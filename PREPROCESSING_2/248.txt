cachalot confirmed that he was a cartage how much violence is against people in the camp is not clear the nurse tell em parry is heard by people being kidnap from the camp but that is hard to confirm and he told me this story when i first head up in the camp a woman came up to me and ask me if we would be bringing in condemns i because when she got sexually assaulted again she wanted to be able to ask her attacker to where condemns if she would not get pregnant in a relief work how's be depots of places where my grinds refuges a stranding this but the security is she is here black of predictable food and water sanitation five toilets where they should be a hundred twenty my no proper hands for people when i first saw it i was literally jest due founded because this seen refugees situations this have been to banquet si'vesteen cock aware have been to a rock have seen t mighty p camps have seen the refuge he camps from serial i sate is this horse i would definitely stay that this his or if that a bar in in them for a lock a humanitarian accountability for what is happening to these people you mean that that nobody's keeping account of whose here an who is in who goes in an who goes out who goes in who goes out who goes nothing the proper i u g camp she says the initiations camp they would have that a big to fence some keeping track of who comes in and out when we asked medical officials about conditions in this camp they said they are not helping the twenty five hundred people here cause hit don't want a permanent ten city in this spot they will not people to move to government shelters an the ate nation said they went step in less the me in government invites and step in unit states whose policies landed people here in the first place is also don't five million dollars to house them in mexico the money is not go to ten camps this one but to the official medical government shelters it is enough money to shelter eat thousand people ut we sent wan more people than that back across the border her fifty seven thousand under the remain in mexico policy pas another twenty one thousand who emigration officials have not even begun to process we have told them the systems backed up should sit on waiting lest stay in mexico all get to your cases in a few months these a mostly people who in the past before president top old hae been lout into the united states he wait for the resile court dates here wit many people but pushing back across the border es outing refuge camps that we do not call refuge e camps where n our country doorstep tho day we try to understand what this new policy means wit people we send across the border we a sayer from yours officials wo send them there were not feeling great about it themselves we u be was chico says medicaid life a class to we us guan good by stranger so say to day with the us officials on the front lines his job in to remain in mexico is to send people back that's of them been resigning saying no this actually not my job as tangos times re port i male tool took to a bench of them before the remain in mexico policy began and up ended the asylum system and completely change what it is to be in asylum officer here is all the job used to work when a central america showed up at the us mexico border and said let me in ism afraid of going back to my country that is where the asylum officer came in the officer did something called a credible fire screening to check if the person was likely to face harm or death if the best sent them back home if there is even a chance that they would the asylum officer would let them into the united states to wait for a quart at were an emigration judge would make the filum call dug stepped says people do not understand how hard the job is at the time all this started he was an asylum officer and see vasisco it is it'd have people come to my office and my job the central is tell me the worst thing that have happen to you have an hour go and that all the side if you telling me the truth and all the side if o us sit you are expected to be were really to do the job well need to be an expert in the political cultural natural and economic situations in he innumerable countries around the world and your expected to be a human mydotector all at once present from took spot asylum itself as if it is fraud he says it is a hoax a big fat convoy that people come in with fake asylum claims that asylum officers just let every one throw and then asylum seekers never show up for their done ort that it is a border wide two thousand mile loophole and it is true then most people do pass that first stop with an asylum officer and enter the united states but there is a good reason for that it is building do you us asylum law a common sense humanitarian idea we do not want to send people back to situations where they would get tortured or killed the legal term as non refluent and you es law set the bar law if there is basically any chance and asylum secret could get killed or harmed the officers was to let them into the us and does not need a lot of proof or evidence at that point later when they get before an emigration judge and by the way the majority do show there they need proof and most of them get rejected even before president true took office less than fifteen per cent per year got asylum that is because most people do not meet the specific criteria in the law or do not have enough evidence or it does not check out all the asylum officers have ever spoken with see it as their job to head out the fakers the people who do not really need protection the one where just thing to gain the system oh my god heres where ism going to be real with you this is an asylum officer we are calling result this is not her voice she is afraid of getting fired we had an act or copy what she said as closely as possible the fraud hap is happening on a sealed that that is huge we are talking hundreds of people month i interviewed three asylum officers for this story and all three said the groups that have been the primary target of president trumps emigration policies they actually are not the main ones committing fraud it is not the central america it is not the middaleastern people it is the india people and the chines people they all have the same bullshit is story about getting beaten with hockey sticks three times because their part of is seek party and the police told them they are going to jail them if they ever badmouth the ruling party ever again bullshit just hap they all just happened to do the same thing and suffer the same fate even though there's absolutely no confirmation in any media that any of this persecution is happening and study's done by our our department of state a counter parts in the country are straight up this is not a real thing the chines are running as similar scam with christian claims in the fall of twenty eighteen asylum officers started hearing about these big changes coming the policy that was first called remain in mexico and then later ligan protection protocols m p p but the asylum officers who were going to have to implement this thing they did not know any of the details of how they were supposed to do it it was all shrouded and much secrecy this is another asylum officer we are calling her and we used an actor here too to protect her identity over the next few weeks and starts picking up around the office that some of her colleagues were been called in quietly and ask to go to the border in sandbag and instead of the credible fear screenings they would always done they seems to be doing something entirely different under m p p a whole new kind of interview with different rules she knew she is going to have to start doing them too she pulled aside a to worker who would already been sent to the border i was asking her ay what is what is the training what is this and she was ism not allowed to talk to about it another asylum of ja is those who you consider a friend ore ja sorter professional colleague good colleague good colleague some one that we had mutual trust for sure and then was told was brought in by a supervisor for a special brief about about it before i was going to start doing these into views and was told here is the skinny on it and do not tell any one why because i think they knew that it was legally dubious and suspect and they wanted to keep the the leak to minium the leak being a major policy roll ut that was can a change asylum eh that is the l that is the leak yet two months go by before they do a formal training session with the full asylum corn and it is just a power point here is our sola again hands were going up and being we how is this legal or how are we going to be doing this and how do we know how this works all three of the asylum officers i talk to said that the presentation left them with lots of questions including the biggest one how was this legal these officers knew better than almost any one how dangerous mexico is and as policy seemed designed to send tuns of people back to mexico it seemed to be in direct contradiction with you as asylum law which says that at the very least we cannot send people back to a situation where they would get harmed or killed we cannot violate the principle of non repayment and the response was ism just the messenger bringing this down from h we and this is the power point they gave us i was well if you do not even care about double checking that this is legal and you are just the messenger as you say you are a facanass had all three officers say they raised s concerns and got roughly the same response just get out there and do your job but they found out soon enough was just how radical a change the new m p p interviews were from the old credible fire screenings for starters not everyone would get an interview only the people who volunteered that they were scared to go back to mexico would if they got an interview under m p p asylum sewers would have to prove that they would be harmed in mexico not their home country an not just any harm they cannot just be threatened by gangs or the police they have to be threatened by gangs or police or whoever be cause of some very specific reasons laid out in you as law because of their nationality race religion politics or being part of a particular social group it'll we b d u and they would have to show that the medical government a cop or an official was unable or unwilling to protect them and the asylum seeker could not just say all this happen they could under credible fire screenings now they need to prove it it is as asylum seekers were travelling through mexico fleeing for their lives they should have been gathering evidence of all the screwed up things happening to them there making a paper trail and they should have had all of this evidence on them right then right after crossing the border which of course is next impossible especially because they had no idea any of this was required drugs wall this happening and wanted nothing to do with it s we tried to keep his head down to try and avoid having to do these interviews hoping the courts would kill m p p but they did not by tune m p p returns hat sky rocketed and it was all hands on deck for the asylum for dug could not dodge it anymore and i do not be now it said you are doing m p p interviews toy i heard u father and son sonithink was pretends eleven twelve the flag om under be cause o violence another problems did not talk about that much cause it does not matter for the purpose of impute an forest only in why they're afraid to go back to mexico of course the guy and his son do not understand why their even talking about mexico they do not understand any of is at all the interview continued she had tried to find a place to live there had tried to we a work permitee mexico and was a sensually denied and as her casings talking about your encountering car tells and witness saying other migrants being murdered tortured in front of i son and fleeing and burled eating away wall that at er being she and ti him out his son having miners for weeks because of is and then be get stop by the place and he please take all their money herselfans and because i cannot get them to save these magic wordsiflak yet befretten me because ism under but that is all they had o t been on that a because ism hunderan those would be the magic words that would put them in a protected category they were targeted because of their nationality though even if the father had said because ism under and they probably still would have been sent back to mexico because odds are he did not have any evidence proving that any of this happened dug he did what the pass he told him to do he sent them back to mexico the old credible fire scrapings usually took an hour or less these empty p interviews can last four five six hours when i ask these asylum officers to describe what these interviews are for them for the agents in front of them resale gave the most fitted picture she told me about the very first end p interview she did a family from all salvador two parents in two kids she had a script she had to stick to the family was exhausted and aromatized and totally unprepared your put into a cell you are separated from your kids and your wife you have no idea what is going on because you thought to day you were going to be interviewed about a salvador and you were going to get to enter the united states couple hours later they lead you into this freezing cold cell where they can your hands to a table in handcuffs and some one is sitting across from you who does not speak your language and starts talking to some one in the phone who starts translating to you that you are going to talk about mexico you smell shit because you have been living in a shelter without any running water for a month and a half buss you have travelled all the way across central america to get there and you do not understand why someone is talking to you about mexico this interview goes on for an hour and a half and the person keeps pausing it they can talk to some one on the computer which they say is their supervisor and nothergard leads your wife an that you have not seen in the last twelve hours into the interview room and you can brush her hand as she passes by your happy to see her because you have been separated you have no idea what is going on where are my children i do not know sir ism sure they will be fine your wife goes through a similar interview om but she keeps being confronted about the answer she is giving because their different from yours and the officer can understand why this story very differently between two people who experienced id half an hour passes before her children are brought into the room and then the officer has to talk to a ten year old boy about whatever his parents said and then confront the he ten year old boy on inconsistencies between his story and his parents story and then the wife is when am i going to see my husband again the officers i have no idea let them know if you need to use the bathroom usual made the case that the family should not get sent back to mexico and to her shock her supervisor agree in fact she happened to walk outside the moment the family got released they have got their back packs on their holding hands she thought maybe this will not be bad but that was the last time the very next interview a woman told her over and over she was afraid of being raped and killed in mexico usual believed she was going back to a place her that was very possible but because the woman could not name a specific person who would assault her usual had to send her back since then it is essentially been know after know after know asylum officers told me that even when they find one of those unicorn cases we they check off all the boxes and recommend not returning to mexico their supervisors overrule them and told me and mi producer nasty rayon about one asylum secrets case were their attacker even spelled out their motive and it still did not fly it was basically a situation where there was a really clear connection to the nationality the persecutor head really said i am harming you because of this nationality your nationality and the harm was really really severe it was my definitely torture and oh it was really clear that the police were not going do a thing about it did not care at all and the supervisor rejected it why lye the say we they said ah we cannot show that if this individual went back to mexico the persecutor would be able to locate them the standard to days upside down from what it used to be incredible fear instead of let us ere on the side of letting people in because we do not want any one to be tortured or die under m p p the standard is almost impossibly high almost nobody gets in the department of only an security says only about nine hundred and sixty people interviewed have not been sent back to mexico ultimately of a little more than forty seven thousand m p p cases registered as of october with about thirty seven thousand of those still pending of those only eleven people have been granted asylum or some other kind of relief according to works university which tracks all this is in government artistic eleven and that is hat the policy was meant to do the administration credits and p p for a sharp drop in the numbers coming to the border mark organ the acting had of customs and border protection calls it a game changer and absolutely successful it only took dug two days and five interviews to go home after work and pull out the law books he is a lawyer he actually own to beat up copy of the emigration an nationality at the law hundreds of pages long that makes up the foundation of view as immigration into he grabbed that off his bedroom shelf along with a few of his other books from losscul he printed out a bunch of court cases and supreme court decisions with more cases pulled up on is con petersgrane in the middle of all of this was his pen and white legal pad as an attorney he wanted to get his feelings about em p p how much worse it felt compared to everything else they did down in writing he worked for hours and he wrote down seven bullet points the main ways he thought m p p was a legal once he saw the list laid out there on the lined white paper dug knew what to do the next day he went to tell his supervisor he was not going to do any more i p p interviews his response we i know these interviews are horror and were all required do them it is for a turn spread it out it is you known recalling basis it is camera at camera and an he not that pint there is this this moment the i could it could have just said you are right and now the sax and gone back and a pas and i told him you would understand ism not doing his entries you wan sly what e you are not doing his enemies as i now shit i can the legal to thankfully moral and ism that dig his boy's was done he did not really seem to know what to say eventually he told him he was probably going to have to write him up somehow to start disciplinary proceedings dug went home that night and decided to escalate he went back to his legal pat i a century rat a legal memo explaining all of the reasons hat if that it was legal and why is refusing to do it and that on that money i he man that to all of the administration and san racist got and at the two supervisors that were involved in the dish proceedings and then nothing nothing happened instead of sparking some kind of rebellion or at least forcing a confrontation it is crickets he took it a step further he sent his member to a sensors office then he dropped tat his good by hemal detached his memo and sent it out office why to all of san fracisco asylum about eighty people and to are representative of the union for asylum officers across the country and with that to shut down his where compierre and walked out he quiet they make one change and everyone of the officers all this is terrible but we will figure it out and they make another change t yous is terrible but but i mean my job ism in a do it even if i don't wanton an all complain about it it complain about the work and it complain about the hours the end of the day i mean a do it and the more i do it the easier it is to do and that his terrified i mean that is how all the awful things in the world it happened that is how you get many good people doing really bad things and that is what is happening and it is terrific you are likely common people back to e raped in cot that is what this is the three officers i spoke with ere not alone a union representing the asylum officers and u cars employs file debrief in a lost against the administration arguing that m p p was a legal and a ton of officers at quitting have heard this from a bunch of people in the asylum corps and that citizenship an emigration services the parent agency several use the word access and if officers cannot quit they are calling in sick anything they can do to avoid an p p interviews we tried to get some numbers from the government they would not tell us how many people had left they did say that by the end of the year they hoped to have seven hundred seventy one asylum officers but as of a month ago they had something five fifty meaning they're roughly two hundred people short i tried to get an interview with the acting head of c i s can cuchinalli to talk about all this he sense been named deputy homelandscurity secretary he did not give us one but i did get one question in it was oat a press breakfast this audio was recorded on my for i the molly or twofer night s is yo haw you redo the concerns from some of tam you are asylum officers they're concerns that many policies ben handed down by the trump initiation paretic early targeting asylum in fact illegal that there be ordered to implement policies that are a direct contradiction with operation lost their pass by comes for waste makes o noodle you yous ore expected to just we agree or all this ah but it you expect that do you yet the professional loves that you teresalstos place there for they are part of the executive branch he said and long as we rein the position of putting in place but we believe to be legal policies that have not been found to be otherwise we have fully expect them to implement those faithfully and sincerely and vigorously now we are to shy an p piece first birthday after chaotic start it is thousands returned each week it is expanded all the way east a crosse u border from californium to teases gulf coast and it is not just central america being pushed back now it is humans then asylums pregnant woman it'll d b d cue asylum at least at the southern border has essentially ground to a halt here is anna it'll say this the administrations been successful what do you mean they want negative decisions they do not want asylum seekers in this country they do not want people to get positive decisions or determinations for asylum they have felt that the standards for screening interviews we too low and they wanted those standards changed and those standards raised end they have succeeded what do you think the administrations end goal is no more people from chitholl countries anna throws up in shower almost every day she has recurring nightmares she says she cannot focus cannot sleep she thinks about the people she is returned to mexico all the time it is nearly a hundred but there is one family in particular that she cannot stop thinking about a father and son why do you think that case sticks with you kit was really young what happened to that is gut get hidden aunt he get murdered happening happening a lot what was content what is my moral culpability in that i interviewed that case and my signatures on that paper work and that is something now that i live with ye i feel i feel in someway that this administrations made me humanrates opener the irony of the policies that under our asylum law to qualify for asylum you have to have been harmed because your part of a particular group a certain class of people and the way that the asylum officers have implemented m p p they have created exactly that a huge group of people in need of protection about sixty thousand migrant forced by the was back to mexico to be preyed upon there as they wait on their request for safety in the less it is exactly the sort of situation that our law was supposed to prevent one asylum officer told me it is the first time that we have been asked to affirmatively do harm to people you are not just saying i do not think you are eligible your literally saying i believe what you are saying i think you are in danger go back to that danger also to covers in migration for the lost ageless times shore a print version of this story also is that their website coming out what sound when the cartels get on the phone and bargain with your family for your life we have recordings that is in a minute n cacao bob radio wen our program continues this america life for m my r glass to day an a program the out crowd t stories about the people the tens of thousands of them who a been pushed into mexico that the president's re main in mexico policy another policies but i sing about what happens to those people as they wait in mexico for months and before we get to the next act there is another thing that the trump administration is put in place that makes it a lot harder to get asylum here something we haven't talked bat yet a new rule that went into effect this summer it says if you want asylum in the united states you first have to apply for asylum in at least one of the countries that you passed through on your way here and if to get rejected by that country before we will give you asylum here in the united states many asylum secret of course have no idea that they required do this when was in madamara at that ten camp is came out wit that woman jenny from honduras going to got worried about the cartage listening in our interview long to been kidnapped she ware saying that er cordate in the united states to get asylum was coming up on nonmember twenty six and she are waiting since made august shot she had a good case ms hop o

in the camp all twenty five hundred of who waiting from wants for the court dates hoping for asylum its easy to imagine that this one rule would kill all their applications jenny's attitude was i soon across my fingers hope for the best cause i one go back home in seem to dangerous this and you dangerous in mexico too lots of people feel that way and the danger i mexico is is subject to back too which we hae arrived at now at too take the long way home if yo had to pick which border city in mexico is the most dangerous the wavellaredo right across the border from foredo texts would be a good contender the state department classifies it is a level four threat that is the same threat level as a rack and servo am lot of danger there is kidnapping can to being is prevalent there that one of our producers met men in a migrant shelter wo were terrified to go outside i young cupid i told her just putting one foot outside the shelter makes om worried et trip pi just two minutes his looking

yours emigration take shoelaces from any one they detain most of them were men many of them with her heads down and on pare stands out to me a father and son in marching polo shirts both of them sweating in the heat their clavi soft faces at has his arm around son they seemed the talk to me the man ill call him divide quickly tells me a story o o e the e the ta the o e the the a a lave ta the the a a boy a bebop he says he is not a criminal he is a person who is always made a living tut he cannot live in his country any more they are from hundred avid was a business man he ran a little clothing store the gangs there demand money they call it a war tax the tax a putting higher and higher and told divide's family could not pay it any more one night the cartel broke into his house threatened to rap his daughter and they fa give done lots of interview with people divide my grinds and really difficult situations this one felt especially hard i think just seeing a father fall a part in front of his eleven year old son in we the me we we e the e e e e e bet e in the on ls he tat pee yo on the word davit says he wanted to ask for a asylum in the us but the agents did not listen to him they just gave him documents to come back to a court date and remember he cannot go back to hundred he says o ten e ten e e the e o the of to the oo the the the a e the o the o a e e e the e e e the a the e the the the i don't have anywhere to go i do not have anything i do not have money he says they say that here we were being sent a lot of people get ki nap and i do not know what to do we only talked for ten minutes i painted up lending him my phone he called his sister new jersey and explained what happened then he made it to the united states only to be sent back to mexico it was getting dark out and it'd been told not to stay and was e letter past dusk i crossed back into the us to go to dinner probably not a mile away from where i last seen divide and my phone rang it was davits sister it'll call her laud she had my number because it was my phone he called her from earlier to day she was crying hard i struggle to understand what she was saying she tells me have in i son of bin kidnap just hours after i left them she would got in a call from a cartel demanding ransom o a e e e e laud says that the cartel told her the ransom was nine thousand dollars for have and another nine thousand for has son eighteen thousand total they put have on the phone briefly she knew he was alive and then the kidnappers gat on e e o o do my and i told them where in the wad are we gin to get this money the man on the other and told her she had to get the money he said he would call back to morrow i asked laud to record the phone calls war en and she did when they called the next day she put them on speaker and used her relative's phone to shoot bid of it the can looking on o we bin o e noon tin dentin ane the ton the ta monk canon the they tell her i need you to deposit the money as soonest passible be a septa the ahutha means old lady laud is thirty eight she tells the again the she has no money that she is sick from anxiety in her conversations with me laud is scared crying but when she talks to the kidnappers she holds it together she asked if saved in a son a okay they canceler tell her they have food that they can bathe for now each call and the last a few minutes o a o are goby the third day the cartel has lowered the price to five thousand dollars each for saved in his son laud works the nightshirt at a printing factory and new jersey hardly makes twenty thousand dollars in a year plus she is a single mam and all o these calls the canneppers talk superbest ism guessing because they have other ransom calls to make cannepping's a big business a volume business with a whole in for structure catnapping migrant has been common an mexico for a long time what's different now is that the guess is making it as specially easy for the cartels to i identify in snatched victims there sending asylum secret back in big groups all at once same time each day and they're easy to identify with their plastic bags and missing shoelaces homeland security did not respond to my request for comment on the kidnapping situation but this week the asking head of customs an border protection the guess is quote sending a message to the criminal organizations to stop exploiting these migrants in nuevoladee the most dangerous part of these asylum sewers journey is probably that hours rite after they been sent back to mexico after walking across the bridge their transported to the medical emigration office by van outside the office men in fordo trucks monitor whose coming in going locals call them lot males the badguises one migrant told me about getting chase as he walked to a shelter from there but by far the most dangerous place as a best station it is a place they go to escape novel level but it is a place and of getting call catnapping is routine the cartels refer to it as passing through the office on the extortion call yo can tell its a well oiled machine it is methodical they sound the negotiating the price of a car they do this all the time rs loud turns to everyone she can think of she goes to her local police department an tor her mayor's office to ask for help they reach out to the office of enter cry booked but by the time tho get back to her about a week later it is too late laud eventually scrapes together money from her madman sister but just a fraction of what the cartel is asking for e catch ti yo tin mi oi anti she tells them look have already pulled together twelve hundred dollars tell me what were going to do and give me time to get the rest the man says he's con fer with his base in the meantime he says she should wire the money lady asked to talk to her brother and they put him on too l none she asked any how are you brother worried he says she tells them do not worry that she is pulled together some money the next day the cartels released saved in his son i talk to avid on the phone three days after his release he is distressed it is hard for him to finish the sentence respite tesla reside greed i tell him i wanted to help him that is not something a reporter spoke to say but back when the final their lives were an immediate danger and i helped in small ways i connected laud with an into in mexico city that advocates for migrants since avid in hi son were released have suggested safe bassoptions the family they always knew that i was a reporter during a story on them but they came to see me as one of the few people they could trust that they could rely on lady called me almost every day with at dates she still us a few weeks ago i went to meet davits in his family in monopode in northern mexico when there hold up they were staying with an acquaintance of laud's an exchange for grocery money and hoped with construction have did not want us to interviewing him there he feels is welcome has run out we do the interview at our hotel it divide his eleven year old son and his ninetenural daughter he is also been sent back to mexico under my p yet as is potitatic ism here with my producer line we figure well talked to divide in one room while the kids watched the we in the other i but the kid sit by their dad on the bed they will not leave one another side i wanted to know what happened when i left him that day on the bridge and what he described were all these details of how the cartels kidnapping businthis actually works won sure victim on theanside details that were routine and also terrifying here is what happen he said he and the other hundred people who were sent back to mexico that day were taking from the bridge to the local emigration office for processing after that he says he man wearing a medical emigration officer uniform agreed to take him in a see to the best station they can go to a safer city but as soon as they got to the station he got a bad feeling when tent the me it o me me wen i wanting i my son this god grad me was a told on strong follow fetus he grot me when he said i want a thought to you wand i said id have nothing work to your about and he said you on not going to the car means is come questions and is id do not and he since you can in to the car the who were r e hard wore we ma let them want them he says at least a dozen migrants also arrived at the best station that night and the cartel hustled them into different trucks all the trucks were bran knew he says he remembers that the one he got into was a gran ne son and there were four or five other migrants in there with him he says the emigration officer who drove him to the best station sat in his car and watched them all being carted off we cannot confirm this but there is a long history of long force went in the cartels working hand in hand for example an two thousand eleven seven topfofficials that lexicons emigration agency were fired amid allegations hat the agency was involved in the kidnapping of migrants and it squares with what his sister in new jersey told me she wired money to that emigration officer for divide's best ticket and when she got the ransom call they cannapfers told her to wire the money to that same account the wont the emigration officer used she said something is not that the emigration officers account and they hung up i asked the medical emigration agency to respond they told me they have no knowledge of recent complaints of emigration officers turning migrate over to the cartels we r and the try divide held on to a son the cannapers did not see only ley o go we omolakavithe i just told us to keep er hence then ha stop king at the sides and the gat who was driving us wast keeping ani on us and he was making sure we were not shining they had the window told at a also they talked over round for a while but divide suspects they were just going in circles that they did not actually travel very far they pulled up to a normal looking house with the big gate inside the cannot presume our self ones to take pictures of avid his son in the rest they interrogated divide about where hes from his line of work how he got to the best and most importantly what family members he has there it was patient intake at a house chance except for by cartel we talked about the cartellsas organic crime but i never imagine the book keeping they keep records an photos of the migrants i kidnap and also who they release have says there were more than twenty migrant at the house the men an women send in separate rooms during the day the cannappers hit any the men who tried to look at the women the room avid in his son sultan had one mattress every one else leapt on the floor at night avid would lay on the ground holding his son logaasiis comagosagon in your and gone salt a salt a would lay don we him in a corner an at would had my son the you nor hey could not see you trying but my ten were almost folding out i in on bani they we what hard we the most telly lose that when the to arrive the boy he would always tell me that my sons organs were good for selling that he was in a good age that he was only even years old they dit heed on o we go bate and my son once heard the guide the saying that he kidney that he pagans were good for selling and he was almost crying and i told him ton crime but i was this be i did at halcyon as divide tells me the story his two kids are sitting on the bed beside him neither of them is looking at anything in particular there just sitting there blankly divide also seems devoid of emotion he does not at all resemble that divide from a few weeks ago the whole i talked to right a er his release now his affect is completely flat s on the fourth day of his kidnapping when the bosses woke davit up and told him they would reached ta deal with his sister they may be how and he said to me get up with your son faddy this to they an gone release you guys because house he the already pad made a thepulsin solo socomocael the man told divide if he talked to anyone police reporters the cartel would come for him take his son and killed aside the same man who kid nap them in the first place drove them back to the bust station and bought them each ticket cavie does not know what happened to the dozens of other people on the house most migrant were a kidnapped in released the cartel gives them a key word it is a postcode that indicates the migrant has paid off the cartel they are not kidnapped again the avid doesn't given one maybe because he has not paid a high in a ransom when we met avidin montage he did not know what he was going to do one one of the kidnapping the cartel had taken divide in his sons emigration paper work and they did not give it back without that paper work he does not even know which day he suppose just show up in court but even if he could figure it out he told us he is too scared to return to noway lovely under i p p he would have to assure the same port of entry to get to his hearing what if we get kidnapped again he asked last week i get a ponecov from divide the family they been staying within wintery wants them gone and he is lost hope in the asylum process he thinks they will not be listened to that the hearing processes alive and in fact he is it about how es cases likely to come out under this ad ministration it is virtually impossible to gain asylum based on going violence deeds deco to take his family back to under es the country they try escaping in the first place according to home man we purity his own statistics thousands of other families ire making the same choice family green cover reported on to need for me tot come wont is thing before we into day's program when

welcome to the superman latponcas o science science pay to from i m indrhuberman and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing hair hair is a topic that occupies the minds of many people there are people thothat are losing their hair and want to halt or reverse that loss of hair and to day we will talk about all the ways that science has taught us we can slow or even reverse hair loss i confess that researching to day's topic was a particular joy for me not because i am obsessed with hair mine or the hair of others but because hair turns out to be fascinating from the perspective of cellar biology and stemcells which is a topic that have long been interested in and that for much of my career i focussed on in the context of development when your brain and your nervous system develop it develops from a small batch of cells that turns into many many trillions of cells and it does that by sell replication something that we call the cell cycle and will talk a li fit about this and called my insists to day i promise not to get into too much detail but what makes hair very interesting from a biological standpoint is that every hair every single individual strand of hair has its own little stemcell niche meaning its own little pocket down there in the local in which specific stemcells give rise to those hairs for different durations of time depending on the hair where it is on your body et camera fir instance the hairs on your head will undergo on going growth for four to six or even eight years were you to not cut your hair it would continue to grow one single hair would continue to grow i guess we could say all the hairs will continue to grow for up to eight years that is very different from for instance your eyebrows which have a much shorter period of hair growth last no on the order of months that is why you do not see people with eyebrows that extend down to their waist but you can see people with hair on their head that extends down to their waist if they do not cut it now that discrepancy illustrates for us just how incredible hair folicals and the themselves that reside with chairs are and their enormous potential to give rise to these thingsthat we call hairs which are simply propenes of varying length to day we are going to address what determines the length of a hair or rather what determines how long a hair continues to grow before it ceases growing and eventually falls out we're going to talk about what regulates those themselves what allows them to continue to produce hair or cease producing hair and as we do that you will learn all the biology in clear simple terms regardless of your background that will really set the stage for understanding what will also talk about which is how to slow hair loss or halt hair loss entirely or even reverse hair loss we will talk about hormone related hair loss in both men and women we will talk about some of the mechanical and stress related influences on hair loss and we will talk about the chemical and mechanical approaches to halting and reversing hair loss everything from minoxidil to do astride to qitoconisal to micro needling to fibroid estrogen get one pathways again all made very clear regardless of whether not you have a bacon in biology or not i will also dispel some of the common myths about balding and hair replacement if you have heard for instance that you inherit your patterns of balding from your mother's father that is not true although it is true that you do inherit certain genes that influence whether not you have a predisposition to balding in particular parts of your head and believe are not even particular parts of your body but it is not the case that you can simply find a photo of your mother's father say is age fifty o r age sixty or seventy five and determine whether not you will have the exact same pattern of hairless that is a myththad it'd to dispel right here and now and i will dispel some the other myths about hair loss hair replacement and hair regrowth as well before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performances element contains a science back telectorolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one graham of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elements doctor slash supermen oke let us talk about hair and in researching this episode by talking to experts in the biology of hair and the stencils that exist in all of us that give rise to our hair growth and the pigmentation in our hair and in talking to experts who understand how to halt and even reverse hair loss that there is a tremendously interesting biology her owning hair but there is also an incredible psychology around hair in fact most people who experience even marginal hair lost undergo pretty severe anxiety now i confess this is not something i can relate to i am losing my hair in certain places ism forty seven years old have got couple patches up front where there is very minable hair i think that as we will at or learn in this episode reflects a higher density of d h t dihydrotistosteron am receptor's at that particular location almost elsewhere in my scalp but keeping my hair is not something that have fretted about much of my life and yet as i was researching this episode i remembered an anecdote for my childhood where my father told me and i think it was because i was stressing about something and i was trying to get to sleep and he said do not stress calm down and hearts why if you stress too much it can actually make your hair fall out in fact i have a cousin who lay down one night stressed and woke up the next morning and all of his hair was on his pillow and i it'll never forget that story i think he was trying to get me to stress less i do not know f that story made me stress less or not ah but in any event i do not know that that story's true ism not in a challenge the authenticity of that story i did not have a chance to reach out to my my father and ask him to verify or not but as we will soon learn it is true that our psychological well being can impact both the coloration or lack thereof and the growth rates of our hair that is a real thing and the reverse is also true which is that as hair starts to thin or fall out or change color many people experience intense anxiety or even depression this was not something i was really aware of perhaps that is just because have always kept my hair pretty short anyway i was assume that my hair start to really fall out to shape my head but that is me and that is not most people out there i think most people would loth to lose their hair and in fact given the enormous number probably up in the high billions of dollars and euros and other currency of course that people in vest in trying to halt or reverse their hair loss it is clear that hair is very very important to people what we know is that by age fifty approximately fifty per cent of all men and women will have experience significant enough hair loss that they start to notice it and a large percentage up to eighty five per cent of those people will experience some sort of anxiety that leads them to go out and try in either halt or reverse that hair loss now what age fifty well an important point arises from that which is that the hair loss is not occurring between the forty ninth and fiftieth birthday hair loss is on going from about age thirty to age fifty it is only by age fifty however that about fifty per cent of people out there start to notice that his loss and this is typically because they willow they will be in a a bath room or looking in a mirror and on the lighting will be bright enough that it permeates the the the s prouder boundary of their his another will notice that their hair is thinning in a particular location it's usually haw the sort of thing happens again our psychological states can impact our patterns of hair growth or loss and of course patterns of hair growth but more typically hair loss and hair graying can really impact psychological state this is a subject that people take intense interest in and to day were going to talk about how hair normally grows why it grows at the rate and for the duration that it happens to and then as we talk about ways to intervene with that hair loss those biological mechanisms will come up because they really provide a nice framework for explaining why certain treatments work more or less well or why certain treatments might have certain side effects or total lack of side effects it will also halite a really key theme that will come up several times into day's podcast which is that there are both mechanical and chemo can approaches to slowing and reversing hair loss mechanical approaches would be things as simple as managing the scalp but mechanical changes to the scalp can cause either hair loss or facilitate hair growth this is why things micro needling are prominent in the contacts of trying to reverse hair loss but again there are also chemical approaches to trying to halt o reverse hairless and this relates to the fact that the hair growth it slap is strongly regulated by hormones such as estrogen thyroid hormone insolent growth factor and that other hormones in particular the androgen things testosterone but mainly its derivatives dihydrotestosterone are very much involved in setting the stage for hair growth by controlling how big or small that pool of stemsells that gives rise to hair growth is if any of the terms i just use are confusing to you do not worry i will make all those very clear in a moment it is actually all pretty straightforward and simple and it'd to just start by talking about what hair is how it grows why it stops growing and why hair normally falls out let us talk about the biology of hair and in doing i also want to talk about stemsells a keep in mind that when you hear the word stemsells you we most people think about the sorts of cells that people are getting injected into their face to get rid of wrinkles or give them new skin or to give them more hair if it is inject in the scalp or into a joint to repair a joint or muscle those stemsells are what we call examens stemsells exogenists meaning from outside the body the stemsells are we gingko talk about to day are called endogenous stemsells sells that we all make that can give rise to other sells and that is really the definition of a stemsell stemsells are present in all of us from the very beginning of life when sperm meats egg that sell which we think of as the egg starts to duplicate it incorporates the done from the sperm and the beg of course says a duplicate and then those cells give rise tod more cells and more cells and the ability of all those cells to replicate and crate more cells are because those sells really are stemcells now at some point we are a completed body plan as the biologist say we end up with a brain and a spinal cord and limbs and fingers and livers and guts and all the things that we need in order to be of functioning human being even though we are a baby at that time we having grown up we have all the bits that we are going to have for our entire life at that point many of the stemcell populations disappear for instance past puberty and probably earlier you do not get many more new braincells you get a few but you do not get many more new brainclls because the brain does not have many stemcell populations whereas other organs in your body maintain little pockets of stemcells or in some cases many many stemcells that can give rise to more and more of that tissue across the life spin and hair is one such tissue if we take a look at hair what we find is that indeed there are the things we call hairs but there are also stemcells and those stemcells are actually what give rise to the hairs that we see on the head of our scalp or that we see on the surface of our body right off the bat you should know that every single hair that you have is the because you have a stemcell population that is giving rise to that particular hair let us take a step back or rather i should say let us cumin on one hair and the stemsell population that gives rise to that hair because in doing you are going to learn all the different components that you can tap into if your goal is to halt the loss of hairs or to replace hairs that have already been lost as if we were to just mind at the level of one hair what you would find is that that hair has what typically is called a hair root that is the portion below the skin and when we say below the skin it means that it dives down into a narrow trench which is in this sill all epidermis which is this outer layer of skin it also has a shaft the shaft is the part that grows out above the skin what you see on somebody is head or you see on the on their arm or when you see an eyebrow you are seeing the shaft of the hair the root of course goes below the skin what most people do not realize however is that down at the base of the root there is ashy a little cave a little pocket if you are to look at this it would look a little bowl the little round area with a bunch of stuff in it right below the root and within that little cave there are stemcells there are populations of cells that have the ability to divide we call this mitosis it is a process by which cells can actually divide and take dine with them and then give rise to other cells we call those cells that that divide and move out we call those dotter cells we call the cells that give rise them progenitor cells it they are effectively stemcells that give rise to these what we call dotter cells those dotter cells then become the various types of cells that make up the hair when you see a hair you are not seeing something that grows throughout the life spin you are seeing something that is going to be born down there in that little cave then is going to grow it is actually going to stack up on top of it cell that is because hairs are made up of a proline called carton the bunch of different kinds of caritas depending on what kind of hair you are looking at but these are little preachings that stack up on top of one another and there structured in a way that makes them pretty darn durable i mean it it is possible of course to pull a hair out but if you ever tried to tar a hair in particular u thick hair one from the face or even a one off the a top your head it is actually a a pretty pencils strong little thing and that is because curtains stack up on top of one another and bind to one another with a really strong bond what you end up with is a bunch approaching stack up on top of one another and that is the actual hair c we we got the hair shaft the hair root and then we have got the stemcells down there in that pocket that give rise to the very cells that make up the actual hair we also have down there in that little cave which by the way is i shall called the hair bulb if you really want another technical name cause it shaped a bulb we have not just stem cells but we have cells that give rise to the pigment of the hair that create what is called linen now some people have very blond hair very light hair some people have darker hair but everybody unless they have what is called the albinomutation where the hairs are truly white they lack all linen and this pretty rare condition although it does happen most people have some degree of linen in their hairs because there little pockets of linen producing cells linens just a proline that century gets injected into the cartoon into the hair and gives it its darker color now there are couple other components about the hair that you need to know about especially if you are interested in reversing hair loss or reversing graying of hair one of those components is a little gland next to every hair root within the dermal layer of the skin this is below the epidermis there is a gland called the sebaceous gland and the salacious glad makes oily stuff in the oily stuff is called sebum an under the name for of evokes something kind of gross but sebum is actually really cool and really important the sebum gets injected or seeps rather into the area right around the hair as the hair starts to approach the surface where it goes from essential root to shaft and the sebum does two things first of all it forms a little bit of a seal right at the place where the hair exits the skin and that seal is very important actually for water proofing of your skin we do not often think of ourselves as water proof because we are accustomed to water just landing on our skin and and rolling off but that is because of some of the oily properties of our skin now it is also true that our skin is pretty densely packed with cells but in the absence of sebum we would not be as water proof as we are now as i mention sebum has two important properties the other important property of sebum is that it actually is a strong anti bacterial and anti microbial most people do not realize is the oils of your skin provide a lot of immune boundary that things do not get into the hair root or the region around it and infect our skin sebum while the name is sort of a unattractive to be honest is actually performing some essential rolls both for water proofing and for anemone system function protecting us from various kinds of infection we are going to return to sebum later as it turns out sebum is also very important as it relates to siriasis and as it relates to some of the jungle components that can cause hair loss can i just confide that away there is another important component of the region around hairs which is the erector silly muscle the erector silly muscles is a muscle that lies diagonally between that bulb portion of the hair or a little bit above it ad goes up to the surface of the skin the erector silly muscle as a muscle that contracts when we get cold or when we get scared if you have ever had goose bumps that is because the erector silly muscle contracts pulling the skin at the surface down around the little hair follicles or at least where the hairs meat the the surface of the skin and those little bumps are actually where little micro hairs resided and the dimples between them or the dimples that occur when this erector silly muscle pulls down now why would this muscle exist and t has a couple of important functions one of the functions is that when it pulls down it causes as the name suggests the hairs to stand up maybe not perfectly vertical but that when you hereon i was frighten my hairs stood up on end that is because the hairs become erect they stand up now why would this happen when we get cold it happens because when the hairs stand up air can be trapped between those hairs and can actually warm our body this is not much the case if you have very light hair on your skin if you are a very hairy person this is going to be a more robust aspect of your physiology and yes this is why dogs huskies can go out in the snow and still remain warm when they get cold their hairs actually stand up a bit on end because the contraction of these erector rely muscles trapping air in there and the their body warms the hair trap beneath the hair and its ore that they have got a blanket on made by the interface between the hair the air and their skin just to recap all the components of hair and the different things around it that are going t be relevant for understanding how to replace hair that is lost we have the her itself which has the shaft that sticks out over the skin goes alibi into the skin but they see sticks out over the skin we have the root portion which goes down into the skin goes through the epidermis and into the dermasten we have this bulb region down at the bottom down at the bottom of that bulb we have stemcells that actually give rise to the actual hair and we have augmenting cells that pigment that hair in addition and this is very important there are capillaries that go into that bulb region down at the bottom of the hair and that can serve and support the stemcells the melanin producing cells which are called malady sites the melanin producing cells in the stemcells get a lot of blood flow that allows them to keep providing new hair or the prolines that make up hair and the pigment that goes into those hairs and those lite capillaries deliver not just neutrino and things of that sort but they also deliver oxygen these it turns out that the whole process of growing more hair is a very active process now as soon as you hear oxygen and you hear that the growth is an active process that should cue you to why many of the stories around how to keep your hair and regrow hair involve stake meets do not wear hat it will make your hair fall out or if you want your hair to grow back and do not wear hats or massage scalp or increase blood flow or why some people will a suggest that people take peppermentoil for instance or mental type oils of different kinds and massage them into the scalp things that make the scalp tingle or there will be light therapies design to what to increase blood flow to the scalp the whole rational the is that your trying to increase blood flow to the stemcell and the malanicite populations that support the hairs and that actually create the hairs now whether aren't those approaches work will touch on a little bit later it'll just give you a little bit of a hint right now which is that while no single one of those approaches that i described is known to regrow hair in a very robust way because of the requirement for oxygen and nutrients and because it is such an active process for the stemsells and milanicites to grow and darken the hairs they grow out of your skin it is true that manipulations or treatments that increase blood flow to those regions can at least slow the loss of hair or can even extend the duration over which hairs continue to grow if you have heard things do not wear hat if you want to maintain your hair or massageour scalp if you want your hair to grow faster in some sense that is true but none of those manipulations on their own is going to robustly enhance the rate of your hair growth those things are design to be done in conjunction with some other treatments that have been shown in many many clinical studies to increase the rate and duration of hair growth now you have in mind a picture of what is happening at the level of individual hairs and you are anything me your nobly thing while there is a lot going on down there just pen et low the surface of the skin and indeed there is but really the things to think about or that stemsell population that actually give rise to the hair prolines that should create the hair the malanicites that darken that hair that give it pig went that salacious gland and the oil sebum that provides some important antimicrobial and other properties to that general region and that erector pily muscle that erect or silly muscle the mentioned earlier is important for creating goose bumps and it is important for keeping huskies warm in cold environments but it is doing some other really important things as well an will talk about those as time goes on this episode right now what i want to do is just talk for a moment about how hairs actually grow and why they grow the way they do this is extremely important toward understanding hair replacement and slowing hair loss there three basic phases of growth of a hair the first phase is the phase in which the stem cells down in that bulb give rise to the cells that make up the prolines of the hair the actual growth of the hair and keep in mind that the hair is actually growing from the bottom up now you might think of course it is going from the bottom of everyone knows that but a lot of people think that the hair starts growing right at the surface of the skin that is not the way it works the hair is actually growing from deep within the root and stacking up and then eventually extends out across the top of the skin that growth phase is called the again phase a an a g e n and this for some people will ring a bell because if you have ever been interested in weight lifting or even if you are an endurance runner you will hereabout things that are anabolic that promote growth ana of growth or catabolic that promote breakdown the first phase of hair growth is called the again phase and it is a period of varying duration depending on which hair in the body were talking about the again or the growth phase for hairs on the head as i mentioned earlier is anywhere from two to eight years for most people it is going to be about six years what this means is that if we were o just not cut our hair just let our hair grow for to to eight years that hair would eventually grow to a length that it was at its maximum and then would stop growing we can say that the again phase of hairs on the scalp is two to eight years the duration of the growth face contrasts that for instance with the duration of the managed phase for hairs of the eyebrows the hairs of the eyebrows grow about four point two millimeters per month believeuare not people have measured the sort of thing now that is an average some people are going to have eyebrows that am grow much longer per month it's somebody who for instance has a mostly the same length eyebrow hairs what every one som it'll get one those eyebrow hairs really seems to be heading off my head at really wants out of there and it is much longer than the rest what does that mean does it mean that it grew faster maybe but chances are the steel population in that particular eyebrow logical for that one eyebrow hair is longer than it is for the others this is really important ism trying illustrate two principles at once here the first principle is that different hairs on your body including the airs on your scalp have a growth face of different duration this is why the hairs on your head can grow very very long cause they have a very long managed or growth phase and the hairs on your eyebrows will only grow for a few months before they actually fall out and then have to undergo replication of the themselves to give you new eyebrow hair to then grow what is important here is not just that there difference is in the duration of the growth phase but rather that the rate of hair growth is not something that tends to differ within a given body region right you will hear people say on my hair grows really really fast other people will say oh my hair grows really really slowly that is probably not the case while there could be slight in races in the rate of growth that is the addition of more carton to the actual hairs creation of more hair more quickly almost certainly what is happening is that the duration of the managed phase in some people is just much longer than it is in other people and we do not realize this and we tend to think more in terms of how fast hair grows because if you were to just look at somebody is hair you would say oh they are all more or less the same length i mean some people's bangs are shorter than the back because they cut them but if they were just grow their air you would say oh it is all more less the same length but if we were to cumin with a microscope we would see that there a lot of hairs down there in between the other hairs that are very very short or even tiny tiny tiny and those are coming in as the other ones are finishing their managed phase of that is the managed or growth phase after the eaten phase comes the mutagen phase again this resembles the word catabolic or the breakdown phase during the mutagen phase the hair is actually receding not from the top down to the skin surface and then into the root but the other way it is actually receding from that bulberegion up toward the surface and that mutagen phase is going to also be of different duration depending on which fiery the bodierin and it will vary a little bit depending on who you are meaning from person a person will talk about the influences on the enagenin mutagen phase in a moment whys it important that it actually recedes from the inside out well that is important because as it does that there is actually a change in that bulb region down below because normally there is an interphase there is conversation that is occurring between the steel population the malanacides in the hair itself and they support each other remember there's blood vessels going into that area or rather capillaries that are feeding that area as well after the mutagen phase comes the telling phase which means rest the tligenphase is appeared in which no new hair prolines are being added by those themselves and duro in that halogen phase that bulb down there at the bottom instead of being nice and vain and a really having a lot of space in it with all these different things stemcells starts to pinch off from the from the little tube that comes down from the surface of the skin that normally would have a hair in it it starts the pinch off and at some point many hairfolicles pinch off that bulb region and it recedes and dies and when it recedes and dies the stemsell population in the malanacytes go with it in other words there is no longer a population of stemcells to give rise to more hair after that tillage phase and there is no longer malanacytes to pigment the hair and in fact the hair is not there any more there is no hair even to pigment after that token phase unless it is a hair of a particular type such as the hair on your scalp which can then re enter the cell cycle and get back into an managed phase and regrow more hair from stemcells and there are three critical stages of the life cycle of a hair that are relevant to to day's conversation there is the managed phase during which the hair grows there is the cottage phase during which the hair actually starts to recede and die the proteins actually disappearing from the bottom up and then we have the tillage phase which is the phase in which the steel population is what is called a semi quiescent semi quiet or completely quiescent where it's not active at all those three phases make up the life cycle of a hair keeping in mind that for some hairs they can re enter the life cycle and go back into the managed phase if there is stemsells there and if there is oxygen there and if there is sufficient blood support and and this is a very important and if there are the appropriate hormonal signals to support growth and there is a reduction or in absence in the hormone signals that actually trigger that tilling phase i make this point now because much of the rest of to day's discussion is going to focus on why particular hormones such as hydra testosterone cause hair loss and why inhibiting things hydro testosterone can support the preservation of hair that you have and the regrowth of hair ad to make a long story very short and then we will get into some additional details that are relevant an that i hope you will stick around to listen to dihydrotestostrone which is derivitof of testosterone causes changes in that bomb region where the stemsells reside it shortens or halts the eleven phase of hair growth and it extends and promotes the canteen and halogen phase when we hear that o not diadrotestostrone makes your hair fall out or estrogen makes your hair grow there are real chemical are which is a biochemical legitimate reasons as to why that is but it all comes back to this three phases of hair growth the energy growth phase the canteen catabolic or hair losphase and the halogen phase which is a rest period in which the a hairs can either come back if it re enters the enegenphase or maybe its over for good hormones or the accelerator and the break on each one of those phases it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve me delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i start taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets be the robotics that i need for got health our got is very important at populated by up microbioda that communicate with the brain the maun system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those robotics an athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contain a number of adaptions elements and minerals that make sure that all f my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes right if you to try at lentic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plan et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitamin d three k too again that is athletic green stock calm slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the years supply a vitamin three k to now you have in mind the anatomy of the hair and the area from which it grows and the stemsells et camera fact that there is salary enervation delivering oxygen and blood flow to the stem sells that give rise to the hair and that there are these three critical phases of hair growth managed canteen halogen now let us talk about the accelerators on hair growth and the breaks on hair growth there are many accelerators on hair growth but the first one that i really want to under score is blood flow itself which equates to the delivery of neutreente and oxygen this is vary important and it explains the lot of the treatments for halting and reversing hair loss for instance one of the longest standing treatments for halting and reversing hair loss is called minoxidil minoxidil sometimes also referred to by the grandame regain was actually a drug that was developed to treat hypertension this is a cardiac grog that lowers blood pressure and it does that by causing vast dilation it allows more blood flow noxious to the hairs on your scalp but to hairs everywhere on your body and indeed most people do not realizes but minoxidil will not just slow the loss of hair from your scalp it is also effective at slowing the loss of hair elsewhere in your body how does it do that well you now know one of the major ways it does that it does that by extending the managed phase oh it basically makes that phase a bit longer does it make it much much longer which is why for most people who are losing their hair quickly or who have already lost their hair monoxide alone is not going to be sufficient treatment however minoxidil has been shown to be effective at slowing rates of hair loss and people that are starting to experience som hair loss all get into dosages and things of that sort elicit later but right now i just want of really focus on the logic of why people would take this drug which is lowering my pretension at all as it relates to hair loss right that it seeming con of crazy until you understand the anatomy and the growth of hairs which you now do that is what minoxidil is doing it is creating more blood flow to the hairs which because minoxidil does have this plosive effect least most people would to slow their rates of hairless on their scalp anyway it tells you that blood flow and delivery of oxygen and other nutrients from the blood is pretty critical if not very critical for the support of the hair growth cycle itself now again we have not talked at all about the sorts of chemicals or the signals within the body such as hormones that actually direct the growth of hairs here were just talking about a mechanical change allow more blood flow to the region and thereby extend the managed face which is exactly what happens with minoxidil now minoxidil does have other effects and this is why dosing of minoxidil becomes a little bit complicated and can be elicit tricky to trouble shoot it can greatly lower blood pressure or lower blood pressure just a little bit depending on how sensitive somebody is to that particular drug oftentimes physicians will start people on minoxidil dosages that are very low ideally that would be the case and then racketed up in order to figure out where the minimal effective dose o the kind of critical threshold is beyond which they start experiencing some pretty uncomfortable side effects such as o swelling of the ankle or headaches or dizziness these things cannot happen with the use of organ each minoxidil now minoxidil has also been associate with increases in n the hormone prolactin prolactin is a hormone that is released from the pituitary it is a hormone that acts also is a bit of a narrow transmitter many hormones and it tends to be antagonistic or in opposite to dopamine sedopomine is a petrochemical whit action nuromodulator meaning it modulates the activity of a bunch of neural circuits in the brain it also controls the release of various hormones in the body dopamine is almost always associated with states of motivation pursuit and drive it has a little bit of a and a feel good element to it which is why a lot of people think dopamine as associate with reward and pleasure but it is really about energy motivation and drive dopamine and prolactin are as i mention before antagonistic to one other there sort of a push pull people who take minoxidil special if the very sensitive to tor they take dosages that are too high will experience increases in prolactin that in turn can cause things reductions in libido reductions in overall feelings of well being apathy and in some cases where the elevations in prolactin are more extreme they can experience of for instance increase in man breast tissue gang comitia or even small bits of milk let down things of that sort in women who take minoxidil the side effects are much the ones in experienced in men there can be swelling edema of the tissues an because if you get too much vase of dilation and to too much lowering of blood pressure that is not good headaches dizziness and on sensing o monoxide is really important if somebody is going to usemonoxidil in order to try in slow or reverse hair loss and again it mainly is going to be used to slow rates of hairless not to actually reverse hair loss the really anything is to get that dos a dry the ranges of minoxidil that you will see suggested and that people use out there are vast and i should also mention that there too major routes by which people get minoxidil to the heirpolical one is to take it systemically as a pill where goes into the general circulation the other is to take it topically as a cream there are prescription and nonprescription forms of minoxidil just a further complicate things but the ranges of oral monoxide that you will see out there and that people take range anywhere from zero point to five milligrams all the way up to five milligrams per day that is an enormous range is are a twentyfold range the topical minoxidil is also found in various concentrations the typical concentration is going to be a five per cent concentration that people use once per day topical treatment with minoxidil at five per cent concentration is thought to just stay at the scalp but we now know that it can go systemically can get into the general bloodstream why that is should make complete sense to you because when you put something on your scalp have already told you that he's little pits on these all tubes that go down to those bulb regions a below the skin that have direct access to the blood supply when you mass something into your scalp it not only has the opportunity to get into your general circulation it often does especially if it is something that is very water soluble and that way can get into the capillaries and into the general bloodstream although topical treatments of which we are going to discuss a number of them to day do not tend to get into the general circulation as robuster as taking something by way of pill or capital o case of monoxydal works by way of increasing blood flow to the steel niche below the hair the dosage ranges of the oralmonoxil are tremendous point to five milligrams all the way up to five milligrams once per day the dosage range of the topical solutions tends to be a little bit more confined typicallies of five per cent solution and it is recommended at people use at one time daily may be twice daily it is also important by the way if you're going to take this rout that you actually leave that solution on the scalp for three to five minutes this is important and should make complete sense as to why its important ucancious rub the stuff in your head and then rings it off and expected to be absorbed at actions to seep down into those hairfolicals and axis the niche how do people arrive at the correct dosage for minoxidil well for better for worse really in some cases it is accomplished by finding out that you have an unwanted side effect dizziness or swelling of your ankles or edema or i would hope this wouldn't be the case but something that suggest there's hyper prolactonemia you could get a blood test to measure prolactin or o u perhaps notice a drop in libido or some lethargy on these sorts of things that are common to reduce levels of doom an increase levels of prolactin i would hope that if people are working with a physician or if there not in taking minoxidil that they would start with the lowest possible dose for oral minoxidil that would be point to five milligrams and then increase it as needed rather than jumping in right at five milligrams because some of those side effects in particular the fluid retention and the hyperoprolactonemia can be pretty uncomfortable and can disrupt a lot of aspects of life that most all of us consider desirable o case it were really focusing right now on treatments that relate to the critical requirement for hairstemsells to receive blood flow in order to receive oxygen and nutrients to get the hair to grow and that is really what minoxidil is a ball it is also what all of those anecdotes you hear are all about managing the scalp or putting red light on the scalp although red light might do some other things in general heating or lighting of the scalp or managing of the scalp is really designed to increase blood flow to the scalp the reason minoxidil works at all is because it is going to increase blood flow around the clock and that is because people are taking a topically and its seeping into the general circulation or at least sustains somewhat restricted to the hairs niche or their taking or my and it makes it to that hairball niche a below the logical when we manage or scalp however that is a transient thing you i can message my scary now ism no doubt a increasing blood flow to certain areas m pretty decreasing blood flow to the areas pushing down on but it is all temporary i do not know many people that can massage their scalp enough during the day or long enough during the day rather that it would sufficiently increase blood flow with that said it is clear that increasing blood flow to the scalp by way of reducing high pretension which is effectively accomplished by broadening by expanding the blood vessels an capillaries is it an effective way to at least hold on to the hair that you have is it going to completely halt hair loss if you have a strong genetic by us towards hair loss no is it going to reverse hair loss very unlikely that it will but it can slow hair loss or even maintain the hair that you have if we were to take a step back and ask ourselves what other sorts of drug treatnance are out there besides minoxidil that increase blood flow and that my increase the rates of hair growth or more likely increase maintenance of hair that one already has by increasing blood flow to the niche and nowadays there more and more doctors who are familiar with this requirement for blood flow understand the mechanisms by which monoxyvill works an understand the vast desire out there for people to hold on to the his they have and regrow hair and there proscribing things low dose to dalifill two point five milligram to five milligram to dalifill to dalafille was initially discovered as a drug to treat prostate health it was a drug that we now know can increase blood flow to the prostate and thereby offset some of the issues associated with an aging prostate higher doses of to dalifill sometimes also refer to as the by its brandnime which a seals are used to treat erectile is function but at the dosages that are used to increase blood flow to the prostate and that now a number of doctors are using to increase blood flow not just to the prostrate but to a regions of the body including the scalp such as two point five to five milligrams to dalapill this is something that i think deserves attention because it falls under the umbrella of increasing blood flow to the hair damsel niche in order to maintain hair it is not something that most doctors are gong to be familiar with as the way to reverse hairless because it will not do that but the use of logos to dalasi to slow rates of hairless is very much in a logical mechanistic sense exactly the same as the logic of using minoxidil to slow rates of heiress it is all about increasing blood flow to support the steel niche below the heroical the critical requirement for bloodflow oxygen and mutants to the steel niche is also why you her lot nowadays about the use of p r p platelet rich plasma for trying to offset hairless or even reverse hairless we are going to do an entire episode about p r p it is pretty controversial in certain circle and well accepted in other circles a couple of anythings to understand about p r p first of all it is being used in multiple tissues for different purposes indifferent clinics for instance word certified physicians in the united states canada an rope are doing p r p injections into ovaries to try and expand the number of healthy folicals and eggs that people can conceive later in life or even earlier in life if they do not have any locals people are getting p r p injections into their joints in order to try and support joint health people are getting p r p injections into just about every tissue you can think of however p r p despite what you may have heard is not steels somebody tells you their injecting stemsells there either outside the u s candor northern rope or their injecting something else you want to a really look in to that and of the safety issues they are are the subject totally deserving of an entire episode ism not necessarily opposed to the a future of themselves as a treatment but keep in mind that themselves or selves that can give rise to lots of other sell types and they are sells that divide and replicate and there is a name for that when it happens in the adult body when you do not want that and that is called cancer tumors are over production of sells from stemsells when those stemsells ordinarily should be quiescent c keep in mind the difference between themselves and p r p p r p plateletlich plasma again is legal in the u s in many other places because it involves drawing somebody is blood spinning it down in a particular speed which separates out different components within the blood then taking the platelets and reinfecting those in a solution back into the persons bodies platelet rich plasma or p r p is planet enriched plasma from that person but the basis of p r p is really to encourage nutrient delivery to a particular region in the body using somebody is own platelets because those platelets are enrich for various nutrients people are getting p r p injections into their scalp those are not stemsell injection as are p r p injections into the scalp with some moderate success these are very expensive treatments they tend to be transiently successful ism sure there are people out there who are going to say p r p work fabulously well for me that may be the case ism not going to dispute that and am happy for you although there are not sufficient clinical data to suggest p r p as a treatment right now especially given the cost many thousands of dollars many many treatments it is also the case that the p r injections when they work might work for reasons independent of the platelets when i mean by that well soon we are going to talk about a different type of treatment which is a mechanical manipulation of the hair police to truly on the scalp that typically where people want a regrow hair i do not know many people who are trying to maintain or a accelerate or regrow their back hair for instance they might be out there but i do not think there a lot of em or their leg hair for that matter almost always its going to be scalp pair and one way that people are doing that is through mechanical stimulation of the hairpholical and the steel niche using what is called micro needling micro needling as the name suggests is taking a bunch of little needles either in a little scamp little square or nowadays typically it is a roller looks a a paint roller accept its a cottons of little needles in rows all over that roller those needles range in length from half a millimeter to two point five mill millimeters millimeters and one rolls that over the scalp and if nonthinking ouch that probably hurts indeed they can hurt a little bit or a lot depending on the thickness and the length of those needles mice needling has been shown to do two things it has been shown to reactivate semi quiescent populations of stemsells that are in that teelogen phase putting them back in managed phase and thereby stimulate more hair growth it has also and this is i think the best use of micro needling it has also been shown to be a very effective agent for some of the hormone based hair regrowth tools and pharmacology that we are going to talk about in a few minutes micro needling and pier p have something very critical in common which is the needle the actual injection into the skin and for those of you that are hearing this and thinking why would disrupting the skin with needles actually support hair growth or regrowth would that just damage the physical this gets into some of the a i think interesting if not fascinating aspects of our biology which is that all of the cells in our body really can respond to both chemical and mechanical cues and when we her needle injected in the skin we think a that must just be damaging everything causing all sorts of inflammation but turns out that low levels of inflammation cause by things micro need in or p r pe injections or even the introduction of any kind of fluid my for instance saying fluid injected into a region can cause changes in the cells in that region causing for instance steel populations that were waning to reactivate again causing tillage shades physicals that have malanocites and stemcells that are dying off but not completely gone to re enter the cell cycle micro needling procedures p r p injections things minoxidil they all kin of center round this same general theme of increasing blood flow increasing oxygen delivery of neutrino or in the case of micro needling increasing inflammation just enough at that local site that certain cascades of biological function that relate to proliferation of stemcells or maintenance of stemcell populations are kicked off it reminding the cells in that area that they need to stay alive in order to replenish whatever is lost sometimes a wound can actually induce some dealing although i do want to point out that the micro part of micro needling is absolutely key and this should be obvious to you when you think about scars i non now about you but have never seen a scar with hair growing out of it or if there was it was prathrly one hair but if you have ever seen a scar for it some one had their appendix out or someone had a brain surgery you see that scar because there is no hair growing out of it the micro portion of micro needling is extremely important we are not talking about causing significant damage to a tissue in order to acuate that stemcell population were talk about causing micro damage and micro levels of inflammation to stimulate growth for those of you that are interested in using micro needling or micro needling in commination with chemical treatments minoxidil or some of the other treatments will talk about in a bit fanasteride and akene yes believe r not canine is being used to regrow hair very interesting getting to that moment but if your interested in using micro needling alone or in combination with some of these other treatments there is a wonderful review that was just published this last year wonderful because it is very comprehensive not wonderful not to the fault of the authors because most of the study is out there on micro needling are not superb there are ways of gauging the strength of a study mainly relate to their duration whether not there were control groups et camera but the review itself as excellent the title of the review is micro needling and its use in hairless disorders a systematic review we will provide a link to this in the shownote captions and this review did a very good job of highlighting both the strengths and drawbacks of the serious studies looking at micro needling it also explored the use of micro needling in both men and women and of various ages and it does appear to be the case the micro needling shows some positive benefit in both men and women regardless of age especially when used in combination with the serious other treatment that were talking about i was also able to glean from this review in some of the papers described within it that needle lengths of about one millimeter to two point five millimeters seem to be more effective then shorter needle lengths if you are scared of the needles and the needle lengths keep in mind that done properly micro needling should not be too painful some people experience a bit more pain than others but it is not considered a very painful procedure it is however a procedure that can cause some bleeding of the scalp and that bleeding o the scalp can be very apparent especiayif is in the front of the head i supposed o on the top of the head and hidden by some hair or if you're already i quite bald in a given region a keep that in mind i suppose one could wear that or a whip or something that sort if they were really self conscious about it but the mice needling itself is causing a physical disruption to the scalp some degree of bleeding inflammation and again all of that is part of the process by which micro needling can actually improve hair growth and of course there is healing that occurs of the bleeding and the damage of the physical this is a transient thing but understanding the cosmetic implications in the short term as well as in the long term is certainly worth knowing one thing that is very clears that the combination of micro needling and minoxidil treatment together is far more effective than either of those treatments alone in addition the commination of micro needling and minoxidil has been shown to be effective in recovering what are called dead zones these are regions of the scalp that are either completely ball or mostly ball for which there is essentially no steel population there and the combination of minoxidil plus micro needling is somehow able to recover those steel populations and allow new hair to grow although the growth of that hair in those deadline regions can take a very long time thirty to even fifty weeks neither minoxidil treatment alone nor micro needling alone has been shown to be effective in recovering these called dead zones when those treatments are done separately this i would says a strong reason to consider combining micro needling and minoxidil as supposed to just doing minoxidil or just micro needling i should also mention that minoxidil treatment if you pursue it is likely something that you are going to have to do for the rest of your life if you want to hold on to the hair growth that you obtain with minoxidil or if you want to maintain the hair that you are already maintaining with minoxidil some people have been successful in taking minoxidil maintaining some hair growth or even stimulating some hair growth and then coming off minoxidil but most everyone who goes on monoxide has to stay on monoxide because when they cease taking minoxidil even if they are doing other treatments they lose the hair that they gained with minoxidil that is an important consideration the decision to go on minoxidil is likely a decision to be on monoxide for the rest to your life as you are probably trying to realize there is a relationship between mechanical stimulation of the physical and bloodflow both of which turn out to be critical for maintaining hair and for stimulating hair growth not surprising ugly then an increasingly common treatment for hairless is both books is the brand name for what is otherwise known as bochelinum serotonin what is bochelinum serotonin well bochelinum serotonins sometimes just called bochelinum for short is a toxin that is a bacterial toxin that serves to cut the proline that leads to synaptic vesical release what in the world did i just say well when your nerve cells communicate with one another they do that by way of electricity but the electricity within those nerve cells those neurons triggers the release of chemicals from neurons into the scynapsll gap between neurons and the release of those chemicals allows the next neon to be chemically active or in some cases it will suppress the electric selectivity of that next neuron bochelinum nerotocxin serves to cut a proline present in neurons that neurons cannot release the chemicals that cause other neurons to be active this actually is pretty serious if you were to get bochelinum nerotoxan injected into your muscle you would be paralyze because the nerves that control contraction of the muscles would not be able to control the release of that chemical on to the muscle which makes it contract bochelinum serotonin is commonly used in what is called both books is something most people are familiar with because people get it injected in and around their wrinkles because many wrinkles are triggered by not just loss of tensile strength in the skin but rather the nerves around the skin and in the skin a hyper contracted which causes wrinkles ferine i have cross feet i to think that is because have laughed a lot and smile u lot and it is nobly also because give squinted a lot in my lifetime i have cross feet because the nerves there have pinch the skin on either side of my eyes and that is given me little creases there that are sometimes referred to as cross feet books injections can be applied to the so alp in order to relieve tension of the scalp and in hearing that it should be obvious wybotok as being used to try in offset hairless it is decreasing the squinting if you will or the tensile nature of the scalp skin that more blood flow can arrive at that stemselpholical area books treatment to the scalp is actually becoming pretty common there are couple requirements with this books treatment first of all has to be done by somebody whose really skilled there are numerous images on line and websites on line of called books fails where people have gotten too much books or the injections of been done too deep er not at the correct locations on people's face or scalp than it can give them droopy scalp or droopy eyes all sorts of you cosmetic nightmares can occur with books the second thing to understand is that books does eventually wear off that bochalin of narrator and does not stick around forever and provided it is done correctly at the correctdosages it does not actually kill the anurans that cause that tension of the skin books injections have to be done repeatedly the efficacy of books for offsetting heiress is not clear their ain't a lot of large scale clinical studies on this just yet but it does seem to be at least one reasonably safe alternative to things monockidil although i think if one were to just want to increase blood flow to the scalp things loose to dalafill which does not seem to carry any the side effects that monoxide can carry we talked about topside effects earlier that would probably be the better alternative both as a fairly invasive procedure but some people of for both treatment in fact there is a centrum called cuts vertices pirate some of you have probably seen that it is more typical than men although it does occur in women it literally means a lumping of the skin on the scalp or girl of the scalp an gory or gyros retains to the satin word knee it means bump or knee am and at any time you hearth were girl a in nor science or n biology you talc about a bump sometimes see people have ridges in the back where it looks as if the skin was pushed together can the a sharply dog but on the scalp people with cutout vertices grade almost always experience pattern hair loss now part of the reason for that is muticous vertices grade is also associated with some androgen or testosterone related hormone issues that will talk about in a little bit but in addition to that it has been shown that relieving some of those grade by injections of books to allow those folds to sit flatter ay is effective it can lead to less of those girl those bumps and can improve hair growth in those regions even if those people do not take on any additional treatments to address the hormone issues that is really how people arrived at this understanding that books might be a good treatment in general for reducing the an kind of squinting of the scalp o that can occur and the resulting hair loss in those regions i now to turn our attention to the chemical variables that control the duration f the growth phase of hair the duration of that cattagenphase which is when that hair essentially recedes from the inside out and the quiescence sea quiescent telogent phase there are a couple of key chemical players here that we should all be aware of first of all the growth factor i g f one insolent growth factor one which is produced by the liver but that receive stimulation from the brain and pituitary to be released is a strong regulator of hair growth and we can think of it as the accelerator on hair growth it does that by extending that managed or growth phase for longer it does not necessarily speed upgrowth but it extends it for a longer period of time in addition cyclic a m p which is part of what is called a second messenger pathway in fact cyclic ape is a second messenger is also a we player in stimulating growth of the hair logical now cyclic amp does many different things in many different cell types in the body it really acts as the name suggests as a messenger between signals that arrive at the surface of cells and transmitting or conveying those signals to things that happen deep within the cells such as the turning on and off of various genes when here second messenger do not let that confuse you or overwhelm you just understand that the whole process of getting signals from the outside of cells into the center of cells and controlling gene expression for instance causing a stem cell to continue to give off matter cells ere causing a hair cell to continue growing for longer that whole process is a bit a bucket brigade of handing off water or a bucket from one a component to the next are along a chain it is an assembly line i thing that is probably the simplest way to think about it for sake of this discussion i g f one is known to increase the growth of hair by extending that anal in phase as is cyclic m p those are going to be considered the accelerators at least in this conversation the breaks on hair growth are going to be the things that either shorten the again phase or that extend the captain phase or this quiescent phase which is the tilling phase and the two major breaks on hair growth that we want to think about are p d e which is a phosphor diesterace any time you here ace it is likely to be an engine and t g f bad too this is a particular growth factor that somewhat counter intuitively does not stimulate growth it actually stimulates lack of growth or shortens growth with all of that in mind and please do also keep in mind that you do not need to remember all those specific terms just understand that there are some factors tinselling grow factor one that act as accelerators on growth and there are factors that act as breaks on growth we can start to think about we for instance half of all people by age fifty start to lose their hair well they start to lose their hair because of something called androgen related alopecia which translated to english means testosterone and testosterone delivered induced heroes this is true in men and women hearing that you should probably be wondering the following thing young men have higher levels of testosterone than old men right well the answers yes although some older men in their forties fifties even eighties maintain testosterone level similar to many men in their twenties but most do not it is a downward slope starting at bow age forty how steep that downward slope is depends women too have mesotron in fact women have higher levels of testosterone than they do estrogen that is right a healthy woman have higher levels of testosterone than she does estrogen however women on average have lower testosterone than most men they still have far more estrogen and far less testosterone than most men but the level of testastrn that they have within their body is higher than the level of estrogen they have androgen such as testosterone and its derivative such as hydro testosterone which will be much the topic of what we are getting into next in hit if one and cyclic an p again androgen such as hydro testosterone inhibit prevent the action of if one and cyclical p which you just learned a few moments ago act to extend the anagener growth phase of hair which then raises the question well if young people both male and female have higher levels of testosterone than they do when their older why would people lose their hair when their older and not younger ah the answer lies in the conversion of testosterone to hydro testosterone testosterone most people have heard of hydro testosterone or h t is made from testosterone there is an enzyme called five alforductes the converts testosterone into dihydric testosterone in both men and women hydra testosterone binds to the androgen receptor at five times the affinity of testosterone it is the most powerful androgen in humans and it is responsible for a number of things that we all really want and such as mental vigor physical vigor strength healing capacity drive libido and on and on d h t itself is not bad if we take a step back and we acknowledge testosterone levels are higher in males and females at younger ages as a pop t older but as they get older there is more five all or reductase activity which is converting more of that testosterone to dihydric testosterone and dihydric testosterone inhibits hair growth by reducing igeif one cyclic amp we then we should all be aboard why it is that by we fifty about fifty per cent of people experience pattern hair loss that is androgen dependent alopecia but translated to normal english is pattern hair loss and in a moment you will understand why some people lose their hair from the crown regent am in the back of the head or back and top of the head whereas other people lose their hair in the front of their head in the flanks right on either side of the midline or may be in the midline in front altogether and that is because different people depending on their genetic lineage have different patterns of androgen receptors on their scalp and the pattern of androgen receptors that you inherit indeed does come from your mother's side and this is what gave rise to the the myth that if you want to know if you are going to go bald or not just look at your mother's father does not quite work that way in fact if you think about the logic you should really look at your mother's mother if you want to know your pattern of androgen receptors on your scalp however most women do not lose as much hair from their scalp or they have ways of covering up the hair loss in their scalp because their hair is just generally longer or there using other approaches that you never really get a clear picture of what the androgen dependent hair loss was in your grandmother now we do not want to go too far down the genetics rabbit hole because as you cannot select your parents anyway but if you want to know why for instance ism losing a bit of hair on either side of the midline in the front it almost certainly has to do the fact that have a her density of androgen receptors there as supposed to say on the crown of my head were for whatever reason my hairs seems to grow thickest other people lose hair on the crown in the back and top but not in the front and some people lose it all over now you understand why hair loss occurs in certain regions of the body you should also understand that the androgen receptors on the face are also what are responsible for beard growth and this is where it can get a little bit tricky but a lot of things will tart to make sense if you can understand this and internalize this if you have a my density of androgen receptors on your face well then as your de ta levels go up with age you will be able to grow a thicker in thicker beard in fact it is rare to see some one who can grow a thick beard in their youth but not much as they get older in fact the reverse tens to be true the pattern of androgen receptors differs between the scalp and the face and the back ay on your back you have androgen receptors and their de t stimulates hair growth if one who has a very hairy back or if you have a very hairy back i mean you have a hoydens of androgen receptors on your back you have a beard and that beard is thick well then you have a density of androgen receptors on your face however a density of androgen receptors anywhere on your scalp is going to predispose those regions to androgen dependent alapesha or hair loss in those particular regions which is going to allow us to understand why all the rest of the treatments for holding hair loss and for stimulating hair growth almost all of those center on inhibiting either d h t directly or five algor educates the conversion of testosterone to d h t now it'd to discuss the ways that one can chemically adjust certain things within the hair growth pathway things i f one p de e t c abaca et camera in order to stimulate hair growth or hurt hair loss the first thing on this list is actually going to be pretty surprising to a number of vow and that is affine we all think of affine is a stimulant that we drink i certainly drink coffee and carbamate occasional energy drink things of that sort affine does many things besides stimulate our central nervous system and make us feel less sleepy however one of the things that fine does is it is a fairly potent p d e inhibiter by being a potent p d inhibiter it indirectly stimulates i f one why well because p d e can suppress i f one and by ingesting affine or by applying topical affine ointment or cream to the scalp you can suppress p d e sufficiently enough to increase i f one and increase some hair growth or at least maintain hair growth in that region this may come as it shock it might seem a little bit esoteric reaving outside the margins of typical treatments but head to head topical affine application can be as effective as minoxidil application without actually lowering things blood pressure and potentially increasing prolactin and some of the other negative it is call them negative because they are side effects of monoxide affine ointments and affine present in various hair treatments and creams et camera is starting to become a more prominent female there i will include a reference to affine and its uses for offsetting hair loss keep in mind that topical fine ointments should not necessarily be applied every single day this is the sort of thing you might do three times a week the concentration of gaff in and different ointments varies tremendously most of the studies of affine on the steel niches that control hair growth an extension of the managed phase of hair growth have been performed in metro in a dish although there are some clinical studies exploring this they are not nearly as extensive in number or duration as the studies of minoxidil because this approach just has not been around quite as long however when comparing side effects of minoxidil cost of minoxidil comparing the efficacy of waffle and minoxidil i think affine as a topical treatment for offsetting heiress stands as a pretty good choice if your going to start exploring this pathway and there is no reason to think that if you were to try the coffin ointment and it did not work for you or you did not it for some reason or you needed to stop it for some reason that you could not stop it safely because it does not carry all the other and a blood pressure related affects and prolactonemia effects than minoxidil does f you look out there into the here maintenance and hair replacement literature you look at the treatmentsthat are being sold do not be surprised to see affine there and also do not be surprised when i tell you what's about to tell you now which is no you cannot simply just drink more affine in order to accomplish a the goal of offsetting hair loss it is true that when you invest affine it goes systemically however you have many a decisive receptors throughout your body those a adenosines receptors and the parking of affine in those a decisive receptors is the main way in which affine exerts its stimulatory effects making feel less sleepy it does that because then a denizens cannot have its effects which r to make you sleepy well those a denizens receptors soak up much of the affine that you would invest orally that very very little would make it to the scalp and to the heirfolicals at the concentrations that you would want that is why you have to rely on the application of these affine ointments about three times a week keep in mind that no one has really explored the dosages of affine in these ointments in a systematic way we are still in the early stages of all this but i do think it is import to mention affine because of the lower incidents of side effects at least for p order side effects and the general safety margins end the head to head essentially comparable efficacy with minoxidil because monoxide has a bunch of other issues now keep in mind that both minoxidil and affine bare generally used as a preventative for reducing hair loss over time they are not expected and they do not as far as we know create new hair growth to any sufficient degree if any of you have used kaffinointments or minoxidil and observe new hair growth that was robust please put that in the comment section i be curious about those experiences but as far as i know and from the clinical literature that i read there is no examples of that one other point about affine it does appear that affine can not only indirectly stimulate get one in the eaten phase of hair sell growth by way of reducing it an t g a feta but it also seems to reduce apodosis which is naturally occurring sell death of that stemsell niche we ben talking lot about the enagenor growth phase of hair we also talked by the antigen where the recession of that hair from the inside out but remember that third phase the diligent phase where that whole bulb down at the boom the bulges its call gets pinched off and holding dies and takes the stemsells off to the grave with it it appears that affine can offset the death of that niche and potentially maintain the stemsell population longer making coffin a really good choice to think about in conjunction with the various chemical treatments aimed at directly attacking the d h tea pathway that will talk about next there is one very direct way to increase hair growth and maintain the hair that you have on your head and that is to increase get one that can be accomplish through prescription drugs such as growthormone and things that stimulate the release of growthormon and if one keep in mind growthormona's released from the after pituitary during the first hours of sleep especially when you having eaten anything for the two hours prior to sleep and especially when you get regular bedtimes yes this is a real thing if you are re going to sleep at variable bedtimes especially if you go to sleep much later than your usual habitual bedtime you will miss that growth hormone pulse that normally occurs in the first two to three hours of sleep this does not mean that you need to be neurotic about getting to sleep at the exact same time every night is public plusermins thirty minute window and it does not mean that you cannot stay out laid or have a bad night sleep every once in a while or get woken up your hair is not can fall out my that story notwithstanding your hair is not can all fall out because of that but you do want to try and get that natural growth hormone release each night and as i mention there are prescription approaches and those are growth hormone itself and things sirmorellen which is a peptide that increases growth hormone it is actually a secrete a got it causes the secretion of growth hormone and thereby increases in igeif one this is well documented both growth hormone and igeif one as i mention are available but prescription they are not without their side effects they do cause growth of all tissues they do increase height in children they increase bone mass and density they can increase mainly fat lost not much muscle size but they can increase leanness and they increase hair growth they can increase turn over of skin they can make skin look more youthful all these things sound wonderful and yet they also have problems because they can increase growth of small tumors that normally might be eliminated there is at increased cancer risk with growth hormone treatments in igeif one or anything that increases i one such as sirmorell and ipremorolan any of the peptides that you hear about nowadays that said a number of people are using sirmorellan as an indirect way to increase if one and thereby to increase hair growth it does seem to be fairly effective in doingthat especially when done in conjunction with other treatments that will talk about but keep in mind these are prescription drugs and they do carry their own risks the other thing about stimulating the natural production of igeif one is that as its names suggests insolent growth factor one it is insolent dependent in many ways if not for its secretion than for its action at the hair physical and stemsell one of the things you really want to pay attention to is to avoid being insolent resistant or rather you want to try to be insolent sensitive your carrying a lot of excess body fact your bees or if you have type to diabetes mean your insolent resistant your going to want to deal with that their number prescription treatments to deal with that nowadays people are very excited about all the gel p one agonies but in addition to that regular cardiovascular exercise and resistance exercise making sure that your body fat percentage is not in excess of where it needs to be and everyone has a slightly different idea of where it needs to be both cosmetically and for health that is a conversation between you and your doctor and you and you frankly but you want to avoid being insolent resistant because being insolent resistant and being bees can indeed lead to heiress and there are many people out the who are not bees who none the less are experiencing heirthining and heiress because they are insolent resistant by way of reduced igeif one activity there are a few supplements these are over the counter supplements such as mayoand coital taken at dosages of about nine hundred milligrams before sleep which by the way can also assist in sleep or things barbering or met foremen which are known to improve insolent sensitivity each in every one of these has its own profile of positive and negative effects the lowest number of side effects is associated with nine hundred milligram mioanocital taken about thirty minutes before sleep most because it can make people lo it drowsy and it does aid sleep in some rely great ways but really exercise in maintaining a healthy nutritional program are also going to be key you just cannot discard those berberine which is a substance made from tree bark is sometimes call the foreman's met foreman met foreman being the equally effective prescription version of barbering or put differently barbering is the non prescription but equally effective version of met foreman keep in mind that both bearing and met foreman dramatically reduce s blood sugar levels and if you are not king to take them with carbahidras it can lead to some feelings of discomfort that is why ism not a fan of them but if your goal is to really improve insolent sensitivity they are considered very potent tools on the list of things that can do that the other thing that is really important for maintaining proper hair growth this managed phases that you need sufficient iron this is because iron and marital play a key roll in the sellgrowth pathways that go from the stemcells to the stimulation of carton within the hair itself do not have time to go into this pathway and a lot of detail but you can have your blood levels of iron measured turns out to be pretty important becauseyou do not just want to start popping iron supplements because too much iron can be toxic too little ins your anemic for women the levels of iron that you want are somewhere between twenty five and one hundred and for men somewhere between thirty and one hundred and fifty fortunately the tests or the blood tests for iron are usually a very inexpensive add to your current blood panel if you are going in for a blood panel for el deal h feel an a typical things or if your doing the more elaborate hormone testing which i do e recommend people do if they can afford it or if their insurance covers it do ask for an iron test as well and if your iron is low you may need to supplement your iron if your iron is too high that is not good either but iron plays a key roll in the managed phase of hair growth you want to make sure you at least have sufficient iron and if you do not you want to make sure that you are getting it from nutrition and or supplementation o case o earlier we were talking about my hydrotestostrone dihydric testosterone just to jog your memory is a form of testosterone that can bind the androgen receptor at five times the affinity of regular testosterone both men and women have a lot of testosterone relative to astern just happens that men ten to have more testosterone than women do over all but both men and women as they age convert more of the testosterone they have to dihydric testosterone and dihydric testosterone does two things that are bad for hair maintenance and hair growth first to f all it shortens the managed phase that growth phase whatever hair is going to grow is going to our over a shorter period of time second of all because of the presence of androgen receptors on the steel niche area and around it it actually miniaturists the magical and the stemselniche in other words it makes the population of cells that give rise to more hair proline smaller and can eliminate it altogether and that is why anything that reduces five had for reduces is going to reduce the h t is going to maintain or extend the growth phase the angel phase of hair growth and is going to offset or event some of the diligent phase the pinching off and the removal of that stem see niche now one substance that we know can inhibit five a for a ducts although it does it pretty weakly is sal palmetto which is an extract of the salpalmetto berry to be honest i do not know how this was initially discovered if any one knows please put in the shownote captions when i looked on line i found a bunch of conflicting stories about who was the first person to start extracting the extract of the salpalmettoberries i have no idea which one those is true maybe somebody can tell me the god thing about salpalmetto treatment is that it is known to have very few if any side effects there mayst be some side affection about one per cent of people but it is not associate with a lot of side effects it is also known that when taken at about three hundred milligrams per day and here it does not have to be that strict most o the studies that i explored involved taking anywhere from two hundred to five hundred milligrams of salpalmtto but most of them focused on about three hundred milligrams of salpalmetto per day divided into two or three doses why well as a relatively short half life meaning it ingoing to get cleared from the blood stream and more importantly it is biological action as can be very short lived if you can get a hold of fifty or a hundred milligram capsids or tablets of salpalmetto and divide those up taking them in the morning afternoon an evening or even just in the morning and evening to achieve a total of about three hundred telegrams pray that is going to very likely help you hold on to some of the hair that you would have otherwise lost may be even grow some new hair and i say maybe give you some new hairgrowth because salpalmetto is not known to be a particularly robust treatment for the reversal of hairdos it is known to have some effect but it is generally taken in conjunction with a bunch of other things and it is really hard to tease out just what amount of hair growth or prevention of hair loss is due to sal pommetor specifically but i mention it here because the mechanism of action is logical and fairly well known which is this weak effect in reducing five alforeductastan thereby reducing t h t again because it has relatively low side effects even tough it is not supereffective and because it is fairly low cost and its available over the counter let it was important to include now as soon as people here things salpalmetto berry there probably also thinking oboe hero call the exhales now keep in mind that there are some verbal compounds that have pretty robust biological effects talk before in are optimizing to stostrone episodes about things tongaali and fidogiagrastis which taken in correct dosages and in the correct way can be pretty potent for increasing utilizing hormone and free testosterone i can have huge effects not taking emotions anabolic steroids but they can have real effects and verbal compounds can be potent however i do acknowledge that there's a vast market out there of verbal compounds and plantable compounds that people are arguing must lee the people who seldom are arguing can increase hair growth and there are some decent studies of these things the hard part about studying these verbal compounds and these plant derive compounds for increasing hair growth is that they are often taken in commination with one another in fact most of the hair growth supplements that in all these verbal compounds and plant compounds include five or ten sometimes even more things altogether teasing out which ones are effective in which dosages are effective is nearly impossible they are just too many variables you will hear for instance that green t extract racy mushroom pumpkin oil zinc kirkman that all of these things can increase hair growth perhaps the only thing on that list that makes logical sense with respect to the big chemistry is that kirkman is known to in some people be a potent inhibiter a five far for a ducts and d h t much that i can personally say for me i once took kirkman numeric it is also called in my dosage as about a gram to two graham capsids and i felt absolutely terrible i man just dreadful i do not care if it allowed me to keep my hair forever it'd rather lose all my hair three times over as that means it would have grown back it'd rather lose all my hair what's just put it that way then ever take kirkman or numeric and high dosages again and in saying that i know that many people take numeric an kirkman and really its anti inflammatory properties and do not experience any side effects i just happen to be particularly sensitive to kirkman by way of this d h t pathway and i know this by way of blood work ism never going near that stuff again that said a lot of these erase compounds and cocktails probably will have some minor marginal infantisimily small somewhere in that range a fact on maintaining hair growth or in stimulating new hair growth is just that their really are not clinical studies to support any one of them and that is why i singled out salpalmetto is one of the few for which the bile chemical pathway of in hitting fallal for reductase and the low instance of side effects and the fact that many people have used it with some degree of success makes it a stand alone i wouldn't say recommendation but a consideration another commonly discussed and use commercial compound for offsetting hair loss and stimulating hair growth is quite connissal sometimes this is known as nisarall where near all is the grandame of a shampoo quite cannibal is an anti fungal that was inti fly develop to treat dandruff and severe siriasis quite cortisol has been shown to be effective in increasing hair number it is also been shown to be effective in increasing hair diameter which is somewhat surprising because one of the common side effects of quite cortisol is drawing winning and brittle hair what is going on there is a little on clear will return to that in a moment the mechanism of action for quite connisolds pretty interesting remember earlier we were talking about the salacious gland in the production of seem that oily stuff whose very names seems to evoke discuss in certain people well quite connaisol can disrupt some of the fungal growth that frankly we all have on our scalp all the time i know this is a surprise to many of you but you are constantly bombarded with viruses bacteria and funguses all the time but we vanish a battle those off with our amuse system either by physical barrier such as an oil barrier the seem or through antimicrobial action chemical approaches our man system the seam et camera auto cortisol aces an antifungal that in some way seems to reinforce the properties of seem at keeping out other fungal infections and the net of fact at least as far as we know is a mild reduction in d h t now exactly how this happens is not it really clear what is clear is that the use of quite cortisol shampoos two to four times per week with a scalp contact time of about three to five minutes has been shown to give about an eighty per cent responsory of maintaining hair that would otherwise be lost that is pretty dramatic eighty per cent what is less clear is whether not quite conning shampoo can actually stimulate new hair growth but as your probably trying to realize this is always a bit of a tough thing to disentangle maintenance of hair that you would have lost verses new hair growth certainly that is an easy thing to disambiguate if you have a patch of scalp where there is absolutely no hair es a called dead zones that you can resurrect with certain treatments b ut what about areas of your scalp where t hair is thinning for instance on the top your head is where many women will first experience a pattern hair loss alopecia is a right at their midline no if especially if they have a part right there they will start to notice that under very bright light florescent lights and particular they will notice the thing of their hair there or in the forehead region they'll start using quite cortisol shampoo again the typical recommendation is twotofour times per week the scalp contact time of thereto five minutes and really rubbing it in and then sensing it out you do not ne t be supervigorous but you want to make sure that it gets down into the physical and around the physicals not just sitting on top of the hair which is going to be especially important for people have long hair to really mirage it in well they will experience a growth of hair in that particular region that almost certainly were due to miniaturization of the heirfolical and reduction of the total population of stemsells in that physical as supposed to complete loss of the stemson population the reason we say this is that there is no reason to think that quite cortisol can actually stimulate igeif one or act if a growth itself it is probably offsetting some of the reductions in the enagenphase and some of the exacerbation of the tilling phase now if you decide to use auto cortisol as an approach to offsetting hair loss it is very important that you get a hold of a shampoo that at least two per cent concentration of quite connissol this is important because a lot of the onesthat are available out there especially on line are going to be one per cent or lower you want to try and obtain a veto cortisol shampoo of two per cent or her concentration of qutoconissol was as other things in it of course i should mention that there are occasional side effects with queitoconnissol the rates of side effects from the metanalses and reviews the died were somewhere between one and eight per cent of people will experience some side effects but those sideiffects tend to be pretty mild things irritation of the scalp things finding and brittleness of the hair that sometimes can be offset by using shampoos that contain things baton i know many people are proxy curious about biotin which is a proline that can be incorporated into the carton a whether or not different baton in rich shampoos can really enhance the total amount of baton that gets incorporated into the hair is in clear but it is clear that having sufficient baton around is important if you get a lobedextra from your shampoo can imagine how that would quintic tap off the amount of beaten in that hair and there are people out there saying that baton in rich shampoos have done wonders for them who knows i ism not going to dispute their experience if you are going to use keitoconizol keep in mine that the more typical brannames that are out there with ones they are oftentimes do not have to per cent or if they do have two per cent they can be very drawing and lead to brittle hair there are newer and now fortunately a greater variety of keitaconizol containing shampoos we is a podcast and i do not have any affiliation to any of these but i will provide a line to a couple of the more prominent ones that are known to have two per cent concentration of kitoconizol as well as some other things in them known to offset some of that dryness and brittleness that keep conical shampoos can trigger by now i think it will be abundantly clear why inhibiting five algor reductase and thereby reducing the h t should increase hairgrowth because of the negative impact that d h t has on the hairfolical the major player in this whole story around inhibiting five alforeductas and reducing t h to maintain or increase hair growth is going to be finasteride and its close cousin do astride finasteride is effective in reducing the h t because of its actions in reducing the type too is and time or inform of five algor reductase it turns out theirs three different uniforms are what are sometimes called isoenzimes of five aloreductes this is getting pretty far down in the weeds what i think most of you just need to know is that finasteride reduces d h t that is the net product of finasteride and in doing it can increase hair count by as much as twenty per cent pretty remarkable if you think about it in addition finasteride treatment done properly which will define in a moment can reduce hair loss in ninety per cent of all people that take it that is am a near staggering mend there are not many farmasuitacles out there that have that kind of efficacy really dramatic and in addition it is known to increase hair thickness by about twenty to thirty per cent over all conscious create new growth of hairs and thicker hairs but whatever hair you do have and have on your head it can further thick in those the finasteride story is one i think of general success i mean it really seems to improve hair growth and help you hold on to the hair that you have the issue with finasteride is twofold first of all it is known to have some pretty significant side effects if it is not dosed properly end in particular populations of people and this is because there is a wide variation in then amount of the different is enzymes that people make i sis we i brought up the isewenzimes earlier some people make more of disown time one and three some people make more of is enzyme two and three and every variation thereof when people take finasteride some people are very strong responders and they achieve really effective hair regrowth and maintenance of hair other people less effective although still pretty impressive but the catalogue of side effects that people experience at given dose varies widely there is a lot of trial an error that has to take place also should point out that finasteride comes in two major forms there is an oral form and there is a topical form this is not unlike our discussion of monoxide earlier topical finasteride is typically taken in one per cent solution or ointment and rubbed into the head sometimes it is now also incorporated into shampoos but typically it is put into a solution that people rub into their head and it is thought that the one per cent solutions are equivalent to one milligram of systemic finastride i we need to take a step back and ask why was finastoride developed in the first place while finastoride as a barely potent five alphorducta in visitor it is great at lowering d h t it was developed for treatment of prostate enlargement and various issues of the prostate that are associate with elevate h t that occurs with age the topical finastorides were designed with the hope that the finastride would make it into the heirpholical and would inhibit d h t there and allow for more growth of the hair which apparently t does but not make it into the systemic circulation or at leasnotic concentration sufficient enough to cause as many side effects as with the oral dosing now the problem is it does make it into systemic circulation the issue is also that topical application of finastride is harder to dose than oral finastoride not saying you should be taking oral rather than topical finastride but keep in mind that the dosages of finastride that have been shown to be effective for inducing hair growth cover an enormous range as low as point zero on milligrams per day and as high as five milligrams per day which is a just staggering range now in trying to simplify the problem of how much finastride to take either by way of oral tablet or by way of topical solution we can get a bit of leverage on this by thinking about how much d h t reduction occurs as a function of dose and there finastride shows this really interesting what is called logerhythmic distribution what it means is that for a dosage of point zero on milligrams of finastride you are going to achieve approximately fifty per cent reduction in d h t and that systemic d h t this is a blood measuring your d h t than taking point zero on milligrams of finastride again point zero one very loose of finastoride repeated a couple weeks measure people's d h t in their blood again you we that it is reduced by fifty per cent however at increasing dosages of point two milligrams one milligrams five milligrams of oral finasteride per day over the same period of time the increase or i should say the reduction in hydro to testosterone does not increase linearly it is not that you go from fifty per cent to sixty per cent to seventy five per cent to a hundred per cent with each increasing dose it tapers off it can flattens out it tends to increase a limit but its sort of a gradual slope increasing as you had from point to milligrams out to five milligrams what this means is that given that refusing the h t can cause very side effect sexual side effects reductions in either sexual function or sexual drive as well as overall drive and motivation sometimes even some depressive symptoms that everything points to taking the lowest effective dose of finasteride and starting with a very lo dose of finasteride because loosens of finasteride even at that point zero one milligrams take an only daily are already leading to a fifty per cent reduction in hydra testosterone and thereby taken for a long enough period of time should offset hairless and stimulate hair growth one of the problems however is that people will start taking finasteride at a lo dose u know point one milligrams or point two milligrams maybe even point zero one milligrams and there will be a reduction in their do t but because of the long duration of that managed phase they do not see a lot of change in hair growth in the first mother even two months and what the end up doing is increasing their dosage and then they start to see hair growth but then they start to experience more side effects now the side effects of oralphinasteride are serious enough and common enough in people at take finasteride that the topical solutions were developed but their two one needs to exercise caution because if we are going to translate between topical finasteride an oralphinasteride with the understanding that topical finasteride can a actually make it into the systemic circulation we need to look at what is been shown in clinical studies which is that for instance taking one milk leader of point two five per cent finastoride applied to the scalp this is a very typical recommendation translates to the same thing that would be achieved with two point five milligrams of oral finastoride and when i say translates to the same thing what i mean as it leads to the same concentrations in the blood now consider that point two milligrams point two milligrams a finastoride in the blood is known to be effective in generating new hair growth and maintaining hair that one already has when they start the treatment if you think that the topical finastorides are actually creating lower over all systemic concentrations of finastoride that is not necessarily the case again one milk leader of topical finastrde at point two five per cent leads to eight two point five milligram concentration in the blood when the effective dose within the blood stream by taking it oral as a pill is point two milligrams that might not seem a big deal to you although it is a big deal right re icing two point five milligrams verses point to but it is a huge deal when you consider that the side effects a finastoride increase as you increase the concentration of finastoride in the blood stream where does this leave us should people who are interested in taking finastride take the oral form at loose or take the topical form and simply try and apply it less often or guess at what their systemic concentration of finastoride is well it is going to vary from person a person some people are very sensitive to finastoride and not in the good sense the side effects just really show up quickly and they tend to be dramatic other people not much the doses recommendations that i was able to arrive at based on the clinical studies and frankly in discussion with some doctors who prescribe finastoride we are the following point five milligrams to one milligram of finest ride as a tablet per day seems to be an effective and pretty safe starting place for most people now some people will find that even that point five telegram dosage is just going to massive effects that are not going to work for them and they are going to either after reduce their dosage of finasteride or move to the topical or may be cease taking finasteride altogether but for many people out there that is going to be pretty well tolerated the anything here is that one is going to have to wait some period of time to see whether not any hair growth occurs it is a naive and frankly foolish approach based on what we know about the duration of that managed phase of the hair to do one of these treatments wait a week or two and then decide to up your dose now it is not foolish to reduce your dose if you are experiencing bad side effects but is simply increase your dose because you are not getting results quickly enough that is not going to be the best approach i really encourage people who are going to explore the finastride route to think of this as a long term project and to really ratchet up slowly if at all starting initially with a low dose taken for a long period of time may be even as long as twenty five weeks before considering going up any further certainly as i mention before if you need to go down further that is not gong to be a problem least not in terms of reducing side effects some your not into get additional hair growth but is surely not going to increase your she effects if you reduce your dose however i will talk a littlest later about post finasteride centrum which is something that is getting increasing attention nowadays that something that occurs after people have taken finasteride for an extended period of time now some of you of perhaps heard and it'll just tell you right here that the topical forms of finasteride are associated with far less side effects now that might come as surprising given that topical application of finasteride can lead to systemic distribution of finastride but the numbers that are out there right now it is that topical finastride is associated with thirty to fifty per cent fewer side effects or thirty to fifty per cent less severe side effects than oral finastoride now they are several things probably responsible for that one is that people tend to racist up their dose of oral finasteride pretty quickly but keep in mind that the effective dose of finasteride in the blood is point two milligrams now earlier i said the typical topical finasteride solutions are point to five per cent people taken one mil of it that it two point five milligrams and it seems a massive overdosing ah but here is the discrepancy and here is where we can arrive at some reasonable recommendations if you decide that finasteridesrite for you you get a prescription i would hope that your honor during your d h t levels and other hormone levels that would be ideal and working with a doctor please point five milligrams to one milligram per day of oral finasteride seems to be the best starting place for topical finasteride it is going to be that one mil leader a point two five per cent that we talked about earlier but that is taken only one time per week and you can fully expect that rite after the application you will have higher levels o finasteride in your bloodstream and therefore lower levels of t h t and that that will alter across the week most people are not going to be able to measure their d h t on a day by day or even weekly basis is just to expensive and labor intensive but i think those dosing regiments ought to get people into for or less the same category of optimizing hair maintenance and hair growth while minimizing finasteride side effects one point about finasteride taken either alone or in commination is that in recent years really in the last five or years there is been increasing discussion about called post finasteride centrum now post finastride centrum is indeed a new phenomenon in the sense that finasteride has been prescribed for a very long period of time four treatment of the prostate at dosages of about five milligrams per day that is a very high dose sometimes lower but as high as five milligrams per day and for many years there was no discussion about this post finasteride centrum what is post final stride centrum post finastride centrum is when typically its males this is where it is been described will take finastride at any range of dosages from one telegram to five milligrams per day there either doing this for prostate or more likely their doing it to offset hairless an increase hair growth and then they stop taking finastoride for whatever reason financial or was not working for them where the side effects were not to their liking and they start to experience some very severe what can only be called centrum of facts such as very reduced libido very reduced erectile function very reduced mood to the point of depression even suicidal depression this is pretty scary stuff especially since it is occurring at an age when most of these things are not typically occurring in males they cancer but they are not typical of younger males an their twenties and thirties and early forties we have to ask ourselves what is going on here after all people v taken finastride for the prostate and fairly dosages without this postfinastride centrum when they have stopped now these young males are taking finastoride their coming offinastride in their getting this very severe very debilitating postfinastride centrum this has become a kind of hot topic enough that medical doctors who've been prescribing finastride for very long time have been forced to address this i think at first they were for perplexed an thought i do not know this might be psychosomatic whenever that means m as the nonscientist who works on mind tidy connection we know that nothing is truly pcychosanatic everything is of the mind and body but the point is that enough medical attention has been placed on postfinastoride centrum and trying to unravel exactly what that is where there are now a few general conclusions about what might be going on first of all it seems that younger males taking finastride in particular dosages to improve hairgrowth or offset hairless seems to be one of the key variables were not seeing this postfinastride centrum as much in older males in fact it seems to occur more in males and their twenties and thirties than males in their forties and older that is one thing in it may relate to the ways in which dihydrotistostrone we know has a very key roll in early embryonic development its at what is responsible for the male genitalia it is also responsible for certain things in female development but mainly in uteri its responsible for male development and development the penis in particular and then a round the time of purity dihydrotistostrone acts again in what is called its activating effects to further increase growth of the genitalia increase the musculature bone growth et camera and increased libido and a number of other things it is probably also involved in the activation of puberty it certainly not the only hormone involved in the activation of male purity but it certainly one of the key players dihydratistostrone has these known early rolls in embryonic development and puberty but what postphinastride centrum seems to indicate is that dihydrotiststrone is likely having further effects on male maturation in particular saturation of the hypothalamus and areas of the brain that continue well into one's twenties and may be even one's thirties and here i just want everyone to keep in mind that we tend to think about development as childhood teen a years young adulthood adulthood but really development never stops development as something that starts at conception and birth of course and then extends all the way out until the point when we die even if we live to be in our late nineties ore achieve a hundred years of age development is a cursing that entire time and these different hormones such as dihydrotistostrone are having different impact for across the life span and in different ways across the life span there is not a clear conclusion about what post fanasteride centrum is really all about but it points to theft that d h c is likely to be involved in development of the brain n the brain to genital axis because i mention that because many of the side effects that a associate with this postfinastrised antrum seem to center on sexual side effects although their also the depressive side effects of course those can be related to one another in either direction while i do understand that loss of one's hair or potential loss of one's hair can be particularly troubling and anxiety provoking even cause depression in some cases i am sensitive to that you also on to be sends give to the fact that some of these treatments such as fianastoride can carry very serious side effects even if you come off them h a a postpinastoride centrum as long as we are talk about finastoride and this general pathway of five aloreductaste in ambition and thereby d c inhibition on on topics and themes and nomenclature you are now very familiar with we have to talk about do astride do astride it is yet another molecule similar to finastoride but remember those three informs of the five alforeducta sens on well it inhibits all three mainly type one tintype two but also type three and it does it very potently as a consequence the typical dosage of or do astride get this point five milligrams to two point five milligrams taken orderly works two to five times faster then typical finastoride at inducing hair regrowth and reduces d h t by get this ninety five per cent just near flat lines d h t and that can occur at concentrations as lowest point five milligrams although you will see prescriptions and people taking do astride anywhere from point five milligrams although ay to two point five milligrams oral now not surprisingly do astride is associated with a lot of side effects relate to the d h t pathway things reduction in sect strive reduction and over all drive it also tends to impact other hormone pathways increases an estrogen prolactin that is why ganochomnastia man growth of man breast tissue sometimes occurs when people take do astride and you are probably asking why would any one take do astride why not just take finastoride and wait for that hair growth well answer is that people are often very impatient and it turns out that do ta sterile works about two to five times faster than finastoride some people do not want to weight o full thirty weeks or forty weeks or fifty weeks or more in order to grow their hair back and their very concerned about the his loss that is occurring they will take what i hope would be a very low dose of do astride i realize that there are always to take dutastride that can be safer offset some of these side effects but by my read of the literature if one is going to try to mildly inhibit that h h t pathway things sal palmetto things topical caffeine which has some effect on the androgen pathway but as we talked about earlier tickles other pathways things qitoconisal mild reduction in androgen receptor pathways in the physical and very direct because it supply directly the scalp things that are going to be the bastorout for mild reductions and h t as an attempt to maintain hair or grow hair whereas if one really wants a potent stimulus for increasing hair growth that is very likely going to be finastoride and hopefully low enough dosages of finastoride and hopefully a patient enough patient person that they are willing to wait the duration of time required for that hair growth to come back because they understand that that antigen phase take some time now the holy grail of all this hair stuff is in understanding that no one specific treatment is magic and in fact there are now a number of good medaanalysies comparing the various treatments we talked about today alone or in combination and we can sunrise that pretty easily by saying that commination treatments that involve a mechanical stimulus and a chemical stimulus are always going to be better than either one alone and within the mechanical category the stimulus that seems to work best is micro needling the commination of micro needling and finastoride can lead to some pretty robot and impressive hair regrowth much that people that were i a we would only describe them as pretty bald or bald can regrow significant amounts of hair have never seen examples of people who were completely balled meaning lacking all seal hair to grow back a full head of hair but the commination of micro needling and finasteride is probably the most effective way to go and if you are going to do that there is no reason why you could not also use k to conceal shampoo could also u salt palmetto there is no reason to think that these things collie with one another although any time you are inhibiting a d h t pathway or whether not your increasing or decreasing any hormone pathway for that matter you ane to be careful about layering in too many different treatments because you soft want your h level to go too low and let us keep in mind that even if you take a very loose of finasteride and reduce your d h t and do not have side effects maybe just the mere edition of sal palmetto which leads to a slight reduction in d h t combine with some caffeine ointment would be sufficient enough to start inducing some of the lo d h t associated side effects you really have to c for you and that is one of the major issues in this whole field of hair growth and regrowth is that people are highly individual in their response and in their side effect profile to these various treatments not there is an enormous range there and unfortunately there is no way to know a prior before doing these treatments what your response is going to b in terms of side effects o your simply can have to explore and i would hope that you would explore starting with minimal possible effective dosages and to do that incardination with a medical professionals you could really evaluate these things that the level of blood and cosmetic changes and in fact that is a pretty good modern actor for thinking about the different treatments that we talked about today everything from mechanical treatments a simple as message which were all hurt about but for which the really are not a lot of data for supporting hair growth but certainly things micro needling which is a mechanical stimulus for which there are pretty good data that it can improve hair growth also things sal palmetto a weak d h t antagonist also things kitocanosal shampoo which again is a weak t h t antagonist and operates through some other pathways is well to stimulate hair growth my suggestion is that any one young old male female who think in about embarking on various treatments for offsetting hair loss and stimulating hair growth consider both mechanical approaches end the approaches that attack the chemical pathways that can stimulate hair growth and can inhibit the inhibitors of hair growth in fact that is the reason why we spend much time on the biology of hair growth and what shuts down hair growth early on into day's episode and then systematically went through each of the various treatments that relies on and in some cases hinges entirely on either a mechanical stimulus or a chemical stimulus in order to exert its effects my goal today was not to overwhelm you with a ton of biology about hair although we did cover a lot of biology of hair and steels and hair growth my gowan describing all that was really for you to be able to hereabout various treatments but they are not its layers or p r p or finasteride do astride or whatever is coming next that were sure to hereabout soon on line and from the medical community and to be able to place those into bins related to their known or potential mechanisms and then to be able to step back and evaluate which if any of those treatments might be right for you if you are learning from and ore enjoying this podcast please subscribe too you tube channel that is a terrific

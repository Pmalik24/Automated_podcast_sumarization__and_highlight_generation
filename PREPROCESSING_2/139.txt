bog down by specious legal cases and elevated toward the republican presidential nomination because of them donate trump faces almost insurmountable obstacles to the white house even archer tells bunker crimson about his special relationship with hunter and by mix means america credit being down grated ism beenshkur of this is benchmark show the benshpira shows sons rob express we plan i talk about them every single show why have not you gotten if e planet get expressive plan right now at expressive pans i cam glassman all right today the former presidents of the united states is expected to appear in person for its arraignment in federal court in washington d cs soeregongto get another o j siphon day where the president is trail by hellacoppters as he leaves marlogo and then he gets on a plan and the ho goes to washington d c and the goes into a courthouse an then he octets a court house hon wrong t get all the usual hullabaloo about how this is historic and it is the biggest thing that is happened in the united states since evener an it is an amazing amazing day for e left that all onto be celebrating thrall going o be whoring it is going o be exciting we have done this several times at this point because true of course had to go to new york for arraignment and then he had to be in florid and mama for arraignment naps been washington to see for payment boat's the arraignment world to er here with the with the trump campaign and this is not dona trumpsfall because this incitement is garbage the indictment as i discussed yesterday his charging crimes they are not actual crimes they they are suggesting that dona true for example committed some sort of fraud against the governments of the united states which is a li that is not in fact how that wall works but they wanted to charged him with was incitement but they really want his charge with was he is the one who created the iron on canary six but the providence does not fulfill the actual elements of incitement because incitement under america waw requires the actually tell people to go do the thing is not enough to say well you now i really really do not thatguy and then somebody goes they burn down the guy's house that is not enough left say i want you go to that guy's house and burn down his house and hears his address and tat the latter is incitement true did not do that he is said on canary six go peacefully protest patriotically protest at the capital building and then he did not do enough to get people out but again that is not the same things incitement that is not an actual crime is just him being a bad president at that time which again his activities during canary six i think we're grebes i thing his activities between the election in canary six particularly in the aftermath of state certification votes i thing it was wrong i thing was false hitting is none of that is crime it turns it can do lots of things in america that i personally think our grievous wrong in damaging to the country they are not crimes happens pretty much all the time and every single day former president trump again he is going to show up in washington d c in order to be arraigns and this just under scores the fact that not only could president trumps life be at risk here because he now faces seventy eight felloongy charges across three criminal cases if trump were convicted on all counts according to politico and given them factotum statutory penalty for each one he would face a popping six hundred and forty one years in prison which i soon means you ad not or out prison although he is seventy per cent preservatives at this point because he eats much my donates and diazole that is not counting additional criminal charge you you might face in georgia the actual plausible criminal term is probably nothing that in both state and federal course judges have wide latitude in sentencing none of the crimes trump has been charged with carry mandatory minimum sentence the ferns with no pair criminal record rarely receive the maximum and sending true to prison could raise pretty on president to practical an legal issues given the fact right now he is the most likely person o be the republican candidate for president there is the actual real possibility the donaltrum could be campaigning from prison in the middle of next year which again hi drama and maybe i mean i would love as ye a presidential debate in which jobidon being corrupt the hunter and having violated the loco could the medically have a presidential debate in which you have the candidates in actual jail sells a cross from each other at fulsome and just shouting at each other across the hallway as flaming bed sheets fall around them which frank would be more ascertaining the most presidential debates at this by butt is this a miscarriage of just as it in this indictment shunotco for it i discussed it at length yesterday not only that it is very clear that blacksmith wants the stuff prosecuted as fast as humanly possible thonnaltrumps defencitorny john laugh he said prosecutors want a force to trial in sixty to ninety days if i get my outright that means that they want ta force the trial in october nonmember at some time presumably before the primaries begin the prosecutors that let us go to trial ism ready and seventy days fire not are not ready and seventy days how bi i r ha i i try have i e pro ais out he have three and a half hears flail make it pall what a the bottom line is that they have sixty federal agents working on this sixty lawyers all kinds of government a personal and and we get this an given and they want to go to trialing ninetydays just that son justice to you on m a just in the pros her ti we in never a i ts to the trial is at ais to force a former press in the invited states to trial in ninety days when you have have three years this well now to they're they are two things that are happening right here from a a sort of political perspective one is the entire election tychael will now be about canary sixth o bout ton trumps activities is legal activities tho bout class by documents that is what the election's going to be about and that is what democrats want the elect you do about they would love nothing better can that is why y have michael wish loss is the world's worst historian and write speeches for jobidon comparing canary six to nine eleven which again this is such an absurdity ism sorry canary six was a was a rally that turned into a fairly small scale riot in the contact of the twenty twenty rices wipers most damaging riots an america history and from a property damage and and you many lives were lost michael wish lost comparing a bunch of adults going into the capital building and by the way killing no one o ka because tithe reality is that the one officer who died bring signal died afterward and it is unclear that the cause of death was directly related to canary sex butt put all that the only person actually was killed that they was actually habit of course comparing that to nine eleven and which three thous an america died in a full shall attack on the united states including both the world's ratescenter and the pentagon comparing that to pearl harbor i michaelbishlosses he his a terrible historian but this is the narrative pearl harbor nineteen forty one we were bond persistent was very much in danger our democracy many people were getting doc can cay the they'd do the democracy hat my this last days prat euros foul help to put a coalition together at the last neaten to save democracy an train round the world nine even two thousand one bosom of in lagan another arris hated our democracy try to destroyer you see where ism going what we see in this an firemen is that on canary six twenty twenty one donate top just those to their threats to america democracy try to destroyersist o a he is now comparing dona from to osoneman loden and hero hero whether the thezuour democrats one gone the gloves run this election they ran the flesh in plabocan twenty twenty thy ran the flesh n playbook an twenty twenty two and it actually went pretty well for them i remember a lot of us were pretty exercised about what i think is still the worst presidential speech have ever seen given jo lion's bazar and fetishistic speech in front of independence hall were he completely miss red what liberty is and then declared lifts political opponent's enemies of the republic blood read index penance hall with the soldiers flanking the background youremember all of that but it actual worked out fairly well politically for ms o democrats one a re run that playbooks that is point number one point number two is that if you bog down your political opponents with boss you after loss would after lawsuit criminal case heater criminal case haver or that that keeps him pretty busy and not only that if you had with bunch urinal cases they are pretty obviously politically motivated it elevates him in the primaries democrats are getting hin all the things they want here ell get to that in just one second first let us talk about the fact that big tax big governmenthese are not trust worthy sources they'll to silence o any descending voices into submission in fact they work can an glove together there is literally a story out today that the white house contact to casebook an ask them to ding daily wears tragically to great dailywars traffic in twenty twenty one we do not trusting tax we do not trust government you should not either this is why you should fight back against having your voice censored by both by using express it v in the noble big tax they do not just attempt to censor you they track what you down line a you monetize your data and your

men that is e c p r is us v p is i come lasshmen to get three months for free is it ex less vibe dot come lash man to learn it more o case this is in a fact in attempt to on that rig the twenty twenty four election again when i say rig i mean it in the sort of generic sense i do not mean select total fraud i do not mean democrats shipping in ball box in middle the night or dead people voting in chico in nineteen sixty or stealing in election for a frank an over norm cold men in minisoda that stuff does happen that is on ism talking bout here when ism talking about here is the free rigging of the twenty twenty four election by essentially making donate trump the republican hominy knowing that the amount of baggage he brings into the general is going to drag him down in the general election because that seems to be the most predictable way that the selection cycle goes it is very difficult to believe that independents are going to think re publicans and con serrated on these issues his most people do not watch the stuff at the granular levelled he listen to the show you are more politically in formed that about ninety eight per cents of the america public the rest of he public a huge per sending oath public does not follow the stuff closely and hes when they see headline after headline after headline suggesting that dona trump is a criminal if they are not in the forty per cent base of dona trump if they are in that ten per cent which tends to be less engaged tends to be less informed which tends to notes in to con servatofe podcast but may turn on mean an every often that the the people who catch the news when their not reading sport section for those people you thin te'regoing to be gran yulotally involved an whether the go ja was caponized again tonal trump because after all dona trump has been arguing that for years he was right but those arguments in not are baked in to the cake the question be comes both practical and message on a practical level howisdonal pumpkin can ten with the fact that he is likely to have at least four on going criminal trials in the middle of the selection cycle husganto do that we already know that his superpack is pending every dollar they've raised all of them on his legalese's right now first dona trumps most be a billion he should not be using his superpack money for that dona trump should be paying his own legal bills and when you do not net money t dona trump it should not go toward his legal defense it should go tor to feeding jobidon by building up a grass rates operation tit is a simple politics but put that side en your fine what by way done trump could have started sepperat legal fun and then if hoe wanted to give to his legal fun you could of the sit he did but put all that aside every dollar donate trump is bringing in is being spent right now on legal every moment the donate trump is on line is being spent thinking about legal everysto often he sides swipes on to artist just can a keep hem down but most of his folk is right now is going to be on the legal cases and dancing about jack smitten stuff here shall that is an awful expenditure of time for presidential candidate who needs to run in election in swing states in order to win beyond that think out the practicalities thing about the court dates thing about where he actually has to physically be in many of these cases he is on to have to be for days or weeks in florid for for his case on class documents or n washington you serve for for the general sixth incitements or in gorge of for alert total interference is elements that are shortly to be coming or in new york for thestorby angels nonsense he is enough to be in all of this place just on a practical level is the very very difficult case for donate trump to run it is a very rough race because they have set up all o these dopscals gain this i a itsbeen had once you bring a bunch of species allegations against trump and you lock him up in drums of his time in his money for the next you are and a half that is a form of rigging the election and as a at another component of this by doing this you are also helping to rig the republican primaries in a bazar sort of way when all of the media coverage goes tor donate trump it sucks all the a out room nobody else can compete it means that donate trump with all of his baggage is likely to be the nominee because everybody on the republicanize of the a myself included we all look at trumpet mere that is being victimized and we would to give him as much power as he can have an or to smack back i get it i totally get it but there is the thing if he loses none of that tithe power of a nomination is no greater than the power of a not nomination the power of the presidency is the thing you need if donate trump does not win giving him the nomination the nacho help him one i od up not one little bit you need somebody who can win if that person wins presume they could pardon him theoretically of federal charges they could remake the deep ja that is the thing we holdall be focused on if we actually care about fixing the system and making sure the y do not get bad indictments against political opponents but that requires victories the question really as always comes back to victory again that is the practice out that is that is practically number one is his time being stacked up i him being basically named of all the way until election day with criminal cases and then again there is message number to which is the message is democratic in a ram down push it push it push a push in and these criminal cases allow them to do it everyday trumps can being court talk at it everyday an true social talking bout if there is if there is one person who likes talking about trump more than jobidnist dona trump he loves it is favorite thing we in an entire lection cycle of that maybe that something that you are up for for dramatic purposes or be cut out of loyal tea to to trump on some sort of personal level i i do not blame you for it i get it ism just asking is the thing that is most likely to result in actual in actual victory as well we in a second ire's quite pot probable that jobidon basically set all of this up at lest in terms of the indictments that are now coming down from blacksmith fillet to that in just one second first we have a great dog his name is happy he is very cute he got groomed yesterday not gob not an middle school he he got a actually clean and groom and i and he is at he is a very very pussies to have knees and his hair is growing long and he looks a a v a ambiversion of chuck up like hit is love him which is why we want him to live a long and healthy this also i we give him rough greens every single morning the dog found you have ben giving your dog is dead food it does not have a lot of nutritional value and look at it it is brown dots or something green food batter for your dog rough greens loose happier wed backs that can do the same for your dog your nous to got ton by new dog fold just sprinkle some rough greens on their food every day it contains all the necessary denizen's minerals you are dog's not getting from their regular dog food happy loves his rough greens he dives into the everyday rough green's the only supplement your dog will ask for by name rough greens you get it it is it is a joke to pun natural pathic doctor dens black the founder of rough greens is confident this product will approve your dog's half he is offering my listeners a free jump start trial back go to rough greens dot tomslashmen let rough greens bring word dog's food back s that is a you f f greens dot tomslash ben today or call eight three three my dog thirty three that is eight three three my dog thirty three o canso did jobidon rig a lot of this sort of stuff i mean the answer is a cantisounds it this an article from march thirty first two thousand twenty three a few months ago bid unsaid what the biding justice to partial do has let the a written of justice beet the department of justice let them make the judgments if we should be prosecuted they are not my lawyers they are not my personal lawyers but and there's the near time's reporting backing march he does have opinions in the past mister bison privately told his close circle of advisers then mister true posed a threats a democracy and should be prosecuted for his roll in the events of canary six according to two people familiar with his comments he also told confidence he want tat at turning general merit garland to stop acting a ponderous judge and to take decisive actions well that is heard that he then did those things and this a very much when brocabama said would it be great of the virus would not be grig if the virus when after all my political opponents thou be great that is overt and then magically the press did just that then people we did not order them to do it right when you say publicly you want the people who work for you to do a thing typically they tend to do the thing if i were to suggest on my show that i want my than to get me a birthday cake tomorrow for no reason i assume somebody would probably hear that and maybe ell get birthday cake tomorrow you've in within in explicitly tell him by the way got hour ne thebirthda cake but that is the that is the way that this sort of stuff works when the boss says a thing and he says it in public he subordinates ten to do the thing is it a coincidence that jobidon wanted these things happening now they are magically happening is it also a coincidence that barocabama apparently told hoiden earlier the summer the donate trumps political strengths could actually be a problem for him and maybe maybe it might be kin an nice if something would happen to that i rid a men if he just got hit with bunch men siemens that ain't ibapen that would not get terrible thing according to washington posed at the bunch help them late tune at the wite house presents o bomb promise to do all he could to help get the president reelected according to two people familiar with the meting but he also warned that dona trumps political strengths including intensely loyal following a trump freely con cermet of media ego system in a polarized country under line his worry that trump could be a more formidable candidate than many democrat's realize i know what is a a great way to a undercut that opposition is by locking him up with munch of false legal charges that could in washington he see quite probably result in a conviction no call from a idea prosecutor he says thiswill almost certainly result in a conviction which again it is in washington he see father's real go shot i frees feature i me truce defense the n well id just set id i in actually do anything but that is never ear if fence to wig few it o y yet do not order you to kill some one it o or yo on conspire with you to kill somewheeon through my words or it is o that that does not mean that i once only speech there for i camp be prosecuted that is thoroughly bones i thing were generally castes an fitment ere is straightforward ad narrow but pay packs a punch as been its calculated and i feel i it is almost certainly point results in a conviction it is not clean it is not calculated its not pack a punch it is an of ad mask rating as an indictment but does not matters on washington to we there's every possibility the dona trump could be convicted and and convicted in short order in washington dose and terms of danger to trump again there get stack it up in sort of to categories one is the actual solidity of the legal case in terms of the solidity of the legal cases that are currently outstanding against trump on the criminal basis by far the most grave charges of the class documents charges those ones there is pretty solid evidence the trump did the thing it's not with regard to the political concerns the political concern of course is the double stand withthilery bits a whole different thing in terms up which charges re the most dangerous and trams the stuff that trump has violated the rankings go flora case desk indictment which again is species and manhattan indictment which is superduper species in terms of actual danger to go to jail desk is by far number one by far number ones s its a washington desex jury and tat is a huge difference in this case and democrats know it they want o jam him up this is it is rigging it when if if suddenly the bunch of legal cases that arose against jo bison just prior to the election in which he had to sit in the doc munch of dead decided to just try him month after month after month for bunch of specious charges yes that would be a form of election rigging in the same way s from a flection rigging when the federal government literally lie two people about whether hunter by is laptop was real causing social meets censorship of the neworpost story an the other massacre of course as have said is the democratic message which is that dona trump is the worst person to ever person and a nancy policy is trotting now went out it she apparently she is heartbroken there is nothing i hate more than crocodiles here as this is crocodile tears just in extremes you have a singular experience of geinrsec on as poured the indictment what was your reaction an what jump down to you it is her braking for our country to have e president of the night tat a wit this a lis the tags against him and i dustpan it conned that a daniuellisin it iron nasty the health committee by partition committee than opsonin this any in all the members of the committee in the stay for the work that they did they made a foundation of facts about facts and the law and made a criminal refer to the justice department i she seems very heartbroken does not she or maybe she superheavy this guests to be the narrative going forward and this leads us to our favorite thing two the things can be true at once him a get to all the things the in me try once in just one second first this show is supported by gran canyon university gran maneuvers i visited it is a beautiful beautiful place it is an affordable private

your purpose at g c u gran canyon university private christian affordable visa g c u dot e t u to day aga now get to the two things come me to once it can be true the democrats are things rig the election in their own favor by it both elevating tonal trump in the primaries and also degrading him in the general with all these legal cases which achieve all of those things both for narrative purpose and for actual practical day to day time on target purposes for atonal trump at can also be true that donate trump made some of this bad himself an mean therefore lot people are very angry at my pence today can and anything that mi pence should hae come out strong against the indictment i her again i think that should have i thin ye shul have said this indictment is species does not appear to to b legally eradicated but mi pence was also the my who donate trump was lying about for three months two was the person who who dona trump was was basically directing all her in the universe at his own vice president who been absolutely loyal to him for four years there is no more loyal servant of donate trumps policy positions in the white house then my pence for four long years and on time trump swiveled on him and just clocked him in the face repeatedly by line it was a lie that my pence had the unilateral ability to overturn the election it is not true just as coal arris as not have the unilateral ability to overturn the election and ism constantly amazed by any one who gives any credence to this legal theory and there were people who ware doing it for several months i i cannot see any reason to do it other than for a a sort of nefarious purpose in in the sense of a selphagrandizement because it was obviously legally species an and silly twice president does not have the capacity to simply put aside state certified votes if he did should make him a dictator that is silly a but no two things can be to once trump pence should have said that the indictment is species and also donate trump radically mistreated my pence there is no question about this and ma pence is not wrong to talk about that here is pence talking about that yesterday let us let us be clear on this for there was not just the ask for pass a the president ta specifically ask man his faggot o a of crack to lawyers asked me the literally reject lots the which would have result to in ta in the assure being turned over to the house of re presentative and literally cars wot oven our o maltha just the people people canary the an i man frankly i a before id hope that it not come to this point ti i do not know if the government can me the standard the burn o prove be od reasonable doubt a for recital charges but the america people deserve to know a the president top a at is advisers i did not just ask me to pas the ask me to reject pots return votes essentially to overturn the election do not be angry my pence to don trumped and ism sorry you in me angry my pence for again not coming out against the investment strong but it is sown trump who made its bed with regard to my pence true then tweeted out i feel badly for my pence who is attracting no crowds enthusiasm or loyalty from people who as a member of the trump administration should be loving him by the way it should be noted at this pointed of all of the cabinet officials who served under dona trump a granted of for have currently indorsehim he did not fight against selection fraud which will now be easily able to prove they some most recent faconsitement and in formation which will have be made a available to us finally a really big deal the up had power mi did not understand but after the election the rings in demo changed law taking that power away a don true talking about loyal to with regard to my pen is really pretty graves this falls under the two things can be tool conceal don trump should be invited these are not crimes they are just very very very bad behavior and bad activity it can also be true that don trump relied on advisers for some of the worst advisers in america history kidney paw is a cook she was a cut the whole time everybody who is watching shouldhave said that she was a cut the whole time we looked at her claims and we established on the show that here claims were cookery from basically there beginning get on rude juliani on his legal team it turns out that rude seems to be now unfortunately he went from being america mare when he was a terrific mare of new york in america here on the afromaphro nine eleven and a pretty formidable presidential candidate the beginning the two thousand aught race in to a man who appears to be a habitual drunk when there is it there is an outlet out that there there is a a lass mud out right now from a former assistant in which the former assistant accuses him of sexual harassment anta and other and and other sore of sexual miss conduct and ism skin she has tapes of juliani talking to her juliani again it is these arethepeople the trump had around him these are the best people to thinks can me to at once on trump should not be indited and on trump does not surround himself with the best people this a direct quote from rude juliani's topic can get ready with the bleeberguise there we go he is talking too a a in assistant named well donee a and him she is apparently suing him again as i say right now in civil court and here is the transcript that of a tape mister juliani come here big come here big is your belong to me give them to me indiscernible i want to claim my i want to claim my i want to claim mi these are mi miss funny oh yah mister juliani these best belong to me no on else can get near these hoo c a i do not care of their flirting or they give you business cards at these are mine you got it is don't yes mister juliani understand ism very possessive have gone easy on you is don't to now mister juliani have ben easy on you miss don't you are pity tough hung mister juliani have been easy on you give them to me these were the people that that doll trump surround himself with in the middle of the election cycle is that a good thing is that what you want in a candidate i just because two thing just because you are being prosecuted and persecuted by your political opponents does not mean that you are actually good at the thing whereto you are not making obstacles to resell by hanging out with people rude juliani for example while rue juliani shows up four seasons gardening with hair die dripping down his face i i does it is does that sound the mark of a good candidate again thotrump is lot of things have got said before he is a genius for telescoping the id of the republican base his a genius for it he can put his finger directly on the pulse of the republican base he feels what they feel and that is an extraordinary power also he has no discipline whatsoever he surrounds himself with the absolute worst people who who apparently are there just based on some sickafhantic level of personal loyalty to him and he is not immaticulous tool on behalf of his own position he is not if he were he would have done a better job in last nervous presidency which frankly was a disaster area the first three years this presidency his can of personal foibles were not in any way really hampering the efficacy of his program the last year was a disasterhibs ween black lies matter covert handling and all of this stuff i is and of a disaster the question is is that the person and then put aside the electro record is that the person the re publicans want nominate do you do you wish to be succored by democrats in to doing precise with the thing thy would you to do which is nominates on trust that can hit him with eighty three false incitements if he now in the election lock him up and hit him with a media waves suggesting that he is a criminal and do you think that don trump is can be able to overcome all of those obstacles do thing that is that is likely is that the most plausible solution here or is a possible the best thing that could happen is for mobile not to be president any morse we can fix the problems can fix the problems and this brings us to the other candidates inside the republican race again rondosantus is still the solid number to there is no number three all the talk about anybody else rising inside the republican pulling just is non existent all the the e right now if you wish to see some one aside from dona from nominated it is to mantis or bust the real or post expelling average has trump at fifty four and has to mantis lateen and is every one else below five per cent no one else is gaining steam no else o picking up traction not him shot who stuck at three per cent nine if he hailed who stuck at four per cent not my penis who stuck at four per cent not toe we cromasuammi who stuck at five percent and certainly not the the inimitably absolutely magnetic dug bertha we have never heard of the the mantis is final my doing the thing that he needs to do which is he is aggressively finding people on the left to punch according to politico decants has now agreed touldebate gavenusum on fox news which is good now news is very clever guy dosages thrill enough to prep for this this is the debate that really the country should have is whether we wish to be more flora or whether we wish to be more californium have a personal stake in this debates as i literally move my family from californium to flora and my company from californium to florid and national the ism fascinated by this i think that it would be the debate that actually is worth watching as opposed to you now two old men screaming at each other about their personal corruption or a legend personal corruption this debate should be interesting according to politico the for republican in californy democrats have repeatedly sparred over policies in the respective states each representing one side of the idea logical spectrum though occupying different political purchase the mantis is trailing trump for the republican presidential nomination news is basically running is a shadow candidate in case jobidon should fall over and a smack his smack his head on wednesdaye de wants agreed to the debate i said toy when and were in eights o awesome told politico the governor was also in apparently the proposed debate dates are nonmember eighth or nonmember ten and a handy would be the sole monitor it should be a fascinating development it is something that de stasis obviously needs to do and he needs to show that he can be a better candidate a better weapon against the left than trump its that give been saying this for while it is not about which republican candidate can tear down trump because no republican candidate can her own trump is by demonstrating o republicans that the best person to achieve the gender the republicans want he achieved and to stob for example the weaponiszation of the do ja the person most likely to beat jobidon is the person s soul get the nomination right now the polling data is not suggesting that its desansisabove trump that can change and it can change pretty quickly have just again remind people that the candidate who is not facing down for separate criminal indictment between now and the election is probably gan and not have quite as many obstacles the guy who is it seems tautological but it is worth noting again not in emotional argument to purely factual argument wins more likely to wen the guy who has to spend all f the time in sort who does nothaugh spend all this time and court and who also does not hire some of the worst advisers in the history of advice can just one second more breaking news on jobidon and hunter bison novena archer did not interview wit tucker cross and good

congressional investigators a cording it two fox news demon archer hunter bison's form business partner told investigators that hunter use his quote very powerful name to quote ad value in pitching and securing for business venture archer said that hunter biding quit would not be avert or overtly shay were gin to use might add for this instead archer said that he would use it to get leverage he said quit defensive leverage that the value is there in his for the value that hunter bison brought to it was having there was the theoretical was corporate governess but obviously given the brand that was large part o the value to they wen they weren't bringing in hunter widen a druggaddicted crack dictate horrid diced drown to do corporal governments that is not that is not exactly the person the you hey that guy who is a crack hound when we snorting parmishon cheese off the carpet let's bring him in for corporate governments i sit on the board of a large privately held company the would be dailywire i also sit on the board of a publicly held company angst that tret company and out lemme sell we do not do corporate governments with crack attics that's not how it works do not the as the sole value but i do thin it was a keep components of value said demon archer it was the sold hallux was not a keep pone it what at what else is a value lie what is the value of of hunter bison a cross is into life what is the value of him they really name it name an productive thing that hunter bison has done other than having a last name that is the same is that of a senator v p an than president archer told investigators that hunter put his father than v p robin on speakerphone well meaning i business partners at least twenty times archer said that the id dead was to quotesell the brand he said that brought the most value to the brand it was hunter widen and him we would discuss having know an understanding of de c and that was to differentiating compose invest being able to raise capital he added it was not as specific as the vice president son but obviously the brand carried as to say it in honest to got yourn't to say it we if control junior walks into a room and he says have connections would you think he saying he has connections to his literal name is don from junior hunter bison's literal name is hunter bison when asked if archer and hunter would tell business partners they'd unique access because of ye be widen archer a guest we'd say we had unique understanding of de c and how it operates and how that could positively reflect on the terms of our business referring to melisma archer told investigator's hunter used the brand of job for having doors open which sent the rights signals for tribesman to carry on its business and be successful archer said my only thought as i thing talisman would've gone out of business if he did not have the brand attached to it when pressed archer just kept repeating that he kept saying they re able to survive for his long's they did just because of the brand because people would be intimidated to mess with them archer explained in what way legally well that is interesting they felt that if they must wit charisma legally that the brand would would come in when me spell that out they were afraid that they must it charisma legally the vice president of the united states might withhold a billion dollars an midst get the prosecutor fired is that with hey were afraid of the brand interesting and meanwhile of an arch did not interview with tuna carbon in which he openly said selling access to job was it certainly in abuse of of power i guess ism pivoting against the lie that ism hearing people tell with a straight face congressman goodman for example thoroughly no what was going really you are taken a call from the vice present and put on speakers not us hay that ism in meeting with somebody is why it is limit let me put my dad the bathe u spinner in in the rear view it is a it is a it is an abuse of off power it is an abuse of off power ism interesting ism it is certainly in abuse of soft power and then tune reveals a letter the jo by actually sent even archer thanking him for just being best ease with test see with his son i hope you enjoyed lunch thanks for coming sincerely jusephor boon junior ps hand written happy you guys are together they are many levels here but here is the vice present the united states saying to you a man in his mid thirty's who's not a government official ism sorry i was occupied with the guy runs the world's larch's country i would much rather talk to and thank you and he was thanking me and thanking hunter i think that the endow they for bringing this idea of this government regulators test ad misery businesiness of the private equity world and i think he was excited about the prospects for hunter and a now he was a just just thanking nothing was a nice gesture but he is a vice press the united state u and he is talking about foreign business deals with you and thanking you far think i e it goes but my other earlier point in in i think i it the time i thin tat the jack pot in finding the regulatory an fire man er company that can having a right to the ta but in obviously as times told in a being a little bit too close the son and e burning i ay ism at this point i think that we can point out that there will be a fall back defense because the fence that job did not know what was going on is out is obviously lie that the idea that job's not involves in any way with his sons businesses is obviously lie all allthese things are clearly lies organon gets the final the final defense hers can be job of course her did he had to hunter was derelict hunter was a beautiful boy going through a rough time a wonderful artist in his soul who is stopping his a brother's widow among other women well doing crap and trafficking and all that a wonderful and and job loves his because he loves family job's a family men there is one final obstacle t at to fend to and that was the fact that he was ignoring a for you old girl who actually is genetically his granddaughter is a he's ignoring her and now they have decided that the real reason he was ignoring her is cause he loves his family too much too much that is also why you ignore members of your family you love them too much according to envy see news in recent weeks president jo bison realized his silence was no longer tennabal that it was time for him to publicly recognized his for yer old granddaughter caught up in a bitter child supportcases involving his son hunter people familiar with matter said u before he could do he wanted to take one final step getting the green light from his son which he received last week one for said and on fridge bison finally spoke out about his seventh grandchild to him for years he would not much as acknowledge in public now the president wants to meet little many one robot's of arkenton and spell the notion that he was ignoring a vulnerable member of the bid family tree tat is that the root of his political identity according tote people familiar with matter he wants to mother ye when up he is in a meat navy one a proximately the time that he visits palestine oho or the border a those the the same trip probably he he sin what was palestine visit the trained agreement member's gan do that and never habit yet navy one the chest to me a frequent white house based never family dramas typically play out in private the rarely when the first nations for families involved the president was wrapped himself in family throughout his queer is now in an improbable twist having to explain why he publicly ghosted a young girl who as as much as grandchild any of the others whose high school graduations he attends or who playfully call him pop publicly claiming navy one is a member of his family may all fer biding measure of peace politically however it also serves to blinds a jeep line of a taunt does not not does not it is obvious that he was ignoring his granddaughter because he does not care about that granddaughter at isn't car about the granddaughter because hunter clears the checks for him the white house to cline to comment on any of the family development including whether bison wants to met his granddaughter in person instead a white house had referred the to fridge statement a called the issue a private family matter that is weird that is private family matter i gan i love that there ow claiming privacy no one knows any of bisons other grand children other than navy ones specifically because he does not ignore and of is other grand children its not a story jobidon is a bad man the very vulnerable candidate republicans have an opportunity to run against that vulnerable candidate an it is particularly true because i am not sold on the idea that the economy is in solid state i know that everybody in the media are already turning eagerly the idea that the economy is going to be just long and there will be no recession i have some doubts give that whwellse has doubts as it turns out the fitch credit rating service remember by comics it is amazing by comic by comic means that done fitch ratings is now down grated the us governments credit rating weeks after president bison and congressional republicans came to the brink of the historic befall warning about the growing debtburden and political dysfunction in washington well one way to solve the get burton is to is to stop spending seven trillion dollars a year but the bide wite has long now fitch just got a wrong that is probably what it is fitch got a wrong now you mind you that when mood's down grated israel credit a few weeks ago in the aftermath of judicial reform in israel the entire media sighted this is evidence that israel economyesabout the collapse it as not yet collapsed when fitch downgrades america credit rating because we are spending wlychto much money and we will never catch up then it must be that fitch is wrong here is hard burnsteen on the white house counsel the economic advisers when turbo era ta told cell do you adoration toaaaoaan a a tereaaraaer far i you real good toerag stanooar peoplaao r than to o and a bear for ma well the there is only one problem of this which is that america owes a we a to much money and that is just a reality and nobody is going to take this on at all the fact is again because we have jack top our interstates that means that the interest payment that we are taking on our new debt is going to be extraordinarily hon the amount of money were gan have to dedicate to paying off olive our creditors for decades to come is extraordinary net interest is going to reach seven hundred forty five billion dollars in the twenty twenty four fiscal year that it is three quarters of all discretionary spending excluding defense in the united states that just the interest on our debt and it is only going to get larger again the fact is that as a share of g d p the projection of yours that is a share of grows domesticcrodict continues to rise absolutely astonishingly and dramatically which is one reason why you are string to see credit downgratesthat is con continues long as the program of the united states is to spend more and more and more money the bid administration their plan is denial an the strategy of the bind administration is to pretend that that does not matter as always gait yelling proud feat she she says that done it is puzzling to get this credit down grate anta this administration deeply cares about fiscal responsibility which is a strange because people who care but fiscal responsibility do not spend seven trillion dollars the year the lonkerterm the united statremainsthe worlds largest most dynamic an most inifativ economy with hi strongesfinantial sister in the world it is division is pestling an lihtedthe economic strength wit my in the united states i strongly disease with fitiostisition and i belief id entirely unwarranted fiscal responabilityis priority for praised inion in me earlier this year the praised inbeing get limit legislation theincluded oritrilion dollars in deficit reduction is police would also inpruvetiscal outlook by refusing define by to poinsixtrilion dollars fie neaten years of at right there gong to reduce the deposit guys by that by by that they mean that they are going to supposedly spend less many over what we actually are paying then they did previously not there can reduce at that that is not a thing that is going to happen by the way the the economy's still on tender hooks here because as the walstergunal points out earnings season is still coming we are on to find out nor how the earnings of these companies are on to do and will e he that am pass the stop market while stocks of climb corner profits o fallen according to waster journal companies in the asci five hundred are set to log at roughly seven per cent year over yours decline in earnings for the second quarter which again it is hard to see how these stock market keeps increasing while earnings are going down we are also going to see the jobs market that is cooling pretty rapidly youmust employers added about two hundred thousand cousin tune that's the smallest monthly payroll gain since late twenty twenty the sultan planet report is coming out this fridge wage growth has slowed as well and we are seeing your in your job opening again what what goes up must come down the economy went up wade too fast an arms of just the heat and i it is going to come down a i i i have very little faith that the bide ministration has somehow avoided the pitfalls of reality o say time for a quick thing i and then we will do a few things that i hate things at that i to day i enjoy when people who do not have leverage sometimes believe they have leverage it is kind of funny for example race's idler is not actress now there are many many many actresses every berestot in in lost evangelists is not actress race's idler is an actress who is on roadway there are many many many people who try for roadway and where quite talented it turns out in country three or forty million people that re lot of talented people who are actors actresses singers but race's idler believes that the has leverage oven thou again no one brutally in hollywood no one has the capacity to open a move any more does no one does then the number of stars were can open a move in america that is down to basically crissprat no one o but tom crews crispate that is the tireless you knows not on realist as race's ogler recall's juggler however part the after strike and she says that do caught she she essentially promotes the labor they of value when it comes to acting here a ya this is this is not going to be how this this labor strike gat solved o a a you i to a a a w at r o i well the you can negosha than your contract but dit you are not i noticed what she saying there is that because she is standing there i disobey dress she should get paid for every hour that so white and the non that let ten so white and the non dwarf dwarfs o various divers backgrounds in sexual plantations for every hour that is that in the badness for hers that's con to get streamed for two hours it is not it is ton can be amazing but even put that aside that is not how market's war that did she take the actual risk is she in putting the capital into the making of that film ere e she getting paid a salary in order to do that film a pretty lucrative salary i would imagine she could negotiate for a point right there the actress have done that past on very rich doing that do she have the market power to do that the answers of course nothings o go down thestreet an and hire somebody else a good luck to her in her in her leverage play that is not how business work a time for a couple of things at that i hate there is some people today who are laughing and celebrating at the separation between just intrude and his wife first all done know that you was married to lady but in any case just in trust that is bablonbyjoe by the was credits of balm in any case just in trust who is for sure not fell castor son in any case we and his wife soppy said to wednesday they have separated after eighteen years of marriage the way that they announce this is on their respective instrogram accounts which was thewy the most honorable people do this thing when you have three kids s you god your instrogram accounts and the you let the world know the youon't each other any more soppy and i would to share the fact after many meaningful and difficult conversations we have made the decision to separate justintrudo said on instrogram then they both asked for privacy a supper statement from the couple said they have signed a legal separation agreement they remain of close family and soppy an the prim minister our focus on raising this kids in a safe loving and collaborative en environment both parent will be a constant presence in their children lives and canadians can expect to often see the family together ism sure the canadians will be absolutely thrilled they have two boys fifteen and nine and fourteenyourl daughter congratulations to them on no helping to completely script their kids life even worse than it is screwed up being public figures the two met in tune twill not two thousand three to charity gala just in trudoand his hear said they chatted and flirted for much of the evening that they went on a dinner date and the he said i felt to giddy sense that soppy ad be the last woman i ever dated and at lasted until intelligent they were married in motion in made two thousand five she apparently worked is a t g host hold can answer tandem en correspondent in caber she said in march two thousand fifteen i can tell you headway no marriage is easy ism almost kind of proud of the fact that we have had hardship because we want off entity we want truth i tithe reason i put the some things i hate is because again the behind of no one shoulder revel in somebody ease's divorce when the kids because it is screws up kids incredibly badly the kind of soft peddling of the effects of divorce on children in our society is astonishing and what is amazing is that it is become wrote if you a to the the late nineteen seventies before no fault divorce became a a sort of common place aspect of america life and you watch a move crater verses ramen which rocks about effects of divorce on children divorce is devastating kids it is devastating it rocks the world that destroys the world it it it destroys whatever feeling of safety they have in predictability they have it takes one of their parents out of the house and it is terrific the fact that these people on married for eighteen years of society to divorce while their kids our still the youngest is nine that is it that is a disaster aria it really really is and this is why you soft barring they're their reasons to divorce abuse she dang other the there real reasons divorce but if none of that is happening sous people i do not feel living with yo any more ah you are you are doing the wrong thing you are kids come first that is that is really quite bad o can a couple more things i the to apparently me cliff who is a former florin star who as now become some sort of social media star she is giving marital advice have a general rule i do not take marriage advice from people who have stopped half the human population just tat just a general rule and ism she here heres me a cliff giving marital advice she is also by the way a rabbit anti sit in hear ego o were comparing tats pay girl does not know that i am tom brandy at this game married at eighteen divorce at twenty one second marriage married at twenty five divorce a twenty eight thirty gage met engaged at twenty nine ended it at thirty but i kept the ring ism still keeping tom brandy on his toes we should not be afraid to leave these men we are not stuck with these people marriage its not a sanctimonious thing is it's paper work it is something it is it is it is a commitment you make to some one but if you feel you are not getting anything from that commitment and you are trying you got a go you have got a go you have to go i know it is difficult to fell out paper work and to make appointments into do all of these things but this is your talking life do you want to be stuck with some one it i period that is terrible marital advice also it is not what the word sanctimonious means in in the words of manupotinkin i do not think that word means what what you think it means i think what choose going for was there is no sanctity to marriage which is a hell of a statement considering that literally it is the most sanctified institution it is the institution with the most most sanctity in human history but to hubris just piece papers have a question why some a peace paper at all i get getting marital advice from a lady who just regal list of her marriages this is somebody given you financial advice after going bankrupt t eight times well paying off your days is thentleme you half to do i m you sedan documents hang their spot to pafrudets not there is bankrupt white white committing two paying off your debts man meanness to be of paper you nosh got quart and clear bankrupt see what is the problem it'll ka gentleman stay far far away from this human because this is not a person that you want to be in relationship with i silo ya it just means it into commitment a commitment i can violate whenever i please and leave which is not what we call a commitment is genius level stuff there from again a a wise wise human ill get final thing that i hate to a this one is actually quite important we now have actual open evidencethat the biding white house ask face book to degrade the traffic of daily wire my company according to just the news an john solomon the memos suggest that the button white house inquired in meetings with casebook executives asking whether casebook could tweet to angry them to show case stories from the york times an hamster journal over content posted by look polarizing conserve to journalists and commentators in early twenty twenty one the memos reviewed by just the news chronic a series of meetings between the whorehouse signal direct or rob clarity and executives from face book now known as betta in spring two thousand twenty one as the first questions about the efficacy and safety of the covinineteen valine began surging on social medium the memos delivered recently undersipinuts the houshuti sherry committed make clear the white house was actively interacting with far book and sometimes pressuring the social made gift to moderate contents in a way that would encourage more america to get inoculations on aril fourteen two thousand twenty one for instance the white house's clarity asked face book whether it could promote than york times and hamster journal over the daily wire flirty ask casebook and please quit if you re to change to the algorithm s that people were more likely to see n york times hamster journal any authoritative new source over daily wire mommy lar an pulverizing people you wouldn't have a mechanism to check e mature i pact daily wire of course we are we are a sight that filed a landmark walnut challenging the she van at mandate under hoiden a we are the only major company in the united states on the right to actually file a lawsuit against the she of ax mantel while other major media america companies on the right were actively forcing their police to get the shot we were suing the federal government to stop it we are not afraid to sue the federal government again we are not afraid to sue the bison white house in erstwhile there my be criminal violations right here clarity is cited in the notes is t asking the question come candidly there is not a lot of trusted face book and the baton whorehouse want to know whether the platform was foot finding things tat are effective that you are not doing to combat resistance to valines in terms of interventions know the there are groups that are hotspots admen have to approve post if violating consol prove gives the roup of strike ism uncovering new examples on comments public figures on comments might be contributing more the notes quote the casebook executives as saying tope we are absolutely pleased to look into the effects on our business of the bison white house engaging in absolute first o men in violation there is no questions the first men violation it is as simple as that it is a first man violation because the federal government cannot force or even pressure a private company into censoring information that is a first amendment violation pretty clearly and as my friend and way or lictor says it is a criminal violation government officials were tempting to use government powers suppress the civil rights of america citizens me that that is right maybe there will be a criminal incitement here maybe there should be certainly we are examining all of our legal options of this plant we have no hesitancy whatsoever about going about the going at the widen in white house again we did before will do it again it casts us millions of collars to got for the oh of act mandate we helped overturn the thing and prevent eighty million america from having to take the shot if indent want to take it we are perfectly happy to do the exactingthing with the bid an white house right now to stop them from ever violating the civil rights of america by pressuring face book and and other social media companies again and by the way we have looked at the traffic on our website and whether it declines in the aftermath of this conversation suffice it to say evidence we will be presented this is it is an astonishing story it truly is all ready coming up we are going to be joined by treat horn to discuss proline apologies and

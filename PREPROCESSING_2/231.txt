and every morning he wakes up it makes himself breakfast puts son videos of the to day show forbad before the earth was destroyed just to make the morning seem normal one o the sports fans on our staff mat was saying the other day that that it is exactly what it is to day watching the constant replays of old sports on television he is watch the twenty eighteen stably cop the ante a finals came seven for twenty thirteen and old bankers game for nineteen seventy eight the masters last year the tag woods on all that goy if om back when life was normal and sports was part of it pat of the throw of my we jordan documentary the last dance was it was not just sports but a prime time sundae night sports of ten did you go forward to and u watch knowing other fans for watching and talk about an sher means just the world used to be hes o guises to wite about the college fora along cur can spencer sober this thing that i love about the lack of sports in our world to day he is a guys o normally spend over fifty hours a week on a slow week watching games and thinking about sports who these days hungry men rating in empty kitchen pantry for any scrap of food i resorted to watching old college games the they seen before and live cream baseball in the middle the night the german okay bundislee o sturdy morning the choice bis was between bundisliga and a wormhole the america tail gate game where people throw sand bags at a a a a wooden plank that is mason here is spencer expending what he is come to i yesterday put on for the dictation of my kids in their larger education rocky steamboat verses mot who man randy savage at restelvaneous three and its largely considered the greatest resting match of all time an i realize that since some homeschooling my cad they had to see the important classics of my culture the cannon the cannon ye now mad it really were joking boat were not canonically here's a lot of controversy about what is in the cannon wrestling was no one disputes this speech his watching way for games under rock town sometimes he says he saw this action might be better for him in some way to about fewer hours despots maybe maybe but it also makes me realize that the things i fill them with are much better there is a lot empty the is a like there is there is a lot o empty space out there man there is a lot o empty face in life and when somebody is says you do not well now you can nan you could fill it with something really meaning full will you or or is that even an option i think there is only much meeting you can packing to the hours of a week i think there is only much productivity within one person i think that something by the way this is sports me to confront anyway the i say these guys rout about sports doing these spotless months it is called what wort sports the tone of it is peoplewho living tens surrounded by rebel after a war remembering what it was to live in houses looking back on their old lives which only now they appreciate for what they were the as say starts this way i remember there were expensive commercials i definably remember expensive commercials being a part of at sports i only notice this when sports on replay happen the ad for replay games or cheap very sad om generators carbarn to boot tattoo get for things that should not be tactical carriers and hearing ans o you remember how back when there were words each person had a list often they strongly preferred to win if the portend trail blazers and ideas grisly squared off you and i would be a little bit hacker about life if the go is lings for the teem that one wall is that all about y the things they miss filly spans doing things that were not normal for anybody but pills fans spreadsheets of sport statistics for each game which results them went into a spread chest for the whole season wins then went into a historical archive spread sheet watching a for our game and walking away with one gift worthy moment they write fell aversion of sitting for gold with version in which the dirt itself was valuable o uncle thing i remember about sports is watching people run fast in one direction it was fund to watch some one do this when unimpeded such as when you sain bolt walked into a mall in church shoes or whatever in rain as fast as the fast as an a fill player ever had but it was ten times this fun when some one was able to run really far while other people were trying to stop that person from running far also for watching big people try to stop fast people from running they write sports vital chemistry labs designed to run for hours sons and centuries along the way producing countless things nobody could have predicted from the onset a cool other world we space place would people could completely depress course for several hours and sometimes come to space madness long the way one things went hay wire you remember that part a part was a pall of thirteen e when your team starting safety when out with an injury and they had to figure out how to play with tend to fenders a won't guy who should have been going to law school instead of covering the other to best receiver that part was a problem but the fun one o fall these problems very much belong to some one else despite us getting to invest feelings and whether they solve these problems or not carrying about whether i mediocre general manager could finally figure out hat to sports pledges this was kind of politics but in a fake world in which we did not have to acknowledge politics can kill us that was nice is all passage in the essay where sensor reminiscence about the last live gave he went to it'll li sou and lesson in new organs they got oysters for the game and met a friend ad restaurant the next day to eat and talk football for hours he writes do you hear all the beats of an impossible world playing there i do i feel every little ping of a world that have only miss for forty five days of this point li cactus needles just pressing into the skin of a hovering hand mason some at all up neatly with this for me the thing that mattered most about sports is how they by design did not matter we built industrial complex is around them but at hart they were about discovering which side had earned the right to shout the cooler obscenities on any given day and then the following day we would rediscovered but a day in our program everybody who is

i dot e gala bit wall we'll doit a boy to gala a sea that is tit o the so as not to being a basket of gan as also about playing basketball and what it can mean to you and not incidentally all the trophies that you collect long way of yer serious about the game from the get e big of the trophy of course some trophies do not age very well get old enough in at some point the congested to look dusty aging matter what of our producers nancy unlike a doctor friend of hers o what about a basketball all about this when i met up with my friend many to talk about basketball she was having some trouble with her trophies she just moved to a new apartment and her new place was small small that a bunch of high shool trophies would just dominate any room they were in she had the trophies in a box in e living room and we sat on the floor pulling out fake silver statuette of girls an coolies reaching ever upward hopeful and fit liken sortie at propaganda posters i to a see feeling really tough walking how with something ass big especially to hold i li share yo gat that baby by the base then she found one that was not the others sort of hard to understand actually it picture this a thick slice of wood sanded and shacked and mounted with a miniature room and backboard and then leaping across the front a stick figure made of roofing nails going in for a slam dunk marry identified this as her nineteen seventy eight girls of our sit team trophy from cardinal dogcart high school and the girls she said had not been pleased with a trophy at all if ugly is not ye it is truly if we were all really unhappy we wanted w a relational a the yes i i we would rather have had the the also ugly but much more acceptable old version of trophies than o an i o armies was sure i mean if your thirteen year old girl you art ye walking o tat you a a ran that is a truthyou an something that goes up high in the sky not something it is a slice of a tray i a a slice id a tree with a man stick figures order together ye doing the one thing that you will never be able to do dunk what was that was that something that your discuss oh yet i mean we and we also thought that that was the only reason we would never being be luckily for us we all thou well we are we are really some of the best players on the face of the earth when your sixteen year old girl was showing in i at a tough catholic lead school you sink ye we enough ism just as good as marine cheeksand the doctor would to play with me and a doctor ja am and you know we we could attribute our lack of success in the evil to the fact that we were girls soon to be women who would never dong and that is all that was be nus from it many handed me the wood seized trophy and when i reached to touch the stick figure i realized that one of its feet was on a hit i could actually make it go in for at the dunk once i discover this it was impossible not to do i over and over and over the trophy was completely hypnotizing a disturbing artifact from an artistic period best for got that that that the art of the late seventy show know e specially in catholic em religion text books and churches and stuff was ugly her near there was even at a wanna that late sevendays alike a ism afraid have been influence by it its of little in drawings that are just the little bit of on purpose you do not a men an the on purposeless of it is just all ouabrigt right you can always your cats even on playing in the back as a kid many played basket mostly with her older brother dance the two of them roomed around the city together lookipick up games whenever they could all summer every week and even at night because the court down the street had lights it was a way to get out of the house to escape the chaos of eleven kids in a working class iris family an a two small house on the edge of north's philadelphia basketball was a place of clear rules and gestures that always made sense and home was a place where you could get hit for no reason or find yourself still hungry at the end of a meal many remember being hungry a lot growing up a fact always cheerfully denied by the nuns at school the message was em you could not be hungry because your parents for saints em and they especially directed it to our family into all the other families the had u a lot of kids in them that our parents were saints was they work hard to provide for us i thought that i was just extraordinarily em greedy that that i would want a you do not eat when i was hungry i think that the playing baseball was away to say if i could use my body in this way that u got me stars an attention and a certain amount of prestige than then then my body was cain away even though it was men i was way too skinny when i was kid em and it was cause for concern for the schooner couple times and playing baseball was away to say you are not you not could have herald damage from being mail nurse she just can have these other miner molters pro another nothing about basketballs tat she many bought the family a rim and a basket ball for the back yard when she was only seven or eight using her first communion money sixty five bucks and five dollar increments from every one in her huge family the only equipment she really needed and could never afford we good shoes she always had those supermarket check out line shoes with ha hard plastic souls that were completely embarrassing of course but also had no inability she would be running down the court and go sliding and be called for travelling whole year she got up the courage to ask a girl down the block for her old chose her hang was can and e she had really nice bate a bullets big tops white and i wanted her sneakers and cause i knew she was getting new ones and in our neighborhood there is the practice of throwing your old sneakers up over the telephone wires when you are done with them and most of them were hardly worn out at all i mean not it the mean they thought of them you could see t hat there was tread missing but it is not you had ripped through the top of them and it'd asked her for them and she said dead that she would given to me when she got her new ones and m and it was i thought that it was a little bit were that i would ask somebody for their we shoes but we had other clothes that were used from other people and she was tough and she cat in had this she seemed she be the kind of person that could keep something that to her and and would know what it meant an and she did she never told anybody except of course the most i portent person that she should not have told her mother and her mother got m really upset and told her that she could not given to me and there they were hanging up on the telephone wire my sneakers and am sure that her mum did that because she was afraid that if i came home with the pair u sneakers that it would be in sulking to my mother ism sure that they all had this understanding up themselves you now you do not insult some one ease's you do not insult one of your peers by giving their kids here crappy shoes even though they are better than the crappy shoes that you brought for them but they were always really beautiful sneaker sang up on the one's and her is no way to get them no way at all they just floated up there and hon i think that is when i decided that em platonic idealism was true there really was a perfect thing ti ever experience at least all i played in that catholic league and only i could see them for what they were they only a worn out tread i saw a season of unforeseen high statistics we told for two hours about basket ball and we kept returning to the dunk and the cruelty of the dunk on that would sliced trophy i dunk by a stick figure made out nails driving home there eighteen year old sense of frustration they could be the best ball handlers the best cards and it did not matter worth a dam because they could not dunk all of that captured for ever in the last trophy most of them would ever receive i think it was really kind of thoughtless and the way that thoughtless things can sometimes t have a really nasty edge to them no one and we had a woman on our team who was six three and she could not dunk the ball you do not mean it was there was no there was no one that we knew who could dunk the ball not not a single woman that we knew and we knew some tall women we knew women who were in college i mean he's that i have a dream i recurring dream that i dunt the ball e what were the circumstances i was on the base line i i i made it was the same i was in the same position a time and it was not the kinds of dunks that you seen real life that even the best players do this was a spectacular don't because i did not just get my hands up over the rim i sailed over the rim with my feet and got above the basket and just slam the ball down to the thing i was my whole body was a most tor i to it stay in on small him very come mi talking with nacyaptake coming out e kit is not created sacker invents a way to be a star that is in a minute chico up a grade wen our programmed continues to smack li my glass to days programmed time out and is kind of in presented moment when sports as been put on paws when has that ever happened we have favored story om back before the locked you to fill on the void the sports void we have arrived at at three of our programmed at three there is a cannot play i get sos far as i show we have done football basketball it is turn to saker this is from dance ala con executive produce your on hose to radio imbalance and t'sabout is dad growing up in peru angel's tad reata wed sack a round the neighborhood all the kids did but is never anything special was certain tat he was never thought of his being a battle but he was thought of from a young age was being beyond unusually bright when have gone back e on i was introduces all as is were dato son and then ta sort a lid lictor you know your at was so your at as smart when he was a kid he won this om ye just fourteen he won this national quit show for kids on to an know a flew from the city where he lived in flutilema o he as only id from the provinces as who was a finalist only kid from public school the front page of the newspaper his incredibly verbal kid left poetry in words great talker but again sacker there is two things that happen when you are not one of the better players you they butcher in got you known to be a got keeper am may be they might make you ref but that is ouzo really low ye abut my dad turned out around and was not gold or refund ism sure he played ism ism not saingthat he did not play but but he started calling the neighborhood games weber he was calling the games to ti he have beer he had a my microphone and a little speaker he can make his voice louder and yet he be have only that yet yet and and busily his taking equipment down and he is announcing kids actual games yes has their play yes i kids knows ye kids his neighborhood i just imagine o if i were a kid playing in that game to have somebody calling the game and i could hear them cawing the game is out of doing it would make hear competitive you an mat makes it much more a absolutely my pick my picture of it is how glamorous kinin me suddenly it is their game is elevated and it is not just the neighborhood game now it is look this s just were on the radio which is just that is the same they do for the world cup h a a ta danielstad would also make up games the whole professional games all the players both sides all the

six holding gloves win the gardens packed the crowds going wild morizzis incredibly fast and beautiful in the ring watching her you understand what it means to be a smart fighter she is calculated that woman she is fighting is taller than she is with longer arms some moritza duck down low and jabs up to the body shooting where she lands her ponchence to the ribs then to the chest and when her opponent can barely catch her breath merit is up giving her a fierce combination to the face and head et goes the gas the ephebe it was little of the body oh other to the old the other one other one

prow but there does not seem to be any way she could make a living at boxing she is only one hundred six pounds they do not even have a name for her weight class if she went prow no one knows if any women were good enough to matcher as it is there are only two amateur women at her level in all her title matches she is always been put up against these same two opponents over and over and she is beat them every time in ten years there may be enough women that marital would be able to make a career of it but she is already in her thirties she says she has to be realistic about the future i

stands last year melton signed her up for the metros tournament without telling her on the night of the fight he called her from ringside and told her they were holding up the match for her moritza got in her car and drove from queens to brooklet while melton lied to the judges about moritza being stuck in traffic she arrived beat her opponent and three rounds flat but was disgusted with herself for fighting when she was trying to re tire that she left without even collecting her trophy but being back in the game felt too good and after that wind she just could not bring herself to walk away despite her reservations she went on to fight in the nineteen ninety seven new york gloves and of course one we e and february just after moritza missus the deadline for the nineteen ninety eight golden gloves i go to million's him to see her fight even though these days moritza is and there much any more melton has promised me that moritza will spar with a new girl he is training we wait and wait and now marital an hour passes when she finally shows she looks worn out and tired she is not dress to box and she says she is got the flue she is not in a fight rid away everyone starts pushing her s is la a ai a the with me wat he need everything nap then she says she did not bring her shoes she does not have any of her gear melton points to some shoes lying in the corner says there her

stiff at first then she starts to relax she is ducking down dancing around the ring and in the last ten seconds of the fight she has a surge of energy she is punching hard moving fast throwing none stop combinations a a and afterwards she is pumped up with a renal and setting laughing with melton in the guises in the him she says she will be back to spar and train every week and even though she is missed the deadline for this years golden gloves she swears she will take the gloves next year stake tune for nineteen ninety nine she says stay tunes but morizza does not show it million's the

donate trump calls on the republican national committee to cancel all future go pe debates where dona wants as finally comes out swinging against trump and called red pilled influences our telling young men not to get married we examined whether they are right i venter o this is teventferro show the bmenshpir shows ponder by expressive veins tug about them every single show why haven't you gotten a vepaniet at express we plan right out expressupiansicom flesh men already folk president trump is basically now to clearing the primaries over and look if you look at the national pulling dato right now he is up by a long shot on the rest of the field if you compare this to sate twenty sixteen at this point in the twenty sixteen races trump play out may be ten to twelve points on the rest of the field at this point trump is up by virtually all o the pulling about forty points over the rest of the field the latest e come is you go pull for example has trumpet fifty three per cent to sent said fourteen and everybody else well below ten the on with poll before that has trump it fifty five to wants at seventeen everybody else well below ten however this is not a national primary when you look at iota for example trumps lead it search to drink a little bit not that he is not in the lead but it is closer to thirty points then to forty points when you move on to new samphire his lead again is closer to thirty points than it is to forty points at least fifth at least forty five or fifty per cent of the republican bates in these primaries does not want oral trump or at the very least is time my voting already about people ware not dona trump and there is a solid number people who dona trump but would be open to others this is what the pulling is showing right now shall trump would two cancel all future debates because he says the we can to train our fire on bison now that is ken man ironic came coming from president trump whose train most of his fire at this point on various prosecutors going after him or on rod to cantus he is not trained an enormous amounts fire on president biding to this point however trying to end the primaries early is obviously in trumps best interest whether the irons he goes along with anything that is another question according to media yesterday the trump campaign his now ask the grandee to put an end to any further primary debates following a second debate the former president dona trump shift a note trump senior advise our crista seven was sent true the trump press office said to night's who pedate was is boring an inconsequential is the first lobate nothing tat was see will change the dynamics of the primary contest being dominated by present end trump president trump has e forty or fifty point leading the primary election and a ten point lead over providing the general electrodes that is going to one pull we take you that pull a couple of days go there two supper polls have come out since then one with biding up one one with biding up five this to suggest that in the real clapotics palling average for example trump is up ten is not right in the average basically he and and biding or running within margin of ever the iron see should immediately put an end to any further primary debates we can train our fire on crooked joining and quit wasting time and money that could be going to a evicting biding from the white house now again one of the presence here is that the arguments that tum trump is going spent all that money on evicting bind from the white house ignores the fact that extraordinary mounts of the money that is port into trumps campaign has been spent on his legal bills and we will going forward we spent on his legal bills particularly if all of his assets are locked up in new york because of this fraud case meanwhile president trump is is doing the trump thing he did this u a w speech of the other day that was not to the u a s about w and do a stage craft e who called stage crafty girls call it fibbing president trump stacked the room apparently withe bunch of his own supporters many of whom ere not union members in fact there is one person carrying a skin theta at union members for star for trump who then admire to the rest the he was not in fact a union member and had basically ben handed the son according to the uchigardian wens oral trump gave a speech in michingan on wednesday seeking to capitalized on the u a w strike at lease two crowd members holding science and union members for trump and auto workers for trump turned out to be neither according to the troy news one individual in the crowd who held the scignthnts at union members for trumpet knowledge she was not a union member when a poached by reporter after the event another person with the sign the red auto workers for trump said he was not an auto worker when asked for an interview both people did not provide their names the paper said that between for and five hundred people attended the event it was it a none unionized automotive parts supplier and client feu even go to a unionized job he went a none union shop to do speech about how the u a w workers deserved more and he they are being screwed by president by again the general message the trump gave with regard to biding and electric vehicle mandates clothe rest a lot of that is true however again the manipulation of the stage craft is pretty wild is pretty wild well dona trumps lawyers meanwhile we say they are looking down the barrel of a real problem for dona trump with regard to his assets o people i think are not spending enough time and energy on the fraud ruling in new york the reason being again all these criminal indictments therein to go whichever way there going to go and everybody knows hat there politically motive of the fraud ruling is also politically motivated but the real world impacts that fraud ruling is devastating to president trump on a personal and a familial level president trumps lawyers apparently do not really know what to do be cause the judge in this case is obviously parson and obviously over the top the judge she fined trumps lawyers for making arguments he did not in that last ruling according to the never times trump could loose his grip on buildings including trump tower on fifth avenue the trumpenternational hotel looking overlooking central park and all the rest the judge coded with new york string general latria names and as a punishment the judge effectively revoked trumpslacences to operate all of those properties and it left much of his new york operation hanging in the balance trump is expected to appeal he is already sued just justice anger himself who is ben a therein in the side of the trump lawyers for more than year in wednesday hearing trumps layers pled for clarity asking justice an grow to explain exactly what the effect of his ruling would be and the judge refuse to say it is it is totally on clear what happens now it could spell the end of the trump organization it could the fort force to sell off of several properties it couldn't basely destroy trumps organization in new york more likely illegal experts is a period in which trump would be unable to operate his properties which would be handed quart appoint to chief executive such an arrangement would preserve trumps ownership while preventing him an his woods not sons from running the machinery of their umpire without permission from the sort which could be a problem depending on how much leverage he is taking out against buildings for example in order to fun his his legal enterprises an all these are obstacles to to trumps reelect again it is not the trump camp be baton he is certainly in is that a probability i that's not a probability i think that it is eat i would say a forty to forty five per cent shot that trump would beat jobidon in i general election given his performance in the last telethon given the fact that right now he is not the actual moline at until many democrats our focussing in on the failures of jobidon rather than how much they hate dona trump obviously jobidon is focussing in in tremendous fashion on trump and trump alone a he the only reason easily that he state in the race is because trump is denominate he believes that he is the only candidate that he can beat it is more of that in just one second first

going to work obviously but he has been far bell to sort of skate over the top he is dong what he wants to do an everybody else can in the scrum fighting each other well finally rondo mantis is extra training his fire on trump and this has been the sort of pattern when it comes to primaries with trump going all way back to twenty sixteen hoe go back to twenty sixteen what you will see is that ted crews an mark radio or under the weird assumption that donate trump support base would simply collapse at a certain point and then they would just walk into the nomination that obviously did not happen instead they unit up fighting each other to the end and then con basic state in to make sure the donate trump was the nominate by sticking up ten fifteen per cent of the vote in competitive primaries and dona trump waltz to the nomination despite the fact that the early states he is only whining thirty thirty five percent o to and well to day trump is a lot stronger thane was not twenty sixteen and he seen a sitting president before a huge per enter of was is absolutely addicted to president trump the love the guy and whoever is running against trump at a certain point here is going to have to stop wit this notion that trump is going to just fall off the road somewhere he is not someone on to have to take him on directly when the only person right now his position to do that is the who is number two in the race on to mantis and decants for all the slingshot arrows that he is taken is basically in the poles where he is been for the last six months he is his stuck in the fifteen to twenty five per cent rage he is in in a second place holding pattern and something has to change and finally desansis who has now done two separate debates with the rest of the with the rest of the second her republicans he is beginning to fight back because he is man an argument the argument basically isle i i i on the last to debates and the only other sold candidate and he only i who is running double digest even against trump in these primaries therein a consolidate to field do not consolidate feel round one candidate who has not even had to go through debate and who has a lot of blemishes on his record and said why not consolidate the field around two candidates and then let us battle it out and ten a trump wins trump winds by the way that that is what the the poles are showing the the the pop are showing that people believe that the dsansis one last tote for example we an an focus scrub came out yesterday and at in an focus group suggested that de senses was big wine o theater to es no the you o but lord who you think ti best during this debate all of you purger well christy case his this ton the feeder but it to tokens one two three for five six seventeight nine he one two three four five six pence from a swimming well escort as he can my the sans is cleared the fields when it came to t when when he came to this debate and and the poling did it support that same sort of notion five thirty eight did apple on the debate what they found is that thirty three percent of likely republican voters t o watch the debate said the basis performed the best only five per cent said that he performed the worst nick hailed came in second chin eighteen per cent rating as the strong estimator seven per cent rated her as the worst baron aswarm fifteen per cents at he did the best bat ten per cent all it hes of the worst along people love the vaglopuple hae date everybody ate chis crispy time got basely did not register people hated my pencil performance nobody understands my dug burial as on the state de basis is now making the case that he should have made a long time ago which is when it comes to winning the the general election ism your guy have have the proven track record in florid i have not lost to present bine before while dona trump has and downs true has to stop locking to bates is bout time for donate trump to actually debate me ans he is now calling for one on one's bate with trump directly here was de since mastery going a lot more aggressive with trump he is had a look to say about me on show met o really since twenty twenty two right before the mid term election he started out he started attacking me when i was a we all republicans work best to be united for red wat now he tried to attack me at has been doing at a lot let's one thing to do behind ta key board step up on stage an do it to my far o day for it ye use to say i was a great governor now be sin your saying the opposite let us have that tho scochit and it'll do it we can do one on on i was with it show last night let us do that and let us loot's get the america people wit choice that thedeser now is trumpet actually going to do that of course not trump is not when that and that that should raise some questions if trump is unable to debate on to mantis who is in excellent republican governor from florid and who is the second place finisher in in all of these poles right now and by the way who actually is a threat to him and i i know that everybody is righting off to mantis over all right now but the reality is that the basis has done an enormous amount of groundwork and i whale right now to basis is running by the lays he guess news post in the twenty and i what trump has a major lead but that's non the way the i carcass run there carcass and those carcass rely a lot on ground game there re lie a lot on endorsement i what is still very much in open question there is a world were to dances wins i and if if trump just keeps ignoring it i basis men it a certain join some he is getting have to take it to trump and basis s gin to have to be the got who does it because no one else in the field really is capable of doing it that big problem here is that when you are looking at consolidation the field trump once the field to consolidate to just him i there not are mature to do that considering again all of his vulnerabilities that we have dis cussed ranging from the fact that he is wildly unpopular with suburban women to the fact that he already lost to jordan the first time to the fact that he does not have the self control to actually meticulously attack jobidon's record and all the things we all know about dona trump those should be fair game for debate but consulting the field to two is necessary at the point if you actual want there to be any sort of race instead with munch of also ran for staying in the field and this is ridiculous if there were too serious candidates on the stage in that last debate ronosantis nick half everyone else on the stage is is is in terms of why they why they there they should not be there the vague romasuwammy is not rung for present he is running for senate from oho or he is running for a cabinet position under president trump or he is running for a new business in the media chis christy is running a pure revenge play he is he is a homicide bomber of politics he he committed the world's most famous political murder suicide new samphire against marcorugo basically an sharing the nomination of donate trump and apparently he wants to do the same thing again christy says ism not going to drop out why should i drop out the answer like drop out of h out got no shot of winning the presidential nomination why are you doing this stop it if it ale the to come down a new camp strand there's better than any one have in a run we it a right campaign in twenty sixteen how are you hinting the if the field tit going to be want out and if you are down e fore new camp shit with you drop out of the race give ever you fetch of wanting you assure that would not drop out a before that that el the go got a sit avens that whit could cell me to do but what i would also say t you is least what i see up the new hampshure is those trump it almost every poll well below forty person the unbelievable arrogant of people cries crista staying the race even if chis christyware join new samphire do you think christy christy goes on to even compete in south caroling who any of the other primaries the answer of course is no the answer is no this field needs to winnow and in needs to about fast if there is can be any one to change men there is no one is into challenge trump maybe the poles are exactly right nationally speaking and trumps blowsy the rest o the field maybe fine but if there is ten be any alternative the field has to wino again ism looking at that real cerpolitic pulling average and what your seeing that real corpolitic pulling average is that even in the national pulling trumps fifty three betters forty seven per cent of the republican base is not in love with trump but you have eighty three candidates including crispy at two and shot at three and pens et four and romasuamy at five and half at seven that field is going to have to window and window pretty quickly if anyone is going to challenge trump and again dis sansican have to get a lot more aggressive on the campaign trail against trump against trump among other people and just second we willet you join who is deeply relying onto trumps candidacy in or project him back to

a speech the entire speech was bahodonal trump is the scourge of the world and of course he has to run this campaign because if he is force to run on his record he loses she is going to run purely on the idea the dona trump is a threat ton democrat all thus now back in twenty twenty two some of us handcuff to this strata you be said while hobbit he is a bad president and his bazar speech in onto independent all flanked by you best marines in the background with a blood red background was absurd and again queasy terrifying and and yet and yet because trump was seen as such a as a threat by many sort o moderate voters the the result was that the democrat's over performed in twenty twenty two and s there going run that same place back again a here is join yesterday talk out o the mama

not a drum he is get a play can the goodness is is not have to play at it just is your authenticity in casting he is just a a walking anomatronic corpse as a pruners act is suggested he looks he is direct from the hall of residence at dinner land manlike pastry that is more life than jobidon is at this women again is that a rip on him not if the pitch is the guy on the other side of the isle is a crazy person who can destroy america foxy on this grab i know t that s crap but my making people then believe that here is jobidon going through all f this is tat distaste quoting man that mangoquo cheerio magical to join what a main metro bin have never heard yet that the longest word in the english language is numerals from microscopic soicalalecanconiosas what least it was until the speech it

a short period of time or in now at a deter in the course of this country in the world for the next six or seven decades you me every mare committed to preserve in our democracy our posters protections we carry us on in a again all this garbage but the case that he is make and is going to be and it always comes down this when is by versus trump who is less off putting and who's the person who is going to project solidity now when it comes to record trumps record is way more solid than bisons without a doubt when it comes to personality bid in poetically solid the good news is that is not alive any more your enough to worry about whether he solid or not because corpses generally art all that volatile in just the second we will get to the other flaws in gobidon's candidate see first when it comes to the air that you breathe it is a lot more polluted than you thing an much stigmatic outdoors if you live in lawsangelis and your lungs are turning black ism talking about

he is not thenomines that real prom one his big probes is the fact that he is as corrupt as the day is long the house yesterday commenced their impeachment inquiry si suggested beforehand that i do not only see the strategic need for an impeachment inquiry given the fact we are already on the re publican side looking into all if his corruption am not our how putting a stamp impeachment inquiry helps things other than if for boxes you in because you do not come to in impeachment a the an of the impeachment inquiry you exonerate the guy and the question is going to be whathyeu have enough votes even on the republicanize of the out for an actual impeachment that means holding together your caucus in really strong fashion which is kind of a problem since again the i preachment inquiry was launched without a vote in the house meaning the the the majority in the house the republican for who is not even there and that the fact is that that my earthy could not get enough publicans to vote on the dotted line with a and town m peaches angry to launch at that way which raise the question at whether he asking get enough are publicans to not for an actual in peaches which would be a giant fail if you launch an inquiry without coming to an actual i peaches you get nothing out of it the republicans did it anyway they launch the impeachment inquiry word people think that that was an attempt by maccarthy to stave off the right flank singles ism giving you guys what you want got the i peaches inquiry what you want for me a whatever whatever this is that yesterday they had a six hour hearing on impeachment it is not amazing for the republican party it they would presents any first and witnesses instead they heard some testimony from of a r tidy of of sort of different scholars including jonathan turkey forensic account in brusetobinski from a justest to parents had turned i lean cover the they knew going in the jonathan truly was was going to say that they have not the evidence to impeach bison yet the promise es the that is the headline coming out of the impeachment inquiry day on is that the republicans on witness said he cannot i each i bacon what you are right now here is jonathan truly yesterday this is the question of an impeachment inquiry it is not vote on articles of impeachment in fact i do not believe that the current evidence which support articles of impeachment that is something that an inquiry has to establish but also do believe than the house has passed the threshold for an impeachment inquiry into the conduct of president bide gas it is that first part that everybody is losing in on his truly saying we do not have the evidence eats to impeach but it is okay the their boring sac by relays in preachment inquiry would be appropriate you see came e rascal who sitting next to comer was leading the inquiry gens comer you see gaskin his democrat and shifting in his seat gleeful that truly said that there haven't of evidence to impeach right now well the eminence continues to emerge yesterday according to brightpart hunter bison apparently reference selling access too president job as the keys to my families only asset according to messages from hunter bin to i la back up released by the house ways means committed on wednesday the committee released in formation confirming even archer's testimony the hunter began travel the world selling less to the widen brand meaning jobidon hunter referred to access to jo as quoted the keys to quote my family only asset which is pretty strong language documents obtained by the committee confirm associates of the biding business had direct access the white house and then v pchobidn's advisers according the committed by n associates were told not to mention jo being involved white house logs many biding business associates visited the white house double times in addition after the iris launched its investigation into the bean family hunter ban apparently poult expected all of the stuff to go away when his can becomes president according to an meal between hunter bid and he see an en producer that the committee actually obtained again the producer has an meal from hunter saying he expected all the stuff to go away when his can became president that is not good an that there will be more evidence to emerge foreshore comer for his part he said we now have evidence that the chines government is sending direct payments to joins media family wile of course shastra we we knew that have you been able to get a fie what pacifically kill biding did to get pay w all these people who were paying the bisons for bout jobidon met with every sing one upupour told too the to even though he is li to the meter we old sitting there tat with any of e me met with all they were all in trouble they were all leading helping that this a if the you talk about the remain money the eucaine money they were being investigated for corruption in their home countries they may be help from job in china this was the chines government this was the chiles government the sending direct payments to jo bisons u immediate then and what they needed with hell navigating the geurocracy thing eliminating barriers to entry in our market then all that is true and more evidence he is going to drop here an it is not going to be good for join democrats for their part there junking on republicans yesterday that were suggesting the they got nothing there is no evidence all the rest of this ken stop but it does not matter because in the general america perception of job the idea that he is clean and pure and honorable no one thinks that the pulls show people think that job is crop mainly cause he is corrupt but here a democrats yesterday slaying let gonna had slag kings and queens go for it i to let us get it straight were sixty two hours away from shutting down the government of the united states of america and republicans are launching them preachment drive based on a long de bunks discredited li what a day we are having here is not it right i may less t to as a former director of emergency management i know at disaster one i see one i won to want think you to mister dead trump for calling in this hearing to day we fee the long on but little hand and mister dona true here is peter prance are all over this heroin in this sham in preachment dona trunk in preachment oh how many detachments we got to there oman investments we got for ow many providing your own rope donate trump is ray ism hes sick winning he is just rennin running away with it and that is why were here they cannot same dona trump they cannot take away the two in detachments and the fore figment but they can try to put some numbers on the board for jo bi but the rob is when you sling mog you got to have on and they just do not have anything mister chairman honestly that we can tiny wen man a shatter and we were plan a drinking am i will be drunk by now if the comings that is smoking gun we are even a dripping water pistol they would be presenting it to day but they have got nothing on jo bison come on if you all think there is much evidence wore here call de not on in preachment in peach em right now first moments that is not how an inquiry is can forms all on inquiry is but also guys go off you do not go off really continue to talk about this because it is very very good for jobidons opposition and just one second who gets the latest on the u ay o turns out that when you insensitive unions to strike they to strike more it is amazing how that worth first as you might know we are fans of our friends over at genusoll you enough to take my word for elephant rochford says i both eye hackney spots this subs as feeling both of them this seem is worth every penny fella is raving about the famous dark spot corrector from genuses you must have after once of record heat and commodity sun spots brownspots is coloration even red in plane patches all will disappear in fronts of your very eyes here is genusall's amazing guaranty you will we results on ta one or your money back not only as genus l in along tam partner the my families been using genuses itself a decade crazy fastersolvs it it really really works and that is the much of of genuses because again you are trying it completely risk free it about seventy present affright now take advantage of genuses most popular package you now includes that darkspot corrector plus the classic genuses bags and puffins treatment how well simple go to genus dot come slash of par o start looking years even decades younger tomorrow sago lies the dark and liver spots basin smugness under the are cross feet at genuses dot come slash a chipper that is genuses dot come slashburggon they on a making guarantee results on day one or e get your money back of enusell dot come slash shipper is a meanwhile again jobidon between his corrupt personality the fact that he is in a state of physical and mental decay an is bad policy he is a very vulnerable candidate the you ait u apparently is now threatening more strikes oh that that is that is great seeming the president showed up war their hat and now they hay we gem news let us strike similar an rest the economy the you ait you pledge to widen it strike on fridge barring significant progress in talks with the try car makers has the companies take steps to keep critical parts flowing to their dealerships parlor talks between the you at w and g m ford motor and wrestler parent sealant's continued a union official said wednsday nearly two weeks into a limited strike at all through out o makers he you a u official said the union listens by new strike target at ten a m fridge with walk outs to begin at noon unless bargainers make headway and negotiations for new for your contracts last went for you right u expanded that strike beyond three assembly plans to include a thirty eight part distribution centers owned by g m and sealant's the union spared for from wore walkup they said they are getting more concessions from ford but the widening of the strike why you think there doing that their doing that because the presidents of the united states literally showed up and walk the picket line with them wearing u a lo had that is why you end up with more strike if they caught a really really great sweet heart deal with all of these car companies and your car becomes wildly forespent give you now exactly who to blame his name rhymes with jobidon that is exactly wo to blame it turns out again that when the presidents of the united states in horses one side in a private lever action is very likely t thatside is going to be incentive us should take a harder line position not to come to the negotiating table and bargain it speaking of failures the you crane work continues to slog on according to the near times literally no one has gained ground this year all the booth sides of bunch ambitious offensive the front line has barely shifted after eighteen months ware a break through looks more difficult than ever again the front line new crane basically changed not at all from us went to there suppose to be a major you cranial offensive that was going to reverse russia gains in the don was and the crime region instead the map looks pretty much the same the spite nine months bloody fighting let than five hundred square miles of territory of change tan since the start of the year and and meanwhile jobiton has no offer him he is provide offer he says the zelenskys can do all the negotiating were just con keepshining checks that is not the way is your work i the within your work everunnos ha the opens were now i for year here wasting to be an negotiated settlement no one believes the drawings are pushing the ruffians all the way out of crime and although out of the combat there is been almost zero territorial change the last major territorial change what is in nonmember remember of last yer otherwise no territorial change whatsoever since the shut since the star of the year you can is get about a hundredand forty three square miles and rushes get about three hundred thirty one square miles these are not major amounts of territory and yet join has no plans dawn this for it is just going to continue ad in minimum which presumably is why some other democrats are starting look radio why is not anyone jumping in on the sky i me he is vulnerable on he ego seventy per cent of democrats do not want him to run again one of the people who is now delusional thinking about rung for

switch to day get yours a germ's razors add come meanwhile on the right a fascinating debate has broken out about the value of marriage it is whit is really interesting s that they are bunch people on the so called red pilled rigged who have now suggested that marriage is bad for men that men should not get married now the case that they are making is not the liberal feminist case that basely men are useless and terrible on woman's man a fishnets by school or anything that the case that they are making is that the stakes of marriage have been changed by things no fault divorce custody arrangements the is child support payments and a the rest fossil support the basely the legal regimen has made it not a bargain for men to get married now i agree with with the critique of all those postman in no fault divorce is a disaster area i think that the child custody arrangements that that basely always go to mom no matter what that is it that is a serious rob when you shift the intensive structure there is reason why the majority of divorce of the vast measures divorces are now initiated by women that that is not because in the past women wormwood wildly abused and today they are wildly liberated but that really is when you shift intensive structure and turns out that all the risk is now taken by men women are gun be the ones who actually active ate and push that divorce button however the red killed have taken it one step further and now there telling young men you should not get marred it is too dangerous to get married do not get married that foolish that is what sou let us let us go through some of these arguments because they become very popular on the right but start with pearl does for pearl dais is an anti feminist who has a become petty popular as old people label her sort of a female and relate t without the ad checkered past and the here is pearl dais talking about marriage the trad nondairy wire conservative when a saying that pearls just the demand groomer who lies about tat just boy is as on the negative never the positives and all the men complaining a just crime and one day he comes how and he fin tho that he why have called the police on him and told them that the first time they how o ten years ago he om he had caught an crater and the truth of the matter is when a man has told her they are not his kit a man has no way to have tiller and those canto be actually hit they are always her because the court give f the women custody ninety per cent of the time and red matter really the only not that of the money to fight it and the time i i aft the daily wire terms bowing not was om are if that is just cry baby they just are they just the cry they be we man who do not man of an want to i tho to et o the then thing betas tan that m demanding that the last tan an demand an women they three precisian for doing the to you go leman that mad see to tap o an take part in the the them that the criminate thegn them you the find to got that price you will not do it but an i have the thought too i tell i found a mulling girl tended the tame thing found a crisis girl that ti the thin to a o to cha the g they happen an all over whether you want beeves to it happening i do not care about your new then i do not care about yo turn the happen everywhere o case the argument that you's man against it all these marital policies those that those are correct to arguments and nobody is disregarding the pain of men who have been wrong fully victimize under the circumstances where the intensify structure is completely start against them that is true however the benefits of marriage are still unbelievable it does matter for you marry to pretend that there is no difference between the person the acari that is happening with christian and museums and and to all the same that statistically untrue there things that you can do to mitigate against the risk of divorce and the person the you marry is the chief mitigation the truth is that n the jewfish community we always have a back up can in the sense that every marital contract is a preen up every marital contract s pin up radio y a jewfish a to be is a price up it guarantees at certain levels of spousal support for example if you if you give at get then it it it makes prior arrangements and all the rest but one that the throwing out to big with bath water is not the solution how about both he about we revise the system of law but also in the meantime you you need to find as plus and get married to her and if what are requires for you to to feel comfortable doing that is to shift away from the state mans steed law and toward a contract arrangement then then do that as well are we can have churches that is ponce or that sort of thing because the truth is that those are forcible contracts and court very often the custom precustofthe arrangements an all the rat s of that sort of thing i will not go through some the staffs with regard to the benefits of marigicts i think that it is also possible to exaggerate how bad things are for men as the mean there aren't really bad for men who end up divorced or that women are not divorce men and incredibly high rate over all or the women are initiating the vast majority of again i agree with many of the retires of current many law agree the lot of that stuff the problem is that when you take it far that you say that the solution for men is to not get married now what you have done is you have created a second order of fact we are unmarried men become actual menaces a the reality is that men channel there aggressive drives toward building for they channeled toward destroying and a system in which women are unmarried and men are unmarried that something that the left wants and if you acquires in that then you actually end up destroying t the very fundamental bases of society that allows for the growing and building of society beyond the left best principles mot men may it my answer to pearl is both an but yes g t married and also we should work to change those laws but by the way the way that we date has it hasn't a fact on how we get married who we get married to an when i dated my wife we went in knowing as we began to date that we were not we were not going to sleep together until we were married we knew for a fact then we were going to have long conversations about things the mattered and and this is by the way the the best available die a suggest that this is how you ended with a tangible durable marriage the last of very long time is it everybody has to be committed going in that value when you put values of the center of dating that buses does not mean that you are going to be impervious the possibility of divorce but it does mean the chance of divorce are really a lot lower a lot lower now do on i bump there i don't thing i am robing onbrole frankly but that there their bunch of other people who are making similar clans for example a brain artless was on whatever pod cast in and here he was talking bout marriage we you conferer a arena preen ups are regularly thrown out all the time the typically non forcible especially the longer marriage goes on the less likely they are to be enforced men can absolutely destroyed in marriage and in divorce financially when it comes to the kids women with a us toy and then also you to get the divorce the financial stop just going the turn getting all that in o if the if it is contest divorce and mid five figure six figures on on a turkeys and yo other pay for her turning to fifty per cent of marries and in divorce city percent of divorces are in ash by women in to per cent of shows college dedicated nine percent of chanciport payments go for men to a nine to seven present of among payments c men o you know you have no fault t o deform woman can seat on you she can so it h she get again lot of what he saying is true this stats on marriage are not completely drugged though those in just one second an the rip on on the divorce law is a good rip it is a fine rip and the answer is not for men to a word marriage the answers for men to find a good woman to get married to who's committed to value yes of course marriages a risk of course it is and that risk is dust proportionately born by men at this point that is true also but is the reward work the risk the answer in a huge majority of circumstances where both people are committed likes a have share christian values for example the is the risk is is worth it is is the basic principle and the these arguments are made not just by people i visit andretate has made the same sorts of of arguments here is drew take talking about men do not benefit for marriage y whin it is a fantastic incitement and i think an idealists tic world thus way would be i think the reason is no tapping to day as i do not think many men actually benefit from marriages or relationships any more and people are always going to hap to to require some degree of an entire i think that we set up the world now an a way where men are seen as worker droit there expected to go work all they come home clean off as well share the cleaning with the woman not have any not no meal prayer pared for not have any authority over the household and just and just be a worker droit and be a sad a i do not think that many people under an that men are intrinsic really wire to desire respects amongst our peers and in our environments this is why sees works hard because they get respect in their come i gate again i do not disagreed with much what you say but the solution very often with the red pill can a movement the diagnosis is correct and the solution is wrong than that that happens very very often in this sort of movement that the reason by the way that pearl and the rest of the redpoll movement think thewy they use because of arguments one that did ha person destiny makes with pearl in this particular claim men out earning man have a hard him respecting them man there way that is not true that is loan give hadn't to that day he explained why at at a time the women reported that they were expected to be in charge of the house duties that is the wecachop and the arak of a ropes that a modern woman actually curd that is all oudimated nowadays i went you have e was reputed ti we you a ta ti i a is much as is have don't do it a g t o do that that is the issues that at the one o o e operate for wat a an absolutely is i a o go get older and you menage a household an your own pearl you wills how king an orators when your working an that you come home a a a o bobble and nobody coliclyat and ye the a i have totally salaries of er divorce of courses t actors to break up home a i can live that a fill o o like to it e lie long friends from gratschool high school will doorman college and that hate each other for ever over bad dorm roommate en no light en a relationship that you of course ti the pelorus is perfectly help ti think i think tit hitting i a no a as been up duties in the households like on of the most important parts of a relationship because it is where you are spending most of ta o this way i say my will get try to say ism tan gone even dating still you live together cause it do you live together you will really know wit the other persons and dance is tor live it together you see what the household duties are than you get a feel for wat the relationship it destiny is saying here is totally crazy o gay the idea that you get divorced but see of case get divorce because you cannot split up who handles the dish washer is nuts and comparing marriage to roommates houserments yes because you don't expect to be roommates with your roommate for the rest of your life and have children with them generally speaking a marriage is not supposed to be a contractual arrangement that is purely about who shares household duties is pose you about building a housel it is that attitudes we divorce that is making the red pill true they sexancun a that is your version marriage than ism not in i agree that were my version marriage i would not be in the point that ism making is that that should not be anybody's version of marriage just the crown version version be anybody's version of divorce and win give you some starts the demonstrate did not all marriages are created equal not all predicates for marriage are the same brad welcomes who is a social science scholar on all this he has a book called get marriage and it is all about marriage and divorce than here are some of the facts in that there well substantiated by by the data the number one factor in predicting a high quality marriages perceive partner commandment if you believe that your partner is deeply committed to the marriage you will be deeply committed to the marriage which is one o the reasons why it really matters high date to really really matters iodate i agree that n a content for you picking up a girl in a bar and the you live together an the get married to her that is a very risky situation you put yourself in a situation that is very risky but that is not how have ever recommendeddating the is not aver how of recommended getting married it's all part of wholistic you of how male female relationships work if you just take marriage is an institution and you just throw it out there and however you date is supposed to be equivalent that of course is not group women who had ten church are fifty per cent less likely to divorce for examples when you heard pearl earlier talk about for ex have seen christian women divested muslin yes but the questions likelihood you can always find many any group who does acts wires eat the question is how often does that happen how you mitigate your risk as far as these staff that fifty per cent to marriage s and a divorce just about forty per cents right now of first marriage is in divorce which s weigh weighed to high tell down significantly since the nineteen eighties but again is not equivalent between groups college educated parents risk of divorce has fallen by about twenty five per cents since the nineteen seventies and here is a good stay almost ninety per cent of their children for college educated warrants are being raised in married largely intact families to day turns out that there is actually a formula to his successful marriage it tends to be conservative religious highly educated tho those would be the biggest the biggest things that are going to a fact whether you and up staying married or beth you mend a divorce by thewy another factor that ends up determining whetheryou stay married or and of divorce is again about the nature oath marriage do you have kids marriages with kids divorce far less often than marriages without kids in fact the divorce rate for couples with kids s about forty per cent lower then divorce rate for couples withoutkat which make cense be have less than vestment once yo have kids then actually a damages at another party for you to get divorced over the dish washer and then then then somebody else pays for your crimes at that point seventy seven per cents of college educated con sedative parents are still in the first marriage for seventy per cents of moderate and sixty right per cent of liberals and again then the number of newly divorce people for one thousand married magicians is to cline pretty maricetly since the eighties who twenty two point six in nineteen eighty it is thirteen point six to day in two thousand and twenty one as far as the notion that it is damaging financially for men yo get married notes it is damaging for many at divorce it is not damaging for mentor get married married men in their thirtisern about ninety five thousand dollars if they're to waiting there about six thy eight thousand dollars of there single thane about forty two thousand dollars the average marriage premium in household cossets is more than two hundred ninety thousand dollars for a stably married man again i think what peopleare actually arguing about over here to be fair to the red pill group i think whit their actually arguing about is divorce and the question is are you more likely to stay married or are you more likely to end up in a divorce situation and that is a a fair question depending on the process that you use for dating n the cultural milk in which you live in in the commeriyor island d orthodoxtirsh community not a lot divorce i very very load of worse rates why we because have on is religiously committed hes everyday goes into marriage believing it is a sacred bond that actually matters cause people do not date for sax people actually date looking for to the day when thy will hae kids together because every family in my neighborhood has four plus kids may go those are the preconditions but if the if the idea here is than you are your your basic binary is argue married or divorce divorce is is typically worse than never married and married is way better than both divorced and never married and yet to risk but is it a coinflip ionic quinflip i think it is eight it is e decision that you have to make as to what kind of person you misdate how you wish to date that person what kind of relationship you wish to builder how seriously you take that commandment in the first place do the laws need change absolutely need need to change their garbage i totally agree wit that it is easy for men to be victimized under the circumstances it is easy that yo should not enter the risk let us look at from the upsides in he downsides here is a chart from brad about opioid overdose debts by gender educational attainment and marital status and what you see is that among men if you are single never married what you see is that the pod overdose per one hundred dowsing age twenty five plus s twenty five for single never married men it is even hirer for divorce men and it is extremely low for married men really really low for married men and again that is that that is ore you in o be one o the people who has tivorsternot one of things you can know going in is you will never get divorced and then you have to measure the you marry a woman will not never and we cannot pretend that that divorceword falls hon you in from the heavens that is outright the person who is this i give dancing advice all the time my number one dating advice date for values date for values in the end that is the only thing that is going to remain o hate time for some things i things that i to day the senate has apparently now passed unanimously a dress code o

welcome to the hubermanlaponkans science scion space to i for i manner superman and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor robot malaria doctor robot malaria is a professor of psychitryan behavioral sciences at stamford university school of medicine he is both a medical doctor and m d and a researcher a p it his laboratory is famous for having discovered some of the key components allowing negro plasticity that is the nervous systems ability to change in response to experience in addition doctor malaria's research is considered central to the ten book knowledge about how reward systems in the brain are organized and function indeed doctor malaria's research over the last ten or fifteen years has merge what was once too desperate fields the first being the study of nauru plasticity again the nervous systems ability to change in response to experience and the other field being the field of dopamine as it relates to pleasure and addiction his laboratory is shown for instance that when we seek out particular forms of pleasure regardless of whether not the healthy for us that changes the way that our reward circuitry works and actually changes the way that dopamine is released and how it impacts the brain and his work has also informed how we seek out healthy pleasures including healthy food and social connection to day's discussion explores all of these topics and by the end of to day's discussion you will have a rich understanding of how nauru chemicals dopamine and ceretonan work in parallel to reenforce that is to increase the probability that we will engage in certain types of thinking and behaviors if you are somebody interested in negro plasticity that is how the nervous system can change in response to experience and are you are interested in reward systems what motivates us and what we are likely to pursue in the future given our choices of past and if you are interested in things social connection and empathy or lack thereof to day's discussion encompasses all of those topics it is worth mentioning that doctor malaria is a true luminary in all of the fields i just mentioned as well as several other fields in fact when you look out on the landscape of modern narrow science what you will discover is that a very large percentage of the top laboratory studying narrow plasticity and reward systems and on all stemmed from having trained in doctor malancra's laboratory it is a real honor and pleasure to be able to host him today and ism sure that our discussion is going to greatly enrich the way that you think about brain function narrow plasticity and reward before we begin eye to emphasassat this podcast is separate from my teaching an research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero coss to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is rock rock makes eye glasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality the company was found by two all america swimmers from stamford and everything about rock eye glasses and sunglasses were design with performance in mind have spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly rock understands those challenges in the biology the visual system such that they design sun glasses and eye glasses that always allow you to see with crystal clarity now initially rock eyeglasses and so glasses were designed for sports performance and as a consequence all of their glasses are designed to be very light weight end to not slip off your face if you get sweaty however the design of the glasses include some that are specifically for sport and others whose aesthetic really blows you to use them for sport as well as out to dinner or to work et camera and that is how i use them if you would to try rock eyeglasses and sun glasses you can go to rock dot cam that is a o k a dot cam and enter the code supermen to save twenty per cent off your first order again that is rock a o k a dot cam and enter the code superman at checkout to day's episode is also brought to us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods behaviors affect your health by giving you real time fee back on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor one of the most important factors impacting your immediate and long term health is the way that your body manages its blood glucose or sometimes refer to its blood sugar levels to maintain energy and focus throughout the day you want to keep your blood luck steady without big spikes or dips using levels you can monitor how different types of foods and different food comminations as well as food timing and things exercise combine to impact your blood glucose levels i started using levels a little over a year ago and it give me a lot of inside into how specific foods were spiking my blood sugar and then leaving me feeling tired for several hours afterwards as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals was impacting my over all energy and in doing it really allowed me to optimism how i eat what i eat when i exercise and on such that my blood locos levels and energy levels are stable throughout the day if you are interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself go to levels dot link slash superman right now levels is offering an additional two free months of membership again that is levels dot link ell and k slash supermen to get two free months of membership and now for my discussion with doctor robot malaria doctor malaria rob welcome the thinks for having delighted to have you here both for sake of your medical knowledge an training as a psychiatrist and of course as a luminary in the field of nor plasticity dopa men in reward systems social systems your knowledge of autism and social interactions a newer interest in or perhaps old interest in psychedelics and what they are doing in potential for mental health and there just many things that a you have done in this field have been a long long time fan of your work since your days as as assistant professor have tracked your career i learned a tremendous amount from you by observing you end from being your colleague really delighted to have you here you are making me bless and i do not blush easily well it is all true and and i will as well you have also trained an enormous number of incredible scientists on carldiceroff the carldiceroth on on alempki always speaks incredibly highly of you as a mentor and ism somebody she is learned a tremendous amount from and pretty much anyone that is worked on nerd plasticity on dopamine and reward systems addiction and now in the fields of autism and soon psychedelics as well references as you often and you have been mention many times before in this podcast if not by name by work again thank you for being here it'd love to kick off the conversation by talking about something which is very fundamental to everything we are going to talk about but certainly fundamental to our daily lives which is dopamine and we hear much about dopamine people tie by dopamine hits people in tat dopamine as pleasure donpamean reward for the novice how how would you frame the dopamine system i mean it but does a bunch of different things in different areas of the brain and body but to you what what is dopamine represent as it is major function in the brain and could you give us a general contour of the nerd circuits that allow this chemical to more o less put value on our experiences yo that is very well put om as you point out dopamine is one of the major what we term demodulators in the brain a chemical signaling messenger that the brain uses to mediate a complex array of actions of it is best well known function is in what we call the brain reward circuitry this is a circuit in the brain when we use the term circuit what we really mean is one part of the brain communicating with another part of the brain because the brain is this very complex an ow it is the most complex organ is organ in the universe with lots of different nerve cells talking to each other simultaneously in is her scientist we try to parse what different brain arrears are doing in what different demodulators might be doing and dopamine what discovered i should know this many decades ago and it is it is as i said the major chemical messenger molecule in the called brains reward circuitry and when you are talking that but what is the brains reward circuitry this is a part of the brain that tells us something is reinforcing in our environment some stimuli or in quotes is rewarding makes us feel better or good although that is a gross over simplification a and before getting into the details of dopamine an its function in the reward circuitry i think it is useful to talk about why do we need a reward circuitry why do we need something in our brain that tells us this feels good or this feels bad and it goes back to evolution i i am a biological scientists that means i believe in evolution u and if you think about the evolution of our species everything is driven by developing mechanisms that increase our survival and it is really useful you need something in your nervous system that tells you some stimuli in your environment is important for your survival or some stimulus in your environment is dangerous it is not magic that our very high fat laden foods are highly reenforcing and reward rewarding it is not an accident there has to be a mechanism in the brain that tells us that it is not an accident that most of the time for most of us a sexual experience is pretty reenforcing is pretty rewarding it is not an accident that warmth feels really good when you are cold that water taste much better when you are really thirsty there hath what evolved is a mechanism to tell our nervous systems and tell our brains this feels pretty good i should repeat the behavior that leads to that rewarding experience and similarly it what's really important when you there is an event in your life that is highly dangerous for some mechanism in your brain to say woe i do not want to go back to where that lion was than we can get into that this was a long winged way of saying what the reward circuitry tells us is this it event this stimulus that could be an external stimulus i said i a crispy cream dona which i happen the love that i have to be very discipline i do not eat to many of them ism if i it could be a drug of abuse and maybe we will talk about that a little bit all of these stimuli seem to activate and cause the release of dopamine in this brains reward circuitry now we need to get into a little bit of detail am our scientist use these very unfriendly terms to describe different brain regions the home of dopamine cells or brain sells are called neuron the home of dopaminnurons ism are in a part of the brain sort of what we call the lower mid brain ism he dopameanoranswered a part of the reward sir care are found in this area called the ventral segmental are which ism sorry to have to use such technical jargon and we call it the vote that is the acronym and the roof of the midbrain is the rectum it means roof and the base of the midbrain it means floor which is cementum i think that is the there is a rationalist it does not help much at all to know the name and in fact you are absolutely correct and i always forget it is o thank you for pointing that it is a it is a side effect of teaching your nan and i which i once did back in the early eighties but have forgotten everything i taught come anyhow these dopamenerans and we can talk about other types of dopameanerans they send messages what we call projections ism using telegraph while was that we call axons they send projections to many different brain regions the key one in the brains reward sir carry being an area again with a very complicated name called the nucleus recumbent and maybe inter i actually do not know how that name evolve the nucleus accumbent i done ism sure i should know because have been studying it for thirty years but i have never looked up the agenesis of that name well the fortunate thing about this podcast is it is both on audioplatforms notify an apple but also on you two been now we can be absolutely sure that somebody has put it into the two comments underneath this episode and therefore everyone will learn including us i do not know the oration o the er uncles om and if it is it is a gross over simplification but it is the activity of these dopamenerons in the ventral segmental area ism that then cause the release of this powerful neromoguler did moneromodulator dopamine in the need lies e comments which has a is part of another brain structure with a tough to remember name called the ventral stratum u and then magic happens and when i say magic happens even though we have been studying how dopamine modified the properties of sells in this nucleus accumbent the truth is we do not have a deep mechanistic understanding why when dopamine is released in the nucleus accumbent we experience that as ism being very cautious were the simple way would be to say as highly rewarding but it is a little more complicated than that what what it tells us is that there is something really important happening in our environment can could we say that accuse the arousal system it it it gets the arousal system going there is close ties to our memory systems which hopefully intuitively makes some sense if something really important is happening in your environment because again we i think what is helpful for your audience says to always be thinking about how these system evolved from an evolutionary perspective and if dopamine is signaling something really important and salient is happening in your environment you want to remember that it could be a highly rewarding experience a source of food for me it is a cry all don't i do not want to i do to emphasize any one manufacture of one don't adverse the other i i sugar laden fat laden foods that is why i never eat them because i them much an i use that as an example but because that was an important events for my survival this reward circuitry yes it stimulates my arouse system it gets me to pay attention it also has very close time to memory systems ism an to go off in a little bit of a tension i think the one him i do not wat to say it is a mistake i think perhaps somewhat over simplification of how people conceptualize dopamine roll in the brain is even though it is a major important roll is for it to be active and released during highly reinforcing experiences sex really good food drugs of abuse it also can get activated subdivisions of this system during painful stimuli en during aversive stimuli i which again a really important for you to be aware of to say oh my god that is really bad for me i and the dopamine system this reward circuitry and its subcomponents that may be perhaps signal more salients or reverse aversion in the environment are closely take to arouse systems and memory systems i i gain hopefully for somewhat obvious reasons you want a remember powerfully reinforcing events in your life as well as powerfully emotionally or physically painful events in your life i hope i answered my your question to a modest degree no i far better than a monastery that that is an excellent description of the dopamine system from a true expert and the question i have is about some of the context and wants of the system but in in sort of real world terms how how should i think about this even in my training is an nursing just i know anurans can be a little active a lot active everything in between that can be active over long periods of time or shortly i e time but let us use the example if the dona ism ism i a glazed old fashion dona i actually do not have a craving for sweet things don't is is is an exception i the glens old fashioned don't but if i were to see just a little piece of a glad's old fashion do not verses a full glazed fashion donna could i expect that more dopamine as released to the anticipation of the complete dona and then the other question is how does context influenced the dopamine system for instance if ism very full a glaze of fashion dona might be aversive to me i whereas at ism just a little but hungry i or if ism actually more on a schedule of rewarding myself for abstaining from sweet fatty foods than abstaining from the food might be its own form of reward ye i me and to me the opening system seems incredibly simple and yet incredibly prone to immediate context and the kinds of haunts that me wore constantly juggling it'll interrupt myself to say that we are costly juggling a bunch of different reward contingencies we want to i you i have good health metrics and may you have a certain aesthetic qualities try body but we also want the donna and how does a simp a system as simple as a one neromodulator system and the vitae to nuclear accumbent and with some connections to the memory a how does it balance all of that information in real time to me that is just staggeringly complex but also incredibly interesting ism i think you beautifully put fou very eloquent description ism you just said it it staggeringly simple simultaneously staggeringly complex and you ask several different questions context makes an enormous importance and that is one of the reasons i became interested in the dopamine reward circuitry is as as a colleague in the academic nor science for but your listeners probably do not i started out my career studying very basic mechanisms of pass city how does the brain modify itself and what makes the brain different then compute the comcomputer hardware is art the physical connections in the brain are constantly changing the strength of the communication similarly for the dopamine reward circuitry its highly plastic and its highly contextually dependent i and you gave the example of doughnuts in feeding and it'll answer your question about the cues ism yes it is i i used to give the example of thanksgiving let me give that example in the morning of thanksgiving all for most of us in in the united states ism the morning of thanksgiving if you are at home visiting your parents the smells of the apple pie the smells of the turkey cooking are highly appetitive highly reenforcing your anticipating that fun e then your anticipating uncle job coming to visit you for thanksgiving and that is all because these cues the smells the anticipation of uncle job's your previous experiences are part are part of your memory system sort of talking to in a simple way your rewards or city to your building up this anticipation one could almost say this craving which maybe well talk about in the contacts of indiction and then make a longshore short think about that evening at the end of thanksgiving those exact same cues the exact same smell of the apple pie turkey and uncle job himself at the very least they are no longer appetitive meaning they might actually be averse the last thing you want is the piece of apple pie you cannot wait for uncle job to leave your thanksgiving dinner and i always argue that does not happen magically that happens because your brain has been modified by the content in which it sits and this very important modulatory system this reward circuitry is responding to the exact same stimuli with a very different response that ism just telling you of repeating what you said the phenomenology and and again my other favorite example is any of us who have been in an intimate relationship knows that the love of your life can turn to the bane of your existence in twenty seconds am and again that does not happen magically this person who you crave who you love does something and two minutes later your brain is saying o my god i you i may have to break up with this person or this is not an incredibly painful experemotional experience and what fascinates me about the brain is how does the brain mediate that rapid change now back to yes context makes is everything about how this powerful nermodulatory system that uses dopamine works and the truth is we do not know it is because the in puts on to these dopaminerons the other nerve cells that are driving the activity of the dopaminerons a have actually studied this in my lab at standard university with ha colleague well leech lewd who a an a world class hero scientist ism wive studied the complexity of the negro anatomy of the opening system and these dopaminerons in the ventualtegmentalarea this the source of the reward circuitry dopamine are receiving inputs from all over the brain the receiving indirectly directly in puts from visual areas from sematiccensury areas ism and ism not giving you a really good answer because that is one of the goals of my research to try to understand how context how the history that you have had with these cues which we are to get back to of the dona or of a drug how is that modified how this neuromoduloratory system response on similarly the the nucleus accumbent the the target of this powerful modulator dopamine is receiving communications what what we call inputs from all sorts of brain regions that about drew your audience may not they receives inputs from an area called the hippocampus which you may have covered in previous podcast which is very powerfully very important for memories both establishing new memories and again remember that makes sense you want this system the stopping reward circuitry to be very connected to memory systems that the nucleus accumbent the activity in the uncle accumbent is modulated by dopamine while it is receiving information from the hippocampus which helps in code new memories while its receiving information from a brain area called the eidola which tells is a part of the brain involved in our emotional experiences the accumbent also receives in puts from the preferential quarter which is this brain area as better than me untrue is important for decision making for planning our activity and i cut go on and on to will not talk about prefrontal quarter a moment on because on it always wat surprising to me that prefrontal quarter is talked about as this higher executive functionary but then when you look at the noranatomy its as we say monosand optically asap i know wit one connection away from structures the miggala one connection away from structures the the nuclear sicoments in other words prefrontal quarter to me is every bit as ancient as some of these other structures that we think of as more ancient and really the whole ancient valve thing gets a lioebit dice because certain areas a the person of quarter are more elaborated an humans but but to me the prefrontal quarter seems to be especially important in the context of this thing of scaling the reward response or context of the reward response because it can set rules it seems to know a o k were recording a podcast now and there are certain rules are certainly t tin the do and not you but what is fascinating about the and ism glad you gave a bunch of different examples because what is fascinating for instance about the the relationship example is that yes at one moment am we can adore somebody in another moment later if they do something or do not do something we can be incredibly frustrated with them they can even become in aversive to us ism homely that does not happen too frequently but i think we have all had the experience of adognat an event or a person actually looking different to us in it from one moment to the next homely not at random right and to me it seems the prefrontal quarter is uniquely position to really say of right now we are in a mode of for lack my bitter word love and loving been the in the verbenas of loving a been the verses of arguing we are now arguing wherein the extents of of a reconciliation con somewhere in between or something of that sort and how a structure in a circuit as simple as the dopamines as right one mollecucould suddenly say oh it now getting over my anger is rewarding whereas five minutes ago being right and the most angry was rewarding and then five minutes be we that again were accelerating this move but five minutes or five days or five years before that this person could do no wrong and the dooming system is just cat and whatever you do i am just delighted incredible an to me i cannot think of a more interesting system in nerasiwell i mean that was eloquently put i i agree with pretty much everything you said i do not have much to add because you wat you are pointing out is the challenges of studying these systems the importance of studying these systems and the challenge of presenting how the brain works to this pod cast audience because on the one hand you have done a market of fantastic job over the last few years in your podcast of making complex subjects accessible to allay audience i and get them to be thinking about how our modern view of how the brain works may could be used to enhance health could unhands mental well being but as neuroscientist academic narascientists ourselves we we know you are over simplifying things and the actual functioning of a system the dopamine reward circuitry as you just eloquently point out is much more complex i it is modified by these prefrontal in puts which are simultaneously telling our memory systems cannot pay attention here m am repeating what you just said the context makes a big difference the history you have with the person or stimuli with whom you are interacting to bring this back to your n which i never i the initial question is a small piece of donna actor they the cue that that small piece of adorn and activate the reward car carry and cause release of dopamine to the same extent as the fuldona depends on your experience with donate i mean i think for you and me because we seem to both have you white boats there highly appetitive for us i probably does it matter reuse we have learned even a little piece of donna activates all of our memory system saying man that is an old fashioned ways dona i want to eat that i want to get one or i want to have the discipline not to it ism i hope it anseryour question its and ism ism shifting topics completely but that is why addiction is challenging lit risen to o that i let us talk about it because you have done at a ton of important work in this area f addiction i mean one of the basic questions i have about addiction is can we hear that certain drugs are more addicting than other drugs were ceres behaviors we also hear that ere can be come addicted to anything when on alumni was on this podcast i mislaid what is the most am unusual addiction you have ever seen in she talked about a patient ism who sadly ism committed suicide at some point later that a she told us had been addicted to water to drinking of any kind first call but then water eventually i and my question about a diction in the dopamine system is fort let us pick a drug am cohune i have never done cocaine i but people who have done cocaine tell me that it feels very good i and one of the more salient features of the cocaine high as that it comes on very fast and it ends pretty quickly too is the rate of opening increase related to the addictive property of a drug or behavior i as much as how much dopamean is reales that is a very sophisticate a question and answer is yes and that is usually the thelecture i give the way i think about addiction ism an obviously my friend and college on olempke is one of the world's experts and terms of the understanding the human experience of addiction i have studied it as a cellular molecular our sciences trying to understand how addictive substances modify reward circuitry modify the connections in the reward circuitry modify how dope neurons act and the way like any what is appears to be a simple term it is layered with complexity ism addiction is somewhat of a continuum and i to think about whether you are talking about substances cocaine and i will explicitly answer your question soon or opioid as we is where going in this country there isn't opioid epidemic ism i do to think about addictive lability and it is in my view it is pretty clear that when we are talking about drugs they have different degrees of addictive liability siamang i had a cup of coffee this morning am i and many of us listening to this pod case it is really hard to start our day without getting that hit of machine but are we addict to machine that is a tricky question because have never heard of anybody robbing a bank to get achene destroying their personal life to get katheiene am i would say wahine causes tolerance but i would not say it has a particularly high addictive liability ism whereas drugs psycho stimulants cocaine ism have a very tropic it is have a very high addictive liable to answer your mega is to question there eve been some famous studies done i by the director of the national to drug abuse nor volvox ism simultaneously there's been studies in animal models of edition where you nailed it the in a rough way the addictive liability of a substance is directly correlate it with two aspects of dopamine how much dopamine is released in the comments and the genetics of the dopamine says you said how rapidly it is released to get a little technical even with the drug cocaine or opioid it is not only the drug itself it is the root of administration because the root of administration influences the genetics meaning how fast that drugs gets into your brain influences the reward sircatry and how fast it causes a big rapid release of dopamine and some of your podcastlisteners may be old enough to remember the crack cocaine epidemic or freebase cocaine and cocaine does have methampheta mene a very high addictive liability i teach the nerve id give lectures to students that standard about nerbilogy of edition is part of a team course team taught course i have kids i who i had to deal with and whantyou know what i always say is young you it is not that if you use this drug your automatically going become an addict ism but you are taking that risk and it is impossible to become addict to a substance if you have never used it by definition but back to the root of administration i i went off that ta tanorsor statement om because i think we may have heard that in high school though i am to be is was not the must attentive i an ire get that ethical students be don't to actually o u i there was not no battle om but you that you cannot become addicted to something that you have never done which a i just want it you remark that because i think it is a profound statement because it points to the importance of the memory system but also plasticity and i i want i make sure the century we get around to talking about how am the amount of opening released in the contains how that might influence plasticity the o wen asking your cuing up in the back your mind is whether r not addiction is just related to the sensation that we have when we indulge in a behavior or when we are under the influence of a drug or whether or not it actually modifies neral circuitry in a way that makes a brought range of a drugs or experiences attractive to us it is probably the latter but let me get back and i will answer that in a second to the point i was making it is not only the substance it is the root of administration in as i said you cannot develop a problem with the substance and develop as substance rides problem if you never take it but snorting cocaine is a different experience then smoking it or injecting it and not of the reasons the crack cocaine epidemic was powerful is it it gets into when you are smoking it or injecting it at gets in and people do this now with methamphedami i mind mechanics most of them and that is another epidemic in our country most of them smoke it and that the danger of that is the drug whether it is cocaine method pedaling gets into your brain almost instantaneously causes a very rapid powerful s urge of dope men in the accumbance in this reward circuitry and that the feeling you get which and we arguing to get into this is not necessarily a happy feeling and it only last it can last for tensive seconds or a few minutes and it is a feeling that for gives you this overwhelming compulsion and urge i want o do it again buts even no it may not actually feel all that good it is it is it is r and and again this gets into you know we did not have in eduction problem for any substance other than alcohol i ouzo for most of humanity's existence because these substances scene methemphetomen synthetic of bounds ventral they did not exist and our brain the truth is our brains are were not are not designed to handle those kinds of very powerful substances as many of have been taking a one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundation a nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of fitments and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with a one ism sure to get enough fitments and minerals and the robotics that i need and it also contains adaptedence to help buffer streets simply put i always feel better when i take a one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste grit for all these reasons whenever ism asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer a one if you would to try a one they'd to drink a one dot come slash supermen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of item index three at to again that is drink any one dream slash supermen when you wane to go from here you asked a question about the the neural mechanisms of of what we call edition yet to know about the roll of neroplasticity and edition i i do want a highlight something you said in i apologize for interrupting a moment ago an no a that iverefrybodyoto is an interruption based on real excitement because a a a person i know quite well who is a recovered cohune attic told me and that by the way folks this is not i have a friend anomicia i truly have never tried cohune mum and this person said that the first time they did cohune his thought was i hate this and i cannot wait to do it again expand and that is exactly how you described and i think that is a fairly common experience with people suffering from an edition disorder were not supposed to use the word attic any more because that is a little bit judgemental and not an you knowing clan as something along this long o on a on an attic as must a being indicted you being o and that is beautiful description i hate it but i want to do it again and again it just shows the pa the power of this system which remember evolved for our survival a very simple way of thinking about it is these drugs are tricking the reward circuitry to say this stimulus this experience is really important for my survival i have to go do it again and again and again a side question is the huge question is why to some people develop an edition problem and others who have used the substance just do not and is again as a world class her scientist yourself the answer it is always a complex combination of underlying genetics the environment in which they find themselves the environment in which they grew up and how that modified their reward circuitry to get at your question am one set of experiments my lab did which other labs did to i do not deserve the sole credit for this is showing that drugs of abuse cause powerful plasticity in the neurons that make up the cells that make up the reward circuitry and in fact drugs of abuse cocaine methamphetamine opioid morphine heroine change the what the synapses the synapses are the connections from other nerve cells on to dopaminurons on to the nerve cells in the accumbent and these connections these synapsis con change and drugs of abuse cause powerful changes in those connections and therefore powerful changes in the activity of the dopaminurons and the neurons in the in the ventral in the in thenuclious ceccumbents and in fact the types of changes that occur appear to be similar to the types of changes that of evolved for good uses for adapted forms of learning and memory of again this is an example that this superficially simple dopamine reward circuitry is changing all the time as is highly plastic and can become more sensitive to certain experiences et camera et camera could ask a question about some of the general contours of the plasticity in the opening system on the said before and i love this statement even though its very simple but in its simplicity its really elegant that we cannot be come addicted to a substance your a behavior that we have not ism taken or partaken in is there data to support the idea that just one exposure to convene or one exposure to some sort of behavior can lead to a lasting change in the dopamine system such that one's propensity to be addicted to that substance again if one were to indulge in the future or behavior again in the future is increased and have a very particular reason for asking this but am very curious with the answer i mean an in the work my lab and other labs have done in preclinical rodent models ism the answer is yes a single administration of a drug of abuse cohune it morphine can cause relatively several days several weeks of changes in the connections on to dopamenorons and on to ism the anurans in the nuclei ceccumbence those changes that does not mean these changes are permanent or ism or irreversible but the changes last a long time ism and again the big question for understanding the neurobiology f edition is what you now those changes are probably happening in most people who take the drug in this case and we can talk about other stimuli non drug stimuli that can become in quotes eductive and again why in certain individuals to be honest it is not a big deal yet i did cohune at this party it was nice but i do not feel any craving or urge to do it again ism whereas other individuals that sets them down a a very bad path and really badly effects their life and that is a huge question in the research field the s obviously if we could make predictions on which individuals are more susceptible ism and not to get to political here ism but it is also whether you become develop a problem with e diction or not is influenced by the other parts of your life you have other ways of getting reinforcing stimuli getting satisfaction saving an outlet that other ways of activating your reward or dopamine circuitry he oasis your healthy ways i youknow as you have articulated i thinking in your podcast getting exercise you and i both to get exercise i feel really good sometimes at painful during the exercise but afterwards i feel great ism very day almost in the universe in on of the collars one i yeti the desire and then that i hate this but i cannot we to do it again an seems l exercises off in the opposite yes i hate this i do not want to do this and then afterwards gosh i always feel better and it'd be happy to do it again i man yes i mean i to exercise chasing a ball that because that gets me off thinking about this hurts madam anyhow back to addiction ism yes these drugs can cause w i denounce define not permanent changes from a single exposure ism are not know and and the types to study some talking about were all done in experimental animals how that relates to what happens in our brains in human subjects brains is it is not completely clear but i think there are parallels the changes might last a few days a weaker to ism but one can see if somebody there have been studies done where in an animal model if you give repeated administration of a drug cocaine the changes get stronger and they last longer which is kind of intuitively obvious but again the big question is why in human subjects there are people who can use these substances and not develop a serious problem in their others were there there very very damaging and found then that is why i still make the point if you're a young person if you sure do you want to take that risk is it worth it i to have that experience and that is an individual decision we have got we have done some pots upsilons about alcohol anabas getter and there it seem to be a pretty wide variation in people's response to the information i think because there are people out there who while have have got friends who a e recovered alcoholics yes who i who will tell me the first drench they took they use language it combined with the chemistry of my body in a way that nothing before ever had and they felt it was this magic elixir that has not been my expand an i and i have heard the same stories and it is it is hard for me to relate because you alcohol does not have that effect on me and that is where that is it is hard to believe that kind of immediate response to alcohol is due to their in the environments in which they grew up about that can have an influence that just feels almost more genetically incident and there is evidence that issues with the use of alcohol and developing alcohol use disorder does run in families i an obvious of it runs in family yo have to worry about how the environments of that family influences an but there is a lot of study saying there is a genetic component ism maybe you if i have a drink cut in the after i just fall asleep yen it does not have that effect on me in ya and ism and any one can imagine similar things for other drugs of abuse there are people who have used cocaine of use methemphetamng who find it modestly enjoyable but it is not the be all an end allot is not this incredibly powerful experience and you just talked about i think a friend or a colleague who said i hate it i hate that but i want to do it again and that is fascinating and they're now i recovered a it'll call i in cocaine attic and thief they have abstained for many years but still get a little bit of a glean in their eye when they talk about it'll call heir cone in a way that i just cannot relate to ism in relate em can i tell you a little dinette about me which i love to tell i here and it gets in to how the reward circuitry is closely associate it with memory systems and how use associate it with powerful experiences develop their own reenforcing reverse of quality monastery short when i was a young and i cannot remember in my twenties maybe twenty i spent a few weeks in parts i started smoking cigarettes meg this is a long time ago and i got its cigarettes are very interesting nicotine is highly addict to as are as the tobacco companies were fully aware of high addictive liability very high addictive li people we rob people for the money to buy cigarette ism they may not rob because although they are bevy understandings have become quite expensive but s not devotesign how my how much our fit cigarettes are use market for organized crime the ere are third parts of are of ore in the world third world countries where organized crime produce counterfeit cigarettes and are making hundreds of millions forbillions of dollars ism and i think nicotine as it is delivered in cigarettes as i mig tobacco companies put in a lot of work to figure out the exact dose of nicotine that will make you get that kind of feeling that only last for a few minutes you want to do it again and again ism we can talk about then nicotine what becomes an a problem in a specific society with the diction is not only based on the nurobiological actions if we are talking still about drugs or substances of that substance it is heavily influenced by the availability of the substance want but my my little story as i smoke some cigarettes in parts i i i i i learned why people to smoke it was very satisfying to have a cigarette in a partisan catalyst in ow it is very interest me s the first few times you inhale tobacco if you get dizzy it is kind of aversive and it is exactly what you articulated despite that you want to do it again i i it was just a lot of fun for me i enjoyed it and i was disciplined and at some point whenever this was i came back and says i did not smoke ism because i knew wit was bad for you but to this day forty years later every time i go back to parts i get cravings i actually just one i get aback o cigarettes i wanted i the have that dealing again of inhaling the smoke but the point is of how no powerful these rewarding experiences can be or reenforcing experiences and for your audience technically i know what i have been taught by some of my psychology colleagues is we use the term reenforcing in a very behavior defined way something is reenforcing is if it the behavior that led to that stimuli it makes you want to do that behavior again rewarding means it actually felt in quotes good am it's an important they ad surely can be different again as you defined by your friend who his i forget i think it was convene cohune was highly reenforcing but it was not necessarily enjoyable or rewarding and is not that fascinating i have a some colleagues in the edition feel am i one of them is retired now cannot barrage in terry robins they they coin they distinguish between the terms wanting and liking and think about that liking something means it is something you you enjoy am wanting means you wanted but you do not necessarily t or enjoying and that is a description of your friend's experience with conquering some of us have been in destructive relationships where you want that individual but you are not sure you are necessarily that anima som nice people will be in relationships we they actively dislike the other gang is not that which is a bit for of a concept to me but will it is interesting this this separation of reenforcing and rewarding wanting and liking because one of the things that is very prominent in twelve step programs is to create rewards around abstaining from the dryer behavior and i should mention that programs twelfth step when followed seemed how very high successorace at least that to at onalempky tell ills me mum that in some ways they are modifying the wanting and liking their splitting the wanting and liking of you o it'll call for instance creating a a liking of sobriety more than the wanting of alcohol there's that is beautifully put i and i think that is right m how that plays out in the hurry mechanisms that is a our scientists om interests in man that is a tough one i but i think that is wise those programmed are pretty successful it is helping the person make those dissociation i and i i do not know that much about those programmed bees i have not seen patience myself for whatever it is been twenty seven twenty eight years but i think part of them are to help that individual find as you both other sources of liking and reward i getting some tactics fash satisfaction and reward from the actual abstinence being able to cognitively teach themselves that i deserve a pat in the back i deserve credit i feel good that i did not take a drink at that party that i did not use that substance again and how that plays out in our brains is a really tough one yet those ere the way you described it is exactly right those those programs are highly reenforcing for abstinence behaviors everything from the social connection which we were going to get to social connection as we know mum to the way that people start to conventionalize their attic self for was other self its actinvalvs a a splitting of the self in an interesting ways as longs we are talking about doughnuts cigarettes o longcokin ism curious a before we move to a bit more o neuroplasticity is there anything that people ought to know about how different substances an behaviors that are addicting might impact the opening reward circuitry differently for instance m we took about cocaine is having this very rapid on that big increase in opening and a crash as we know a certain pattern of fanatics as you describe it the opioid crisis is is incredibly serious problem right now ah as is met them bedouin u but it something met them becoming functions a bit cornea in terms of its fanatics just an opioid is a very different chemical than cope cocaine but it sounds it impacts the opening system is the dope annurgic activity caused by ovoids responsible for the addictive properties of options or do people also the feeling of being under spirits i personally hate it coming out of surgery they gave me they gave me viridian once and i i hated it it'd rather have the pain most operative pain then take something vicadinor or value or fentinalor anything that to me is just completely aversive but i realize that there are many millions of people that feel quite differently it is a great question i think all the studies both then human beings and preclinical animal models yes would suggest that the c the addictive liability of opioid and psycho stimulants which are cone and met them examine have the common final action of causing massive release of dopamine in this target of the dopemenerons the newly seccumbencs they do it if you going to get a little scientifically technical here the very different mechanisms cocaine and methamphetamine what the drugs known as psycho stimulants ism actually bind to a propene in the brain are a molecule in the brain that is responsible for sucking up it is a vacuum cleaner sucking up the dopamine after it is been release and cocaine prevents that dopamine from being vacuumed ups the cocaine hangs around longer methnononly prevents the dopamine from being vacuumed up it actually causes the reverse it actually causes the direct release of dopamine from what we call nerve terminals from the sight where dopamines release opioid work very differently they actually primarily not solely work we are the dopaminurons live and it is a little complicated if it is not that critical but they indirectly it increased the activity within the dopaminurons themselves causing a big massive bigger than normal release of dopamine that is one commonality ism but anybody who has used these drugs you read about these drugs the subjective experience of the drugs are dramatically different and that is because of the actions there having not only in the reward circuitry but throughout the brain in it it is interesting you talked about vicadand have taken vixen in because have had several surgeries and things you i did not it have t have gotten other opioid for pain release that were great i mean they took they took away a lot of pain after my ligament repair ism and that is a different question that even when you are talking about opioid all drugs are not crew are they are not identical sentinel has a m oh big larger ism addictive liability because of its molecular properties and how it is interacting with the opioid system in our brains and the receptors the actual prolines in the brain that it interacts with but the subjective experience of points landing it is interesting a some people of it that is you if we go back in history as there wore the ism opium dens throughout i aria ism there were wars about opiitsing the the the famous point wars between china and the united kingdom i showing you how powerful i the availability of a substance an opioid can be it's going off in its mansion no i alwasrise but commonality is opening release in the commons but it is of if you remember what a vendiagram is all these drugs have some common actions usually on directly or indirectly causing the mass of release of dopamine in the comments but then they have their own individual actions because obviously when you take cocaine or met them that amen it is a stimulator you are enough people are grinding their chief their hyped up for most people spirits of the exact opposite your i mean in opium dens from the movies i watch in watching narcs and all those chevies shows you are often you are lying down you are your kind of in almost a dream state very different subjective experiences i to just take a brief break and thank one of our sponsors which is element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt sodium magnesium an passing the called electrolytes and no sugar salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerves ls also called neurons and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back to elect like ratio of one thousand milligrams that is one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electronics and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i been sweating lot and certainly i drink element in my water when ism in the sand and after going in the sauna becausethat cause is quite a lot of sweating if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc cam slash superman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element dot cam slash superman i had not experience with the opioid recently a no a voluntarily over the christian holiday we went to visit friends and before going to sleep i wanted some tea and i asked if they had any non calf to the they gave me this ta and u a that night i had the most bazar dreams have ever had and i slept for fourteen hours the next morning i what was that tea and i fell off in the morning and i went is shall a blue louis flower tea that is actually illegal in the united at it is sold and it has morphine compounds in it i am one of those feel its very susceptible a to even low doses of any kind of novel drug an the anotsoso interest i a ever takin cofgsirp with dexter morphia no i any that stuff why i ha n i have a tendency what i get a cold i it gets into my long as i cough a lot and i think this has been reported this is my antidotal ex m confirming what you said dexter mothorphan is a different sort of opioid then actually some people develop a problem with it for me it gives me really bazaar dreams i really was similar to what you he was a very unusual master holds different conversation about what makes us dream and what e what the meaning of dreams fascinating and i hope you cover may be you have cover that we have not yet but we are intending to do a whole series on sleep in dreamy that would be and main get in ti started out in sleep restarts i have a fondness for it drug research in sleep research have a long try of overlap with allay poison's work on now i worry with allay hopstoke but by the way folks if your interest hi relationship between a hallucinations in dreaming fallen poison is a good name to start your a your ratio nonet see at anal bra nineteen my god ism dating myself nineteen i oh seventy i canmemver was seventy six or seventy seven i worked with fallen horsiness and underground that haven ma no i isn't undergraduate at harbor he was at harbor radical schooner i may e i of his writing and i hat a lot to on it very really ahead of his time yes he was i will get i was i should nobody would anybody who knows me will not believe this but i fact that i was a very shy insecure twenty year old would not have guess who o i and even he medical school i ought i likely was not confident of my opinions at all i was very shy wasn't thought all of the ideas i had must be obvious and i should never save them outlook do my ask on as as ice you raise us i aninsyule in portent i in you you have this incredible a career track record i your adored by your college es here highly restricted you one just by a reward a word there is to win an up since to were something in particular that on like was in an overnight thing or one day you woke up and thought i a candy manly van myself but if you would not mind sharing that cause i did not before we talk get back into some of the science i this sciences a human endeavor and and most people listening or probably not scientist but i think everybody deals with these issues a of of self doubt and people appeared out veering levels of confidence but a what whale happened lav to thank you for asking i it would enough for me it was a very gradual process and i am not as as an undergraduate as a medical student even as a nostoc ye i was very unsure of my ideas of my intellectual abilities of whether what i was thinking was really in a worth while as a very gradual process i think it the increase in my confidence i think began when i was a stock which is a training period after you have received a oh day and eddy where you get additional research training and i worked with my name roger nice at you see as f an roger was a very for intellectually intense very forceful individual and i got involved in a field where coming people a little bit of a tension your your your listeners may think that science test are these get individuals wearing white coats with no passion or emotion and nothing could be further from the truth the most successful scientists i know a pretty passionate in pretty intense about what there working on driven i an then this is a socialization anyhow during my nostoc i started getting involved in a topic were there were vigorous arguments about phenomenology we were studying i had to develop a tougher and thicker skin i had to be able to argue my side of of the hypotheses we were entering i it started developing as a post and then it slowly evolved as an assist e professor ism in for your listeners who do not know i do not to admit this but ism in my late sixties have been running my own lab for almost forty years ism so even ism gradually as an assistant professor i realized hey i can do this i can do science i can write papers that my colleagues seem to be interested in and then gradually w over then the next ten twenty thirty years i et i gained more and more confidence i for me i was this very gradual ism build up of many different experiences were i developed some confidence that ye not all of my ideas sir great of course they are not but it is o keyed voice o my opinion it is o k to state my ideas and why i believe this and why i do not believe that that was my experience thank you for sharing that shows i think a people struggle with the that very issue and ism clearly showing up again and again over a long pate of time is helpful but as he said you'd the learning to trust one's ideas just a brief anecdote o when i was ism coming up in narrow science a few years behind you i not years i not too many i mean si vacates i i recall the incredible number of high profile papers montero plasticity and long termitentiation on turn depression these are terms a related to the modification of synapses ism that romolinka and roger a coal pioneered a big segment to that work and as i remember seeing your names on papers and i thought roger worked for you sorry i not li love to hear i lie i inly later did i learn that you ere a his post ox an an ad then we collar berated as you make ham peers very quick very quickly i joyous had and dog and i rogers wonder i i did have the confidence even as to postthough any actually even as a grads don even though i was a little insecure about my ideas i wanted to be treated as an equal that is the one thing i did have i never felt that i was working for somebody else i always felt that i was working for myself and that we were colleagues ism even though my ventures or had more experience and i could learn from them but i it you are working for yourself even though you have mentors i think there is there some real gems in what you just describes to thank you for striking the time to do that sir it'd to discuss one aspect of reward circuitry that i do not think most people think about it fairly straightforward i nowadays i i to think no more people know what dopamean is and understand it thanks to your work and hones work and some discussions have taken place on or podcast other podcast but you knows all too often we think dopamine reward wanting liking drugs ora all of that is great but what about the truly adaptive stuff right because it is it is am easy to fall into a discussion around dopamine of the things that are bad for us but what ism thinking about here is social interaction i clearly we are a social species and a lot of your work in the last i debate and a half or has focused on the relationship between the reward circuitry which you beautifully described for us and social interaction and connection and where ism going with this is ultimately this has huge implications for autism and opium spectrum disorders i do not know nowadays is it can you not specicalotism a disease is that right you hear bout naurotypical and neuroatypical but is but i have friends who have children who are severely artistic and a i do not know many parents who w d elect to have a severely autistic kid and those people often i talk about it as autism where a child having autism first all before we get into the social piece make because i stable that what it how presuppose to talk about autism nowadays i i i am very interested in the pat of physiology of what the medical profession terms autism spectrum disorder as you points it out the individuals living with an autism spectrum disorder are quite heterogeneous and it can range from individuals with severe intellectual implement and quite severe implements in social interactions impairments in century processing impairments and in lots of different aspects of our behaviors that a important and i think nobody would say would argue those individuals on the severe spectrum do not have some sort of in quotes disorder the issue we have to be sensitive to is it is it is a heterogeneous disorder many brain issues that psychiatrists deal with depression we all obsessive compulsive sorter various anxiety disorders tit is always on a continua man spectrum for aughtisinspectrum disorder there are individuals who are high functioning who one could argue have a different style of interacting socially may have a different way of processing century information but who have who would prefer not to be viewed as having an illness but rather would be viewed as having a different style of living and interaction and i think we need to respect that the challenge is again not oversimplifying a complex heterogeneous disorder om and both being respectful of the people who do not want to be defined as having a our psychiatric or brain disorder while equally being respectful of people your friends with severely impaired children who deserve help who deserve research and it is a tough one because my understanding from tobeonust just reading articles in the lay press and going to websites from organizations that philanthropically support research related to autism with in that community of individuals who are not researchers but who have family members are are themselves dealing with some degree of aunt's inspect from disorder there is disagreements about how to what terminology to use how to deal with them and it is complicated i think we just have to respect everybody and if your interacting with individuals i think it is appropriate what do you prefer om i do know as a medical professional the and especially when you revealing with children there are children who need help and i we are not doing them a service by saying they do not have an issue that we should be helping them with in working on i hope that answers your question beautiful i think it beautifully answers it and encompasses all sides that we can move forward and i think is we use the term a autism or children are people with autism om that is will referring i think people are very sensitive especially those individuals who are negro a typical who previously might be donnas as aught to spectrum disorder but would prefer to not be labelled as having a brain illness that that is fine it is kind of once you are an adult you can make that decision for yourself we certainly have colleagues at stamford and elsewhere and i my nniclenical assessments me rural somewhere on that and again it is in continue of just you know the experience of depression is in a continual but n as we depression you love a child or an adult any less because they have depression nor would you the other child are adult any less a because of a expression of some artists we i i know that when i people do not and we have we are being trained in the medical profession to be very for and our societies going this way to very careful with the terms we use and the labelling of individuals yeouknow have been taught you can say individuals living with an artist spectrum disorder some people do not using a term of that individual is artistic because that has some can have some i soft wan to say derogatory meaning but some labeling kind of but you done sometimes this gets out of control too as we are both now and forsake of fluid conversation we will do our best we will acknowledge from the outset that we are well meaning but far from perfect and how i handless we p welts an think about social interactions and leaving us idea anything relate to autism for the moment it appears that the circuits in the brain that mediate the desire to spend time with others of the same species maybe even with other species like a are fairly hard wired but modifiable they we were born with the capacity to build them up and that social behavior is highly rewarded is it rewarded through the opening system and what if any involvement is there of the ceratonergic system and we have not talked about ceratonian it but id love to bring up ceratoid at this point may you could educate us a limit about ceratonan because am push if dopamean is fascinating ceratonian is at least as incredible am you great question i i think for me these this way for me to answer it is actually just tell you my resource history and how a la mine at stand for that at one point was studying what y what you and i would call fairly hard core molecular mechanisms of neuroplastecity how to connections between nerve cells change and what molecules are changing and pretty hard for molecular stuff how did i end u studying social behaviors in mice and what i hope we will end up talking about even developing behavior models of what i will define as empathy in mice the answer is very simple my lab was working on rolls of classic dopamine reward circuitry and how it changes in models of edition we have not talked about depression models of depression because just intuitively hopefully your listeners can understand if one component of depression is what we call antedonia the inability to experience reward eating dona is no longer satisfying having sex is no longer that much fun which is a component of depression if there is a mechanism in the brain that tells you something is rewarding my definition that is not functioning normally in severe depression we were doing models of depression to figure out how the dopamine reward circuit was changing as were many other labs we were studying addiction those were the obvious ones and having it might be entertaining to to your audience to outearn how academic scientist think i was thinking those or fascinating topics they are pretty competitive am lots of other labs were working on it once i started thinking what other experience is might be modifying the reward sir care i actually made some attempts to look at feeding behavior but i do not want a mingle actually never pursued that for variety of reasons and that is obviously important because of there isn't obesity epidemic in this country ism and we can talk about how the reward sircatri and some of the things we've learned from our studies of a diction may be helpful to understanding o obesity but back to social interaction i started thinking well for most of us what i call a pro social nonsexual experience is highly reinforcing ism drew your pretty social guy am a pretty social guy most of the time it'd rather go to a move sporting event a dinner with friends ism it is no actually for me the most meaningful component of my life other than spending time with my children is spending time with my close friends am and i started thinking whet why is that why do i have such a good time going to a ball game with my best friend or going out to dinner with another couple ism and interacting it is because while it is highly enforcing and if it is highly reinforcing it must involve the reward sir care and then i started thinking evolutionarily it makes a lot of sense because if you are part of a social species there is a lot of evolutionarily a lot of advantages for your survival to be hanging out with other members of your species in a non aggressive way it can increase your likelihood to fined debate and reproduce it can protect you from predators i mean that is why any of your listeners who ever watch wild life shows or national geographic shows there is a reason all these animals hang out together it is for protection from predators o there all these reasons about whenever it was thirteen or fourteen years ago my lab decided to start looking at how the reward circuitry may play a roll in what i am on to call positive pro social non aggressive interactions another word we used this just sociability m and for variety of reasons that back them this is got this is at least thirteen years we may be fifteen years ago a stock join my lab named guy dollars she is now professor john's hoping and she had an interest in oxytocin and as your listeners know ox chosen is this evolutionarily can serve narrow peptide that is very important for parturition the having a baby born for milk being produced and it is gotten a lot of attention as a potential love narrow peptide is something that is released in our brains during a positive social interaction there is a a well known researcher in social behavior and bonding research called marry young and he did some very important ow somewhat classic work studying a species called the roll in particular the prairie vow and prairie rolls or a species where they mate for life it is called perbonding one roll will find another roll they basically get married they have kids and there they hang out together for the rest of their life o divorce i fifty no an we are no fifty the per center rostra and what marry elegantly showed in part in early days in collaboration with the kindintom insult who is the famous academic psychiatrist they showed that of tolan action within the nearly recumbent within this reward sir carry was required and really important for this monogamist perbonding having said that there was just a paper that called into question that but b ut that is but there is thirty hours of exsert year to that and and ism glad you brought that out is tat willkeep this contemporary and the that the reality is that that recent paper got a lot of attention wo other papers yet an any the toxin is not playing as prominent a s thar boding as people a thought and yet folks a that could be true we haven to be scientific about this in the open minded but there is yo three decades of o work that that speaks to the contrary i think we want to been like want away the tit and we went yo exactly and again the the investigators who presented the work saying exits may not be as important there are limitations to the manipulations they did which they would agree with ism just telling you gouldolin was ta nostoc in my late and we just tight we formulated a project to look at the actions of ox token in the nearly recumbent in mice and the reason we study mice is you there what are known as a genet genetically tractable organism we have all sorts of really cool and sophisticated tricks we can do to probe brain circuitry the actions of nermadulators opening and ceratonan an ox token in ways that we cannot do in other species and ism went to get back to dopamine in a second and what we f found was that oxytocin action in the neuclesa comments was indeed important for promoting sociability probably for promoting the reinforcing component of a social interaction and that surprised us it was wow its its ox tolan seems to be causing enhancing the release of serotonin in the nucleus of comments and that will will i perhaps will get to this that led me off on a whole series of experiments trying to figure out how seratoneand works studying this drug we may talk about called m drama which is ecstasy or mole which actually causes release of seratonum we did that work and that goths working in keratose simultaneously there were some other papers reporting that dopamine release in the accumbent that dopamine is released in the accumbent during a social interaction a positive nonaggressive social interaction truth be told may also be released during an aggressive interaction some people like to fight some people to fight and the difference here is the dopamine released and its roll and social traction its not specific only for social interaction as we have talked about but nevertheless that led my lab and other labs to do a series of papers am talking about the field now showing that and ism giving you a lot of information here how my dopamine release happened during a nonaggressive social interaction it turns out that ox token is not only released in the uncle ofcumbens its released in the home of the dopaminerons in the vitae my lab in another lab from north western showed that ox token can actually macule dopamine n er on activity in the ventral segmental dream i hope i making sens here i do natant to c lo test to i that it just shows how we discuss these neurimodulators dope i just brought in oxytocin we are gong to talk about sacaton a second unfortunately for your listeners they do not work in isolation they community they influence each other in ways that i think it is important for us to understand and e lucid that is not too much technical dear her and i think it is wonderfully rich with there was for us to discuss and ism very glad that you've brought up that neither dopamine nor saratonan nor oxytocin work an isolation because all too often and admittedly sometimes even on my podcast it'll talk about these things an isolation as a way to try and simplify them a bit but there is just no way that the brain works that way french is turning on dopamine and turning off saratoneand it is a waiting of of inputs and i think that seratani perhaps i should frame it this way just as often as dopamine is framed as this reward molecule and pleasure and dopamine hits all too often i think in the popular press serotonin is discuss and oxytocin to for that matter as this kind of warm feel good everything's hello not really associate with reward in reinforcement and a of course it is not that simple when it comes to social interactions it sounds oxytocin and baritone an are playing a prominent roll also in the accumbent and that dopamine is is activated to you has that right of i do not want take us too far down the rabbit whole of curl circuit function but that to me makes at least a brief discussion about the uncles accumbent itself interesting the o case ism thinking nucleus i know that means a piling or an aggregation of pros its talking to this ventral stratum we get a clutching hard of de antral stone aglet it a subdivision amusing ya i is spoke am yet it is partheventral stratum and its i and and then runs there can be active and communicate with other brainareas but we are talking about a lot on new ants of fond man ism not m a smiling out with your audience an an seeming soils it is i sometimes go to bed feeling it is complicated my god it is yetcould we say that within the nuclesacomments there are neurons that are acting as um accelerators and breaks ones there a simple analogy that perhaps while not exhaustive can still be true suit always the goal on this pot as here is no enter in be exhaustive but we want to be as accurate as possible a very influential hypothesis which has guide at my thinking and again the trick anna you have done a wonderful job of communicating complex scientific topics to your podcast audience and i congratulate you on that imine its real its o the really important role i but as it is always more complicated than we want it to be a scientists especially when your dealing with brain activity issues and how the brain mediates all it is amazing functions m historically we have thought about the nucleus recumbent and other components of this ventral stride old brain area as primarily being composed of two different cultures and as you point it out one being soratofe and accelerator something that promote certain behaviors i and the other sun type somewhat being a break saying do not do that behavior do not perform that motor action and it it is true that there are these different saltines it is true that they are modulate it by these modulators opening in keratose and indifferent ways of an that simplistic hypothesis or eristic we call it has been very useful in making models about how the accumbent does all its wonderful things what of leading up to its it is it unfortunates a little more complicated but yes it is there are two different saltines and at least for your audience we can think about dopamine driving the activity of one promoting certain behaviors and inhibiting the activity of the other salty and being a sort of break on certain behaviors as long as you and i a scientists appreciate it is not quite that some curies a little more complicated using that as a frame work to think about social behavior as you said it prosodical nonaggressive nonsexual interactions involve the choice of a lot of behaviors but also the suppression of a lot of behaviors and om once maybe your sorriness ante what am doing here i i i think for people to understand how a single structure the comments could mediate social interaction and reward it we it sounds its doing is rewarding a certain categaryor and catalogue of behavior adoptions and punishing or at least reducing the probability of the occurrence of other behavior actions as when i go to dinner with your ends if i know them really well i might hug them i might even say something mildly and appropriate if i know the contact to be safe an i but at a dinner interview or discussion with somebody i barely know i might watch my words a little bit more yon for instance and i think the accumbent and its associated cirri love the way just put that probabilities it is my probability of having this behavior in a certain context is increase my prod the probabilities of not doing certain behaviors and i think there is little doubt that this brainarea called the lucky accumbent and all of its associated circuitry play a very important role in what behaviors you choose to do pursue play a very important role in these making the decision and performing these prosodical nonaggressive consensual interactions i actually also think it plays role an empathy randan leading you there i want to have a discussion about that exam again the as a mechanistically driven neuroscientist what is frustrating for me is i i know a lot of the connections its making and the other brain areas its communicating with but i cannot give you a coherent hypothesis or diagram of how it all happens o yet yet yet your still anowhat i can say is even at our current level of understanding it is leading to novel hypotheses that are allowing the development of perhaps to if we bring it back to opium that are allowing the development of novel at the at the moment farmichologic therapeutics that might be helpful for people who are not having normal prosodical interactions and would to have them would to be abut fuck function in that domain in a more adaptive and productive and meaningful way and that is the important of the the importance in my view of the kind of mechanistic work my lave an many other laves around the country are doing even if we do not have a details understanding of how it is all happening we can identity drugs and durable targets or even behavior interventions that might actually help people for for example suffering from autismspectrum disorder of the sort that they actually want and meed interact needs the repair help i think looking at a the social connection circuitry a through the lends of autism is going to be very interesting for us to do i do have a question about what is being selected for in rewarding social interactions because obviously am we are living a time where you do not we do not have to aggregating groups necessarily to protect ourselves physically am it helps in certain ways am and certain circumstances but certainly to support our selves in each other emotionally now having people that we can call on when we are not feeling well that we can look to a for resources and that they can look to us a but when we go out to dinner with friends or we go to a ball gave with friends or we interact with friends ism very familiar with the feeling o well that felt really good it just ego to gives me energy it actually gives me energy to go back and do other things spend four days alone am with a bunch of papers and lectures preparing for a podcast which i also really enjoy am but when i do that when i go out to dinner with friends or sea friends ism not thinking about buffering myself against loneliness when i do it i just the interaction am what sorts of at am evolutionary hypotheses can we come up with as to why the human brain is tuned for these social interactions whit is rewarded by not just one dope i also seritoriton and anocsjus in three prominent nauramodulatory a the chemicals in the brain are devoted at one sight in the brain and others that it is connected to of course but to making sure that we do this as often as possible without giving up e rest of our lives why may i again i the i think the answerment o be able to give i hope it is not tried and it may be a little bit obvious is and in some ways it is its its analogous to why drugs of abuse and addiction are also a problem is that the circuitry that is telling us a prosodical positive interaction is highly reinforcing evolved over millions of years or hundreds of thousands of yours whatever the that is and i the only hypothesis i can come up with in and o you may be able to come up with better ones is what i alluded to earlier is it it was very adaptive when we were more primitive organisms never mind nonhuman primates but when we were whatever we were to be a social species am for basically primarily to reasons for reproductive purposes it increased your likelihood of reproducing if you were hanging out with other members of your species and a nonaggressive way ism and for protection against predators ism ad there may be other reasons ism i child weary you a laid a thing in your absence and one of trusted friends they can watch your off yet i thank you at very good point the circuits the modulator to use that evolved over millennia and as you pointed out ism eventually depending on the society in which you live you did not need those social interactions for protection against predators ism although if we look at our world now one can make arguments both ways if you are in a war zone is a better to be off by yourself as a better to be with a group of people ism but it say the m mechanisms evolved for one purpose and they do not just disappear because there is no disadvantage to having this mechanism that tells us of social interaction is reenforcing and i would still argue there is benefit for reproductive purposes you cannot have kids if you are buy yourself all the time well is is the think it is impossible ileacurrently and hand fine to partner with whom to have kids if you are socially isolate or makes it much harder i hope ism answering your question i think and then and then as you points it out you for many of us there is a lot of positive aspects to having friendships and hanging with your friends emotional support emotional buffering and feeling connected it ruling honest is notion a feeling connected i a and later will talk about psychedelics but i this notion of feeling connected has a lot to do with buffering loneliness when we are alone the memories and the and energy for lack of a better word that we feel in recalling social experiences and anticipating social experiences is really powerful yet you mention the that people cannot have children if they spend all their time alone it is actually i realize you are not on social media more power to you but this actually a prominent discussion on social media in or there is a entire culture of young people in particular young men these days who at least from what i understand in the the researchliterature about this are socially isolated spending another time on line maybe not even on social media but er spending a lot of time on line vidogameis hiding in electronic landscapes visional landscapes and concern about mental health issues there a et camera i concern about porn over u benediction there et camera but social media itself is an incredible phenomenon to consider in light of everything we are talking about am i cannot say even though i am on mocha also shall media plate and i quite active there i cannot say that have ever been on social media and experience the kind of delight and thrill and persistent energy a increase that i experience with in person interaction and yet social media i have to assume is capitalizing on some of these same reward mechanisms in presumably the nuclear seccumbents are there any data i relive as hard experiment to do in my may be impose a there any deed that you are aware of that am it shows that social media has a high addictive liability or do even need an experiment i ism not sure we need an experiment i think it clearly does am i agree with the point you are making though your our podcast audience probably does not know who i am i am in my late sixties i grew up but they know you are coverup before computers before salphonds am i still am a believer perhaps in an old fashioned way that physical interpersonal reactions are really important obviously there are advantages to being able to interact over social media and i eking for for all sorts of reasons there is a lot of positive and good from that back to your question can we get addicted i i cannot speak to social media i cannot speak an analempki i think can is much more able to eloquently describe the issue surround or i can just talk from my own experience that myself phone is am and hetman i this is not social media but checking my email messages checking my text to my text messages has a for me has a compulsive eductive quality caeverpress since a lever press for a mouse and i viand part of that is my own personality part of that is the immediate thee back you get from a social senior post from seeing your am mention getting a message from one of your friends sure it'd getting messages for my friends it means their thinking about me it means on part of their world i have no doubt it is activating my reward circuitry not nearly to the degree that a hit of cocaine or an ope it would do am am an o what else to say about it i a i i think as a society we we have to be aware of these issues and it is really comcomplicated how we manage especially ensure an adult you make your own decisions for better or worse but it is a you tissue obviously for anybody who has soldier and arms planning to have children anomults on social media in i see lots of accounts of of people that are eighteen and older who they spend a lot of time on there and and ism not nearly saying that is about thing a lot of people t of entire careers that exist on social mega it just seems to me that om inseam face book lampion twitter have capitalized on this hardwired circuitry a the release of ox having to make it really reduction as the release of ceremony and opening an oxytose and by virtue of someone saying something to us maybe not even a positive thing maybe is a a a negative i i as you said they are thinking of us there something about being recognized by others d maybe this is a good say we are having towards empathy here fashion about him i think that is very well put the it is capitalizing on mes more primitive neurobiological mechanisms that evolved for purposes of reproduction and survival i think that is certainly has to be the case i and i think it is important n having thank you for bringing them up for i says o society to be at least aware of this and it dot it does not me it is many things tit is not all good it is not all bad it has there are positive uses of social met i can see but mostly we read about the dangers of it we read about these kids who are socially isolated who make bad decisions based on what their seeing with social meeting but anyhow back to the neurobout nescience your absolutely correct i an capitalizing on these mechanisms m that evolved for physical interpersonal reactinteractions because the or evolution did not anticipate i just at geography is as realizing on the sexual rats amp's reward circa as here r or another question about it and yet just as the gambling industry does i mean this that you know the vaguest casinos have full time people developing algorisms for how frequently should a slot machine pay off what you k ow what is the perfect amount of pay off to keep certain individuals keepcoming bass oprnisios yet i you can tell i been spending a longtime around attics and former attics have been researching some somethings for the podcast a an a gambling attic a ton is something interesting i said ye that the real stinger with being a gambling attic is that the next time really could change have as no alcoholic says that that the next drink could change everything for the matter or that the cocanatic does not the on the next line of cocaine could could make all of life better now and whoever whereas the gambling attic actually holds in mind the n fentistimally smaller and yet am real potential that the next time really could wipe out their debt and peat perhaps wen in and yet we know they would lose that to right whatever winnings and the casinos are fully aware of this i have been told my friends who know theathat they employ in a full time quantitative for lack of a better term i i what is going to say computer gig i do not mean to that the and nobly rob is tot and hurt i would be amazed if they do not have our sciences to have expertise in what is called burro economics for behavior economics i i ninety five per censure that has to be the case i occasionally sit down to the rule table cause i just at have ban easy and not long ago actually i had the experience of winning i fairly not a large somebody but a meaningful son my time and it'll tell you my sole mission at that point was to get up and go back to my room and not stop at another table i and i confess i pulled one brief to an other table play o one hand and then and lost it and then just got back to my room as quickly as possible and then left lost fags as quickly as possibly i gambling is die at me the next time ye ailing is again its all gets back to this reward circuitry and the m intermittent intermittent rewards are very very powerful well you mention earlier that the the reward system is powerfully tune to remember what were the behaviors that led up to the rewarding axariancei and and nobody nobody ever wont on the at the roulette or craps table are poker table an by getting up in leaving i a i got my t rain was just think it will how did i win i one by sitting down and putting chips on the table not by going back to my room exactly exactly and yet i have a the number of degrees and i think my provental quortexis working and yet it was still challenge in that moment gambling is really in having yet another human activity that is quite complicated it can be enjoyable and or can be incredibly damaging and now i all foregoing to think i was that gambling attic you at i swear i not fortunately we very blessing that is not my addiction it'd to talk about empathy and use that is a frame work for eventually returning to our discussion of lots but you have this perhaps longstanding interest but recent research interest and empathy tell me about this work ism not familiar with ay i am go ism git a i hope it is look a dragon the some work have done on the strung called emdiama because it is to related we were working on in my lab social behaviors positive prosodical behaviors that stimulated me to start thinking about what ere components of a positive prosodical nonaggressive interaction a a a common key component of that is having some empathy and compassion for the individuals you are hanging out with and it is a topic i bean interested and for many many decades i was once the psychiatrist and to get on my whatever the word is hobby horse i look at the world to day i try to be optimistic i again i am a child of the sixties and seventies when i look at the world and i actually just did a trip to israel to give a series of lectures and i look at these rally palistinian conflict what always enters my minds have felt this way for decades as what is more important for the survival of the human species than empathy an compassion than actually being able to look at another human being even if they look different than you even if they have different belief system in you what is more important than actually understanding that ninety eight percent of your life is very is is is very similar if you have some differences and how you look in the beliefs you have but there is much in common what is more important than understanding that when another person is suffering their suffering is the same as your suffering we ism and having compassion for somebody i a started thinking what is more important and ism not politician as drew i have no social media presence i figured the only way i might be able to contribute to efforts that might help you the human species unhands empathy and compassion is by studying the neurobiological under penning of it and i did not realize i might be able to do that until i started studying sociability or prosodical behaviors in mice and then i was ism able to h have a young woman scientists and i want to give her credit unique smith ism you might wot have unique on your packs she says she is a dynamo she is now an assistant professor at you we waste i were you were estrus and unique introduce me to a series of behavior asses that i to use the i to use the praise they are measurements the a behavioral antecedents of empathy because in the world of psychologists and people who use the term empathy it has a lot of different meanings to different people ism using it basically to men one member of a species manifest some behavior that indicates it is being influenced by the emotional stay a or what we call the effective state effective with an ay of another member of that species in its immediate environment i in i i for human interactions i just think of any we were talking about friendships any of us who had watch a close friend suffer it is hard you want to do anything you can to help the mat's empathy a mother with your child a good mother hopefully when you have a kid who is sick there is nothing worse as a parent you just want to take that pain and suffering away that is how ism defining empathy it is my belief that any complex human behavior there are are evolutionary reasons why that has been adaptive and important an maintain and if it is evolutionarily evolved there are ways of studying it in more primitive organisms mice it'll tell you some of the behavior assays we are doing one is and as i get a kick out of this uobviousit its pretty new for me one sand we we published a paper in a journal called science about this i which is if you take one mouse and in a ethical way you put it in pain you make its hind paw one of its paws one of its feet hurt a modest amount and you take another mouse and you let that what is known as the bystander mouse just hang out with the mouse that is in pain for one hour just one hour the by standout mouse who has experience no physical injury whatsoever will manifest behaviors indicating it is now in pain and at last may before a twenty hours but think about that a mouse just hank a mouse that is normal hanging out with another mouse in pain starts feeling and captain itself en k and the mice are able to see one another and here one another good points an your getting to how is that communication happening and a lot more work needs to be done on it i unique and her previous colleagues and others one component of it is probably an a factory cut or what we call a daimon there is assent in pants secreting a and probably probably because you can take bedding from mice in pain and expose the bystandrmice that is one thing and i ha never heard of these behavior assays we developed our and this is pretty clan that it'll tell you two others and that it'll tell you how it connects to reward circuitry ism we developed a novel assay which is the social transfer of pain relief pain relief is called anal media and i thought this was pretty cool you take and this is in this paper that was published in science a year ago you take too mice and they are both in pain modest pan i do not want your listeners to get upset we are not hurting these mice too badly ism and it is a tricked issue is aid is it okay to put a mouse inpaince you can the goal is to develop better treatments for human beings in pain obviously ism you have to mice and modest pain you give one mice mouse morphine it is now anal mesic it is no longer experience in pain you take another mouse that is in pain and you just let it hang out with the mouse that is no longer in pain and the mouse that is in pain will show behaviors indicating it it is experiencing anal media it is no longer inasmuch pain now think about that and there is actually evidence from human studies that i cant speak too in any comprehensive way were i it is called social buffering of pain if you are me to be on this have been having somenect pain just because of an old guy and i woke up on the wrong side of the bed and if ism by myself i focus on that pain and it bothers me more if imine the social socially engaged i i think it is not only that i not paying as much attention of the pain but i think there is actually some relief from what is known as the social buffering of pain all ism no hippy but i actually think that all species including humans are secreting molecules mainly the durance that are perhaps even acting directly is as anal chess and i can make that statement with without working too much that people think ism completely crazy because we had a come soba on the podcast from the wireman who shared with us not one not to but at least a dozen ways in which humans are making molecules typically odors an communicating those to one another to powerfully in fact there thestasteron levels there ten pressing levels there mu hem all at goes dow and and of course i none worse on all factions he is going to be passed ward that is us to that is just one slice of the censoryarray than what about the the the way that somebody can look at us in a way that makes us feel good on a normal day where one were in pain just even the touch to a shoulder can mean alive ism never going to meetings when i was a a early narrow scientists and it'd i would probably that point of of not been teletype to walk up and say help toy because i was not in your field than your the luminary an stuff by at i remember as i starry and my by you are m i always say hi every i i know you arethat statement was a reflection on i not reflection on you but as i advanced through my career what i found was you would give a talk or something in some one in your field more senor to you who you respected i would give a n od or something those nods not lie after the later gods could carry you along distance and the voice we want to be intrinsically driven to do the work we do abri social communicate on social speech i think there is a whole landscape of thing what you are describing an is incredible but i think makes a ton of sense yet we have the social transfer pain of anal gear where working on and there is a little bit of evidence in the literature suggesting this might work and that a talk about reward sircatry and may be emdiaman is not an impatagen or not and how that might influence therapeutic efforts for opium were working on behavior o models where we are asking the question will one mouse behave to give another mouse a reward it is the mouse that is behaving that has to press a bar or nose poke or even experience a shock will the mouse do that simply to get give one of its buddies a reward pure altar grand ye it is pure it is it is what we call it generosity a generosity assay and early days at looks it might be working yeti do not am and that is a generosity assay we can also ask the question will mouse work another mouse does not get a shock does not get hurt which is compassion and i think these things are going to be working and whether you want to call that empathy i would call that those who behaviors i to use it from behavioral antecedents of how we define empathy in human beings and the connection to reward sircatry and in the little bit of work we have done on this is we presents an evidence that these behaviors we call the social transfer of pain one mouse experiencing pain just because it is hanging out with another mouse the social transfer of anal media a mouse in pain getting some pain relief from hanging out with another mouse in pain who has that pain relief it seems to involve one component of the complex brain mechanisms seems to involve a part of the brain called the incur singular quarter which human brain imaging studies suggest a is actidateit during empathic human responses and the projections of that area into the nucleus accumbent that is the connection ism and where interested in weather neramotulats toneme in teratogen may influence these circuitry these connections that are involved in these in quotes empathic behaviors i et camera et camera and we think drugs can be used as probes of those kinds of neromotulatory mechanisms i hope this is all making sedative excellent salon is fascinating a ism not one to suggest experiments to a e colleagues and areas where i do not work but i ism going to anyway plot one you are really smart i your suggestions young love the motivational backbone to what you are describing here because i agree the world has a lot of issues and what it could be more important than to increase amount of empathy and compassion in the world m but one thing that we know inhibits empathy and compassion is one's own challenges and struggles and ism wondering if there is a way to introduce something to this behavioral pardon such that the working to provide another animal relief from pain one animal working provide relief of another animal in pain or a animal working to provide pleasure reward for another animal if it could be skilled with how inconvenient that work yes at i laid i am very hungry i ma we all thought to put our own origin mask on first a a too that we do not all die to speak but i grew up for instance with a one parent my mother it was the kind of person who would see at that time there were far fewer homeless people on the street maybe they were all institutionalized i do not know ism but if she saw a homeless person on the street of the town we li don't she would literally pull over give them money mine hotel she had homeless people living in hotels all over the town and liver it was crazy and we could not get anywhere that was the promise we did never arrive anywhere on time and that is my case for always being lad o thinly enforce er beat u i ala away and i ways run incredible right just a very strong sense of a social fantastinaction that kind of thing but in any case some people are that she could not experience any a even modicum of inconvenience for helping others you were as i think most of us feel if ism rushing to catch a fly and i see some one who struggling ism probing in to help them if they are in acute pain or it tuns a dire circumstance but let us be honest y most people i probably gin a prior time their own stress and and priorities for lack of better word when the situation often calls for us to set those aside and and tend to people that her suffering if there was a way to introduce the on the intern a probe of the interplay of circuitry's that involve how convenient or inconvenient it is it were well fed it is pretty easy to go out and gather in distribute fit for others but if we are hungry we tend to focus on her own hunger weak first ism in full disclosure even though on studying and path in compassion i can look in the mirror and say i probably do not practice it merely as much as i should ism thinking of your example if i was laid for a plain ism not sure i would stop and help somebody and ism not say depends on on what sort of suffer exactly a ti emerging on the si o remorse we all would of course i attire right you might think o goodness a d i have time for el ye extra and s ism not proud of that statement but back to your question yes i think absolutely we can design experiment swear afterwards establish the basic phenomenology than we can take our subject animal or mouse and put it into sure certain circumstances if it is hungry itself will it work is march to give another animal timing it is a good question is ism not sure what the outcome will be and one could predict that might work hard because it understands the hunger in quotes more low where could be of course it is not going to work hard for another animal get o food reward because it is starving itself and it needs i take care of itself first it is a great question were also asking questions about you have to know your buy mouse right do you is it are you more likely to behave in a generous or compassionate way if you grew up with that mouse in the way our mice grow up in academic environments and if it is a stranger how will you behave how will you behave if you had a fight with that mouse previously and what if you had and and it also matters did you win the fighter did you lose the fight right your pot young intuitively as we probably out all guess ism more likely to help somebody i defeated in the fight previously because of the cerpuno ism the hierarchy on the dominant one ism probably less likely if that person beat me up all these are great questions i think we can study them ism i also think there are ways we can study these kinds of interactions in human subjects ism out not that i am going to do that myself one it stampreel yetyeso i think there is also an opportunity and ism happy to discuss how normodulators in particular sacaton but also perhaps opening an oxytos and may in fluency the break the circuitry in the brain mechanisms that are mediating what i turmempathic behaviors let us return to autism i does autism involve a lack of empathy does autism involve a restructuring of the reward system around social interactions maybe considering the second question first i could imagine for instance that there are variations in brain wiring that would make it such that a kid who then becomes an adult gets a tremendous amount of reward from i do not know math of designing mugs any number of activities but that through some variation in brain wiring social interactions spending time with friends is just not as socially rewarded it just does not feel good in the in the moment does not necessarily feel bad but it is not selected for and is there any evidence that that is the case in children who are classified as autistic or having autism i i am i want to declare i am not a world expert on pathethysiology of individuals with aught's spectrum disorder i have read some of the literature i do study mouse models of genetically base ought tosimspect rum disorder the answer is yes there there have been imaging studies and again so your audience to certain members are units do not get mad were remember our earlier conversation we we we made the point that ought to inspect him disorders a highly heterogeneous set of behavioral symptoms with wide variation in how these symptoms manifest in each individual we cannot make blanket statements that individuals with autismspectr spectrum disorder are this or that but there are studies both in human beings and mice that suggests that the reenforcing component of a social interaction is much less or lacking in are models of autismspectrsm spectrum disorder and certain individuals and important point is is that just genetically wired was that because in their early experiences they are not able to get the century stimuli that is tell them titis a reenforcing social experience unknown am at least those are topics that i think are worthy of investigation do individuals or mice with autismspectrum disorder lack or do not have the capacity or the same experience of empathy again a very complex topic in question and its very likely for some individuals answers yes meaning they they they do lack some of the narrow mechanisms that allow them but that probably does not apply to everybody i what i can say in or mouse models of social interactions and are mouse models of unquotes empathy in these m are mi amice show deficits and those deficits can be rescued meaning improved upon by manipulations of certain armotulatory systems in this case the keratose and system by giving drugs including a drug called media mayor ecstasy i hope of answering your question i i think these are worth w i subjects for investigation i think there is a lot of value in studying them let us go back to siratonan in the nerves convents am we will get into this in a bit more detail hen we discussed endgame but i now spent a lot of time with a recent paper of yours the really relays one am team a that partisoris hititsyea the door that that roast the relative rolls of dopamine in the newclesigaens verses carton newcleacomens by the way am okra by time this episode comes out in episode all about emdiama itself and its a modes of action will have already erred and you can find that but even if you have not heard that am you eddy amazing amazing molecule because it profoundly increases am dopamine a and that is why the word met them examine is shall in the end am a still a surprised to many people to hear that but it also robustly increases a sir tone an transmission and what i love about the paper from your lab that explored this is that it at least by my read of the data it showed very convincingly that it is serotonin released in the needles comments that is responsible for the prosodical effects of end ma whereas ox token the single talked about earlier that everyone assumes is the peraboning molecule the molecule of love both in humans now if there is a studying humans and in the mouse work that you have done does not seem to play as prominent a roll in the social a enhancement that my am causes and the reason ism asking this in the context of autism is that for a long time there was excitement about the idea that oxytocin nasal sprays might make otisticates more excited about social interactions a more tuned to social interactions first question is is there any evidence that increasing ox tolan in a child or adult with autism makes them somehow more social or desiring more social connections ism not aware of any i do not think the i think it is a it is a worth while it has been studied i i do not think we can close the door on the potential therapeutic uses of ox toxin from the people i know who are much more expert in this than i am i think most of the clinical trials have been pretty disappointing with a in a lot of hope that intrenasal ox token would promote more positive prosodical experiences i do not think the door is shut yet there may be different ways of administering it administering it there may be ways of making a different type of ox token that might be beneficial i have a colleague at standard whose actually looking at a related narropeptide called vesoppressin and cheese finding some potential benefit from that and vest pressing an oxytosener closely related to each other they can even activate some of the same what we call receptors in the brain i do not think the door is closed on the possibility of ox toxin or related therapeutic agents having some therapeutic potential the evidence as far as i am aware is not there yet in terms of m my am u again complicated story as you point out m g am it is it is major molecular targets don't get to technical here are the serotonin vacuum cleaner that the molecule that is vacuums up serotonin and the dopamine vacuum cleaner the molecule that reign vacuums up and excuse my language sucks up dopamine when its released and because it is an amphetamine derivative am as you point correctly point it out it not only prevents these prolines we call them these molecule these vacuum cleaners from vacuuming up the dopamine in ceratonand when it is release it actually causes it how to i do not want to use the term the the terminals to vomit torpeminin cerate that is what i say on the r the i o i es a crimes ism known for when i myself upsets for when i ti whatsnapticallys ala i say that they amadou o o what esteeming definite yo to an aft you en wen omit insect o o on ti on met n a does is that it actually calls what is known is a reverse transport it actually causes it not only prevents the vacuum cleaners from sucking up the dopominin teratogen it causes it to spew out jopominin creator imagine if your vacuum cleaner start it the the pressure n your scum clean a reverse and all the dirt you collect end start at being spewed out now the one difference for media and it is the fascinating and topic i hope we have time to talk about is why does mama qualitatively for most people give give human subjects a different experience then cocaine or metal are especially methamphetam presumably its the fact that there's much creatine exactly and if you actually get in and this is why for your audience is this is why hard core molecular science can actually teach us something about complex human behavioral phenomena such as social interactions and addiction at least the hypothesis we propose and others in the field it is not just science is not done in isolation i want to give credit where credits do we did not define the following that edema affects the keratose an system em more than the opening system it is not quit is not fifty fifty maybe it seventy thirty eighty twenty and that is because the molecule itself of emdiama again ism trying not to use language has a it binds to it has a higher affinity it likes to bind to an influence the seratonean back cleaner more than the opening vacuum cleaner it still affecting both but it is not fifty fifty it is more whatever seventy para seventy per cent keratose thirty per cent opening i and then it does influence ox token in very complex ways i which is o further technical discussion m it was just a nice paper that came out that report it that saratoneand release in a hypothalamic structure which again the hypotholymis you can explain to your unless n eh a verablalish the for your mouth responsible for a sex temperature control a feeding and society in a munch of other things critical am and a and it is a home of ox neurons that produce ox tank you this paper report it that when sratonan is release in the hypotholymis it activates and causes the release of ox token that is in the hypotholymis our work in the reward circuitry suggestive ox token that is baritone and upstream of ox toxin e hypotholymis in the where we were looking in the cucumbers it was the opposite ox token cause the release of seratonem the point to your listeners is the brains unfortunately complicate it yeweactwe the tract but we to come up with general hypotheses an principles but sometimes the devils in the details wen we really need to probe deeper back to your question about our previous paper and dopamine and keratose and wet we are what we propose which is far from nail down is that m d m a because it is an amphetamine derivative does influence dopamine release an dopamine the dopamine system and some of my colleagues in the m d m a field who i respect enormously do not me to say this but i m a say at anyhow remember earlier in the podcast we talked about different substances having a fictive liabilities does it mean the substances automatically addictive does not mean it is automatically not it is a continuum and i would argue that mama does have a some addictive liability because it is an amphetamine derivative if yulan good and it feels good and there are individuals that especially at as your listeners may know m dramas has gotten a lot of attention because it is an therapeutic trial that looks very promising for as an adjunct psychotherapy for postdramatic stress disorder and the the f de the part of our government that approves or disapproves the legal distribution of therapeutic drugs and up proving m ma for certain uses om the point being is that once it if it gets approved my personal feeling as it will have some addictive liability it also has this very powerful what you and i my term drew approsocial effect a some people even call it an empathagon that is a little controversial meaning it enhances your capacity for empathetic to experience the emotional state of another individual to want to understand that persons experiences an emotional state om an are what we suggested is that the addictive liability is mostly although not solely being mediated by its actions on the dopamine system whereas it is positive more prosodical effects and perhaps it is in pathogenic effects are more likely to be mediated by its interactions with the seratonean system and in in this reward circuitry and were actually doing a lot of work to test that hypothesis whereactually testing medium in these behavioral models of empathy in mice am and it looks our hypothesis's being supported the other thing to to drive your your listeners crazy about sorry listeners how complex the brain is if you think it is any neither you nor i were consulted at the design phase an hat a at opologizemen brains easily because i do not look trust me as a scientists i wish i could keep things as simple as possible that is what good sciences it turns out the keratose serotonin is produced by anurans in another part of the brain with this wonderful name called the dorsoraphe nucleus and it turns to the serotonin turns talk to the dopamines that is and influence the dopaminurans and am it is again the point we made earlier in your podcast even though it is fun and useful both for your listeners and as scientist to think about these powerful chemical messengers in isolation because that is how we can make progress scientifically it is how your audience can understand some of the concepts that have been elucidated from brain research over the decades but they do not work in isolation say influence each other they communicate with each other actually doing study showing that season in release in the comment actually model ate dope mean else o gets crazy complicate it but you can still develop simplistic hypothesis as i was saying about m ma were abuse addictive liability and some of its reenforcing qualities which you just mention eat ma a lot of people find it fun to take it is probably mostly we m in sedative o the dopamine system and some of its social effects of your being melted by the cretonne sister were actually doing studies to figure out whether the reenforcing component of a social experience requires that dopamine release probably does that is what ism most messed in really in the contacts of m d ma we should just mention cause we we do a to mention these soviets a yetis and i can say this cause i participated in a trial with m d m it it is a very pleasant experience it is certainly not for everybody it still is a schadual one drug at this moment absolve don you can go to jail for possessing and a we are selling in fact it was a big bus recently in canada and another one in bruises a large amounts of em d may collected those people are eolian going prison for a long period of times a you you do you do not want to take it or possess it it is illegal am which ring my clinical trials here but also the sentinel issue there is a lot of at and i was just in attention to your leaving recess if we did not i shall lot of people are dying thinking that they are taking one drug when they are taking another at we are not encouraging the use of these but i will say that the subjective experience of m d ma provided it is done in a the appropriate clinical setting it is actually d m does not contain other things am dost correctly et camera is a pleasant one for sure and in my sense is that a the dopamine release a is reinforcing the experience that the context to ceretonan is providing the social context and and the word context there becomes important when we think about back to the nines when they re lot of raves and people were also getting o i guess positively back from the interactions they were having dancing all night parting with friends et camera i may i think that om returning to the issue of autism an the role of ceretonent in autism there seems to be less of a a reinforcement pathway for certain kinds of social interactions om in some individual nepotism om and i am aware that there are some prescription treatments for autism that capitalize on the ceratanurgic system and opening system om is it genome to my knowledge the only tie approved parmicalogic therapeutic for individuals with bucks of specimen disorder is actually o god ism just blanking it it is not a ceretonercic drug a ism i y u have to look it up i i want to say resperedone for agitation ism there is no drug for for lack of a better terms the social defhesits there is no f tie approved drug if you look at the literature psychiatrists and individuals with with good intention have testis the utility of traditional ceracanertic drugs prosaic eyesore there are drugs known as es an eyes drugs that influence keratose release and another normodulator that well nor apinefran and at least well done clinical trials which in my view as an academic a very important none of them have showed efficacy having said that there are several companies and full disclosure here i am the founder of a small biotech called manlike therapeutics and ism not advertising from aplite i just doing a full disclosure it was found it with carldizeor author you have had on your podcast ism an unultrproner in samphtus go name carol nicolach i and we have the these to trial face to trial means it is a safe drug wive done all the safety work i and it is a drug the charges a sub type of receptor for ceratoneand ism saratonan works on many different i know what word can i use other than receptor no a listeners in this breast probably be familiar with receptive her parking spots for a parking tour on yes that the paper you i was referencing earlier from your tablet talked about saratonan one be receptaatin particularly important and and the point being is you now i do have an interest in this on can you use the type of discoveries who have made in mice might and actually have any relevance to human subhuman beings in particular those who some of which have some sort of sociability deposits i other companies for pursuing this to emdyamay itself there has been i do not no if it is on going there is a well known organization i if you have ever had anybody from maps unless the murky disciplinary association for psychedelic studies a maps deserves a lot of credit for being a pioneer in saying in particular with em day promoting the idea that you know this drug deserves rigorous an ethical study i that that is at least my view i in maps which was founded by a individual named ricdoblin has deserves enormous credit for their thirty year effort to make it aloud and legal to actually study m demo the point o making is i know maps and perhaps others have done some small trials studying m damage in individuals high functioning individuals with some form of social anxiety am am saying is becaushissis public there is another company called mine me which is one of the publicly traded psychedelic companies and this is on their website full disclosure i am on their scientific advisory board m they are gearing up to do a trial of a i do not want to get two technical of a certain form of m dime there are two different types of m dial that they have these horrible names called nantiumerse am the m damn that is used for clinical trials that maps mama is a molecule and has mirror images of itself and one one has the name r m dime and one has the name s m dime and there there called the her inantimers because there mirror images of each other and other labs over the year is not my lab i deserve no credit for this have done some studies to suggest that the s inantiumer is the one that has a higher interaction with the dopamine system and the r inantiumer has a higher interaction with the serotonin systems a if if you look at the the literature on autism spectrum disorder in human subjects there is a bunch of paper suggesting sertnergic systems are ma functioning in individuals with autism spectrum disorder and if you look at reviews a written or any of my papers we publish site some of their reviews it is clear that serotonin is playing some role in social interactions at least in mice and almost certainly in humans as well it is hard to imagine based on data from everything from essessorized o naratoxic lesions of the human gran et camera that it is not also playing at least a similar rolling i fully agree with that in and as we were discussing theresthereis a modestly extensive clinical literature meaning literature from human subjects suggesting that some aspects of brain systems that utilized seratoneand as one of their signaling molecules one of their neuromodulatory mechanisms may not be functioning in some populations of individuals with ought to inspection disorder based on that based on my lab's work on the role of keratose and in modifying reward circuitry taro role in pro social behaviors and the biggest clue which i think you would agree with drew is this drug m d ma having this is why i am not a druggy myself i am a child of the sixties and seventies i did which means some twenty years older than you drew i did experiment everybody of my generation with psychoactive substances in the seventies i do not want a my about my experiences i also would say many her scientists my experiences with psychoactive substances stimulate my interest in neuroscience how do these substances work why when i get the when i was a young kid the first time i got drunk on beer we is that happening but more seriously i use drugs in my research as powerful probes of brain function with the advance sage that now talking sciences to scientists with you drew they have molecular targets that we can manipulate in rigorous ways we can figure out were in the brain they act using the modern tools of hero science with your audience may not know about ism saying this to you conditional knock out my rescue experiments we can do all those fancy stuff and we can use drugs to study even things has complicated as empathy and i really do believe that it is why have been interested in empty may for decades is there is a clue there how does it drug that has molecular targets in the dreamy nermodula choice system in the ceratonan ormodula choice system have such a powerful effect which is relatively specific on social interactions it does not make you want to go eat more doughnuts it does not om i do not know from me there is a clue there there is something really important from that phenomenological observation in the human experiences that we can learn from i completely agree about eddy ma and o we have done a couple pots about syliciband and by extension list because even though there are differences there sulcivon list as far as we understand largely work through on activation in the ceratonan to a receptor broadening if a bran network connectivity again that ceratonents or atonement are atonal but different receptors very different subjective experience on and i guess the perhaps the best way to describe it is that plenty and sylicivon are almost always considered mystical in the in there subjective effects whereas on end am ma can be in impathagean an actageand on and sari tonal in acting to through different receptor systems in acting and creating very different subjective experiences i also agree i thing empty a mas particularly interesting for the nauru scientists o perhaps also because at least to my knowledge there is no substance in nature no plant no mushroom no ergot no o any no mold om that creates this increase in dopamine an ceratoneand simultaneously emdiamaza synthesized molecule and it may be one of the again high nightingale the safety issues and tings we talked about before it may be one of the great at least experimental probes of the brain that humans have developed and it may be one of the great therapeutic probes om that folks maps have are now doing such fantastic work on i ism very excited about what is happening with the research onemdiamaand ism glad that your laboratory is part the some of the relative rolls of ceratoid in the receptors involved o it since we mention ceratonan to a for siliciban and celeste we would be remiss if we did not say that that this wonderful paper the we will providing to in the shone captions by the way folks om that a romalenka heres elaborates focused on the ceratonan one be receptor even just differences in receptor subtypes leading to profoundly different subjective outcomes i find that to be a just one of the most important areas that one could even think about little on work on i thank you i appreciate the compliment i will also say unlike everything where it werefinding it is not all about only ceratonan one be but that is as there are again pointing to though the amazing and powerful complexity of the human brain or the memelian brain there are sixteen different ceratonan parking spots ere receptors that a distributed in different brain areas in complex ways and that is d uniting but also offers possibilities for developing very novel therapeutic agents that that activator inhibit these in complex ways it hopefully for therapeutic benefit before we conclude i am very curious to get your opinion on what you see as the landscape of the work on psychedelics and emdiama which is not really a classic psychedelic but all these drugs that as you pointed out during your youth were you etrecreationally and for mind exploration and expansion are now being probed as potential therapeutics for various a mental health challenges as well as potentially expanding consciousness empathy in all all of that i mean not getting into the details of you the the legal issues that have to be overcome not even us early talking about the chemical trials of the people doing the work in different laboratories which is have to imagine this is muss amuse tickle surprise you i n how do you feel about what your seeing now because it is a very exciting time for these compounds i it tickles me and excites me with the appropriate caution i i do think drugs are very powerful probes of brain function i think this class of drug which as you correctly pointed out people use the term psychedelics scientifically when pursuing their rim understanding their therapeutic potential their mechanism of action it is more useful to divide them up into different categories the classicallucinagens which aroelisty and solicit and the intact an pathogens which is emdiama which is really a qualitatively different drug there are other substances which we wee not time to talk about began and iowaska which are very complex an peyote but nevertheless i at called and excited as the child of the sixties and seventies ism but i am also not evangelical about their use and their therapeutic potential as you can imagine what i am going to say i think they should be the subject of rigorous sophisticated and most importantly ethical research i i i think we could learn a lot about how the brain works and its amazing capabilities i think we could i think they may notice i say may have therapeutic potential but i do not think they are going to be miracle cures and i do worry as somebody who live through the sixties and seventies and watched because of the learn i the history with temetheleri and his colleagues and the political landscape of how they were being used and promote it i am cautious that these substances need to be studied scientifically and rigorously i and i hope that is the case and i want a caution your audience that not everybody should take these substances they are not miracle cures and while they certainly may be of benefit to certain individuals who are suffering and they certainly may provide unusual and in quotes mystical experiences for certain individuals i am very concern that there are individuals out there that will gain access to these substances and have very bad experiences because anybody who group in the sixties and seventies knows all about bad trips and truth be told i have had a bad trip or two in the seventies and ism glad ad i did because it made me i have no idea what a suicidal depression feels where you are experiencing such a darkness such a lack of hope that a rational decision is to end one's life but and i think the closest i ever came to that experiences a bad trip on else and i are not do have concerns that if you look at the clinical trials that have been done the welcomed done not the anecdotal i went and saw some psychedelic therapists that a friend recommend and it did wonders forme but the well controlled clinical trials that are being done by certain booted some academic institutions they have very strict what are known as exclusionary and exclusionary crycheriar about who is allowed to participate in the subject and may rule out a lot of people i do not mean to be overly cautious but i do worry that if some people take these substances and bad things happen it will slow down the excitement that is currently happening and it will make it more difficult for serious human subjects researchers preclinical researchers to study these substances in the way they deserve to be studied i hope that articulates i think it it it does and thank you for that viewpoint it is an important counterbalance on a lot of the excitement that we hereabout you say as i think the state of kentucky just recently decide to give forty two million dollars from the opioid a lawsuit settlement with a pretty farmer suitable to the study of i began there is a lot happening you and i i man just city clear i think there is no problem with that and i actually would support that as long as the studies of iveagain are done thoughtfully carefully and ethically i see no problem with testing it is efficacy uncertain ism mentalilness's and addiction and it is act it is actually a topic i know a little bit about but we will save that for another time well first off i want to thank you for coming here and sharing your knowledge with all of us for me it is been a real thrill and i also just want to thank you for the incredible amount of work that you have done over the years i know it is still on going you are by no means a retiring other not yeti certainly hope not but ism ism sure the listeners have ism now an a clear picture of the enormous number of contributions and eras you have worked everywhere from as i mention earlier nor last see at the cellar level molecular level addiction ism work relating to social cognition and social interactions rather ism as it pertains to ought is models and now psychedelics and empathy and on and on and again trained many prominent scientists in our field and to take time out of your schadual to come see here with us and share some of that knowledge and stimulate our thinking and as you mention raise it still more questions need to be resolve i is a real privilege thank you ever much and indeed as you just mention we would love to have you back again for i cool i can say is i want to thank you for having me i was a little has not enter nervous about coming here and now i want to come back you youth was the blast what i just did with you and it'd be happy to continue this conversation any time i thank you for your very sophisticate at and thoughtful questions to be continued t to be continued

film won her computer there's something that she show lots of people since she for was it is hen old movie move from nineteen thirty six this is film called the circus it is kind of the russia version of its wonderful life it is that classic black and white maybe that comes on the be all the time it is heart worming that everybody knows but then when i saw what was happening i was what is happening am ye i can ha play there is this beautiful gonna and si singing in the center of the circus tent she is an america who has come to russia to perform and then this man just ert screaming stop the show stopped the she a slimy explain who he is he is german to be honest he looks a little history the mustache whatever oh when it is that to ti sic sir pipers on the rise yes and he is in love with this america circus star but she is rejected him and to get revenge he is going to reveal her secret to the world the secret does she is been keeping throughout the entire film and then he brings out this black baby chchthe thebabys a todlersise ye maybe maybe too and then the german he runs up the stairs and he holds the baby up almost simba and he starts shaking the baby and screaming she sleep with a negro she gave birth to a black child you ring the sup titles now shaking this child over and over again he is a black child a black child and then this guy comes up to him just this rushing guy and audience and hes lake what is the problem and the germyexes is a black child a whip woman a we through a black child i we the russian't get thus literally shrugged his shoulders yet he should his old an hes a whet and the german guy goes off on the speech and puts the baby down and and the taller he just sort of walks off and people audience the they sweep the baby up in their arms to protect the baby from the guy yet and they are passing this black kit around all is he is white russia folks and they are laughing at the go ye he is like why r you laughing why is this funny remember it is nineteen thirty six in the you ask fer more than thirty years before interracial marriage is legal everywhere i mean it is him crow black people are still being lunch ti and to see the scene where this guy is being told by all these white people mind you you are crazy this is no big deal what is happening here and as they started to do more research i learned that this was part of movie propaganda to for decades this message america basis we are not an nineteen twenties and nineteen thirty african america they actually moved to the soviet union because it was promising a better life the boy in the film that black baby is actually the sun of an african america who moved to the movie union in the nineteen thirties while and i have not got into the last bit of the scene which is actually my favorite part of the whole thing this lake russia woman is cradling the baby rocking it back and forth and then she starts singing to him mister dreams stepping soft make is he's annoys yes si shes totally putting this baby other h putting he babe to sleep yet and then she passes the baby to this next person and it just becomes is thing where there embracing this child one from the next racking it back an forth and singing to it the other thing that is happening in this sene is that there all singing in different languages the movie union at this time they are all these different stick groups and then the they are all embracing this back baby o what ism latching this black babbling embrace i wonder was it true would black people really be embrace that and for the in stay in in in the so union for the african america who when over there and left escape braces and did they somehow actually escape racism because that is a question the i think about a lot hen i go somewhere in the world and escape racism yer i had a year or two where i really thought about this salt a i was working is a journalist in ferguson covering months of protest and i community really a at is covering a community that was encracis after the shooting death of michael brown and i had just had this experience where i felt a just seen some of the worst parts of america racism from watching people threaten other people because of the color of their kind she just looking day after day the social in equalities that exist in saint louis and the structural things red lining and it was kind of hopeless are i felt kind of hopeless about it at least of the time and i was a little bit i think i just have to leap here i i used to almost play this game as a coping mechanism where i would think about where in the world can i go i would talk to my friends about gonna a central america places in the craving you think it is better there could it be what it be better there to be a black person there it just being this made you wonder about russia and did it work out for the black america to move there i do not necessarily think that russia is a better place to live as a black person i but for those people who did move there in the nineteen thirties and their kids and their grand kids what roll did race and of playing in their life how did it work out for them the cecally the thing that were on be talking about in general want to ay s pro for we have stories of people who decide i good go somewhere i count move there i but a try to fit in i we see what happens and folie one an a we are calling black in the was say oh that is easy you came up war that day swat i was j this good a rare for that act to be for dependence of those african america expats in russia and just explained who you found i get a the woman that i found her name is fouling hung i and she wrote this book called soul to soul she is a black russia born in race there and i do not know i sort of felt a connection to her them where i read about her because she is a college athlete i was she is a journalist i am a her grandfather is from the same county in mississippi that my grandmother is from we and i i do not know i sort or just felt connected in a way how did you find we originally ye i your book oh you read the book i read the book yet cause i i said line is a journalist she had a successful talkshow in mascot they call her the russia opera which is o most definitely because she is black and had to talk she it was her grand parents who move to russia back of the nineteen thirties they had a left is new york version of a from come meet you her grandmother bertha was a polish new who been arrested at a woman's rights demonstration her grandfather all of her gold and was

there and that is how they love story began tho weird a weird mapmakers situation but it work the couple did not see a future for themselves in america they decided to go to the soviet union liver had visited before and they wanted to help build lender's great new society one that promised no racism liver and bertha settled in news becckastan my grandfather fault there would be some kind of a kinship bet e an africa and america and the do kin yous bi people that is why he chose to go there and dam he worked as a ex fort in a cotton yes her grandfather left the america self and travelled half way round the world to work and cotton he developed a new breed of cotton that would work for resbecca stand's short growing season and life was good they made good money had a names apartment anyone for when their daughter lily was born in nineteen thirty four liver wanted her to have everything he thought white kids cot in the united states lily had language suitors music in tennis lessons but the life got harder after they became full soviet citizens and lost their foreigner status and after stall began to mollify his power they started to live everybody else liver died in nineteen forty lily grew up and went to college in mascot she married a politician from zansabar line's dad he died shortly after line's birth the only consistent black presents in her life was her mom the neighborhood she grew up and all white from a very young age being black and constantly explaining herself to the world my best friend was sash he was a neighbor and since my childhood i thought he was my broth's because we were to get all the time in this street when somebody would ask me why are you black he would say bombe want she is my sister number to she is black recourse her father was from africa and guess what everybody's black f and that would say ya but she was borne in mascot she supposed to be whit and just says o galena if somebody else ask you the question about call we would just beating them right away we were known in the neighborhood as the most cruel fighter thought me how to fight we told me you would take a bottle you break the bottle and would this whatever left egis put ti face we were on a bed kids in the neighborhood this was when she was only seven years old russia was not some racism for utopia people ruling obviously came up against what i would call racism but when i asked ulna about it that was not racism that was curiosity that was ignorance but not a racism this happened a lot in our conversation yule know would tell a story about some experience that sounded honestly horrible to me but she would always insist that it was not racism or discrimination it was ignorance i think the ignorance can be and often is racism but i did not wanted to bate that fact much as understand how she thought about it olive people commented on it solidi did not think too much about the color of her skin when she was a oh hold she did not feel different because she was black but because her family came from america it was not until she started thinking about boys in love that she thought more and more about the way she looked how much she stood out from everyone else and i would ask my mother mam why am my ugly why is my nose big why on my lips huge and she would say no your beautiful and then she would ask her america friends to bring america magazines black and lovely i think it was could black and lovely and my move would show me those magansis say look those beautiful women you look just them and i yous take this i would proud i would take this magazine bring it to sash and other friends in the street and say look ism just them and they would say yean this is a very strange magazine why is everybody blame in it do not bring those magazines any more and i felt lonely ah because i did not have anybody just me it'd assume that there would be a little community of all the black ruffians that they would stick together and hang out all the time but it sounds eolian did not have that was not around people that looked her not even her mam really lily was much lighter and gorgeous according to line just for the record when i met ruling i thought she was gorgeous there something regal about her it is hard to imagine her as a self conscious tea nature but she was my mother would always remind me ah let us say she would tell me be careful would boys they would not date you because they love you but because they would want to try dating a blame girl and that is why my self was she was damage probably because i did not trust any russia my that would approach me and i did not believe that somebody would fall in love with me at all sincerely i wanted to know the ways in which being black shaped feline's life in russia and to hear her tell it her family was never denied an apartment because of her race she was never put into an inferior school because of her race she was never singled out by law enforcement because of her race there was not that kind of institutional racism but she was lonely she felt undesirable being black made it hard for her to imagine a future with a partner much of my conversation with her was about wanting to find her person the strong desire to find some one and her fear that she would not despite her insecurities line was popular and accomplished she took music lessons spoke perfect english and was an excellent tennis player just as her grandfather would have wanted her mother constantly reminded her that she had to be better than everyone else apparently you still have to be twice as good in the soviet union she was recruited to play tennis a one of the countries top universities and accepted into their prestigious journalist an program she had much going for her but she still felt ne boy would ever want date her until she met facia he was a chess champion ah am go well i saw it in animalscastate university a i was a tennis place he was a chestily and a we were beautiful full and do he had a very rough time dating me than ah the coach ah physical training coach of the university cold his parents and said do that hes taking up girl and and this said well yes why was wrong and this because she will get pregnant and she will marry him then he is parents called my mother and said if you think that your daughter will make our son merry your daughter your wrong and then my mam said if you think that my caught for me you sin you can wronged noway mi gorgeous daughter to very yo i stand it was dos going back and forth back and for the he felt that he had to demonstrate that no mater wight he will be with me he started missing his glasses and he would come to my classes and did there the teachers from his glasses would write him you have to attend you have to attend fombombo the end of the story was very sad he was kicked out of universe typo mix classes and he is taking to the army we he h had in o the army ye yet if you a kicked out of university you have to go to the army wow that was my first experience taking i soul for it ye a pretty dramatic and to he first relationship but the drama did not stopped there for line a few years later she did a rushing guy from banish a small town about at was drive away from mascot they went to visit his parents and stay for the week and one morning she came back from the shower and caught her boy friends mother examining the bed sheets and later i asked my door friend what was she looking and he said was she no was for people of also she thought that the shes return and she was very surprise at the weekly but again it was do races it was pure ignorance pure ignorance and this woman adored me later but i felt that enough is enough and it is time for me to to be wit people that not for i am don't a mists and do not ask stupe eons something was missing feeling an russia and me in her grand parents she decided to look elsewhere for answers she thought she would find them in the very country that her grand parents had glad america ruling had heard about america racism but she still thought she would be better off in the essay when we saw any murphy a when we heard about our to ash were we heard about those brilliant a me musicians and was musicians and all of them were black and very very very successful when my grandmother would stop telling me about a racism i was say yah yah ya right and think about all those vheryfamous african america ablates that would be laughing all the way to the bank a i felt that i would be understood much better by people me and dam in fact yes i was thinking an i was dreaming about going to united states and marrying an african america when you pictured and dreamed of going to camera a why did that life look how would this guy look wit hen i did my on i said life but i guess we not again description of the guy ya see i was not really dreaming about skyscrapers and a capitalism and all that i did not understand about that but i just felt that a what is this song only a the he dam he will be tall and black a at a who son was that i my jeryyour prince would come that were yes actually it is the man i love it is german not dishy but what do i now my parents are most exclusively less in to stay wonders in her visions for mist my childhood i was expecting to me t prince that would look me and he would look at me ant lousy o my got ye was gorgeous because even the guide that really really loved me was in the university he used to call me monkey he called me monkey would love he did not realize that that was insulting and i never told him that in america that would be insulting but in russia guys would call that girls a rabbit i do not know my cat well he called me my monk heard i could not explain to him that that was races because i knew he was not to roses that is just how he called me and i felt what came i looked a monkey and what waits o it i called you monkey yo did not say hay that is not you cannot do that but he did not insult me he did mean to insult me he loved me and as i told you he was punish for this law and i would have trouble with thou know i know i know i songs terrible to you i know eolian moved to america in nineteen eighty nine she was twenty seven years old and she built a life for herself there she worked as a journalist she made friends blackfriends he loved to go to black churches and lessened a gospel music alive she went to salads actually knew how to style black hair and she found her blackpinch charming he was perfect he was perfect he was plain tennis he laved yes shelve classical music he was jest perfect for me they day did for a few years eolian was sure he was going to propose and then one night he invited her out to a fancy restaurant i got dressed i prepared i knew what how i will answer so we go to this restaurant a the offense o restaurant and dam them the reception they tell us that we're sorry it is back but there is just one place near them bathroom and he says no no no were not taking it and i said no why not he says well by one o sit near the window i said well t does not really matter window bathroom i mean explain the food is the same cause i wanted to hear the proposal o e i did not are where we were sitting yes he lad no than he said you any you do not understand our grand parents were fighting they were dying for the right to sit at the window not at the bathroom and i said in russia unless you bride but an if you will not get a table regardless of your color as long as green you will get it pleased stop thinking of the feeling insecure and he said what we would never understand each other your black outside but your white inside you dot understand what we went three and that was the end of our pops the and early yes yes yes because it showed that we were different and he said that we would never understand each other she agreed they are different pain points in russia she hadn't experience a kind of institutional racism he had and she said her boy friend could not possibly feel the things that upset her as a russia the way she felt them do you feel you fully understand african america the the sort of pinpoints a no i understand them but i do not feel them that i difference the things that upsets er let us say african america i can see why that unsays but it does not her when he said to you your black on the outside but your way on the inside what was your reaction to that i thought he was stupid i said how could i be black in and white it inside i am i mean ism who am and the things that i went through you do not unto stand did you is ever talk about race before that that argument that you have in the restaurant was that a conversation you gas had are not at all no he no we did not talk about that no with did it surprise you when it came up in the restaurant yes it did because i still do not believe that if they did not for us a place near the window it meant that dates racism i still do not believe for you it feels easier just ti sort of give a little bit of the benefit of the doubt are i cannot i cannot know for sure whether what the attempt what the intention was i a i a no out you and i do not want i do not want to think about it i do not want to damage my nerve system by think in about that it i will never know the truth noble one no but to it can be both not but to it can be both and not but three what difference does it make it is o interesting that you say that just because i feel it is a thing we do all the time in america is that we we replay out these moments of discomfort for each other in the black community over and over and over again to what for what i had a meaning what if you told me that you it'd did that and a result as it result this restaurant waltz was close for example or isn't result this wat was kicked out that make sense but why going through that again and again and again without any results why screeching the place till the first blood on your body but but i think part of the reason we do it is to recognize the lake the this is still hat this is happening lake we must acknowledge that this is happening we cannot pretend it is not happening yes i acknowledge it but again if i was was sit down at home and stopped all they did it because ism just no they did it because ism black no they did it because my grand ban resat america no the did it because on that and that and that that there is no end to that i think for many black america there is a curiosity a need to understand and explorer that constant unease we experience because ism black is my doctor giving me proper care because ism black an i here to fill a diversity quota because ism black and i being pulled over part of what it means to be black here part of what draws us together is an investigation of that discomfort there is come me no reassurance in that i know that black people are not a moonlit yet the fact that fouling did not have this curiosity surprised me but it also made sense yelling i did not have an echo chamber of injustices growing up i can talk to my her stylist my trainer my family ans they hate this thing happened yelling had no community to share wit nobody to cosine her problems were not those of black people but her own i want to be clear being black is not some joyless exercise for me i would not treat it for the world an not moving about but moulin is right about one thing thinking about race all the time is exhausting but i cannot let it go and i try to explain to her why i feel part of it is it it all it there small things that i feel in someways at a to one really big problem that just still has not been solved that it is lake it is small things that at to feeling you do not belong here that the country that you have always that you have always existed and does not want you and i i do not know i had this me i had this dream that yes some war there was another world where i belong t and this is america now with you i do not understand where your dream how i do not know where mi o a i i do not know were i do not know it at i tad to ad fright are you talking about going to africa i do not en think it is necessarily back to africa i think i do not know if this place exist i think it is just this this place in someway still does not accept me after all of this this time and that may be this is as good as it gets and maybe there is not another place a better option do you do you think it silly that i think about these things much yes i think this silly that you think about it is much there are more important things in your life that you you do not have to waste your time on things that you cannot change and do you do not have to change those people if that is how they are but that you you do not i do not think you have to waste your life on changing them you just drop them and go on with or your life do not worry about the things you cannot change sometimes i think eolian is right that ism silly for obsessing over this stuff and i wonder if maybe she is better off for not having spent her entire life puzzling in picking over every in her action with white people that maybe her grand parents moving to the messes are helped her by pass parts of america particular brand of racism that maybe i never really had a choice race specifically black and white such an internal part of living in this country yelling insist i had bigger things to worry about but honestly i cannot think of anything that affects me more being a black america is what keeps me from feeling i truly belong in this country have you ever felt you belong somewhere have you ever found that place ah what ah for me it is not were it is smog with home that is what was important for me when i lived in the united states it was important that i will surrounded by people i really loved it does not that to where i am as long as i surrounded by love that sell that matters i wish that surrounding myself with people i love solve my problem i am surrounded by people i love a lot of this people are black and as long as i feel threatened on behalf of all of them i cannot stop wishing there was a better place for us yelling is better place turned out to be right where she started she lived in the you e say for twelve years and might have stayed but then she met her husband a white russia man and they moved to mascot where he did treater i cents us it was hard to find a black salon in mascot aback them he mud fire at parts just to get our hair done manful bury s when promise o russia ties to yo lent any cocky to making a not can century about black ruffians that include yulan a conga coming up if i gets kicked at of a thing he had no idea he could get kicked out of that is in a minute miccago bob a radio when our programmed continues just marking life from y re was to day's programmed get back to where you once belonged stories of people who do not feel quite at home

dads i grew up with in texts but somehow even more he fixes his own truck kills his own goats when you walk into his living room there is two bulkheads on the wall a big t v and in the middle of it all the thing he is most proud of on a little shelf encased in prexy glass ah this is they promise just as bed or the emigration o specter bed that was it is kind of surprising that soul and of

look look i do not look the part i do not look as as as you was citizen e enough as you want me to get my features are very his panic very medical eventually after a bit they would let him go every time he was going back and forth across the border much because his parents were in mexico and he lived with his aunt and uncle in texts it was not a great situation his cousins never really accepted hi he'd beat him up i family functions his aunt and uncle would introduced their own kids first then him he says he was an after thought at best i got called for bastard to to a because i was different from their color that was very dark compared to them they were very light skin an i soft lo if yo what is a what the translation would be an are mil i think let on talking about try mile the

such a serious offense at the time it is hard to get exact numbers but one in investigation in the nineteen nineties found nine hundred fragment be certificates registered by midwifes in south texts same as soul's the undoing of soul's citizenship set off a chain reaction in his family soul's son who he would had from a previous marriage he got in his citizenship throw soul here is anent again what a was the what at was to my daughter on my grandkits and he gives tho court it at people art sinking a but tat ye know that is that ripple of get soul broke the news to his son soul junior that afternoon after he left the startup he explained the whole thing soul's citizenship was no longer valid not the was soul juniors now they were both on documented incredibly soul junior had just applied to become a s v p officer himself his interview was coming up an a couple o weeks now of course that was not it happen soul's lawyer told me that when someone soul signs up to serve in the government by joining the military working for c v p the government does not look too hard for reasons why they cane it is one the person asked for something in return a greensand for a brother that the government takes a closer look rafter that day at scarbux soul and anna immediately made a plan for ow to fix all then soul could just apply for greener because his wife as a citizen it would be a castle but they would get through it they filled out the application and soul and his soul way was super run about everything he knew what he was up against he would made a false claim to you a citizenship said he was an america when he really was not but there is a clause in the us emigration coat that says if he did not do it knowingly the government can exercised discretion he and anima were hoping that u s i s the agency that issues green current would see this allies a big mix up granting the exception and they would be done they thought would happen quickly actually which was not the case for a long time they did not hear anything long they started to get nervous the star to looked for help from public officials after all soul's a veteran lawn forcemeat he reached out to their congressmen then ted cruise the senator that is not the fullest why told him the other day sand he know i did we boy voted for trump won't we call him it a hey call me out press i voted for you i said i now better not he might come i the port an teacher we we be even a e a a see ta case o corpses i sent her message before we contacted you she never responded everywhere they looked people were turning their backs that thing about our custom's officers arts was to hang out with document to people that was soul now all his friends the coworkers he re feared to his family they almost all abandoned him en theory his wife and it shouldneeve be hanging out with him one person who did reach out to him that lady who used to bust his chops in the bridge when he was a kid soul explained to my producer nutty green she thought i was having the i facial troubles and she called me up and we offer to give me money but she is aythinde about year he know you sit is not sip fer anything that no i told her i tell her i guess ye were right who will she say she just start leafing she is is you do not say that another friend who'd stood by soul and still season is john a our sea the jag it is is initials they met for breakfast at a medical place across the street from an emigration to tension enter for kids he jag is allowed to see soul cause he is retired left customs last year said it was too stressful he wanted something more relaxed he became a drill sergeant and a boot camp for kids who get in trouble the goes i without work who got a promotion bout that got with the dog brag about his a id yo wont i i the and the jag's encounter tat women in the cargo tin refer lo lack a it is he you lawyer lawyer she slap me all she did lonely yet s she she end up the freedom i o my met of coming back much strong eventually after about forty minutes they finally start talking about soul's situation about how he is afraid to even leave the house li i now i do not have any stay is at all new i can get stop right now and i can get t port would he might o set up what he poi an was its it a and my sit the e o it the was its ail en more difficult to to deal with because if i guess not my moment know ism honer me will i have not that is right now can i really go out i i go out bat and woman over my solar i ye a hes o e w is an ti o i a wo is able soul tells the jag he is been waiting wait too long for an answer on his green cart ism worrying to get really frustrated he feels the government singling him out because he was a customs officer he thinks there trying to cover out the thing employed in a document an immigrant by mistake for non he says is over and over said it to me lots of times but the jag's not sure he is right he says meme the government wants to show the do not give any one preferential treatment unfortunately it if it ever comes out e pagan have to show it i who e we just t we give him what he deserve everybody else you why have we brick an all he wilgerlo give him an exception everybody's going wit a woman you can et why the jag does try to make soul feel better tells him he is sure he will get his citizenship eventually he asked raoulf he is talking of his dad he is not the jag says he should but ultimately what leaves an impression on me is that he talks about soul's case any other an unfortunate an document in person soul sits there taking it all in but looking he does not really agree oraoulind and pita had been waiting for nine months when they finally got called in for the green cart interview a need said i was a jarring experience these were officers the guise they both worked with were the first ones to jump in when things got tout they would had each others backs for years if any one would get that soul had done nothing wrong youould be then but that is not what happened we were treated criminals they took a sworn statement from each of us they took two from him they were trying to trip i offer trip me up for something and and o blame that the specific officers that did the interview you do what your told o if i did not need my federal did i would have told them all to go to hell it is about as dramatic reversal as you could imagine soul was a hard ask rule following enforcement officer who would learned he would been violating the very rules he would been enforcing for almost twenty years did it change him did he see things differently did the rule seem fair now that he is on the receiving end of them we take d about this lot soul says the cases hes thinking about now or the ones where he stuck to the rules and did not give people o break and as a result they suffered badly there is this one case a brother in his sister they were both really young they were being smuggled we had like called the consulate banana arrange transportation back to the home countries the turns out that a this little boy was sir he was codein to thinly that a ignorant to his sister who was doing the stop he was going a do do not it his one of his kidneys and we sonny one hat him go to save this little girl's life and the little boy was man i got a go i have to go and is i no we cannot and we had to turn abed he shots crying an crying and crying and now what is wrong eh what is going on why you crying si left my bible over there will just give you another ones an on all that is my bible ah it this point in this interview soul got out of his chair got some water from the kitchen hows argument take your tan ah we s o man this the an i have not it in a long time to here your good we just had to turn m over and that was it ti tall he was doing it for a good reason is do not son he felt hey was o something good and then he was being treated t that well this is the story he is always felt bad about but it feels worse now think him part because he can relate to the kid a little more do some one trying to do the right thing caught on the wrong side of the rules it is also a story where following the rules makes you do a thing that also feels very wrong you placed a lot of hate in the rules yell because when you did these difficult things that you had to do deported than or turned back the this organ down our child it was ort of essentially the rule or the rules i cannot do anything about it and now that you are on the receiving and of that do the rule seem more arbitrary to you or meaning less than an used to no they don i still believe that the rules of the rules the still a li and a i have to bite by them i still have to follow the rules i regardless of what the outcome is of what what happens and that is the frustrating part is that they the have gone overboard on my my case on my my my my situation the their down things differently with me because who i am you esse i asked will not common on on going cases but i ran this by four emigration lawyers and they said everyone is being treated badly i did not think soul was being treated worse than any one else one intends who has a lot of experience in this exact conning case sad shirt two years ago soul would have gotten a green card but since president trump basically everyone of fraudulent work certificates is denied in fact if anything she said he s lucky did not lock him up or put him into deportation proceedings there is lots always is is hard for soul his wife anna she told me she thinks a lot about how soul never wanted to grow up in texts with his ant uncle and cousins how if he would had it his way he would have stayed in mexico with his madman dad working on the farm in the end somehow the choices his dad made deprived soul of a home on either side of the border all those years that my husband was here growing up with his ant and uncle suffering without his mam an at but he would miss his mam he always tell me i wish i had going morn in medic because then i could have stated with my mum an back and now at the age of fifty he rings now than he could have had that and made light to him is not tire time is like no what was a because they did not want me soul has not doc to his dad in months since that day at the startup it totally tastes how i see i mill to for i i thought he was my heel he was even the let ain't got up with em i took him to hart i strongly believe in what he told me what he said and that one o the things was dad that were be as honest as you can it'll that will a for that will a fell it'll ever see why bet again filter this has as he reached out no let it's it'll let's think at let us see i over again months tie but then a year with no de vision by the government about soul's greencarred application then on october twenty ninth of last year soul got a letter from the government his greencarred application was denied they said soul had made a false claim to you a citizenship said he was an america when he really was not and also pointed out that he would committed voter fraud by voting is an undocumented immigrant of course soul thought he was a citizen at the time he thought voting was the right thing to do armful's world has shrunk down to a few acres that he and anna own he keeps goats cattle a bunch of chickens he watches the news in the morning while he walks in the tread mill his badman integrity award or still above the t f he and anima had dreamed of retiring in their fifties and driving round the country in an re maybe visiting their kids at college are on a base if they decided to join the military now they cannot leave town they re border patrol checkpoints on all the major roads heading out of the valley after a career of working double shifts overnights he finally has time to himself to think maybe too much the stress of being document is getting to him he only sleeps for two or three hours at a time he and anima started fighting soul worried for a while they were headed for divorce his lawyer told me that soul could be in this limbo for three or four more years before exhausting his appeals soul told me he is thought of just giving up and leaving it would be drastic but he would bring this to an end if the costs ultimately deny him a green card and he is ordered to leave the country he told me he would go he would obey the law he said ism going to practice what i preach he would moved to mexico as a former border officer who would a distance muggers confiscated loads of drugs he is worried the cartels might come after him they would still see him as a you ask customs and border protection guy the way he wishes everyone else would jemmy raff is a reporter for the aplanatic gust e

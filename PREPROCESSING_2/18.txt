wellfolks we have now reached the point in america life for in our racially divided society there is a quick get out of jail free card long as you are a member of an interjectional group if you have done something wrong if you are accused of corruption if you are accused of some sort of malfeasant the get out of jail free card is your attacking me because ism black and this has significant ramifications for america public life because the simple fact of the matter is that in meritocracy we should be able to point out when you are corrupt when you have failed and if every defense to failure is that the system itself is biased against you hell that means that you region to get more failure system why this true everywhere from politics to administration is true everywhere from the business world to the educational world if when cloudy enjoy gets fired from hazard university the basic idea is that it must be a racesyssystem that got her fired there is no way to whole people accountable if they are of minority race if for example you're a politician and it turns out that you are deeply corrupt and your first move is to claim that america is races and that is why you are being targeted and if that is believed then there is no way to get rid of corrupt officials long as they are of minority status and once that standard is created once the basic idea is that certain people in our society have that get out of jail free card and others do not then all standards collapse because a double standard is no standard at all the latest at ration of this particular foolish defense decisive defense comes courtesy of a personated epiphany heard you might not have herd of epiphany heard but this is a ironing at story about a small town mayor who is been allege two engage insignificant corruption i on a vast scaled according to the ucadalymal the first female mayor of a tiny ellinoi village has been blamed for what living a royal a tax par expense by taking a three hundred thousand dollar salary and racking up huge expenses glamors tiny heard was elected leader of i dusted it is a village of twenty thousand people and twenty twenty one she has since come under fire for what many says her access give spending she regularly engages the services of a professional baron make up tea and stylish before public appearance is in photoshoots for the counties tamper funded billboards those often feature her in what some people say is shameless self commotion she also a tempted to propose a new law there would cape the next mayor salary at twenty five thousand dollars unless the next mayor is fur in which case she gets to keep her gigantic salary has been deemed illegal by many people that is just the latest scandal to hit her she was slammed for hiring her former campaign worker as the towns at code in forcemeat officer despite the fact that he is a convicted child rapid she also raised eyebrows after spending hundreds of thousands of tax dollars on security details including one furnevent with senior citizens and another occasion where she pulled coughs cops off the street to perform a protection outfit for her she also racked up a trips lost vagus where she spend some three thousand dollars on air fare and she is now being investigated for all this and here is her defense a defense that has become the all purpose defense for an enormous number of people in our post gorge of flood society here she was yesterday talking about her a lodged corruption and the reasons why she is being targeted ya be into go ya black car black apaches up yo be in a tacking a black ban a an paw dato be so gyre again the basic idea heres that even if a black person is asking this particular mayor about her corruption it must be because they are a race traitor of some sort again if basic standards of meritocracy and decency are to be put aside in favor of claims that any critique is rooted in race that means there cannot be any meritocracy any more wish of course is the basic idea that social justice can only be established by getting rid of base line standards of competency and again we see this across the board in the united states in a wive variety of places just yesterday we platoclip of mayor abandon johns of chico being question over his handling of the huge migrant crisis that is it the city of chico along with the crime crisis along with the issues of economic problems in the city and his answer was ism a black man with a black wife and black kids how terry go attack me this mentality is actually horrifyingly bad for the country here is abandon johns just couple days ago i have children who walk ten schools we have sora games a you know your ask in be has i ism not a parent in this city i get it a mayor i get it but your asking me to give you a day and i have to sort to y honest than that you have not had a mayor me i get that i have a wife i have children they have schedules and blue we to have public safety that we have to address he's to have the on house that we have to address us to have a budget that i have to address and ism doing all of that with a black wife race in three black children of the west out of see chico i am going to the porter have is possible e what what is the race of his wife and his children have to do it anything the answer as you cannot critique me because he is siting his race of course he is following the footsteps of lorry likefoot who is recently asked at his more of chico after one short term because she is a horrible mayor but shell happy me a black lesbian and therefore she also claim that she would been busted not because she is terrible at her job but because she was black when ask after the election if she ad lost because of her race in a city elect chico which is heavily minority said ism a black woman in america of course she would said in an interview with there york o priors the election what ism a black woman let us notfroget certain folks frankly do not support us in leadership rolls the same force that in one herald washington to succeed there is still here that is referring to the cities first black mayor and this sort of excuse making is a way of lowering standards of performance for everyone well it is more on this in just one moment first if you are me there is not a day that goes by that you do not call or test some one that you care about

it across the word fannuwillis who is the d who is currently going after dona trumpet ad tanto and by all accounts doing pretty terrible job of it a person who apparently hired her lover as a prosecutor despite his lack of proctorial experience and did it using tax pare dollars and then took crisis wit this guy and now's admitting to being in a sexual relationship of the person she hired with tartar dollars as a prosecutor with no proscutoria background she is doing the same routine all the critiques of her must of course be based on race purees fanny wills not all that long ago talking the how races was behind all the accusations targeting her we re p and all the on r t we i ti o w t the you s a o l w w an w g n well i mean because the white mail re publican was not falling the guy that would be the answer to that particular question i assume but again the answer to every question but impropriety is now race in america long as you are able to play that card bandit is a dangerous card to play it undermines standard of stability and decency and per romance in literally every industry this is why see people ranging from bill amen to upon most going after diversity equity and inclusion let us be very frank about this a firmer the action as a practice is a zero som game maritalkcracy is the only form of measurement of performance that is not aero some game because it creates positive externalities externalities are the consequences that a true to outside people that are not involved in a transaction you and i we mover transaction the transaction presumably benefits both of us but if we live in meritocracy and ism goo to my job in your good o your job and then we exchange goods and services then presumably there pop it of externalities to people who are not us ism goo to my job which weens ism highly productive you are go to your job you are highly productive n now we produce product at a cheaper and better rate for people outside of that particular situation that is the beauty of the meritocracies that it benefits everyone merit helps every one seethe best people do the best job at the best time to the best price that its great for everyone however when you instead are stacking employment for example on the basis of race your taking people who are less meritorious and your forcing the public to essentially pay a subsidy to employ that person that is the problem with d not just that its discriminatory but that it costs every one now you can make the argument that since the costs are diffuse meaning that they accrue to a huge variety of citizens and the benefits are incredibly acute meaning they accrue to one person who gets to benefit off this no big deal but the problem is when you keep doing that over and over and over again the cost to the society start to grow and grow and grow again and that is what your starting to we and agencies the federal aviation administration my friend and collie out wash he released a twitter thread to day talking about internal footage of seniorifficials that the f a as flight program operations division which he says is responsible for all aspects of air craft operations work shopping he plan to reduce the number of white mails in aviation now why would that be a useful thing you're not talk about a situation where you need posit externalities how it being good at your job when you're directing air craft how to land for example it putting a less qualified person in place but there the costs are not t of us there is the costs are incredibly acute if you are on the plain that gets misdirected into the ground he's the less qualified person for any reason is put into a particular position when the costs really really a high for you when you are talking about high cost industries for example aviation you need a meritocracy even more than you would in say a low cost industry stocking a grocery shelf or something well mat got footage of the f a a acting deputy chief operating office are angel mccollup saying that more workers need to go from ramp to cockpit meaning so want to see more baggage handlers become air line pilots and then as the meting continues she declares important to quit get a little in comfortable get a little in comfortable always quote is always a ouphe is i for into say something superrich straight now but if you are white just take it on the chin and accept id she apparently complains that flight operations is quote white mail dominated and tells the managers that quote need two talk about what the future could look here she was and in the mail her teth a a whiles worst the and t o right is teviof represent an i do not care about the representation level of the federal aviation ad ministration hit is absurd why should i possibly care about weather the demo graphic of the f a a is representative in any way of the broader demographic do we have to have a heavy share of his panic females in order for the f a a to be good at its job and first of all you have a huge selection by is problem i love to see what the applicant pool looks for the f a i promise you it is male dominated just start what that but beyond that what in the relish talking about why in the world what i if your talking about a job where your personal life experience means literally nothing making sure a plan got where tit is suppose to go is not one worth a li grew up in diverse neighborhood and it'd a bunch of friends adverse backgrounds and that is really informs how i do my job as a person who makes sure the plain lands on time where it is suppose to land it is the dumbest thing i ever heard ism in tagmemic english literature or something subjective that your talking about making a plain land in a place without hitting another plan that is for your talking about i do not for the group poor or rich you have one job in one job only and all i care about is that you good that job don't for about any of the other things but as mat points out this actually is a problem invitation just as it would be in any other job when you lower the standards for the job sons to achieve a quartic diverse work force what you are actively doing is making the employment base worse at their job that is what it is get's more on this in just one second first now n actually likes talking about life entrance can a dark right but it is really

gender inclusive seat belts this a quote from the person quote for contacts i work on if foul were my jobs to design military systems for the war fighter and i have to deal with newbies pitching the ideas about gender inclusive seatbelt companies are made up of two types of individuals those who eat sleep and breathe that d i e so the people put the pronoun in their meal signature and those who keep their mouth shut new york we have affirmation protections and heritage months for every single type of person except white men if i do not have at least two d e i stumeetings are trainings for week on my calender then the all hands town hall meetings have some sort of d i baked into the agenda several sources have also in for mat about something f a program its called e fast which prioritizes called india tribal own corporations and socially and economically disadvantage businesses for billions of dollars and critical grand funding again bottom line here is competence and meritocracy are good for every one and the the predictable result of all this by thewy in the employment market is action makes it harder for private employers to employ people who are qualified of minority groups because when you as an employer are deciding and we hear delyuare obviously by by all federal laws and regulations i have to say that because otherwise the anal b sends me an angry not for using machree speech they done i before we abide by all federal and state and local regulations and laws one we have set it now here is the reality about hiring in the united states is a broad then as a broad trend when you consider whether hire somebody one of the things you are considering is the possibility of liability down the line legal liability down the line and the more we create system and which we say that if you are a member of an interjectional group not only am i supposed to hire you if you are less meritorious than the white guy next to you but also if i decide that you're not good at the job and i fire you i now may face a discrimination law suit why would i hire you in the first place enacted makes it less likely that it qualified minority cans it will get the job because of the risk of liability that is now attached all this is devastating to america public life especially because it also results in a misread of situations when someone is in competent and they happen t be minority n makes it easy for people to actively say oh it must be their in competent because they are minority when that is not true in competent exist all over the spectrum the beauty again of a meritocracy is if somebody does not make the standard it is clear they don't make the standard because they did not make the standard as well note the standard is but if the standard no longer applies and your being hired basted on your race or based on your ability to do as these mayors are doing and simply blame the man for your own problems when that happens and then the person fails then it is easy for people to miss a tribute at to race tat suppose to properly attributing it to the general sinfulness and failure of mankind all the stuff is deep and in stark and to huge problem for the united states o america s why d i has to go d i is terrible for the united states and every vestige of this arguments that incompetence can be covered for by claims about america racism that criminates can be covered for by claims about america racism that a educational under performance can be covered for by claims about america racism all f that reduces it reduces the ability of smart capable people of all races to get ahead and make the world better place for everyone who surrounds them the entire society it large organ meanwhile the media are doing it their best to go after there presumed opponents insane story from busy news targeting another hone my friends hierarchic she is the creator of lies of tiptoe there rib on chip apparently is that because she is posting true stories there are bunch people who read her stories than they send threats this is not called a new story is not it is not if i cover the news and then because i have a very large audience therefore some nuts who go and do nuts things that is not my fault that is the fault of the nuts and yet that is presumably busy news is basically saying that we need to shut down free speech in order presumably to prevent crazy people from doing crazy things thy eve an entire piece from enbucy news titled after lies of tiptoe posted at least twenty one on threats followed now many of these on threats turn out to be hoaxes its on clear we have en sent many these to threats some o the people may not even b followers of this but the goal here is to suggest that social media ought to shut her down based on the activities or rollers now this a super dangerous precedent and it is amazing that a free press is attempting to push that for the free press of all people in america should be really careful about what they wish for here if we are talking about the idea that bad coverage of issues is now to blame for the bad actions of people who cover those issues then the medias can have a law to answer for in america it is perfectly easy to say the black lives matter riot give twenty twenty can be laid almost entirely at the get of the america media if that is the case it's a really easy argument to make but they are going after ciabecaus again this is what the media do the media have decided that freedom of the press only applies to people will agree with them according to entity news hatcheck is not accused of making any bodthreats in wall or anywhere else which means that its not a store we normally when i do not are a on threat there is no story about me if somebody who listens to my show make on threat also not a story about me its story about s person medmonthreat hell get to more on this in just one moment first grand canyon university is a private

that tom it is false that her story was false the story was true but that does not matter end s news's more concerned with trying to smearkhaia by association with people show don't even know quote end s news does fid thirty three instances starting nonmember twenty twenty when people or institution singled out by lies of ticktock later reported boy threats a other violent intimidation the threats which on average cam several days after treats from lies of tiptoe targeted schools library's hospital small business as an elected officials in sixteen states twenty one of the thirty three threats were bomthreats which most commonly targeted schools and were made the a ego absolute insanity that ends news and this geckoes on and on and on and on again the goal of it is to somehow smear reporters for reporting long as the people who follow the reporters a small carry of whom u bad things can somehow be blame on the reporter that that is the got here and this now merges with the blow back that tucker arson is receiving fore doing an interview with laderpoten now i have not seen the interview of ladrpooten you have not seen theinterview with gladerpooten no one is seen the interview with gladmrpooten that interview is supposed that the airwaves to night on a and as have set ism i can a are judge the interview the question is whether'tucker asked him any hard questions or whether it was sort of a massage now i do not know because i have not seen it it will be a bad act of journalism if tucked is not ask him some questions about to have in gershkuitch the the walker general reporter who being held by gladinmerpooten as effectively a hostage or if it does not ask him about what the end of the war looks or version push on his murderous record or is abuse of human rights in his targeting of civilians an u crane and all the restart there are heir bunch questions that tucker aught's be tukkrasn asked any of this question publicly at have no idea what he asked the simple fact that tucker is tucker and went to russia is now causing apparently some people in the e u to think about sanctioning him again this is the unbelievable stupidity of politics people who claim that they have any sort of principle abandoned those principles at the first sign at those principles might be harmful to their political interest it truly is an amazing thing according to newsreel tucker parson's interview with russia president vladimerpooten could see the conservative on at targeted by e law makers currents an former members of the european parliament of told newsreel carbon visited russia this week on tuesday he reviewed that he would soon be releasing interview with gotten parson's work in russia could see the former fox news host in hot water with the e according to give or hosta a former begin prime minister and turn member of the european parliament the law maker described carbon as a mouthpiece for for me present in trump and paten is well adding quote as paten is a war criminal and the u sanctions all who assists to him in that effort it seems logical the external action service examine his case as well now honestly is the best thing that interns a media could happen to tucker having the e target tucker for doing an interview with ladder pouted makes tucker's case for him tuckers an tired case with regard to ladder put ladder's lens has essentially been that the attempts by the media to draw a stark division between ladders lenses ad ministration in u ran and ladder pouters administration in russia is miss begotten that zlensky is engaged in corruption that his engaged in dictatorial behavior by the way there's some truth to lot of what tucker is saying about that in my opinion that still does not justify a full shall russia invasion of ukraine or suggested its an america interest to see u crane fully in busted by russia nor do i believe that ladder pouted somehow has you cranes vest interest at heart all these things can be true at once but if the case the tucker is making is that the e is perfectly happy to shut down freedom of siege but then they complain when vladmerpoutent does it there make in tucker's case for him when they say this according to newsreel the us external action service is the blocks diplomatic arm responsible for foreign policy for an individual to be added to the u sanctions lest evidence must be presented to the e a s for a view if deed sufficient the e s can then present that case to the europeing council which is the body made up of u national leaders which takes the final decision on wether to impose it sanctions or not now again highly unlikely but there are some who are saying that they agree with the stands that tucker should basically be treated as a propaganda on behalf of the creme now i think a highly unlikely that that is is what is going to take place but a demonstrates once again in the same way the media target in hibachi shows it just shows that you violate certain taboos or if you cannot stay on one side of the political isle and not another side of the political political isle all principles with regard to say freespeech go by the wayside now as i say none of that answers the question as whether tucker's general prospective on ukraine is right i happen to think that a general perspective on ran is short sighted and wrong i do not think the world is a better place if ladmerpouten waltzes in to reeve and simply takes it over at this point there there is a a rolling then line on the right that is a problem one o the big divisions con right and left in the united states historically speaking has been that people on the right ten to think that america kicks ask and people on left tent thing not that is by pulling data here for example is some of the polling data from put research center the question was whether the u s stands above all other countries in the world meaning were the best whether the us is one of the greatest countries along with others or whether other countries are better than the u s and what you can see is that over the course of the time period two thousand even to two thousand in twenty three democrats have basically decided on mass that the that no one among the democrats believes that the united states to thegeatest country in the world extremely low number in two thousand eleven thirty one present of democrats said that the united states stood above all other countries in the world as of twenty twenty three that number was nine per cent nine per cents a fewer than one in ten democrats or those who lean democrat believes that america is better than all the other countries in the world when it comes to whether people believe that other countries are better than the united states in two thousand eleven only eight per cent of democrats said that other countries are better than the united states as of twenty twenty three that number is now thirty six per cent thirty six percent of democrats believe over one and three that other countries are better tan the united states which dos raise the question is to why do not you then go to one of those countries who more on this in just one second first for my catholic listeners lent the forty days leading up to master that starts ash wen say february fourteen it is a time of intense prayer fasting and giving hallows annual prove forty challenges one of their most popular last year over a million people joined this year their pray forty challenge focuses on surrender and includes meditations on the powerful book he leader me a story about a priest who become a prisoner and slave in the soviet union during the cold war his story is one of ultimate surrender we are called to offer up our own worries anxieties problems and lives to god there will also be lent music line specific bible stories and other lentil prayers the seven last words of christy with him colvezal halo is truly transformation it will help you connect with your faith on a deeper level what exactly are you waiting for down low that hallo a today that hallo dot come lash paper for a exclusive three month free trial of all six thousand plus prayers and meditations reconnecting with god it is giving those important thing you do on any given day do it with hallo dot come slash our right now that hallo dot come slashabureau but if you look at the republican side of the isle re publicans have been pretty consistent until the very recent past until basically join took office re publicans have been very consistent in their believe that america is in fact bust country in the world in two thousand eleven forty seven per cents of america believed that america was at the best country in the world only five per cent of america believed other countries were better than the united states fast four to twenty nineteen same numbers forty six per cent of republicans believed that america was the best country in the world and only five percent of america believed that other countries were better than the united states but if you fast for to twenty twenty three that number has now dropped fifteen per cents only thirty one per cent of republicans believe that america is better than all the other countries in the world at now seventeen per cent are just under one in five republicans believe that other countries are better than the united states there is a a growing cents and it is connected to jobidon being elected buts not totally due to join being elected there is a growing cents that things are falling apart in the united states and this is playing out in some strange form policy terms and that there is always been sort of this under lying idea on the patio con right that virtually everything goes wrong in the world is due to america over extension that that it is america foreign policy in the post war era that is created all problems nowt this neglects the fact that it was america form policy that defeated legitimately the greatest threat of the twentieth century which was not not germany the greatest threat of the twentieth centuries f the soviet union because that throat lasted literally from the soviet revolt ton of nineteen eighteen all the way forward until nineteen ninety it was a wasting for generation threat and the united states defeated that s that makes for a pretty good foreign policy that is a pretty good foreign policy record and when you point to the shortcomings of america foreign policy since then those are very real but america hegemony has created freedom of the sees america hegemony has crated freedom of trade america hegemony has insured a huge percent of the globe has risen from poverty and yes prison sure the prosperity of america citizens i understand that there is the and bazar notion that america now are living worse than they did in nineteen eighty there is no dated to support us the notion that america were living better in nineteen eighty i profit i just easy question for any one who believes that would you wish to go back and leave in nineteen eighty materially speaking not spiritually speaking materially speaking just intermix the stuff you have the answer is no no one wood because the way that you actually measure wether an economy has move ford is the kinds of products goods and services you can now obtain for your time in the work force again all ill referred to a book called superabundance here by martian up among others that is really good that can a breakdown just how economic progress is worked in the united states the reason that i point the south is because when it comes to things russia verses you crane the question of whether america is a positive forced in the world is very much getting telescopes into a narrative about russia and you crane si has said before you arenouh to be a great lodger's leaky lover to gree that it is not in america interest for russia to widen it is to rest per of governments into you crane you cranes an incredibly large territory it has significant cheap resources it does have ports that are very important to maintain for the west you can also happens to be the borer into virtually all of rope it is huge country mean to understand how vitally important you crane is to the utopian map y have to look at a map of rope in look at you cranes orders here is a picture of what rope look when the soviets were dominating the eastern block at the war saw pack that is the the countries in pinker these were essentially countries that ruled indirectly by the soviet union and as you can see when the soviet union was round the borers of the soviet union when all the way up to grease in the south they went all the way west to austria and west germany in the west and denmark and thy included poland easgermany checks lock hungry romania bulgaria and that went as every one sort of new that the possibility of a serious world war was pretty high outdo you walk across that word from east west germany but symtanks and suddenly world worth a ay in the post war euros that map changes and now what you see is a bunch of newly independent countries that ben broken away from the wars pact and no longer part the work a parties are independent countries the independent governance and history did not stop for these people i was just in poland cave the polish people do not wish to be dominated again by the ruffians they do not if you louodnt know anything about polish vestry but you will realize is that for a very long time for about a we ochery and a half before the reconstitution of poland in the aftromouth of world were one there was no poland who is basally divided up between the rostra vulgarian empire and the ruffians and the polish people have notes ire to be dominated by the ruffians again an and ifyoull that old that old map the ruffians did run poland and that is why the solidarity movement was created it is why plan sought to break free of movie domination and when you go to the new map what you see is a bunch of countries that do not wish to be dominated by the ruffians ranging from finland and sweden in the north houstonia lot of lithuania the basic states those include of course poland if for example russia weren't you take you crane the way that this waxworks bellerous is on the border of russia bellerous is effectively a russia client state sellers was used as a staging point for the invasion of crane in the first place back in twenty twenty two if you crane were to be taken over what you would now see is the ruffians butting up against poland buying up against hungary buying up against romania butting up against much more of western rope it is not an america interest to facilitate cassia's ownership of the resources in you crane nor is it in america interest for russia to now be on the borders of a bunch of other countries that they would then try to break one the other things the coffee from this map is that t e basic states are in serious danger every day of every year estonia lotion lithuania it is only the security guarantees of ado that in sure that russia does not walk over the borders into the basic states how easy would it be for russia to simply take lithuania the enter is really really easy they already run clinic grad a colengrad is is actually a russia territory that exists on the borders of poland and lithuania eve notes not territorially contiguous with russia how easy would who wiselethlania freaking out i lithuania is freaking out and again russia has invaded many of these countries before russia already took over crime which you can see on this map in the south of you ran russia has already taken over parts of georgia as you can see on this map cassia's threaten classic sandwich is also in it south also checking a russia territorial expansion is in america interest especially is not can accost us actual blood the wore to spending money on it all the things can be for once because form policy is really complex i it'll be fascinating to see what tucker actually asks potent about i will but again the basic idea that amebic has no interest in what russia does in you crane even to the expend of spending to money is pretty wild to ma i also point out the many of the people thereat some people wore pretty consist in about not spending money widely people homes massy he is consistent we don't wan spendalot of money on anything including for example social welfare programs a homes masses is in actual physical conservative i dis are the about foreign poly but leases consistent prom mi have of the lot the people who are complaining about spending on u crane for example is that they are perfectly fine with expanding social security benefits medical benefits medicate benefits the are bankrupting the united states in fact the congressional budged office just released a a for that federal interest payments now exceed defend spending for the first time which is an insanestatistic we are now paying more on our federal debt just the interest ten we spend on our military budget every year and that is only going to continue for the rest of time that effectively by the way means that were actual giving money to china to pay off our interest in order is that we can then spend money hon our military which is really bad they the worstspending trench money argument does not work if you are also a person whose in favor of six seven trillion dollar budgets and is unwilling to talk about the restructuring of america national debt and just one second we will get to the situation on america southern border which of course of more interest i think vastly more america than what happens in you crane i care to form policy to but have see the

careers that is daily wire dot come slash careers to day o can meanwhile the situation on the southern border continues to just be a complete mass amazing story out of fox news last night and here is what it says the white house on thursday announce that you us emigration and customs in foremen will soon be forced to reduce operations at the southern border do to lack of funds the white house is now threatening that unless they get the border bill that they want they are going to make it worse at the border nu's be clear about this there is plenty of fun at the border all the wite house have to do is put back in place remain a mexico and all these problems go away all they have to do is replicate border patrol officers away from the processing of illegal emigrants into the america interior and go back do policing illegal immigrants and then quickly to porting them it is all they have to do jor biting can do it right now but instead he is basically threatening to make the problem worse because he is somebody who deeply cares about the border you see press secretary coreengson pare told reporters that because republicans have not passed he by partisan border security agreement with funding for israel in crane the administration is left with no choice but to pull back she said during a gallon our force one yesterday quote because congressional re publicans are choosing partisan politics over our national security and refusing to pass the by partisan at national security agreement that includes significant border reforms in funding over the coming weeks ice will be forced to reduce operations because of budget short falls all is that what is what is happening right now in the middle of the biggest emigration wave in america history your love to reduce operations cause you do not haven of money your only spending seven trillion dollars a year i believe you i do not believe this is just a gambit in order to make the problem worse as a threat ai mean you wont o talk about people who do not america it is hard to argue love america when your basically threatening that unless you get a bill that's let us you off to hook for your own border molfeasintrican make the border worse that is an amazing amazing statement and also points out why politically it is foolish for re publicans to the senate to be talking bandits time to get something done now listen there are things that the senate could do that would be truly worth while really tied jobidon's hands they really tied jobidon's hands how be worth while but again have read the border bill it does not tie jobidon's hands in any serious way when i comes to implementation of the borderbill the executive branch is still going to be using proctorial discretion the executive branch is still going to be directing asylum officers to let people into the country on their own recognizance the change in the asylum definition what have to be strictly and coherently a plied which is something jobidon has really shown little interest in doing remember the currenasylum standard is the you have to show a real fear of going back your home country to clam asylum and that has now turned an implementation under jobidon into just saying the magic words now normally if there is a legal burden on me to show for example tat have a credible fear of going back to my home country's have to show you a policy procedure a set of dead threats they would make it impossible be for me to go back to my home country it you are trying to escape bolivia because you are the target of an actual drug car tell and you can show theme documentation of this is the case that be a good case but that is not whats happening people are hung up in the border saying the magic words and being released into the interior now all that will happen is they will sate new magic words and be released into the interior what is an i understand that senators want to get things done i understand that they feel lie they can get nothing done in the senate under these polarized circumstances the polarization is being exacerbated by the executive branch that means one of two things either the legislative branch has to act in tandem not to work against one another but to tie the executive's hands you the members the legislative have to be oriented against the executive branch and tie the executive branch's hands or there will not be any common ground that is worth fighting for yesterday senator christmerfyive connecticut he treated out of speech by enter names landlord who's the oklohom up senator who is been pushing for the borderbill in which landlord talks about how problems are not being solved in the senate in order for a problem to be solved in the senate the question is who are you orienting against you are not orienting against the problem of a of a open boarder that is not what your orienting against you're orienting against the problem of an executive branch that toes not care about the law which means than less you are actively forcing the executive branch into the corner you are build does not to squat that is the problem here's lank for yesterday on present wen o to yes to be able to move on this bill we change in the wall i understand we have differences but we have got to you sit down together figure out hamburg an a all problems because the america people sent us here to do that nay shall again the america people sent you to solve the border problem that problem is not solvable unless you tie the executives hands the demicratarn' can't do it no dead that is effectively what we are talking about right here now meanwhile the senate is moving on to it is next priority which was always really the foreign aid an all the stuff got tied together despite the fact that it you'd been disaggregated from the start and i got tied together for variety of reasons its started off as just a series of standalone bit one for a do crane one parade israel onephrae tigon and a borderbil and then what happened is that hoiden tied together e crane and israel and re publicans who are kind of dice on the crane aid because we have already spent an extraordinary amount s money in crane blue there is in fact to wing of the republican party the is not rely care what happens in gave and because of that democrats tied the two together the understand republicans want the israel eight and thenderstand democrats want the cranage and then republicans in the senate said o ka well if you are tying not together than rurgnati and something you do not a borderbill and then republicans in the senate proceeded to ritepry bad borderbill sends being stripped out and now there can be attempt to again tied together the craned and the israel aid according to the waste journal send at democrats tried on wednesday to pin down morgue piece support for a bill that provide military aitsucrane israel and other allies the broader measure was the product of four months of by partisan negotiations by republicans made a clear that the one including the borderbill had no path forward with the broader mess dead send at majority leader chucktumer move to schetually procesrael votes wo advanced narrower ninety fie billion dollar version of the package that fun urine israel ans i wan but exclude border security provisions there a still hurtles that our emerging on all of this asked in the early evening if re publicans could guarantee the votes for slim down for anadem package if they got the border related amendment votes that some wanted see at minority which john tune said those a good questions and we do not have any answers at the moment unclear whats can a happen with the with any aid bill moving forward meanwhile what is truly amazing is that again the more controversial provision the one that that obviously has plotted to be attached to it is the far larger are package directed crane there is significant by partisan support for actual support for israel in fact the house attempted to move an israel ad bill on tuesday for about seventeen point six billion dollars and they got two hundred and fifty votes for id which again count those votes that is including dozens of democrats bunch of democrats voted against that bill many of those democrats voted against the bill because they wanted a paired with e crane or never but that is an overwhelmingly popular bill it's by partisan bill in the senate will majority leader stumer even bring that up hoiden is pledged to redo it by the way which demonstrates once again the democrats are scared of their wild left wing base their scared of the respected to lead to c wing of the democratic party which by the way those people are nuts there are nuts theta to lead is a nutjob she is a terror supporting nutjob orshietad to lead the congress woman from deorbormichian heresy was yesterday on the floor suggesting that benjamin at to now who the primeministr of israel is a genocidal maniac which is amazing thing to suggest from a lady who has never had a bad word to say about the october seventh genocide massacre attempt against news in southern israel also i am really enjoying e spectacle of democrat morons and their lackeys in the media pretending that benjamin at now who the prime minister of israel is the sole power in israel right now he is part of a unity for the thousandth time a unity government involving his political opposition the people of israel and their political re presentative are united at this point that baby's even talking ow bringing ya your lapsed who is his chief political opposition to some sort of unity government part he has his his biggest opponent any goes already part of the war cabinet but again this is all a bunch of that it is its its a clown show for people who are very very friendly toward terrorist people rshueto leave here she was yesterday i oppose begin a who war crimes and want him gone to by many of my collie that continue to tell me that do not want a condition to eight they give it to a jenathidomaniac my message to those to my college the thimble if you do not support net tin yah if you're discussed by the costless that of the lifeless children pulled out of the rubble if you actually believe in upholding human wite in internatalaw to no on a blank check to begin yahoos verified by the way she wants compass refunded that is what she would meanwhile to we again has the brainpower of a come quit she is out they are doing the same thing she suggests that what is going on the gossip is not war it slaughters who first tell so one should inform her what war actually is generally a lot f people w get hurt and died is why work bad that is why war is bad it is in fact a war i know because the ware not a war once headboard of surrendered already and compass refuses to surrender in fact cross came out yesterday and said no to a deal on hostages what were their demands for some sort of hostage deal their hostage deal was that they wanted israel to stop all operations in gosh and leave them in pleas in the fossa strip after the worst terror attack on juesince world war to thing that is certainly not going to happen that is that that is what the action when they want israel to turn over preymuch every murderer that it has not custody back to compass we have commassand place and maybe then they'll get some hostages back by the way intelligence report suggest a huge number the hostages who were held already dead you are talking at least thirty hostages dead probably another twenty who are dead is well but here is to c complaining about the situation in the gosistrip which corse tod be over literally to morrow if commassurrendered more than one thousand two hundred is rallies were killed on october seven and a hundred and thirty six remain hostage in response twenty seven cousin four hundred and seventy eight polletinian have been killed seventy presents of whom our women and children and most grand to dart can not reach high fully functioning hospital this is not war is is slaughter o a what is point out at this point that twenty thousand common fighters have either been wounded or killed in this war the number she citing includes my ten thousand terra when she says women and children we should also recognize that many of the people wo are classified as pointing what children are sixteen year old boys who work with compass to reality the i wish it worst the reality it is in fact the reality of the situation an again comose reject to the sense fire this week this week it is these delusional democrats to whom jobidon seems to want to cave which is course is absolutely pathetic ardiguise the rest of the shoe continues right now we will be joined by montane tucker to discuss hour controversial appearance at the crammers i you are not a ember become member used coacher check for to months frank lane plans clicked that link in the

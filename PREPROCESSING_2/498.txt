welcome to the superman japonicas o science science take to or i manner supermen and i may professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public along those lines i want a thank to day's sponsors of the podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens an the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called gopmicrobiom and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer the give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of date and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carevascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium an potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element to cam slash superman to day's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness we are going to discuss jet lag shift work babies kids and the elderly and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science that means quality pure reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things jet lag offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the new born child the adolescent any one that wants to sleep better feel better when they are awake et camera if you have listen to the previous three episodes of the hubris labpodcast we have been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness how to fall asleep how to stay asleep and we have been discussing parameters light exercise temperature et camera if you've had a chance to listen to those episodes great to day's discussion will be even more digestible for you if you have not that is o we i will provide a lo bit of background here or there that it is not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes but if o u get a chance to listen to the please do it i think it will help you digest the information better let us just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we are talking about we are talking about and indoginess meaning within us rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm the circadian rhythm is a twenty four hour rhythm in all sorts of functions the most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness believe or not the experiment has been done throughout history not often but it is been done where people will go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time they're also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time but because people can close their eyes it is actually easier to do the experiment where your inconstant darkness to address the question of what is the indigenous meaning the internal rhythm that we all have and it turns out we all have this rhythm of about twenty four hours although it is not exactly twenty four hours meaning every twenty four hours your body temperature goes from low to his and back down below again and it takes twenty four hours for that to repeat not eighteen not six twenty four pluserminus a couple hours you also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that we tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling getting lower and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing this is a biological fact it is right down to our donna we have she genes in every single one of ourselves that insure that every cell is on this twenty four hour is rhythm close to twenty four hours we have a clock over the roof of our mouth a group of neurons called the supercaismatic nucleus that clock generates at twenty for our rhythm and that clock is in trained meaning it is matched to the external light dark cycle which is no surprise twenty four hours spending the earth takes twenty four hours our sells our organs our wakefulness our temperature but also our metabolism our immune system our mood all of that is tethered to the outside light dark cycle and if we are we living our life in a perfect way where we wake up in the morning and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon and then by evening we catch a little sunlight and then at night were in complete darkness we will be more or less perfectly match to the external or ambient light dark cycle very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights and this other thing that we call life demands to day we are in a talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm now you may immediately be thinking well have heard there are night owls and there are morning larks there sometimes called and their genetic pulling amorphism that is just to fancy name for genetic variations that make some people won o wake up early and other people wont to stay up late an teens want to sleep in more sure that is all true that is all true regardless of what names we give those however there is no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species we were designed literally our sells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and a sleep at night how do i know that well i was not consulted at the design phase but ism certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal we can pull it off but serious health effects both mental and physical start to arise ism not on to spend much of to day talking about all the negative effects of jet lag ill talk a little bit about it or the negative effects of shift work or trying to scary you by telling you about the quite validate round depression amnesia de geisha all the terrible things that happen when you are not sleeping well rather it'd to focus on what you can do an army with tools s let us talk about that perfect schedule for a moment and then let us talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag shift your clock faster and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet law including just feeling miserable when your travelling for work or vacation what is the perfect day what what does that look from a circadian sleep wakefulness standpoint ism about to summarize what have said in the three prove out podcast episodes as well as now countless in stereogram posts here is the deal you basically want to get as much light ideally sunlight but as much light into your eyes during the period of each twenty four hour cycle when you want to be awake when you want to be alert and you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times you've that twenty four hour cycle when you want to be asleep were drowsy and falling asleep how much is enough well you do not want to go high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of heard me say before the eyes are actually to pieces of your brain your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull and as pieces of the central nervous system a ka your brain they will not regenerate least right now the technologies do not exist to regenerate those neurons and humans you do not want to damage them what is to bright well when it is painful to look at when you have to blinker close your eyes in order to bear it please do not look at very bright lights painful that there likely on a damage your eyes however if you get up in the morning and it is still dark out and you want to be awake you would be wives to turn on artificial lights in particular overhead lights for reasons have discussed previously but those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons these bellhops and cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock when the sun comes out even if there is cloud cover the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live unless you live in a cave people have said to me well i live in an area where i cannot really see the sun wen the sun is there it might be hot hiding behind clouds unless it is very very dark where you live skin and via in the depths of winter which case you might want some artificial light get some sunlight in your eyes when you can here is the deal with sunlight and artificial light that i have not discuss previously a lot of photon energy a high amount of lucks ill you acts comes through even cloud cover a good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb is to try and get exposure to at least a hundred thousand lucks before nine a m ten a m maybe but before nine a m assuming your waking up sometime between five and eight a m get a hundred thousand lucks now you do not i want to repeat you do not want to stare at a two hundred thousand lucks or a one hundred thousand luck's light it is very very bright the mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof or your mouth and that system sums meaning it adds photons it is a very so system let us say that i wake up and i look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen that is probably five hundred to a thousand lucks if i were to look at that for a full minute i would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy v her on and i would be communicated to my circadian clock however the signal that it is morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless i looked at that for a hundred minutes or more hundred thousand now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock you are not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what is called the circadian depones you have this opportunity before nine a m maybe ten a m to capture enough photons and you have to do it with your eyes have discussed why that is important in previous episodes of the lock cast be have to do it with your eyes there is no dextrocular photo reception this is not about it em in de in your skin this is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health here were trying out trying to get that at least a hundred thousand photons but not all at once but you got ta get him before nine a m is may be ten a m what you do you go outside if you want to get nutty about this quantitative you could download o free a light meter and take a look around your house with light meter and you will notice that even bright overhead lights are only a sitting about four thousand or five thousand lucks is on to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain anybody that is morning going outside even on a cloudy day could be seven thousand ten thousand lucks tush really remarkable how bright it is meaning how much photon energy is coming through trying get a hundred thousand lucks be for that nine a m now if you cannot do that because you live in an area of the world where it is just not bright enough some people have sent me pictures from northern inland is just not bright enough in winter then sure you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons and ism putting out this hundred thousand lucks number as as a target to get each day before nine a m you can in theory get it all from artificial lights but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus first fall is free if it is a available outside there is a a number of different there are scum me a number of different technologies coming this one a light pad that this one says it is a nine hundred and thirty lucks ism not uncovering this e cause ism not trying to promote any specific products rashly bought this just with my own money on amazon we're not a sponsor then it let us you toggle the brightness i think by holding this on a holding down this button you can make at dimmer brighter this about a thousand lucks it seems really bright but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfless in that kind of thing near their coffee or work station fir sting in the morning but you really want to get sunlight o c those things are come ton nice cause they will travel and were in a talk about jet lag but i cannot emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and sued before you enter the circadian redone which is the middle of the day this is again trying to achieve cone perfect schedule then have recommended based on scientific literature that you look at sunlight some time around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it had just down the sensitivity of your eyes because here is the diabolical thing while we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock and repair us for a good night's sleep fourteen to sixteen hours later it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after eight p m and that is why you want to as much as you safely in avoid bright light and even not bright light between the hours of ten or eleven p m an for i m a number of people have asked me some questions about this and the last episode i went into red lights ho discuss blue blockers all that kind of stuffsonuck an a repeat all that but here is the thing if you see afternoonlight you are going to a just down the sensitivity of your eyes that you have a little bit more will room a low bet more lee way to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without destructing your circadian clock but it is a kind of a doubled sort where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day have mentioned studies on here a number of view of asked about getting the references we are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links there some copy right issues that we have to deal with but wherever possible it'll try in reference these studies and when people ascot generally put them in the response to their comments on you tuber insigram there have been two studies done from universe colorado both published in current biology you can ease we find these on line by just a long the words a current biology camping and reset circadian clocks that have shown that two days a waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night that she took graduatesuens camping the cool experiment be a part of reset the melatonin and quarts all rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms there are other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock exercising more o less the same time eating more less the same time et camera that is not what to day's episode sabots i just describe perfect schedule get at least a hundred thousand looks of light exposure to the eyes not all at once but summing across the morning again when it is too much because it is painful to look at that is obviously something to avoid but then once the middle of the day let say you are waking up at ten or eleven you go outside the suns overhead forget your i can shift your clock you are just not it does not work the way in the evening you see the evening light and you want to get that light to a just down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer that late at night if you happen ta look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle the night it is nothing to shift your clock because it takes probably only about a thousand to fifteen hundred lucks of light energy a shift your clock in the mill the night let us talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lag person this ability to shift the clock with light temperature exercise and food is vitally important for getting on to the new local schedule and there is much out there about jet lag to day ism going diet down to one very specific perimeter that all of you can figure out without any technoledgey our devices and can apply for when when you travel for work or pleasure or any time your jet lag and i want to absolutely emphasize that you do not have to travel to get jet lag many of you are jet lag your jetlag because you are king your phone in the middle the night your jet lag as you are waking up at different times to day your jet lag because your exercises on a and chaotic regime some days at this time some days at that time and if that works for you great i want to be really clear that a number of people always say well i know and that you in only needed four hours asleep and ah or there just fine they travel to rope and just find there is a lot of individual variability we arguing to talk about the origins of some of that versatility may i know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and om a body wait and and fitness ability and i know some people that they eat one cracker and they for one dissolve into a puddle of of a kind of tears right because they think that that sun o throw them off and and maybe it does i do not know there is a tremendous amount of variability out there this is really about optimal and what is possible and you have to ask i can just say from personal experience i suffer terribly from jet lag traveling in certain directions but not others some people do not have trouble with jet lag many people will travel to new location they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back on to a normal schedule and some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jetlag it does not work that way fit work that way i would tell you but there are some simple things that you can do an arm you with the knowledge of what jetlag is and how it works and contrary to what many people out there say and believe i know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility we understand mechanism as juxtaposed to me just writing up a belief and giving you a list of things to do well what happens when you cannot do those things in exactly the way they are written down when you understand mechanism you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system your nervous system a littlest of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way that is wherewereaheaded let us talk about what jetlag is cat well i promised that i would not get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jetlag but ism about to get dark there are quality previewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life it will kill you earlier i guys it means you will die earlier does not actually kill you necessarily although there are many cases where tourist and up stepping in front of busses especially in countries where the cars and busses drive on the opposite side of the street that there used to a who jetlag and lose their life that way jetlag is a serious thing should we had a it a family story about this when i was growing up and a family member travel over sees for work and take a sleeping pill i will not name the sleeping pill though the anemic a talk about sleeping pills and had a case of totalamnesia for a week ah that is not entirely uncommon if you have ever been really jet lag and fallen asleep does not even have to be the middle of the day woken up you might not know where you are and that is because time and space ire really linked and the brain was not design to be transported four five six hours into a new times own it just was not our brain in the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours not necessarily six or nine or twelve hours you really mess yourself up have had that experience i usually experienced as fluctuations in mood i flew twelve hours out of phase tobadobby ones to give a talk and why you abbdaubi and it was a mess i actually am was getting vertigo am i was not hallucinating but i was really out of it and my mood was just all over the place is very bazaar jet lag even if you do not experience it as mood shifts or amnesia it can shorten your life now here is what is interesting traveling westward on the globe is always easier then traveling eastward it is interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west now of course traveling thirty minutes into a new times own or three hours just one times own over is or two times on over rather is far less and detrimental to your biology in psychology then a eight hour shift or nine hour shift now here is what is interesting when we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it contorted our lives we have to ask ourselves why why is that and it turns out there is a pretty simple explanation for this we have talk before about the autonomic nervous system this set of neurons in our spinal cord in body an brain that regulate our wakefulness in our sleepiness turns out that human beings and probably most species are better able to activate and stay alert then they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand if you really have to push and you rally have to stay awake you can do it you can stay up later but falling asleep earlier is harder and that is why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it that because you've traveling east you are trying to go to bed earlier as a californium if i go to new york city have got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early much harder than coming back to californium and just staying up a few more hours and this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food or fight or do any number of different things that we can push ourselves through the release of a adrenalin an upon from to stay awake whereas being able to slow down and and deliberately fall asleep is shall much harder to do there is an a symmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the cemetery of jetlag if you want a read up on this because people of asked me about papers you can look there is a paper published by davidson and colleagues two thousand six in cryobiology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward verses westward verses no travel and longevity in et camera a number different biological markers of longevity going east is harder because going to sleep earlier as harder if you are trying to do that on demand many people to have turned to melatonin as a way to trying an duce sleepiness ism a talk about melatonin at the end of mentioned on previous podcast a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems melton is a hormone and it'll discuss that at the end in particular the roll of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway than valve utilizing hormone testastrona men and estrogen in females as well as a really interesting peptide called kisspepton as a codename all right l let us think about travel and what happens let us say you are not going eastward or westward but you are going north or south if you go from for instance washington d c to lentigo chile or you go from tell of eve israel to a cape town south africa you are just going north and south right and not you either direction you are not really moving into a different timezone you are not shifting you will experience travel fatigue and turns out that jetlag has too elm its travel fatigue and times own jet lag time's own jet lag is simply the inability of local unlike and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm this indodginous rhythm that you have before we get too complicated and two down in the weeds about this i wanted just throw out a couple important things first of all i mention this earlier but some people suffer from jet lag lot other people not much most people experience worst jet lag as they get older there are reasons for that because early in life patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children it is one of the reasons why they do not undergo puberty than it become cyclic during purity meaning it comes on once every twenty four hours and turns off once every twenty four hours at cycles cyclic and then as we get older the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule et camera meal times right jetlag gets worse as we age in addition the other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise the digestion can get worse et camera some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older people who are willing to have a regular exercise machine can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock and have a good friend of his fathers in his eighties ah he is still you pushing out twenty five thirty push ups a each morning he is on the pelatoner whatever it is doing a lost cyclings o some eight year old or doing that many or not an many thirty year old are not but if you have a regular exercise program that is can to make it age easier to shift your circadian clock for sake of jet lag and it is actually a nob you can turn and you can let leverage for shifting your clock before go any further i want a make changing your internal rhythm really easy or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it i believe when i want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body an brain which is called your temperature minimum a most of your approximate weight some of you must even know your blood pressure some you might even know your your a body mass neck some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names but every one should know their temperature minimum your temperature minimum does not require a thermometer to measure although you could measure it your temperature minimum is the point in every twenty four hours cycle when your temperature is lowest now how do you measure that without a thermometer it tends to fall ninety minutes to two hours before your avert waking time si don't repeat that your temperature minimum tens to fall ninety minutes to two hours before your average waking time let say you are not traveling and your typical wake up time is five thirty a m your temperature minimum is very likely three thirty a m or four a m if you want if any of you want too you can measure your temperature minimum you can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for twenty four hours on can fine your temperature minimum what you are going to find is that you have a low point the temperature minimum and then your temperature will start to rise you will wake up a bout two hours later then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak maybe a little trough sometimes that happens and then it will start declining slowly as your approachnight timeshare are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern sands cold baths in tens exercise et camera meals ten have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips but the overall cycle twenty for our cycle of temperature has this pattern and last time i talked about the seminal work of cotakahashe and others who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the rotor your mouth in trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same statue temperature is the effector and once you hear that there should be an immediate of course because how else would you get all these different diver cell types to follow one pattern rite a pancreatic sell does something very different then a a a spleen cell or a a neuron right there all doing different things at different rates the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment temperatures vary from person of person some people are ninety eight point six some people run a l colder at camera but the you have a low point you have a high point no your temperature minimum how are you con to figure out this temperature minimum the temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times let say you wake up seven a m right a m three a m mart happens take those ad them together average them by take adding them up and dividing by the number of days that will give you the average if you're one of these people that wakes up at three am and then goes back to sleep and sleep till ten your wake up time with ten a m if you use an alarm clock your wake up time is still when you get up ki i know thalarmclocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized i use an alarm clock many people wake up at exactly the same time each day there tends to be some variation for people some people it is get a very depending on life circumstances but average that for three to seven days or take that wake up time you can then get an a ridge or sort of typical temperature minimum of now how to get your temperature minimum your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock whether notes for jetlag or shift work or some other purpose here is the deal if you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours maybe five or six but in the four hours after your temperature minimum your circadian clock we will shift that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days it's what is called a phase advance if you would to read up on this further you advance your clock of however if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum you will tend to phase delay your clock you will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later comminute repeat this because there is much confusion out there an people to got circadian time an all this find your temperature minimum i tend to wake up at about six a m sometimes six thirty sometimes seven it depends a lot on what i was doing the right before as ism guessing it does for you but that means that my temperature minimum it is probably somewhere right around for thirty a m which means that if i wake up it at four thirty a m and i were to view bright light at four thirty five a m ism going to advance my clock ism going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning and as i shift my wake up time my temperature minimum shifts too right because each time we shift our wake up time our temperature minimum shifts assuming that wake up time shifts more than thirty men our an hour of if i were to view bright light in the for to six hours before for thirty a m guess what the next night amino want to stay up later and ism git to want to wake up later the subsequent morning your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading again if you want a measure your temperature minimum figure out what it is ninety eight point whatever ninety six point whatever that is fine you can do that but that information will not help you what you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or just after that time viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier and the four hours before your temperature minimum viewing light will make you want to stay up later now some people might be saying while i wake up early and i want to stay up late in um sleepy all day an mum mess or i feel fine look let us talk about feeling fine turns out the define of definition of insomnia is when your experiencing excessive sleepiness s during the day sleepiness and fatigue are different ski going the world of sleep medicine fatigue is a physical exhaustion sleepiness is falling asleep my falling asleep is at your desk are falling sleep during lectures or there seems to be something special about my lectures that makes people want a fall asleep if this curesure in sonic fantastic however in all seriousness sleepiness during the day time unless it is around your temperature peak and only asks about ninety minutes or is a sign of in sonic it is a sign of lack of sleep i want o be very very clear that if your temperature minimum you can shift your clock using light you can also shift your clock by engaging in exercise in the four hours after your temperature minimum to wake up earlier on subsequent nights or exercise before then to delay your clock ski now you can start to sea an understand the the logic of this system and will talk about why this work sand the underlying biology but understanding that temperature is the effector and understanding that you have this low point in the that reflects your most sleepy point essentially right before waking up and then temperature rises you can now start to shift that temperature according to your travel needs here is one way in which you might do that let say i am going to travel to rope which is nine hours ahead typically from californium i would want to determine my temperature minimum which for me is about for thirty a m may be five a m and i would want to start getting up at about five thirty a m and getting some bright light exposure presume me from artificial sources because the light the sunlight is not to be out at that time maybe oven exercising as well maybeven eating a meal at that time if that is in your practice you would want a start doing that two or three days before travel because once you land in were i land in rope chances are just viewing the sunrise or sunset in rope is not going to allow me to shift my circadian clock some people say get sunlight in your eyes when you land but that is not in a work because one of two things is likely to happen with a nine hour shift that either i am going to vise sunlight at a time that corresponds to the circadian redone the time in which my circadian clock cannot be shifted or ism an end up viewing sunlight at a time that corresponds to the fort of six hour window before my temperature minimum it is gin to shift me in exactly the opposite direction that i want to go it can be very very challenging for people to a just o jet lag you need to ask in my traveling east or are my chilling west if i trying to advance my clock or delay my clock remember viewing light exercise in eating in the forty six hours before your temperature minimum will delay your clock eating viewing sunlight and exercising you do notate do all three but some combination of those in the forty six hours afteryour temperature minimum will advance your clock and this is a powerful mechanism by which you can shift your clock anywhere from one to three hours per day which is remarkable that means your temperature minimum is going a shift out as much as three hours which can make it such that you can travel all the way to rope and in as long as you have prepared for a day or by doing what i described back home and then doing it when you arrive you can potentially o accomplish the entire shift within anywhere from twenty four to thirty six hours and this is really important emphasize that once you arrive in your new location and here ism toying about travelling eastward californium to rope once you arrive in your new location you have to keep track of what your temperature minimum was back home and how it is being shifted during your trip now it is much easier to do than you think one of the unfortunate consequences of the smart phone is that you cannot do a something goofy wearing two watches one watch that corresponds to the time back home an another one that corresponds to the local time typically it up dates automatically based on why et camera but if you can keep track of the time back home then you can easily shift your clock going forward ism hoping this to make sense i really not emphasis that you do not have to be precise down to the minute some of you may be asking what what about you have got this temperature minimument if have you light one minute before it then ism going to delay my clock and one minute after it ism gin to advance my clock it does not quite work that ski but it is very important understand that light is the primary way in which we can shift our clock and now you should also be able to understand things the circadian redone from about nine thirty ten a m all the way until six hours before your temperature minimum your not can shift your clock nothing that you do in that time in terms of light viewing behavior feeding et camera is gan a shift your clock and a lot of people are landing in rope getting sunlight in their eyes and throwing their clock out a wack or not shifting their clock at all this brings me to the other thing that is highly recommended and have mention this before but you want to eat on the local meal schedule if it is in your practice to fast fast that is fine but when you eat you want to eat within the local schedule for alertness of that means if you arrive in every one's eating breakfast and you cannot stomach the idea of breakfast your new location causeyour appetite is an there that means the clock in your liver you have a clock in your liver biological clock has not caught up to the new timezone you can for rest yourself to eat if you or you can skip that meal but what you do not want to do is stay on your home meal schedule waking up in the mill the night and eating that is really on to throw things off because a lot of the clocks in the periphery from the the liver the puerperal body we will send information back to the brain then the brain is getting really conflicted signals the temperature minimum is really your anchor point for shifting your clock best i do not know why this information really has not made it into am the popular sphere quite much there is all sorts of stuff about taking things melatonin a using by normal bet's a lotic an a a more sophisticated complicated and potentially problematic a ways of trona shift the clock let us talk about melatonin but first i just want a paws and shift gears a little bit because i talked about travelling eastward but we have not talked about travelling westward i want to do that now let us say your traveling from new york to californium or from rope to californium the challenge there tends to be how can you stay up late enough now some people are able to do this because as i mentioned earlier the autonomic nervous system is asymmetrically wired such that it is easier to stay up late later than we would naturally want to then it is to go to sleep earlier let us sat you land and it is four p m and your just dying you are in californium you came from rope it is four p m an your you really really want to go to sleep that is where the use of things affine exercise and sunlight can shift you right if it is after your temperature peak then viewing sunlight around six p m or eight p m or a artificial light if there is in sunlight we will help shift you later right it is combe it is going a delay your clock and you can be able to stay up later the worst thing you can do is take an a that was intended to last twenty minutes or an hour i do this routinely and then wake up four hours later or you wake up at ye and it is midnight and you cannot fall back asleep you really want to avoid doing that provided it is not excessive amounts stimulants affine in coffeyour tea can really help you push past that afternoon barrier and get you to sleep more on the local schedule and eating on the local schedule as well a number of people of at about the use of melatonin to induce sleepiness are it well it is think about what melatonin is melanoma is this hormone that is release from the pine gland which is a gland a couple notes about the panel cause i begetting a lot of questions about this a pregnant ransom fire for this but a it'd it'd be happy to have a a thoughtful consider it debate a with some previewed papers in front of us the panel does make this hallusengenic molecule they call d m t but in such miniscule amounts that it is not responsible for the hallucinations you see an sleep in dreaming sorry folks it is also not responsible for the hallucinations you might see through other approaches to de empty it is just not that is not where the debate comes from it is infantestimally small amounts there are a lot of con a wacky claims out there about calcification of the pineal and fluoride and this kind of thing book the panel sits in an area of the brain near the fourth vertical where the skull is not terribly far away although there some overeating neral tissue and with age there is some aggregation of some of the a meninges and other things around there that that stick to the skull young brains do not look old brains but there is no calcification of the pineal all right you can forget about calcification the pineal are problem i soft know where that whole thing got started but om that is none issue your pinole will churn out melatonin whole life melatonin induces sleepiness melatonin during development is also responsible for timing the secretion of certain hormones that are vitally important for puberty does melanoma control the on set of puberty not directly but indirectly melatonin inhibit something called ganatitropan releasing hormone which is a hormone that is released from your hypothalamus also roughly above the rufryour mouth in your brain can naturobeen releasing hormones really interesting cause it stimuli stimulates the release of another hormone called utilizing hormone which in females causes a estrogen to be released within the ovaries involved in reproductive cycles and in males stimulates testosterone from the certify cells of of the of the testes melatonin is inhibitory to gan a h gantry releasing hormone and therefore is inhibitory to eh utilizing hormone and therefore is inhibitory to testastron an estrogen just no always about it there is it men amount of data on the fact that high levels of melatonin in season breathing animal breeding animals takes the ovaries from nice and robust ovaries that are capable of deploying eggs and this kind of thing and literally shrinking them and making these animals in fertile these are very high levels of melatonin in seasonal breeders in winter melatonin in males of seasonal breathers takes the testis and shrinks them long ago when i was at you see berley is a master student was working on neronecronology and we are working on om this hamster species of seasonal breeders and basically when days are long which inhibits melatonin these little a liberia hamsters as are called have testes about the size of or f typical table grapes although that is a weird way to put it when days get shorter and the melatonin signal gets longer because light in habits melatonin days get shorter melton gets longer those same hamsters would have testes that would involute to the size of about of grain of rice now this does not happen in humans in short days but none the less the melatonin signal really does have a ton of effects on the homo system now does that mean that if you've been taking melatonin you have really screwed up your hormones not necessarily does it mean if a kid has been taking melatonin that is really screwing up their puberty not necessarily inheres why melatonin operates on a concentration level in a child that is very very small that has high levels of melatonin it acthlcan inhibit g an r h l h testosterone estrogen depending on it the sex of the child but as that child grows through other mechanisms grothomon release et camera that same amount melatonin released from the pineal is now diluted over a much larger body the concentration actually goes waylay down but here is the problem was supplementing melatonin as i mention the previous episode concentrations of melatonin in many commercial supplements have been show to be anywhere from eighty five per cent to four hundred per cent of what is listed on the bottle when you take melatonin or a child takes melatonin oftentimes they are taking super physiological levels of melatonin which at least by my read and the literature says that it could have dramatic effects on timing and course of things puberty it is not much that the journals have come out saying o taking a that melatonin inhibits puberty its that no single study has been done with the superphysiological levels of melatonin that are present in a lot of these supplements in developing children melatonin is used widely for inducing sleepiness when you want a fall sleep in the new location that you have arrived in you cannot fall sleep you take melatonin helps you fall sleep it does not help you stay a sleep in addition to that melatonin has been kind of toured as the best way to shift your circadian clock ism happy to go on record saying it look if you need melatonin you can work with a doctor or somebody who really understand circadian and sleep biology go for it if that is your thing but i as always on this podcast and elsewhere i i have alias toward behavioral things that you can titrate and control exposure to exercise temperature et camera that have much bigger margins for safety and certainly do not have these other indican effects that we have been thinking about and talking about if you not take melatonin the afternoon in order to fall asleep or in the evening be my guests that is up to you again your responsible for your health not me but for many people melatonin is not going to be the best solution the best solution is going to be to use light an temperature and exercise on either side of the temperature minimum to shift your clock both before your trip and when you land in your you location in you clock starts to shift o case now my opinions about melatonin feel free to felt earth through your own opinions and experiences with melatonin and now you also understand what your temperature minimum is and how it represents an important landmark either side of which you can use light temperature and exercise to shift your clock just remind youlobit about temperature if you wan a shift your clock typically you would do that by you take a hot shower and then that will have a cooling effect after the to shower and if you were to get into a cold shower or an ice bath if you have access to one afterward you there is going to be a thermagenic effect of your body increasing temperature and if you just think about your natural rhythm back home when everything stable you have ut i nay deer a low point in which is your temperature minimum and then you have a peak and you think about when you are doing this hot or cold shower in that rhythm now you should be able to understand how you are shifting your rhythm that temperature rhythm is the one that is going to move give you an example if i were to wake up in the morning and less i i wake up six six a m my temperature i know is rising have passed my temperature minimum if i were to get into a hot shower that would then lower my body temperature when i got out that is not normally with happening first thing in the morning and therefore my clock would very likely get faze delight i it is gin to delay the increase in temperature wherever as if i got to a cold shower something i do not personal to do but have done from time to time er an ice bath that is going to then have a rebound increase in body temperature and is going to phase advance my clock that peak in the afternoon is going to come about an hour earlier isn't want to go to bed earlier later that night see can start to play these games with timing and hot and cold with meals whether not you eat or you do not eat and with light exposure whether not you video light or you do not view light o now you can start to see why understanding the for mechanics of a system can really give you the most flexibility because i could spend the next twenty five years of my life answering every question about every aunt's pattern of travel well we are going to kidney then we are going there what should i do but that is on you you need to figure out your temperature minimum and your temperature peak if you and then use these parameters to it gives you flexibility and that really underscores the most important thing is that when you understand mechanism it is not about being nauradically attached to a specific protocol it is the opposite it gives you power to not be naurodicaly attached to a specific protocol it can youyou great confidence and flexibility in being able to shift your body rhythms however you want when things get you back you tuck them right back into place one thing that is a common is that people need to do a quick trip it is not always at you are going to go to on vacation for two weeks or you'll works me place else for weeks on end if your trip is forty eight powers or less stay on your home schedule this can be tough and it may require set killing meetings according to your home schedule but if you can somehow manage that the best thing to do would be to stay on your homeschedule your clock is not going to shift more than a couple hours even if you do everything correctly in one day okas if i were to travel say to rope have actually done this i did a twenty four hour trip to nozzle switzil and gave a talk and came back people thought it was crazy but halo bit of travel fatigue cause remember there is fatigue from the actual travel experience the novelty of it the earns never great on the plains this was even true before there were mask requirements anythings that there is the travel fatigue but you do not throw your clock off if you stay forty eight hours then you start to shift a little bit seventy too that is when you tart running into trouble the transit time is all important but i would say if it is three days or less stay on your home schedule as much as you can and because sunlight is not under your control muster something about you i do not know that is when traveling with some sort of bright light the light pad that i have down there that i showed earlier om for those your listen just on audio it is just it that looks a eight and a half by seventh u pad it is actually not design for wake up it is i shall design it is a drawing pad and you can and it admits about a thousand looks of of like and if you won a travel with something that you can use that in your hotel room to wake up when you some people will use a night shades the not the night shades that you eat or that is some people say yore notes policy down knwnhing about that but the a the the i covers that ut to keep light out those that those can be very useful on plains and in hotels and on you can use light an dark and you can travel with your light and t dark devices that you can stay on your home schedule and get most of your light when it would be your normal wake up time back home and what is kind nice as if on your circadian redone is back how which is generally for most people round ten a m to about three p m basely the rising phase of your temperature then you can also feel free to be outside without having wore son glasses or you not to worry about light exposure but if that window before your temperature minimum that forth six hour window that is the time when if you are viewing a lot of light in your new location you are going to shift your clock pretty con miserably and then you can come back home and have a terrible time at the end of graduate school i went to australia the remarkable country incredible people in credible wild life an amazing time i came back and was the first time in my life where i could not sleep on a regular schedule o sleeping in hour long increments throughout the day it was a nightmare and it took me weeks to get back on target and the way i was able to do that was exercising consistently at the same him m every twenty four hours turning my home in to escentaly a cave at night even covering up the windows and then getting as much bright light in my eyes as i possibly could during the day no sunglasses et camera can take some real work if you if your clock gets thrown out a wack there is a phenomenon called i see you cyclosis where people that are in the intents of carryunit in hospitals ashy lose their mind they they become psychotic hallucinations at camera and it is because of alter circadian cycles we know this cause there expose to these lights in these sounds people coming in and checking on them they leave the hospital or in some cases there been experimentswhere people are place near a window where they get some natural light and the psychotic symptoms disappear presume their were not psychotic symptoms beforehand before they enter the hospital it is pretty dramatic what light can do a to the psyche in to the body let us talk a lit bit about a different form of jet lag that requires no plains no trains no automobiles and that is shift work shift work is becoming increasingly common many of us are shift working even though we do not have to were doing work in the mill the night we are om work in ore computers at odd hours sleeping during the day lot of people who are under om sheltering place type stuff are doing more of this kids with the drifting school schedules here is a deal with shift work if there is one rule of thumb for shift work it is that if at all possible you want to stay on the same schedule for at least fourteen days including weak ends now that should immediately cue the non shift workers to the importance of not getting too far off track on the week and even if your not a shift worker sleeping in on sundae is not a good idea the most important thing about shift work is to stay consistent with your schadual i had a conversation on interim live with simmer hater who a hero scientists at the national institutes of mental healthier sure the head of the chronobiology unit there and he was really emphasizing this point because shift work work people are doing the called swing shift where there working four days on one shift in four days on or another is extremely detrimental to a number of health parameters it gets the coatis all release from the adrenals really at a wack and there these coatis all spikes it various hours of the day it messes up learning it really destructs the dopamine system and well being it is a serious serious problem if you can negotiate with your employer to stay on the same shift for two weeks at a time that is going to be immensely beneficial will help you offset a lot of the negative effects of shift work w i do not presume that all of you are going to be able to do that some of you just do not have that level of control and of course i want to acknowledge that shift workers are essential it a of course force responders firefirers police officers paramedic et camera but also pilots people inert night nurses people working on it on the hospital wards people picking up trash this ten night shifts are critical to our functioning is a society is ism sure all of you can appreciate if you are going to work a shift were let us say you start at four p m and you end at two p two a m excuse me then there some important questions that arise for instance should you see light during your shift well this is a matter of personal choice but i really you want of viol as much light as possible and is is safely possible when you need to be alert that would mean from for p m to two a m and then you would want to sleep using light as a corset of alertness and using darkness as a corset of sleepiness what this means is see as much light as you safely can during the phase of your day when you want to be awake it is the same think i said payback the beginning of the of this podcast episode and see as little light as safely possible and ta lows you to function during the time when you want to be asleep you are finishing out that two m shift that is when you would want to avoid bright light exposure you would want to go home you would really want to avoid watching teeny if possible if you need that in order to fall asleep that would be a case where something dimming the screen plus blue blockers if that is in your practice or you want to do that would would be helpful and then going to sleep and then you will probably wake up late in the afternoon or or early afternoon someone you might say hate supermen i thought you do not blue blockers i never said i do not blue blockers i do not people wearing blue blockers at the time a day when they want to be alert and i do not people asserting that blue blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply because people are wearing them the brightness of light is what is important it is not about the blue if you one aware them wear them urges dim the lights or turn the lights off let say you go to sleep at i get home after this four p m to two a m shift you maybe eat something you go to sleep and you wake up and it is noon or one p m should you get light in your eyes well your first assumption based on what have said previously might be that you rein the circadian deadline that you cannot because it is honor wane p m but you are not in the circadian redone because you are somebody who goes to sleep early in the morning at two a m it is not the circadian deadline is a strict time of day it is an internal biological clock what you need to know you guessed it you need not know your temperature menu you need to know whether or not you are temperature is increasing or decreasing and now we can make this whole thing even simpler and just say if you are temperature is decreasing avoid light if your temperature is increasing get light it is that simple of if your temperature is decreasing avoid light if your temperature is increasing get light the the shift worker who works from four p m until two a m has a temperature rhythm that is very different then mine where i wake up around six a m five a m and i go to sleep around eleven p m of we both have a twenty four hour is circadian cycle except mine is more alined to the rise and setting of the sun and theirs is not right you have to know your internal temperature withthem and know you do not have to walk round with a thermometer wherever taking your temperature although be great if some of the devices that a out there people are counting their steps i i thin it be great if people had a a circadian body temperature measurement ism not involved in any this device development but thing it is a real call to arms pun intended to have a rest ban that would measure temperatureand would tell you your temperature minimum when you traveller when not i do not know maybe it may be some of the devices already do that but if they do not they should it is absolutely absurd to me why we wouldn't have the simple measurement very easy to get that kind of information you don't even need the exact temperature read all you need to know is the high and low point let say you are shift worker who really is nocturnal you are let well you want a stay on that nocturnal scandal now that can be very hard on family is in social life of all kinds but the person who is working say from eight p m sun down to sunrise this raises a question should they be looking at the sunrise and should they be watching the sunset waking up with the sunset going to sleep with t sunrise you think well is that in to throw them off ah probably not it is just ashlygan invert what sunrise in sunset are when they are waking up in the morning if they look at the you know they get some sunlight in their eyes and look at the sun get some bright light from devices or overhead lights in their apartment or home well that is on intend to wake them up if it is in the evening right it is a you notes i do not in if i see that clearly but if in the evening the sun is setting and their looking at that setting sun that is the morning sun for that person and it will wake them up for their night shift temperature rising then toward morning what is happening of wield there closing out their worksheet you are going home the sun is rising do you look at the rising sun well taste on what you now know your eyes are very sensitive to resetting of creating clocks what will it do at that time if this were a class from i would either cold call on somebody or eye to wait for the person in the audience inevitably exists temperature is for that person they have been up for a while temperature i is falling not rising for me would be rising but cause ism not diurnal i ism awake during the day for that person temperatures falling and they view light while temperature is falling what is hit can o do s can a phase delay them it is can to make it harder for them to get to sleep the fallowing night you would say that person should watch the setting sun to help them wake up cause there on to work the night shift but you are probably have sone glasses on or avoid viewing bright light before they go to sleep sun's the same thing they are just on an inverted was a typical person whose whose diurnal but they are don't inverted schedule i ism really trying hard here to make this all really clear they are they are kind of too patterns of requests in the world ism noticing as have find of ventured into the this landscape of social media and podcast they are people want to know every detail want to quantify everything cause they want to get exactly right these are the graduate studensen sides that do not want to make a mistake and to quote my graduate adviser provided the mistakes are not dangerous certainly not leather you you canto want to make a few little mistakes that you can adjust right you know one to endanger yourself but it is actually you are notkingto get things perfect that is called learning learning as when you realize have you would sun this time and that i stayed up and it really messed me up it'll never do that again the other category of people seem to want the one size fits all kind of give me this pill or give me this protocol and those things generally work but thy do not afford people flexibility and if there is anything that it is this temperature minimum thing that have been just hammering on again and again and again to day because it is something t t you own an that you can really use as a keylandmark for shifting your clock i suppose there is a third category which is people were except that biological systems are actually much more for giving than the way they are sometimes to scrap and i manure this as an opportunity editorialize a little bit there is much made of sleep debt look there is not an grass equivalent for sleep they are not gin to come around in trying collect all the sleep that you did not get no one really knows what the consequences are going to be for you and for me and for the next person for the sleep you did not get you cannot really recover the sleep you missed out on but you also do not want to get neurotically attached to a scattual because there is a since sleep anxiety and then people have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep si want o spend a moment on that and go back to a theme that have said many times before because these tools work what i called amnesty are non sleep depress to this would be hypnosis i give you the link but it'll say it again revert health dot calm for clinically tested research tested free hypnosis for anxiety but also for sleep those are very beneficial people enemy are p protocols non sleep my breast protocols for things yoganigra i provide some link to those in the caption for episode too these things really work last night i woke up i went to bed about ten thirty i woke up at three in the morning i knew i was in feeling rested i did a amnesty our protocol i fell back asleep i woke up at six thirty i you need to teach your brain and your nervous system how to turn off your thoughts and go to sleep and i deal you do that without medication unless there is a real need you do that through these behavioral protocols they work because they are involve using the body to shift the mind not trying just turn off your thoughts and mill the night now there are periods of life where things are stressful and people are concern and you will have some struggle getting and staying a sleep and there is that really has to do more with anxiety which and is see our protocols also can help with as i always say do them in mill the night if you wake up andyou want to go back to sleep during the mill the day to teach your nervous system hot to came down to do them first thing in the morning f you did not feel you got enough sleep in other words do them whenever you have an opportunity to do them because they really can help you learn how to turn on the parasympathetic slash calming arm of your gnomic nervous system there is no other way that ism aware of to teacher system to slow down and turn off your thoughts and go back to sleep but these are powerful protocols and his a lot of research now to support the fact that they can really help meditation would be another example meditation of certain kinds of meditation involve focus and alertness those are slightly different then meditations that involve lack of focus and attention to say internal states when a pause there and then i want talk about kids and the elderly in other words how do we control sleep and creating rhythms and wakefulness in babies adolescence teens and age folks are before we talk about sleep in kids i want to tell a little story a not a joke i many you be relieve that i o contrantilanother joke this episode which is the relationship between light skin and pillage color doomed and reproduction matin many seasonal breeding animals liberia hamsters which i mention earlier rabbits fox other animals change their color of their coat in the winter they tend to be a lighter color sometimes of pure white sometimes with flecks of black or brown and in the summer their pillage changes to a color of you do not brown or red some other vastly different color that shift is controlled by light and by melatonin this has an interesting coral in humans humans obviously have different skin tones just genetically because o the amount of melinean in one skin depending on genetic background but of course sunlight will increase the amount of pelican in the skin regardless right this is suntan sunburn et camera bronzing whatever the whole system is wired that shifts in skin color and shifts in these sells within the eye and melatonin are actually very closely link here is the story many years ago meaning about ten years ago fifteen years ago all its was a then it twenty years ago forgive me a final egg prevention who was running is own lab at uniformed arm services this is a o standard by logical laboratory discovered that there was an open in the eye in the sells the eye that connect tod the rest of the brain called melonopsen melinopsen as you many of dunno is the open it is a pigment it absorbs light it is the been that converts light into electrical signals than set the circadian clock eye discovered melonopsen because it was similar in form to what was in frog melanaforce as actually in the skin of frogs that allowed those frogs to go from pale weight when it was dark for most of the of the twenty for hour cycle to pigmented green or brown for a frog there is this relationship between the cells in our eye and the pigment cells of our skin and we also know that in long days there is more breeding how is that work will that is actually from dopamine triggering increases in testosterone mainly an males an estrogen mainly an females othothe courses u spaceman estrogen in both sexes we have this kind of pathway where it is light increases in pelican dopamine and reproduction on the one hand and lack of light melatonin decreases in the darkness of skin less male linen in the skin or in the case of an animal with fur white fur and no reproduction on the other hand and humans do not actually shift their breeding patterns tremendously from long days in short days thoughthere are some data that their sumshifts we also do not radically change our skin color depending on how much sun light exposure we have but the simple way to put this is when days are long there is a lot more dopamine and we feel really good and there is a lot more breeding and breeding behavior when days are show ort there is a topless dopamine and a topless breeding behavior because these pathways are very highly conserved now what is interesting is that as were moved into a modern society where much of our waking days we are looking at screens which is fine cause we are getting a lot a light that way though not as much as sunlight but also at night we are getting a lot of light from screens what is happened is all these pathways melon in the skin turn over of skin cells dopamine all of this stuff has become completely disruptive now that is not to say that we should go back to a time in which we did not use artificial lights but i think the important thing to realize is that feeling good with getting a lot of light the relationship to dopamine and melon in the skin and the feel good feelings of of getting light also on our skin provided you are not getting burned or you not getting excessive you we exposure those are not just coincidences those are hard wired biological mechanisms that exist in everybody regardless of of how light are dark your skin is to begin with there is another point which is important which is that the dopamine system which is this feel good molecule is very closely related to the testosterone and estrogen in reproductive cycles remember melatonin inhibits canatitrope an releasing harmony utilizing harmony and the production of these of the foreman and melatonin is the effector it is the hormone of darkness i just threw a lot of biology at you and ism not saying you're a liberia hamster least not in ways an um aware of ism not saying that your pillage color is going to change actually the reason people go gray is because when you are really stress did you notice they when you really stressed there is an increase in the nerve fibers that release a adrenalin to the hairpholical and that activates peroxide groups in the hairpholical that cause the hair to actually go grey or white actually stress does make your hair grey or weight aging does it to that was a brief aside but for those of either interested in the relationship between light and skin tone and all that kind stuff i thought you might find it interesting that these cells in your eye are a lowlife the these a skin cells in frogs or in animals that a shift their entire color and sometimes metamorphosis yet there's some specie that literally change shape in the reproductive organs in fact if that was not weird enough when i was in graduate school at barely there was another graduates to studying a species of hermaphroditic mole mind the littlethings it dig for maphredate mole that would change from having ovaries testes and back again depending on daylight supercool superdifferent om and while biological mechanism if you are wondering how those animals reproduce they actually adjust the numbers of males and females depending on the density of males and females of their too many males the some of the males turn their testes into outreason if the too many females they turn their outreason to testes they actually are true hermaphroditic animals i supposed to seudohermaphroditic animals broke let us get back on track let us talk about the animal that most of you care about which is the human animal new parents and babies are i sit mention earlier megaton in is not cyclic it is not cycling in babies it is more phasic its being released at a kind of a constant level and babies tend to be smaller than adults they are and those concentrations o melton are very high as baby grows those concentrations per unit volume are going to go down babies are not born with a typical sleep wake cycle and now l the parents saying tell me something i did not know they also have and i really want emphasize this they also have much more sensitive optics of the eye a number people bask me should i be exposing my baby to sunlight you do not want to avoid sunlight but their eyes are very sensitive the objects of their eyes are not quite developed much that when you look at a new born baby and they can they look a little glassy ended and the cold o looking through you or even a young child lot of people think that they seeing you the way that you are seeing them hate to break it to you but if you a ever can a jisgugl a visual image of a at one month old the objects of their eyes are poor that you're a cloudy image they are not seeing your your fine detail as they optics get better then they will see you with more and more clarity but a lot of that is clearing of the lens and some of the other acquires om features of of the newborn eye they do not see very well but they also do not have such great ways of adjusting to bright light and babies have a natural aversion to bright lights you really want avoid trying to use sunlight a really bright light in the same way that you would for an adult on a young baby or child as children get older however megaton and does start to become slightly more dislike slightly more cycled and their body temperature rhythms also start to fall into a more regular not quite twenty four hour rhythm their more of these alltradiang rhythm in episode i think it is one or two of the podcast or may be both we talked about these ninety minute called altradi and rhythms where every ninety minutes babies are going through a cycle of body temperature and some other hormonal features among that much is changing in their system what to do if a child is in sleeping you can use phases of darkness and fa sis of light but there can't have to be shortened in order to try and encourage sleep when you want the child to sleep it is not that there just knock enough fall into an adult regime of a temperature minimoment a temperature maximum there temperature minimums and maximums are fluctuating much more quickly and it series tremendous see om in it actually its sort there is an interesting literature of whether or not they have siblings whether not their twins whether not there in a nursery environment whether or not there alone fully the babes not alone but youknow what i mean that there sleeping alone in a room while you are in the other room there are couple things that seem to help which is getting the over all environment and to a twenty four hours schedule having the room slightly colder obvious you want babies to be nice and cosy slightly colder when you would them to be asleep slightly warmer for the times you would them to be awake babies tend to be run pretty hot anyway om and obviously you want to be very careful about awaiting all extremes of temperature cold or or hot if there going though these ninety minute cycles you are going to have to adjust those ninety minute cycles as well them people say will that is not con t help me at all because howdy ideal with the fact that i need to be up every ninety minutes at night they are couple tools that can be helpful the first one is going to be to try and understand the relationship between calm and deep sleep the atomic nervous system can put us into states of you'll panic where that kind of seesaw of autonomic alertness goes all the way to panic or can be alertness or can be alert and calm right there is there is a range there to continuum can also be that the om that you are in deep sleep the other end of the seesaws way up or you are light sleep or your kind of sleepy or you just feeling kind of relaxed perhaps the most important thing if you are having to map to a baby schedule in order to make sure that their getting changing and nursing at camera out the appropriate times is to try and maintain as if you cannot sleep or you cannot sleep continueouslee to try and maintain a your autonomic nervous system in a place where you are not going into heighten states of alertness when you would ideally be sleeping now i realize that this could be translated to try and stay cam while your sleep deprived which is very hard for people to do but this is where the non sleep de breast protocol surface again and can potentially be very beneficial for people to be able to recover not necessarily sleep but for them to maintain a certain amount of autonomic regulation what would this look this would look e baby goes down maybe it is only to go down for forty five minutes if you can capture sleep to capture sleep there are some data showing what is call polyphonic sleep if you can sleep in forty five minute increments a batches even if its spread throughout the day with periods of wakefulness in between as miserable as that sound there rashly some adultsative deliberately employed that who do not have children forsake of work product activity and it does tend to reduce the total over all amount of sleep that you need it is a very hard schedule for most people to maintain but if you have a baby the baby make throwing you into that kind of schedule anyways o if toucan get forty five minutes sleep while they sleep great if you'd get another forty five minutes after waking and than they go back down to sleep great as many phases of sleep as you can get but if you cannot sleep the data on non sleep deep rest type protocols does show that at least from a her chemical level on be clear what that means reset of things do not bemean levels in the baselganglea measured by things positronomition tomography et camera those things ten to reset themselves pretty well if you can access these deep restate that means not being alert throughout the entire time that the babies sleeping trying to for mirror the babies sleep cycle which can be brutal for certain people and especially if you are trying to prepare meals and do all these things i do recognize that they are lot of constraints on parenting not just mapping on your baby sleep schedule as children approach ages one to three four that is when certainly the objects of the eyes have improved but you do not want to damage the eyes of course with very bright light they are much more sensitive even until there kind of ten eleven years old and well talk about vision in children in a moment but trying to get longer and longer batches of sleep through hopefully not through the use of ad ministering melatonin to the kids cause that is what i talked about before why that potentially be detrimental talk about that with your doctor but more trying to get longer blocks of sleep that map on to these ultradian cycles if we better off to get a three hour two ninety minutes cycles than to four hour batch of sleep because waking up in the mill those ultra an cycles can just be brutal for parent and kid if one cannot get a full six or ten or some kitchoul you bee sleeping twelve hours when they are going quickly trying to get batches of sleep even if they are fractured throughout the twenty four hour cycle the are matched more to these ninety minute cycles meaning maybe one ultradian cycle of ninety minutes or two back to back or three back to back to back that is going to be better than waking up in the middle of an ultradean cycle it is just going to set any number of other things in a better direction than worry you to try to say just in force or force a full eight or ten hours of sleep that is at least what the literature shows a some kid sleep great through the night starting in a very young age others do not i typically here from people who are struggling tremendous sleep they are losing their mind understandably because they are not sleeping their kids not sleeping and or their kid o sleeping for such brief period another words trying to access deep calm if you cannot sleep try and as es sleep if you can sleep even if it is fractured and then you say what about all the sunlight viewing in the exercise stuff when sleep is really really dismantled meaning it is happening in various times of day or r night that is especially tat those times can be especially important for the parent to get morning and evening sunlight because your circadian clock is going into a tail spin and it basically wants to anchor to somethings you wanting give it two anchors morning and evening light case this is rather different than what i described for shift work this is when things are really chaotic n your just not able to sleep similar circumstances can arise if you are taking care of a very sick loved one you are up all night trying stay calm using angst our protocols i know it is harder to to do then to say but those protocols are there their free there is research to support them try and get sleep whenever you can but also try to get morning sunlight and evening sunlight in your eyes if you can and if you cannot get that use artificial light what about later life kids now adolescence teens it is true that tens have a tendency to wake up later and go to sleep later in part just because they're sleeping a lot more they're turning out canaditrope and releasing harmony and utilizing harmony their whole bodies are changing i do not know whether not people realize this but the fastest rate of aging that any of us will ever undergo is purity that is the fastest rate of aging and there is a huge number of biological proves their happening during puberty probably devote a whole episode to purity is a fascinating aspect to the life life course but it is accelerated period of aging and the circadian clock mechanism sometimes are are are very intact and sometimes there little dismantled in going through some some change but prioritize the duration of sleep for adolescence and teens now if that means their sleeping until two p m and then waking up and then their up all night the up all night part can become a problem the specially with all the devises testing in in their rooms or planvidio games morning an evening sunlight would be ideal but some kits are just can a sleep through the morning sunlight however if you were to measure their temperature what you would find is that their temperature minimum would come later in the morning it is not going to be right a m it is going to be maybeven ten a m if they're sleeping until eleven or twelve or it might be at a m if their sleeping until ten remember temperature minimums two hours before your average waking time typically in teens maximizes the total mount of sleep try and get regular sunlight either in the morning or in the evening or both but if there sleeping through the morning sunrise that is probably not as much of an issue waking them up an depriving them of sleep is probably worse because their tea men their temperature minimum is actually falling later there circadian redone is later et camera i think with adolescence and teens it make sense tot can give them a little bit more rope in terms of allowing them some lee way to adjust their own schedule some schools are even starting classes later on the basis of some very good biology to support this late shifted rhythm in this extended sleep face there are data from doctor ladies fighter barmen cycotru behavioral sciences and others that stamford showing that turning on the lights in the room of a teen before they wake up helps them get more sleep the subsequent night also tricks them into going to sleep alow but earlier but it gives the about forty five minutes more of a deep sleep and that is been shown statistically total sleep time increases as well if there hiding under the covers that is nock in a work but their eyes do not have to be open i know a few parents now that are coming in with a flashlight in flashing their kids o on over their eyelids before they wake up in hopes of gain that to work some hove told me this is working ah that is not part of it a standard study om but it does seem to work because now you should know why because if lights getting through the eyelids and it say eight a m and the kid is still sleep and they're gan wake up at ten you are giving them light just after or around there temperature went which is going to make them won to go to sleep earlier and in the case of teens for some reason we do not quite understand sleep longer about forty five minutes longer spend more time in deep sleep adults can do this too if you can persuade some one or put your lights on time or for lights to go on before you wake up that is really going to help you wake up earlier and if your stray here some some themes are really resounding over and over again that should be reassuring to you right there these are for mechanisms o the fortunately there are not a thousand different mechanisms now in the elderly there is a real tendency to want to go to sleep very early and wake up very early and people should talk to their physician om there are is some evidence that monotone and levels and patterns and meletonean secreting can become a little chaotic in elderly folks what do i mean by elderly well it is on to differ rates of aging differ right you see some sixty five year old that are struggling to a move a and seem much older than six some sixty five year old that are you'll still hustling around have tons of energy there is a there is lot of variation some of its genetic some of its lifestyle factors you it it really varies om certainly lifestyle factors can plain important roll in rates of aging i think that the the most prominent results from her sleep incircatin rhythms in the elderly are they need to get as much natural light even of its through windows i realize that some elderly folks cannot get outside is easily it is not safe for them to do it they cannot move around as easily exercise can come in various forms for people that cannot get outside and get a ton a sunlight by jogging or cycling they are not able to do that light through a window in that case open window ideally but for temperature reasons at camera sometimes the window has to be clothes getting people near that window in away from artificial light early in the day and away from artificial lights curing the night face can have a tremendous effect and in the elderly that is when melotonean might be a viable option and this should be discussed with a physician of course but you you way past the puberty time point in most cases people who are in their seventies and eighties and nineties are not churning out a lot of giant h in utilizing hormone to begin with and that is where struggles with falling asleep and staying asleep all the same parameters and things we have described before still apply light exercise temperature et camera but that is where melotonean might be of greatest benefit and again ism not pushing melatonin here but i think for elderly folks for having trouble falling and staying a sleep that might be worth while there are and of i should just also mention that regular schedule for folks that a elderly and natural lot as much natural light as safely possible that those aregingto be the really o the key levers for adjusting sleep in circadian schedules have mention before in previous pod casts other supplements besides melotonent and some of those supplements are quite good for sleep i you knowing not a supplement pusher i am somebody who take supplements i believe in them om some have worked for me some have not worked as well but i certainly believe in getting the behaviors right whether not enemy our protocols viewing natural light exercise it is hot bad or cold showers or what have you behavior of protocols first there are some supplements that have mention previous pod was but have seem to get a lot of questions about such as one take a complements and just talk about some of the supplements that can be beneficial for helping turning off thinking accessing deeper sleep and even being able to compact your sleep schedule into a shorter period of hours meaning getting by well with less sleep people take a lot of sleeping pills ism not in to tell people not to take sleeping pills oh they can be very problematic had it forming on high side effect incidents in many cases some people can handle them just find om regain not physician om proscribe anything professor i professor lot of things some of which are my opinion although if you look at the scientific literature there are some impressive data round some non prescription drug type supplements that have fairly high safety margins m that you might consider but you should talked your doctor always before adding or taking anything out of your health regimes right your health is not my responsibility your responsibilities to be a stringing filter along those lines one of the most powerful in useful tools have mention here on many times and i plan to mention many many more times is the website examine not calm which i have no filiation with but is a wonderful sight that links you to quality pure reviewed studies relate to just about any supplement including some safety warnings om will also tell you what subjects whether i as rats cats elderly folks or kids the i given study was done on which is important can be kind hard to o pull from a sights where people are just advertising supplements right that rally do not tell you what the study was and who were these rats who were these kids et camera there are three supplements that at least for me have had a tremendously positive effect on my sleep that u some of you might consider i would say if your doing everything properly behaviourly n you are still having issues then supplements might be a good thing for you or if you are traveling an you want a little bit of extra help in buffering your sleep wakefulness protocols some people to go just to the supplements the what should i take have people in my life that on you just tell me what to take ism more o ear's what you might want to do or not do but m and then think about what you might want to take or not take but personal preference and free country you do what do what you magnesium magnesium has been shown to increase the depth of sleep and has been shown to decrease the the amount of time that takes to access sleep to falls sleep comes in various forms have talked a bunch of times about magnesium three in eh t egg are e o and a t e three in ate which seems to be the more big available form of magnesium and magnesium three in ate it seems is huddled preferentially to the brain where it his where you want it and it there certain transporters is actually engages the gab of pathway which tends to turn off certain tries the forebrain allows you to an a fall asleep there a is a study if you to explore it since people serious about supplementation might want explore the study which is egoists at all eight s dose dependent absorption profile different magnesium compounds am looks to me e quality previewed paper i can put the link in the caption and it explores all the different forms of magnesium a it does seem magnesium alienate can be similar to magnesium three in ate in terms of which tissues it shuttle to magnesium male ma l e t e is preferentially shuttle to the muscle it appears as poset to the brain its can be more of a muscle repair type thing or u restoring magnesium stores in the periphery asset to the brain magnesium citrate has another name that i will not mention in jest because magnesium situates main effect at least on me and the people i know seems to be a live effect as oppose to a connive effect there is also some evidence that magnesium three in ate can be near protective those data a come from quality labs mostly robin studies not human studies what is kind of interesting and again the safety margins for these things tend to be pretty high but airtime you to take something new you should approach it with caution specie since magnesium could be involved in a heart rhythm and things of that sort the other supplement the at has been very beneficial for me as thiamine this is t h e a n i an e theine t h e a n i n e theine activate certain gala pathways which are involved in turning off top down processing and thinking making easier to fall asleep and theine a hundred milligrams to three hundred milligrams has a calming of fact am theine is now showing up in a number of different a energy drinks an even some coffees as away to try and get people in gest more of a given type o coffee cause it am the ideas that would take away that the gutters and the anxiety allowing people drink more coffee ism talking about taking magnesium and thiamine thirty to sixty minutes before bedtime not during the day to well anxiety but rather thirty o sixty minutes before bedtime with or without food for me has made a difference m and the commination of those two things has really helped thieving a for sleep walkers can be a problem it does increase the intensity of your dreams gives you very vivid dreams am for sleep walkers or people that get night terrors stay away from theine is my a advice magnesium theine might be something to explore for those of you that do not have those issues with the emphasis on might and then have talked about a compound and last time i talked about the a mechanisms of apigenin which is a a derivative of camomile a p i g n a which acts as a obit of a hypnotic by activating chloric channels hyperopoler as neurons increases gala in the brain busy makes you feel e sleepy am and camomile for those view that red yer a was it the peter rabbits fuck into mister my rigor's guard an eight the camomile fell sleep mister my rigor came back o anyone flashing back to elementary school o we am there is a story about caramel having these kind of set it if a facts apagenaas highly concentrated caramel also has anti estrogenic effects if you want to keep your estrogen up you might want you a be cautious about apagenin that is where things examined to come become really useful because you can go to examine you put in apagenin and they will tell you all the things that it does in all the things that does can sometimes include things that you had no idea reducing am conversion of certain antigens to detergents which you might or you might wont avoid that is up to you and where you want yestreen levels depending on who you are and what your life circumstances and rolls are few other things that can help the transition to sleep have are things five h t p it'll trip to fan have talked about why ism not a fan of those for me they tend to theromiinto deep sleep and then i wake up and i cannot fall back asleep i do not to tinker with my ceratonean system i do notice to thinker with my dopamine system for entirely other reasons but am none of which are particularly concerning is just that i find that if i increase my dope men by taking a tirasene i in oil form than i crash really hard the next day or if i take five ah keep you el trap trip to fan i fall deeply sleep and then i wake up but i did not mention that there might be ways to make sleep more compactnand this is actually request to you i had a really interesting experience a when i was a postdoc i went for the first time to an acupuncturist i know the varying thoughts and opinions out there about acupuncture i cannot say that i benefit much from the acupuncture there now quality previewed studied showing it publish inner see press journal excellent journal showing that act puncture can stimulate some anting flametory compounds depending on where the acupuncture is done this really good studies came out last year i take about this on instrograma may talk about it again as well as certain act puncture sits that increase in inflammation i there you can get diffentypes of effects you cannot you say acupuncture's great cross the board and ism assuming that the acupuncturists know which sights are good for increasing inflammation which ones are good for decreasing inflammation however this acupunctreous that i went to gave me these red pills he said these are minerals for sleep and it was remarkable i took the red pills is in o the thing now take the red pill i do not knowhow that means because ism not tuned in but these red pills look little eponyms i took a couple of them on his suggestion and i felt deeply sleep in four hours later woke up feeling incredibly rested more rested than i ever felt an my entire life and i never required more than four hours sleep unfortunately acupuncture's moved away i never forget out what was in those red pills did not get chance to do the aspect gossipy and i still wonder he said they were minerals somebody out there knows what these red pills are in what this compound is and it was incredible and i would love to know what those are if please do not go taking red pills at random to try and recreate this non experiment experience of mind but pleased do contact me if you find out or if you are an acupuncturist what these mysterious red pills were because they were pretty blossom once again have thrown a tremendous amount of information at you i hope you will figure out your temperature minimum and start working with that to access the sleep and wakeful cycles that you want t access i hope that you will explore amnesty are you might want explorer supplementation if that is your thing you have now access to a lot of mechanism about sleep and wakefulness but in keeping wit the theme of this podcast where we stay on topic for an entire month or even slightly more we are not done with sleep and wakefulness i know this is very different than the typical podcast form at where one week gets how to become superhuman and the next week gets how to developed growth mines and his count all over the place with episode episode we are staying on track because i really believe that as we drill deeper and deeper into these mechanisms and you start hearing some of the same themes again and again you were going to start to develop in intuition an an understanding of how these systems work in you an your particular life circumstances and my goal is really to eventual become obsolete it is what my graduate advisor used to call the hi by a buss ism principle i said a somewhat i morbid sense of humor and used to be wellie i get by abuse to morrow what you gan to do ism without me blabbing at you hear i do not want to get hip by a buss i plan on living a very long time if i have anything to say about it but were i to get hit by a buss to morrow what would you do for your sleep in wakefulness i you can put a comment on you to which i hope you will do but if i were hit by a buss and killed than you i win be able to answer your question know your temperature minimum understand light in the early part of the day is valuable light when you want to be awake provide it is not bright it is damaging it is grape for you whether not come from screens or sunlight but sunlight better avoid light in the forty six hours before your temperature minimum or else your get a delay your clock unless your traveling and that is what you want to do moi house temperature increase temperature to shift your clock decrease temperature to delay your clock ski map out your temperature and understand it you do not have to know degree by degree across the day know your minimum know your maximum temperature in your twenty for our cycle and you feel great power through that because then you'll know also about these altradian cycles these nine minute cycles within which you can do focus work do not expect the focus to come early expect the folks come in the middle and then con a taper off talk to obit about kids lobe elderly bout parenting we are going to continue there is going to be more but now shift workers travelers people that are jet lacking themselves at home you now how levers in place information can be powerful but you have to implement it in ways obviously sideways in reasonable ways but implementing this knowledge in the ways that you trust are safe and reasonable for you is going to be the way that you can develop a bit of a laboratory about yourself i loathe the term by hacking sorry byohackers i do not believe in hacking anything i believe in understanding mechanism and applying the principles of mechanism for which there are large bodies of quality were view data and even a whole center of mass around certain biological principles the effects of light and temperature temperature minimums that will allow you to shift your biology in the ways that you want to go that will allow you to shift your psychology in the ways you want to go next podcast episode we are going to talk more about a few things first of all organ answer more of your questions cause during office hours at did not get to all your questions from the previous episode i do read the comments in and were paying attention and figuring out the most common questions we are going to get to some of the harder topic so one came at me it is always fun when somebody does as thinks it will these are just the kind of banal low level questions what about the big stuff what about dreaming and lucid dreaming and consciousness look it'll talk about that stuff and ism plan to do that some of which in the next episode in the falling episode may be even but i want to give you you data i want to give you things that are supported by data i will try to speculate as little as possible because this is a podcast about science and science pace tools for every day life this is not about me speculating many people speculated about the role of sleep dreaming and consciousness fascinating topics and a rather circular argument frankly is been going on for centuries some day will get there right now were concentrating on these deep biological mechanisms that make you who you are and allow you to feel certain ways good or bad allow you to function physically in certain ways good or bad and give you more of a sense of control that is my goal here many people have quite graciously asked how they can

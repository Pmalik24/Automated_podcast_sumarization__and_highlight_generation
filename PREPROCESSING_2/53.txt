e venshpir shosponsif expressive plan protect or online privacy today at expressly piandacan freshmen wellfolks the big news over the week end is that the university of pennsylvanious president elizabeth my gill steppe down from her position as presidents of the university to do the chairman of the board of trustees a person scout both they are both leaving because my gill along with clause gay over at hazard as wells the president of m it they all testified in front of congress were rules stophanic who the representative from new york grilled them about antiseptic chance on college compasses genocide chants on college compasses she asked them pretty clearly and over and over we exactly does not this violate your universities policies against hate what exactly would violate your university's policyesagainst hate and none of these presidents could answer the question be of course certain types of hate on compass is totally allow and certain types of hate in compass totally verboten that is the way that it works on college compass in fact certain rational statements are not allowed on college compasses things boys are not girls you a man are not a woman that can get you ban from a college compass but you saying from the revers to the sea palestine shall be free which means the obliteration of the jewfish state that is totally fine even one said directly in front of a bunch of his daily news the president of pen has now been lasted from her position she resined on sturdy according to the york times four days after she appeared before congress and appeared to evade the question f whether students ho called for the genocide of news should be punished support for my gill which had already been shaken in recent months over her approach to a palistinian literary conference and the universities initial response to the commossatack on israel an october som unravelled after her testimony this according two the york times by sturdy evening one day before pens board of trustees was expected to meet and fire her she said that she would quit scout both the boards chairman said in in smells the pen community that she had voluntarily tender her resignation and an hour later he tendered his resignation as well the two other presidents who testified in front of congress and who are also now on the hottest that of course be cousin gay of hazard and telly cornbluth of m it now it is very unlikely the clouding dagoes anywhere she has been touched by the hand of the diverse god and that means that she will go nowhere however when it comes to my girl my gill to not fulfil any of those are requisites so as a whitely and that means that she could be lasted pretty safely by the d ya contingent and then she will presumably be replaced by somebody of more diversity apparently my gill will remain as the university's leader until an interim president is chosen she will also stay at pen as a faculty member in the lawschol box resignation to effect immediately as well the vice chairopens board is person fully plant and she chars the jurist federation of north america'sboard shes not expected to lead the pegboard permanently now it is really fascinating about what is going on at these universities is that some of the some of the activities a venture capital are now being us against a lot of these university boards lot of these university boards are comprised to people who are major donors and venture capitalists are part of that major donation group one o the people who is been leading this charge is bill adman bill adman is the s yo of perishing square an major in vector and done as well to hazard he is on the he use not on the board but y certainly a downer to hazard in the hundreds filings polish pulled his donation and now he is going after clouding gay he were a letter to the hazard governing board of directors one thing to know about bill amen this guises team neon of venture capital when it comes to hostile take hovers of other corporations and restructurings he has one particular set of skills in h is putting them to heavy use to day the letter that he wrote to the hazard governing board of directors as this dear members of the hazard governing boards in er short tenure is president clouding gate has done more damage to the reputation of hazard university than any individual in our nearly five hundred your history because of or failure to condemn the most violent barbaric terrors in the world's overseen for supporting rather than condemning thirty four hazard branded student organizations who hold israel quit entirely responsible for masses barbaric act for failing to enforce halyard's own rules on student conduct and for another failures of leadership president gate catalyzed an explosion of antisemitism in hate on campus that is on president in halyard's history and light of halyard's leadership a position president'sgazes miss handling of october seventh an itsaftromathon campus have led to the metastasis of antisemitism to other universities in institutions around the world president gain actions and actions have gravely interfered with the ability of students to continue to learn at hazard and for its faculty to teach hin to research classes are continually destructed by protestors who use bullhorns and other destructive methods and the offending students suffer no disciplinary action literally is i write this post says bill amen highly destructive protests are underway inside winner library while soon are trying to study for final exemption finish their term papers during the last to weeks of this master winner library is of course a massive historic library over hazard university an making making places the fact that its being destructed during exams is pretty while the ganiaman am alum of hazard all as a result of president gazes failure to enforce halyard's own rules as acumen jewfish students faculty an others are fearful for their own safety as even the physical abusive students remains in punished president gave absurd explanation for the lack of disciplinary action for the october eighteenth h b s incident was that the university cannot discipline students until the hazard university p d and a beyinvestigations are complete to date i am unaware of any disciplinary actions taken for the october eighteenth instant nearly to months later president gave principal response to dress antisemitism on campus was to set up a task force within a few weeks of its formation rabbi wall be the only rabbi on the task force publicly announce his investigation from the committee president gave failures since i tower seven led to congressional investigation of for conduct this out come on its on is an incredible embarrassment to hazard have been unable to identify any former hazard president being the subject of congressional investigation since the establishment of congress in seventeen eighty nine president gaze entire testimony was abysmal to his disrespectful an condescending to congress hos a hostile witness unwilling to answer direct questions from members in wordsell forever living in come preside went case response to the question does calling for the menticide of jaws violate halyard's rules regarding bullying or harassment presiningats ad quote it depends on the contact and he goes on to talk about the destruction of hazard university about the evils of d e e practices thus who be diversity equity and inclusion practices at the hazard university office of equity diversity and inclusion of belonging which formed undergo oversight he points out that here is been tremendous discrimination and he suggests of course that they search for a new president he is right about all of that now will sh be outed i i highly doubted despite the fact that there is new evidence that is been uncovered by the journalist cries ruffs been excellent on university campuses was well as crisbrunet about the fact that that clouding gay in her p c ts thisapparently plage raised multiple sections but that apparently is not enough going to going to be enough to to discredit her either right now three hundred i guys the numbers of to five hundred as of this morning fault at hazard are urging against gaze removal and one of the reasons that they are urging against that removal is because they do not want to hand some sort of victory to a least stomatic who is the republican congress woman from new york a munch of the professors are suggesting that is very important that a remain because after all she is very divers and

is only one solution intonate revolution both of which our genista calls for the destruction of jury to answer that question there is another question a to answer what exactly is the purpose of her education a this point obviously university serve a purpose that wouldn't have stuck around this long if they had not t that purpose has shifted over time originally to go back to the middle ages university when extension of church education those who completed what was called the trivium grammar rhetoric and dialectics dialectics is logic and the quadrivium math geometry music an astronomy moved t universities over time universities involved into centers of learning in which scholars would passalong age old wisdom and search for new answers citizens who went to university ere expected to become leaders in their fields and to be inculcated in the values of their societies at the same time over time however the centralization of at separate intellectual class led universities down to paths the first path towards specialization in industry the preparation of a professional class the reason the you need degree in order to serve as a scientists oral a lawyer for example the second path was toward social experimentation now the path toward professional specialization has been quite often very posit to get a lot of very brilliant minds inner room talking physics or can get better results than if they were just all over the continent somewhere obviously the science emanating from our universities has changed the world and it continues to do which is why when we are u we a li the people were recalled south campus majors those who be the science majors were considered the useful people but all this is also went an increasing credentialization of society in which university degree is considered an contract to the work force altogether because again those degrees were not restricted being in the sciences they are an extended out to the liberal arts the second path social experimentation has been the way of universities since at least the midnineteenth century as religion started to fade in western life and as universities increasingly became battle grounds for various replacement theories social experimentation became take purpose of the university new theories their very fancy theories of living from autocratic centralization german progressives to broadening of social rights sprang from universities universities became the seed beds of social change the new purpose of the university and the education system in general was well summed up by the theorist john day whose consider one most important educational philosophers of all time those an early twentieth century progressive very much on the left he argued universities were designed to create a progressive citizen a citizen ready to take part in the rebuilding of a great state unbound by history and religion as do we said quote education has to undermine and destroyed the accumulated and self perpetuating prejudices of long ages when social life in general has become more reasonable more imbued with rational conviction less moved by stiff authority and blind passion educational agencies may be more positive and constructive than at president then they will work in harmony with the educative influence exercised willy silly by other social surroundings upon an individual's habits of thoughts and belief expert you see would guide the life of the nation this was early twentieth century progressives you see it at the top levels of the democratic party to day that philosophy for of top down intelligence rule was not relegated to the united states far front do he's own thought was an outgrowth of german progressives were similar ideas were dominant it is no wonder the german universities actually represented a center of power for hitter as historian need version writes the sweekgo and quote a hundred years ago in the nineteen twenties by farther best universities in the world were in germany german act device acted as hitters tincting putting policy flesh on the bones his racistideology the intelligenciath as need point both also of an ugly habit of creating coalitions of the supposedly dispossessed to act as shop troops for their new ideas certainly that was the case in the nineteen sixties when universities in the west were reacting not against the supposed handcuffs of god and theology and religion but now against the supposed evils of nationalism now the universities would be directed toward a new sort of social engineering toward global citizenship in which the atomized individual would be the prisoner long as that individual declared fealty to the intellectual movement of the time thus air be macula was one of the progenitors of the called new left in the sixties posited on university campuses teaching from barely a free sex life style in order to create a non repressive civilization he preach the end of capitalism which of course had led to western power and nationalism in what he called racism the argued for the banning of alternative viewpoints which stood against tolerance for his cause called this repressive tolerance tolerance that oppresses non tolerant ideas no wonder revolutionary students during the nineteen sixty eight peristudent revolt carried banners reading marks man and macula the chaos in the streets of the westering the sixties and seventies was born in the universities of the west shall to day's universities promote a new sort of social experiment this experiment is called diversity equity and inclusion unlike is more brash and open predecessors d i makes far more humble claims at least publicly do downers they want free law or evolution or passivism they simply want more diversity more inclusion they want that in the entire body politic they want more equity modeled by the universities of course but here is the thing the same people who stood behind the old revolution stand behind the new revolution d i is the result of something called critical fury a belief that all systems of power are reflections not of merit but of exploitation that all hierarchies are not reflection of people being good at things and people being bad things but of the people at the top hurting the people at the bottom tan the only corrective to that exploitation is to completely restructure those systems of power by appeal to group identity and coalitional politics put together a coalition of the dispossessed to overturn the hierarchy in this view any one successful must be denigrated as evil if you are successful not a you good o things its your bad person any one unsuccessful must be upheld as good because of course their victim of the evil system this oppressor oppressed binary is the motivating feature of life on campus to day it is the new revolutionary ideology an it results in oppression and discrimination just as surely as the german universities revolutionary idea resulted in oppression and discrimination in both cases that resulted in discrimination against the news always that is why the presidents of major universities struggled to answer base o questions about antisemitism in front of congress this new philosophy is focused entirely on that oppressor oppressed binary that binary cannot be allowed to fall for if it falls then does the entire revolution the entire idea logical edifice that acts as the bases for the revolution against in america meritocracy if a few news need be threatened with mastic's and elimination to preserve d i will the thatuats can have to go d i is the purpose of the universities a understand it is not jo something universities do it is what universities are is the center of why they exist to day it is not a means toward an end it is in fact the goal the restructuring of society because the goal is always perpetual revolution by the entelligencia and d i is the current revolution it is the entire pedagogy meaning the way of teaching in the words of polo ferry whose the chief force behind called critical pedagogy quote washing one's hands of the conflict between the powerful and powerless means to side wit the powerful not to be neutral and that cannot be allowed and d i must be protected and that's what your watching to day from every arena of the left the attempt to protect d i it has to

story today out of stand for university jewfish anstidea reporting on this apparently there is controversy that's breaking out why because there is a newly formed anti feminism committee at stand for university right to fight discrimination against the news at the university and of course the reason discrimination is happening against just the university is the same rest in the discrimination has been happening against t ascent america applicants to universities which is the news are considered disproportionately successful in the hierarchy of of oppression therefore they cannot be included in the oppressed coalition apparently the faculty coacher oath commits o poisoning t are bellman whose an associate professor in standout's graduate school of education and religious studies in two thousand seventeen you wrote a paper with other standard faculty members is called safe on the sidelines and he said antisemitism was not a problem on college compasses because quote different representation of campus culture come from the difficulties in defending what counts is political speech and what counts is antisemitism is the entire thing when you are yelling about how news should be wiped out that is just a a form of political speech this is what quaudin gay and the rest of the idiots went what they mean and the not it it is the smart there isn't their nefarious what they mean is that it is a form of political speech to call for the wiping out of these called oppressor class and the news are part of the oppressor class that is what bellman is saying here to he is also an agents on the inside he served on the academic board have called open hello hello international is a jewfish support group on canvas easily were students when i was at hazard it is it is a place where where ye got like get meal and its where they have sabbath services and all the rest while hello international is pro israel and this person has been working to open up heller international to wildly anti israel events because of course he is anti israel no shock there that is just one controversy that is breaking out and the media of course are fully invested in the continuation of d e i a do it is truly amazing the most obvious example o this came courtesy of the least funny show on television seturnayt live returnee live open this week with a skit about this congressional hearing now the suit this pretty rich territory right this a rich vain to mine you have three university presidents all of whom are supposedly intellectuals who cannot answer basic question was panel skit about the stupidity of our higher education officials or was it about how least stephanic the person asking very simple questions was the bad person oh the answer of this one because the cast overtasanel the writers the higher ups there totally agree with the d e i revolution s nutmeats the villain in this pee is stephanic hereto now i get as tot screaming casting that the lain i bally i can in far in ye t hived wall the can for e contact what e that cannot be your anna you palmate sin kraut yes o now well we are term about tain all forms try anteetetaneflamafoo the t in and mi taxation ta to feel and keep in mine if you do not e you get to make ma look good wit is really really had total the entire skit again makes the protecting t university presidents because of that because of that they cannot even get a laugh at the expense of university precedence because to acknowledge that these university present are in mashed in an ideology that is evil would mean to undermine the very basis for much of the democratic party coalition now does not have to be this way the democratic party could embrace just a broader a agenda and the end of the used to be what was called the john towards canvagenda the two america is moral class based a agenda as opposed to the racially based o agenda that is d e i but they will not do that because they believe that since twenty twelve since barakabomma on an twenty twelve the democrats believe that they have created a coalition of the oppressed that is electorally under f eatable which is wild since they lost in twenty sixteen but they gin to keep pushing this the democratic party's gin o keep moving along with this which is why of course the headline from the you time to quit as fury erupt to over campasantitemitism conservatives seize the moment wow much seizing my favorite brand of of your times journalism is the republican notice headline republicans notice democrats kill baby republicans notice democrats pro anti feminism republican's notice yes though the real headline there is republicans noticing question from all of this is what is the likely next outcome going to be will get to that in just one second first college football play off

out go to prize pics do come slash men house protocol ben for first deposit match up to a under bus as prize pictstokcims slashed protocol ben for to post match up to one hundred dollars case what is the outcome of all this likely to be if you are somebody who does not the d i agenda because it is bad actually quite horrible it is not going o be enough o just fire a feu of the precedents that is not enough if they're then replace with precedence shot tempt to con quit brought in out d i this whole system has fail first of all d i cannot actually be broadened out to include a alien america an jaws because to do would be to include them in the oppression hierarchy and to do that would be to explode the oppression hierarchy because dues and actions are to successful as he cannot do that but let us say they try let us say that they try to put a friendly face on this the way that is going to work is with more speech restrictions on campus s they're two ways that dis can go way this can go number one is that you could just explode the d agenda which would mean that people would have to be come less sensitive on campus it would mean the ya you can chance some really bad stuff about us but it would also mean that you could say some reasonable things boys are not girls on camp as without being dragged into the dean's office the could be quod fat comic by mentioning that being over weight is bad for your health without being dragged into the dean's offs in other words the answer to this would be to get rid of d y entirely an that is the better solution do you think they're on to go for that or they in to go for more speech does these more control is always the answer from people who love control ah you guessed obviously the media and members of the i ntelligenia are trying to move along with the idea that they need to be more controls over speech see the problem with what the university presidents said the other day they were making the argument the free speech means that people have to be able to change enicidl slogans against jaws it'd be open to that argument i really would if i had not been band from half the college camasses in america it'd be open to that argument if a bunch of other people had not been banned from college compasses including students the same university that is said that will cash the student at parkland who in a group tax when he was sixteen years old wrote a racial slur had be band from hazard because he could not be admitted because of that that same universe says that you can chant genecitl slogans on campus the can have it both ways if the idea is that this troubled standard is what is to prevail will just the ad news to the double standard that not solve the problem at all in fact in many ways it makes the problems worse because again the hypocrisy is perfectly obvious to everyone and yet that is precisely what is being called for by wait for it the intelligence a personated clear o finale stone in alienor middle professor of law and professor of philosophy at university of pennsylvaniasias a piece titled to fight antisemitism on compasses we must restrict speech that is o the washington post she was the value of free speech has been elevated to near sacred level on university compasses which is a joke that is a lie is not true at all but she says as ares cult universities have had to tolerate hate speech even hatespeech calling for violence against ethnic or religious minorities university pressies i resisting this conclusion rather than confront the conflict between the commitment to free speech and the commitment to eliminating the hostile in environment facing wish students on campus many simply affirm their commitment to both or by time by setting up task forces study the problem countering speech with morspeech might just mean adding to the hateful metric on compass and would not solve the problem instead this person at recommends that universities shut down more speech universities have a duty under title sic of the civilize act to ensure their compasses do not to send into quoited hostile in environments that a actively exclude students of ethnic religious or racial minorities from receiving the benefit of educational programs and activities on campus in fact pen has already been sued by two jewfish students evening the university has become an incubation lad for virulent anteduish hatred the open expression and economic freedom our critically important values in higher education says this professor there are other values the universities must promote as well for example encouraging civil dialogue e cross differences at butter now see non believe the universities have ben promoting the stuff no the universities have been engaging in maraccusas style repressive dolmens for literally my entire lifetime and longer and now it is only now that they are starting to talk about oh by the way free speech matters when you are yelling at news it is the double standard than everybody's noticing and the amazing solution from people on the left is what if we restricts what if we put more restrictions on speech they will not let go of the d e i without a fight they will not do it this is why your seeing over university of was consent insane battle right now between the universities of wisconsin and the republican state the republican led state legislature the republicans in the wisconsin legislature they wanted to curb d i funding the board of regions had agreed to vote on a deal between the university wisconsin leadership and assembly speaker robin boss they would freeze and cap d i hiring and exchange for funding held up by the legislature but then the word of university of wisconsin rejected that that proposal nine to eight they left eight hundred million dollars in tax pairfunning of the university of wisconsin system on the table and the future of the system's d i offices in limbo the board also voted not to table the vote for further discussion effectively killing the deal s on fridge it looked the had deal to basically freeze hiring in sort of the d i centers of university of wisconsin not even to just dismantle d i entirely which is what actually needs to happen in the wesconsin legislature but to just frees hiring and the university of wisconsin regions said no they said no we will leave eight hundred million dollars in student funding on the table in order to preserve d yah is gan they have now made it clear that they are not interest in their students they are interested in creating this brand new magical socially experimenting world in which d i is the ultimate principle according to vow and his fellow assemble republicans quote it is shame they have denied employs their rases and the almost one billion dollar investment that would have ben made across the u w system also they could continue their ideological campaign to fore students to believe only one viewpoint is acceptable on campus that is how strongly is university leaders will hold on to d i it is the it is the am oh it is the raise on debt for the entire system for them the revolution is the system now what is the solution tall this when they are a few solutions talk this an have talked them have talked about them on on the program afore solution over one if you're done to one of these universities pull your money now pullet and never give it back they the these empty pledges to fix antisemitism on campus maybe that is what got you going first tithing you should withdrawn your money years and years and years goy literally rote in two thousand and four that people should be withdrawing their money from universities not based on antisemitism based on the evil ideology that was being promoted by the d i crowd i wrote that twenty years ago gets are late on the ball but glad you are here glad love join the party pull your money now and do not put it back that is step number one step number two read erect that money toward something useful why not give it to university of button which is an actual ideologically open non d i campus that be a great start or cheers a nun better idea instead of doing that why not instead use the money that you are going to use to give to a bunch of fat cap professors that hazard university living on their pension and waiting garbage about the interjectional identity of black queer women or something instead of that why not take that money and i do not know hirer some people out of high school they can avoid completely the maw of the government educational complex how about that ex et to be real about this there bunch people tin rich off e of the government educational complex first of all all the professors the entire faculty the administrative faculty of the universities is not just professors it is huge burrocrasies of d i burn rats who sit there all day long in do the scrap the at their only certain wings these universities that are worth supporting at all the scientific wings everything else has be comment not just useless worse than useless counter productive and bad have out instead of that if you are if you got a student who is about to gotualy liberal arts university the reason you as aware or sendingyour student there in's blame you i parents did i for me there the reason that you do that is because you our attempting to get your kid a job but why do not business people all over the country get together in say hiring cats at a high school at daily wire oud much rather tiresome cad to it a fifteen hundred on his essay tees and have a four pooch p out of high school then after that kit had been through four years of a barnyard college program without a out that is a solution all these solutions need to be on the table an they need to be on the table right now the university system the let to it because the same people cannot be left in charge ettingwhere of those presidents is not going to help the entire buracrasy needs to be wiped what you tell boy the deep state i the federal government the deep state in the university system is the entirety of the universe system in virtually every state

speech because this will somehow makethings better and that of course is not true because it ends of being freespeech for some but not for others which brings us to aleurones over the weaken upon musk

aleurones i think that ales ones should not be band from apple an they spoke simply because the standards that are being used by the lot of the social media companies are extraordinarily vague problem

apologize for i will warn you i the story is for the biggest thing in at is a rabithol that is horrifying to go now now this is tied into pesto with thousands of below which you lace to come out with put dato going to rituals where they drank blood is the tennis of ale ones as routinely the attempt to turn him into a voice of reason is contra that aleurones himself has said in his standyhook lawsuit he literally said i act a part when ism on my show and i say things i do not think are true on my show in order to act that part how is his defense gay is is not a defense if ale ones as a human being because frankly i do not think ale phones is totally worth offending as a human being but i also do not think that everybody that i agree with that is the standard for being on at i only as the standrdfor being on social media how have argued the people i thing are a lot worse than ale ones should be allowed to be on social media because the problem is once you have a gate keeper that gate keeper is going to be a problem the gate keeper yet you better trust that gate keeper a lot and i do not ism trust any these gate keepers very much and it'd rather have a platform acts with ales ones on it and other ridiculous human beings same on omen who is a liar with regard to for example the israel gossip conflict it'd rather have those people on acts then not have them on acts because frankly i do not think that ism the sole repository of all truth nor do i think that even if ism right all the time which of course i may of course i think that nor do i think that people do not have a right to view other opinions musk over the weight an unhand ales ones he admitted that this was bad for business because it is and a here was musk then having a conversation with ale ones about all of this now i will say do i think that is a smart pair move by you on musk to do some sort of conversation with ale phones i do think that there is a difference in kind between of course your la use my platform and i perhaps the most powerful person and certainly the richest person on earth and when i have a conversation with you sort of allowing you to soft pet all of your ridiculous and ludicrous nonsense i do not think those of the same thing at all i think they're plenty of people who ought to be on at that i personally disagree with why also do not think ire worthy of a great conversation mean i just not thing that they are wonderful people and i really do not think there within my overtone window but my overtone window is not excess overtone window door should it be by the way because if you want a platform to remain a platform it has to include even people you do not think are inside the overtone window in any case here was that you on having a conversation with ale ones over the weekend i ask no a an n ait am into question i really have to get ouphe way an you quit not not this a as the who anyhow thing and am and a you do not because i at is a others i if yer is ta sis i denying that s there is a who that is not cool at at all am ye and is there just what agree ti did you say n n and what what is noon that since situation i i just i would to act here what what to what did you say amen de a the inter tat exploded it was a top story for off it on three years with all the with all these a professors in former school safety people and at all o them sang they believe it was a drill and i simply covered them covering that what was tin unit cart against me and in both cases were as con guilty by judges talking new york there is a judge an angina true case not even jury is tell take case and and then years later after trump got elected an after i waste platform it made me bigger and suddenly i would wake up there would be sometimes a hundred articles or more a day every mantroduc channels sang that i was currently sang nobody die currently sending people their houses currently being on graves cow do oven know these people's hangs always said one of their names ever now ow at i that i believe the children died an at d re get all that t can o si imagine i was not y platform no mention oof of the school shooting it cadatican a for for lie six seven years the they go back to my time line an a then of h big new york p a farm democratic party they graded up they rune hundreds of articles sometimes to day but a week for over year suddenly becomes a big story again o hate om that is not a good explanation because it has literally nothing to with what he originally said about sandihook which is what he want was asking him about by the way the exact quotes from aleurones not sandhog a quote my gut is with the timing and everything that happened a this is stage and youknow give been saying last you months get ready for the big massutings and then magically it happens folks ho got to get private investigators up to sandyhook right newbie them telling you this this thinks the highest heaven it is as phony is the three dollar bill you got parents laughing halala and then they walk over the camera and goboohoooo and not just one but a bunch apparent doing this and then photos of is that are live they said died an mean that they think were dune why did hitter blue the ratted to get control why who government stage these things to get our guns why cannot people get that through their heads again out ones conspiracy therms says a much of crazy crap a lot they the attempt a sort of mean strip this is one of the problems by the way with having a speech police when it comes to these platforms is that if the platforms are fairly open and you have people outshines on there ill get community noted people will note when he saying silly garbage and that is a good thing i think that is a good thing instead what ins of happening is when when you can late the overtone windows he jack horsey or the twitterboard with legitimate con vernation when that overtone window is the platform then the feeling is as they shrink that overdo window rational people end out outside they are overdo window and then they find themselves on the seaside of that wall as alit ones for example and there been this con nation the america mine between ban by acts or discriminated against by jack dorser and rational and that is not correct and that is weird you do not you say two things at once one ale ones ought to be on ex you ought tore on facebooky ought to be on apple the removal of him from these supposedly neutral services is ridiculous and not base and any hart and fast policy if they wanted to say the harden fast policy is if you lose a billion dollar court case ism defamation they do not git to be on the platforms fine at least that is a standard but do not haven't standard just arbitrarily applying a standard another promise when you arbitrarily a apply that standard then you reactive right tends to say oka you arbitrarily apply the standard therefore your rational and good but you at tucker did with aleurones the other night read he had him on a show and spent an hour and a half trying to make aleurones not only look good but look a profit it was very weird thatdun know tucker is doing that an thin tucker again is much more man stream legitimate voice and much more intelligent than that ism not sore what game he is playing there but again that game which is ale ones is a rational reason be person that is not the same question as does anemones belong an ex plan musk totally right to put aleurones back on us by the wanton hes you brought en it out to uncle people i absolutely despise and think are terrible and if they are removed if they are returned to ex i think that that will be you know again a good thing in the sense that ex ought to be in open platform ism saying that even while i say tat that will include people are viciously an is metic races horrible people why really really do not because if the argument is that he is are platforms then the platforms have to be platforms they cannot in fact just be publications by another name by the way we were talking about ale ones took gat ale ones is lawyer see in twenty seventeen during costing battle that his footage could not be entered into the evidence because alecjone's playing a part s he said that all of the crazy which was being used by his ex wife as a ration a for custody they said actually he is not crazy he is lying or he is an actor that what he his again one of those two things is true a in just one second we will get to the latest in the israel conflict again the lack of clarity from the bind administration is crating significant risks in the middle east because this is what they do first have got a holiday gift idea that sure to make you the hero of the season now we all know the holidays can be little bat

commas that continues israelisting tremendous military success one of the things that is happening is as they go into these areas that were supposed to be clear of civilians they are arresting everybody who is a military age mail in these areas and then of of the things they are doing is the same thing that the united states government does by the way when it arrests people very often they have them undress and they make sure thatched do not have contraband on them in this case weapons on them suicide less on them ad of course the media are latching on to this to the same media the have been downing israel word about women being raped and brutally murdered that say medias like alms got a cannot believe that they are they are they are undressing these men before they arrest them that this his literally one of the thing that they are doing which is totally insane compasses engaging som the worst human rights violations ever and israel is a resting people an keeping it not just shooting them keeping them alive will rally many of these people but they undress them temporarily to make sure they n to bombs on them and themed all my god what a human right violation that is obi grave really was hot wat boa gribbwas was just men undressed or was it simulated sexual acts was it a legend torture mean what would exactly this i it it is insane but again this is what r media do are vaunted media meanwhile commons literally stealing aid here there is actual foot's as been release by the idea of compass stealing the supposed humanitarian aid that is going into the gosistrip there literally stealing food they are literally stealing water you can see it from aerial shots these are members of was ore going up to a humanitarian aid truck and they are just removing all of the resources and they are reloading it into the comostrocs s they are stealing the aid meanwhile the white house is still sending to mix signals the white house over the course lass seven two hours did redo of you resolution calling for aid immediate sense fire and white use guys is the went middle of a military operation that happens to be correct but the white house is still doing this ridiculous routine where they believe that if they send mixed signals somehow this is going to tick off terrors less or something antonym blinking he has to uphold the lie that much liberal form policies been based on for the lest i do not know since since the underworld were to which is that there is a community of nations that every one really the default is that every one gets along and war is an aberration as opposed to the world is a really mean and nasty place and sometimes y have to go an hefted kill the bad guises instead it it is all of this sort of heard happy talk combined with the underlying understanding that all of liberal form policy is based on a lie which is that everyone is friendly the men is a wonderful place and all of the rest antonym blinking yesterday he is asked about israel s continuing military operations israel by the way has killed fuel people with every bombing than any modern military in historic and urban area they have dropped at this point hundreds of thousands of bombs at this point there killing about point eight people person dropped which yous a way lower ratio then a a rock fed gangsta or wherever else you are talking out up ben combat encases here was that tony blinking again the united states position far has been israel needs to defeat commons and then we want a look to the arab world as though we are tugging israel chain because if we would if we do not miserable just going wild which of course is not true the reality is that a cold and collective policy by the west of if you screw with us you find out would be better not passionate not over weening but off around and find out is an excellent foreign policy the is the kind of form policy that and with wait for it de torrents it does not o my gosshar we have to be careful all my go ho don't know about us we might we might i know you we might u what daddy were the back this kennisto has stop here is he anchovy blinking overtime weekend maltha were focus on two things were focuston what what is there intent and do they having place for they are they taking necessary measures to make sure that there acting in adherence withinternational ah you mantra law and international a but then also what are the results hand as have said before an there is there bolts the intent there is a gap between the intent and the and the results and er that is the gap that we are trying to make sure is clothes look this could be over to morrow this could be over to morrow if mascot out of the way of civilians instead of hiding behind them if it put down its weapons if it is surrendered a he is right about that last part but notice how he response overtime the met o but we have seen the result on mi god people are yes it is called a war and commons is oh overtly violating the laws of barbet the minute the marthoradits as the thing than blink had well we are seen raising name a war were you do not person where is the magic weapon if the news had their spaceless or may be they be using that but they do not contra popular opinion that might my favorite tony blinking clip over the week and actually what he was asked why the can has been slow in condemning commons rapists we all know the answer to this the sane it is comprised of horrible countries that do not care about mass rape and celebrate the mass rape of jewfish women particularly that is the reality the sane is garbage the sane is a trashed it should be blown up an the earth should be salted beneath it is a horrible place but tony blinking can't to say the obvious because to say the obvious we men under minding the international order that does not exist by the way then me clear about how foreign policy has historically worked overtime course he last several centuries the only thing guaranteeing any level of solidity in foreign policy during the eighteenth an nineteenth centuries was brutish hegemony over the waters that is it and then that agrimony wan the we gout world wars wonted to then the only thing that guaranteed any level of world peace was the united states having hagemity largely over the waters and as that begins to wane we are getting chaos is notion that the united nations has been the thing standing between the world and global war since nineteen forty five is the dumbest both garbage have heard in foreign policy talk in a long time and we hearts anchovy blink and trying to uphold the precious the yuan i do not have an answer i do not know why a countries you do know leaders international organizations were slow to a focus on this to bring it toe people's attention ism glad it is finally happened the atrocities that we saw on october seventh are almost beyond human description or beyond our capacity digest and we have talked about them before but the a sexual violence that a we saw on october seventh a is beyond anything that a that have seen either a thank you for doing that and look i do not have a good answer to that question i think it is a question that these organizations these countries need ask themselves oh they have take themselves a if we shame them if we shame the nemblled wit guess what a policy of shaming terra does not work a policy of shaming terror supporting machines does not work either what works unending hold calculated determination that is what works in form policy period that is it meanwhile what is the united statesman we every time thy show the sort of wavering and mean the were not getting pushed around and when i say we am in the united states in the west more broadly we are getting pushed around in the red sea were going pushed around by a bunch of toothy pirates ware armed nineteen eighties muscadine at best if the united states one told homes jefferson ended the the barber pirates location eighteen o too and yet here we are the most powerful military and world sister all while those whooshes man we can we cannot touch the soothes go be real careful we please explain why why is that international shipping should be harassed in the red sea by a bunch of barbarian morons and we are supposed to sit here is the west meg hell the there are the we have to be careful with the soothes why here is antonym blink in explaining tear been missile attacks on commercial ships in the red seas sins there are threats of dozens of countries we might dozens of countries i do not know destroy the soothes then there were a series of mist attacks on commershoal ships in the red see this went that you asses carney rush to aid them bandit up shooting down several drones fire by the baronial back totes in eat the meiny armed forces now saying they will prohibit the passage of any ships to israel and consider them a target what o you do about that well they're number things a first what we have seen coming from the soothes a directed it ships in that area ais a threat not just to israel a not just to us but to dozens of countries a that are engaged in in shipping that depend on this corridor a for a goods moving about at every single day and this is actually implicated the interests directly of well over a dozen a dozen countries with a cruise from all sorts of a different places it that is true and also what is the west going to do batter would be the question more weakness you show to high tiny badly armed little nothing of a terrors screw the soothes as the united states e most powerful military in road history of course that that leads to signals what signals do you think you are giving exactly determines is the foreign policy that works and determine is basically just a mildly morsophisticate aversion of fa around and find out that is all but here is the thing if you can do that you have to make them find out that is the only way to make that happen now the real reason why the bite administration is concerned about all that is because of course they are deeply afraid that if they are means the soothes that somehow they on to lose muslin votes in michigan first of all if you are mean to a terror scrub n you lose muslin votes maybe that is just the price of doing business honest the god if you are if you is a party cannot stand up to muslin terrace becauseyou are afraid that museums and michingan are join o lottery if you stand up to terrace there comes that is kind of an amazing condemnation of your party is it not we are told constantly by the media that the the right has to dissociate from white so premises which they should by the way of course of course because they are certain votes not worth having have about people who come ass it seems to me if you commons maybe that's a not that is not worth having say that is the price of being a half decent party of hate coming up when we joined by

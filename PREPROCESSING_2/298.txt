query to kill purchased marine we the small right acres speck of an island in the corban and they renamed it quervonation they applied to the u en for independent statehood they encouraged you has citizens to defect my a simple ritual of drinking a shot they even tried to feel an olympic volleyball team the whole thing was a bold experiment and advertising violation building but since those heavy early days of independence the nations patriotic fever is calm to somewhat this now used as a place to send contest winners and a promotional lure for members of the world press which is how i found myself had a dequervonation last tune for a series of very educational to eel a tastings and how i met the nations most prominent citizen and ambassador to the world he stood at the dock waiting for us as our very chugged over from tortilla shaven headed o t a sort of look wanton leva were it not for the speed of mere shades and read superior case the patents to spring gray through a megaphone he alerted us that we were now and tearing a party own as we disembarked he began shooting manically around us with a to keel a shot balanced on his ball head daring us to sucked down without using our hands this was query man the other query representatives were there to teach us about to kill query man i was told was there to party with us his job was to party and just as i began to grasp the frightening yet thrilling ramifications of this fact query man spotted me he pointed to his shock round head opened his arms wide and chased me down the dock nerval man's real name is rye my done a i learn this from the query reps who i think we are a little annoyed that i was asking few questions about there to kill and many questions about the man who seemed to be there trained to keel a monkey actually i was told the term his party capitalist and when he was not on the island ran was going from bar to bar all over the north east in dying the untamed spirit of host quarto meaning what i asked them meaning he does interactive promotions designed to introduce consumers to the responsible enjoyment of the various brands of host query toil meaning what i asked them and that is when yon ran up to the table with a toilet see around his neck and a plungers stuck to the top of his head died he said check it out plunger on my head and then he ran down to the beach and shut sand down his pans and then he sang a dirty song and made us two shots and tenant and then he collapse in the sir and bark the seal it is sort of hard to ex plain what he does they told me and that is exactly what he fascinated me i me consider the plunger were it ma i might have come up with putting a toilet seat around my neck our that is a natural but then to extend the medical to take the imaginative leap to the plunger on the head well that is genius my the last night i was there query reps realized i was lost calls they left me with a bottle of querist special went to bed and than and i got to talk it turned out quell man and i have a lot o come we both live in new york ma rhyme is thirty years old originally from the boson area me he went to an ivyleak school and spent most of his time there drinking and feeling out of place yes the man barking a seal that a princedom man and that is when i realized that a part from some small matters of fate and several thousand sit ups on roman's part we were the same we both came out of college with an english degree the thirst for boos and the a surd fate that some one would pay us simply for being drunken charming and in a strange but undeniable way for hon that turned out to be true and that is when i realized i was jealous of him how does one get to be a party catalyst i asked died he said that is what everyone want to know that is my bag o stuff i beg a tricks what can it props guy an my field needs got my helmet stuffs monkeys i got the glider port have got e three of them it is six months later and ism in roman's apartment in bookman he is agreed to take me with him to a couple of bars out along island where he is doing whatever it is he does and he is showing me a few of the things he will bring with him the speed o i have i threw tit on because it is just shocking at shock value refer chicken plunger ran on the ball the is it was never roman's dream to have a job wearing a plunger he wanted to act it is a fly she i know and did than but he had done some singing and musical theater in college and this was his dream specifically this was his dream there is nothing a day nothayin there s nothing you can day t n a day than had south pacific and summer stock and some dinner theater but it really was not coming together the way he wanted it to from the beginning he knew he needed a back of plan he started looking for a job in finance after all what is a prince to gree good for if not making money he interviewed at six companies but he only got a call back at one think everyone else who applied there from princedom they ill got offer jobs i called and they would were not can offer me a job and why why not i was really really upset and and thought i could change his mind or some hes well it is seems you now people seem to think that you er you would really rather be acting and i you see what do not you leave that up to me i need money to act he needed a day job but the day job wanted him to act he was stuck in new york working part time at a man order bible company and part time at an upper is side bar now than enjoyed a delicious beverage from time to time and when he drank other after a shift or sometimes during everyone paid attention to him he would make joke s and ballad shot glasses on his head he owned the room i mean have always been a typical that people would invite to parties to weddings i people would offer when i had no money and i was hanging out with my buddies from prince any will make him bank in come an were going out to the bar i got on envy money like it'll pay for your drinks i want you i come out and it it was not even much i was such a great friend of is peopludge to funny as drunk people wanted the funny as trunk around a and and i just barracking in i would always goofaround and i occasionally get get old drunk and and dance of people and way the day there was has his own mega company and he would do weddings and parties itself that he took me on and rhyanjoind a shadow industry of party professionalism the kind you might meet on resorts or on yachts leading serve side limbo competitions were at reunions and encouraging people to dance people whose job it is to force stint fact to touch one another to have fun because apparently this is something were forgotten how to than paid his dues working armets was organizing group games dressing up as woody from toystory complete with a big plastic head over his own head and then he got the call from hose query they were running a tug boat called the untamed spirit too for short boozecreises out of sanding and they wanted him on it his job would be to entertain winners of various host queer of a promotional contests and i turned out they pretty much enjoyed the same things the thirteen year old did mess the big plastic head and plustikela and yon but drink too was the envy of all my peers a really i and eventually the opportunity came to do at full time and the tough port about it was that i was not have to give up acting any pretence i had of being an actor was gone cause it was anyone om not down it as like lit makes a money doing something that is close to acting and a s i went with it yon had entered the party's own lie i a my a e a was the we in the house to night i think mi i that from youth s go i as my we s ta blew another and is e o a a for monkery sports bar is on route twenty four and union dale long island foster university is near by but this part of union dale is not much a college town as it is a college strip a black top spoke of suburban sprawl with monorail on the corner next to a guns and ammo shop next to a startups inside its dank and caverns with banners advertising fifteen sent wings and five dollar pickers i will learn many important things to night but perhaps most surprising as this people and bars apparently need quervoteachers and many shot glasses in order to live grand to get them they will do unimaginable things i ai bias let me set the soon than is standing at the jacket of crow bar he is torn off his la break the way ut dance to rebel a very tight speed out stuffed with teachers and then how shall i put this young women crouch down in front of him take hold of a shirt with their teeth and pull i li yo li a woman at all about i had not bargain i de it a oneiric rhyme's not getting grows teachers out of his pants he serving them shots off his head my level with their pros or asking them to licks scowl were just rubbing up against him i maybe it is because he seems to nor mischievous compredatory or maybe it is because he comes with the sanction and strange de i celebrity of a well known liquor brand but rhyme as able to do in say things in the name of querist it will get you arrested in the most circumstances and as antic's arrest tolerate they are adored i i i my had right in a gan again can queer donation i would have described him as a kind of corporate pester but as i watchmen gleefully french him and then wander casually back to their boy friends a betterwoord comes to mine he is a water the half man half priest concert at dyonisis god of drunken revelry and not just because he is got a hairy back e tree li li i li friendly i me like a i oi a i a i i a and if you have not guessed already this is the other reason i'mfascinated by roman's job while the rest of the barred rhyme dances and flirts and watches sports an the thirty odd t vs at minerals have somehow managed to pint myself next to the single screen that is inexplicably tune to pep s specifically returns is documentary of new york than on the other hand is out there moving in a world in the commerce and pleasure and liquor and secs or a intimately and uncritically in twine and everyone is having a wicked good time it is a world in which i normally do not travel and than is my ticket in when he runs out to his car for last man at teacher resupply i realize that this is my chance to try my hand at stateroom i get a tray of shots from the woman has been helping rayon and i start making the rounds a i ai yo one try one of these the the yea from queer to no evil i i i o o oh yow lets go and i do follow r but when we find er friends they all just stare at me maybe it is not clear i say do you want free to hula and they just say no thanks a i i can do i a o nothing i if there is one thing i should not be hard to give away in a bar it is free drinks and yet as i go from corner to corner no one is drinking off my head no one is pulling anything out of my part of the problem is ism not run an maybe i should shave my head and loosen up a little but beyond that but i do not realize until ism out their doing it is as much as i love to drink and as much as i love was ta cirvof to hula and as much as it'd love another free trip to quart donation i feel weary pushing some big company's message that is slamming down shots is a great game the drinking always equals fun which even when knows is an exactly true because one thing i have not mention yet and probably should have is the than does not drink at least not any more ow is follow as in in oi n i he haves o to not little in a going aim join n o aims o him be yon not a o one a b m tender god in a en do one ben run to wit tasty mogerida wo take where the hart of than back is writing new lyrics to existing rockswos it described the pleasures of drinking chervil or give very precise directions on had to do a body shot here is an example shots with her without training wheels query does not hurt it heels it is a little unnerving to hear knowing that the person who wrote these lyrics as the same person who quit drinking more than a year ago in part because he was afraid that it might kill him he was kicked out of a hotel in florid for throwing a table off the balcony in shine lousy blacked out in the middle of a promotion and a quervonation he got loaded he cursed out an elderly guest he was supposed to be entertaining was it an older guy probably a sixties and they were professional contest winners and he is talking at dinner about all these other contests he wane and how this one was nicer than this one and an bovine it sound he is complaining a little bit about something and i was shan't you shut up is a free freaking trap old man o say why do not you take your professional contest winning attitude to shove it up your and the next day i will cupid i know i says something of the problem for roan was that in most cases that is very bad to be caught drinking on the jobs but in roman's case it only made a more successful the wilder and drunker he got the more bars wanted him back the more query one am back and what amazes me is that at the time than was deciding to get sober query asked him to sign on for another hundred promotional gigs over the course of the coming year and ran said ow about one fifty that is every wee cant almost half the year spent in bars to keel on his head to keel a spilling down his face it must be eve working in the apple factory in its own by snakes how does it feel as someone wo dozen drink any more to be confront end on a nightly basis with people who might be the drunk and hurting former you i just do not think about it all that much because it there is nothing i can do about it either way and i just do not know think that is it i m i cannot make any judgment i means is nobody that i could tell you that my needs to stop drinking and know it for sure i can certainly say light i reminds me of me an o that that happens a lot i but when it comes down to i just now it is up to them ages it is not my call rhymes a hundred and fifty day barhop for query is almost over his current contract is coming to a close and he is now working on a new very different project i sonic ma what's yon i save you'll a i to panastonisonic he this is a television ad for the panasonic sonic shaper man electric shaved which than plays a character called sonic nan he got the gig from someone o saw i doing a query a promotion and a lot of it is the same he jumps around in public costing people yelling at them convincing them of the superiority of this particular brand shaver by hopping into fountains and getting spray the shy but if it sounds as if there is no difference think of this first people do not generally drink while they are shaving and second when's an actor now an actual actor with national exposure a good agent making decent money the back of plan is brought him back to his original plan and ism happy form but also kind of sad put it this way i still kind of wane to be quell man but i do not think it'd ever want to be sonic man the fact is ran keeping something behind the boos obviously and that is a good thing but also the boccamalian power of the loose instanter we contradictions up made quizzical man more than a day john it'll little kind of inspired extension o ring himself which is to say the kind of a sots come out

o a o a you a you did this do what you wanted to do i think for sure yet it a totally felt the perfect solution to the problem of d making friends as you get older because it is really as you get older ism not that old but the thing i miss most as an adult is is time is it is time is valuable now and you do not you to have the same conversations that you did when you were an high school where you would be on the home with some one for eight hours a night or you would to stay up and stall night long and tell every single thing that ever happened to you and it was even less that had happened to you because you were fifteen years old and twas just i much talking much bonding bonding bonding bonding and isn't a dust you just do not have they to chance to do that very much and then ow an now we get now now we are really good friends since then like got an union all of her references i i feel lie have known her much longer than i have but but is is not is not kind of the point of of being friends of somebody that when they tell you this information that it happens an a conversation that that is that that is not if back around for the french but that actually is sir y i mean i mean some good sure but but friends the pastor i the i could not that that it different sometimes because i gets to a point where you just have all these kind of bottled stories i got busboy friend he did this and i have this boy for see did this and it meant this and it meant that and whine of of put those stories on a case tapetum when listen to all once starlet kine coming up stock puppets dining for stake and kidnapping is plan be in a minute from chop above a radio when our program continues to smart can lie from our a glass you took on a program of course we choose some theme bring your at variety of different kinds of stories on that theme today show plan b stories of people ditching their expectations and living inside a back up plan as must of us do we have arrived at act three of our program that three when kidnapping his plan be even now i think out very keen and has a hard time thinking of himself as a kidnapper you grab in sudden californium and allabim my to high school with children of move stars and other superrich people and if you could say that he had a plan for his life he achieved a lot of it by the age of twenty two was early nineteen sixties he was youngest member of the was anguish stock exchange he successulwe put to this in realistatedeas he was making a lot of money but he doll streamed drinking heavily i be came an twisted perkadam another pain killers you course if your drinking and taking strong pan killers you get very numbed out and a on a good day you might have an hour of rational thinking quote on quote rational thinking and then also the market had a big down turn and a late sixty two early sixty three and my real estate deals went sour in a period of six months i went from earning about in the neighborhood of ten thousand month nineteen sixty three dollars to a a trying to sell transparent window shades dor to more to stores in the middle of the desert and it is nineteen sixty three your hallowed at that pint twenty three s you have gone broke at twenty three and then you come up with this plan be well one day i decided while i have to do something radical and in my demented state suddenly it came to me that a the way to solve my problems was to i get some money somehow and i would have to be illegally because i was obviously incapable of raising money for my realistate projects an security's projects i came across in a kidnapping was same a good idea and i put a business plan together and went to my a way a a kid napping si a a good idea and you put a business planned together yes i was very business or and and it was i never referred to it as a kidnapping it was going to be it was the plan of operation was kind an under writing a securities under writing but i had to go take somebody is kid in order to raise the money to invest in business propositions and the course in or to be being a good catholic the only way i could get rid of the sin was to pay the money back ultimately you know you anas that you you say that kidnapping seems a reason abelochand was not there any part of it that kind of horrified you no because in my a in my drug in due state you might say i m it to a it i i knew i was not get a hurt anybody and therefore it was not going to be a crime as far as my moral character was concern and as long as i was willing to pay the money back and and was absolutely not gun to her anybody than seemed those o ka s men to who you decided to kidnap well i went down the list of all the wealthy people i knew and who had kids that i knew there was city doubles his father i was see el of doubles air craft that was eliminate a she was a girl a him kitchen knew me too well and his father robot micron he know his rich one month and then broke the next and a then rather lake who father was johnny wise teller all these people that had famous parents and now i went down the list than finally i i thought of nancy and a granny nancisanatra the oldest daughter of franks on notion and a then i of course junior and of course i i say junior on referring to franks not junior frank seniors son and had you met him before i had seen him i mean i knew nancy and high school and and junior high and a had been to her home several times and knew that that the sun who was a way at boarding school was sort of distant from the girls the girls were doted upon the junior was saw all as sort of out of the picture how much ran time money you we v en ask a two hundred and forty thousand that we i i made a list of all the money we needed both for investments and the help my parents and i it came out two ode in forty thousand dollars since is on o have to pay a back i did not want a raise more money than i could easily pay back and you decided you dentin to you we gin to take the money and then you can do what to makeup back i was going to invest and in real estate projects invest the lot angels and and a the specific stock as gan invest in was crisper at the time which was in the toilet and a course made a spectacular come back and at various several different stocks and some real estate which ultimately became arena delay the world's largest marina and if in in fact if had by some miracle had ever gotten the money and in id effect invested would have turned out the way the i had it out line on my business plan the investments were actually fairly prudent it just was the concept was a little off and and is you were in o take this capital you were in invest in this staff and then you an make a profit over i guess a couple years a you would be about as a five year plan and then in the end of five years you were going to give the money back to sonata is set send the money back to franksonnotra and just imagining the reaction that he and the f bi would have when the ransom money starts coming back to m and just explain how the plan of operation was gin to we how the whole thing would come off whereverybody would be at the end house of ki her was an index a in a throwing binder with the indexes and o one of the sections was the benefit to the sonogram family and i would bring father and son closer to gather and at the times on ora was being investigated for his connections with the mob and money wandering through the talent a lodge and sands a casino and lot fags and i thought well that might i even help him there you may not have it help his image yes help the helped because i felt that if the public would perceive him as a worried parent rather than a a famous singer hanging out with the off a woulds cast him in a more favorable image and that was one of the things i listed in the benefits of the sonogram family the thing but that planbarry is is that o it in a way it is utterly logical it just proceeds from a prams that crazy i same people do not wake up one day in designing in go kind out the most famous entertainer in the world who has now mafia connections and you can have the f bi and the moi after you the same people do not do that and particularly thinking that there can a benefit the victims as well as their own family when ask very can in to tell me what happened when he tried to put his plan be into a fact and do the kidnapping he is de such pains to get the truth of it a cross to me and to prove especially that the blame for the crime falls entirely on him and to on to post he enlisted help with the kidnapping an straight is filled with fart tom any details and takes far longer then we can spend here suffices tit delay that it was a comedy of errors and remember of nineteen sixty three the twenty three board keen in and a friend nab the nineteen year old franks an atrerginior was performing it lake aha henna accidentally left his gun in son orris hotelhim he didn't have any cash to by gas or to get away car during the get away his buy get claimed out of the car into a snowstorm and knocked himself out by running into a tree branch when the cut franks an outta senior and demanded ransom sand i to offered them a million dollars and they tried to talk him down to two hundred forty thousand as that what it set in the plan we sent frank to a gas station payphone to get the next instructions about how to get a sun back no franks nectar senior and the f bi go racing down the carbon city thirty minutes away and in about fifteen minutes on started calling for frank sonogram to the gas station and the mechanic at the gas station who was busy in by himself i kept answering the phone and this c alley was asking for franksonot to the most famous entertain of the world time and the guide got very angry when this caller was calling back time and again for franksonotra he thinks it is a funny once e i thinks it is a prank of some sort and as soon as he hung up from the third time after letting john have it with four letter words the before you can gets back too car in screeches two after i cars and franksonotr senior jumps out of the cards as might ans franksonotrhav i had any calls and you can imagine the the the reaction hat that poor mechanic had finally one more time and john call back and this time frank answered the one and johns told him what the next step was on to be berry did it did it occur to you that the person who you were kidnapping and their family would be aromatized and and frightened no because the wait that the plan of operation was design in the way i wrote it out in the script it was always supposed to be just between franks and ora senior franksonoter junior my group of people and the a be the the mother and sisters were not to be involved in the kidnaping and and i based upon what i knew about franksnotr senior and the family and forth i did not think that he would let his wife know if he thought the kidnapping was going to be resolved in a matter of a few hours i wonder if the fact that you constructed such an elaborate web of project with out your business plan that that made the kidnapping seemed reasonable and even good for the snares i wonder if that prevented you at the time from comprehending what you were putting them through absolutely i had i rationalize than justified i i had god's approval anthem sing was being divinely blessed what was the sign that it had god's approval on can dot god talk to me particularly when i would go to church and light a candle and be still and i would hear in god talking to me an sad telling me what i had to do and he was very definite about nobody could be hurt and a had to pay the money back as you have got an older and sober of and gotten wiser does god still talk to you oh no no that went away when i got over and also got psychiatric help i when i hear voices nowadays i do not pay any attention to him after successfully getting two hundred forty thousand dollars in ransom money and returning franks octergunior safely home berry can in his accomplishes were caught aim was sentenced to life was seventy five years but was released after just four years because he psyceactric valuation found that he was legally insane at the time of his time he returned to the real estate business we was wildly successful became a millionaire a few years ago he soled his kidnapping straight to the move studios for several times more than the original ransom a he should his papers indicating that poll of his profits from the sail would go to charity and says that he agreed to a movideal only to set the record straight about a lie that he told during his trial back in the nineteen sixties back then he says he spread a rumor that the kidnapping was only a publicity stunk stage by the senates and not a real kidnapping under the son of samba which says that convicted fellows cannot make a profit from selling their own stories grandson abri junior challenged genie's contract with the move studios it betray two thousand to the calipforn you supreme court ruled in keen and favor clearing the way for the movie to be made but he never was the studio bumpy pictures put the tragic toehold and then in two than three show time made the story into a found with we e match may see and have it our cat berrykann got no money from the deal a why not ta me can you see in n guavas you the my want en a for a fate must of us feer years ago living in canada jonathan goldstone had a job selling the mongrel gazette newspaper of the telephone was at normal kind of plan be that must of us had at one point or another and when he took the job he did not realize that it would become a ten year chapter in his life when you are a little kid you never decided that one day you are going to be a telemarketer it is not something that you plan it just happens the way going ball just happens whore the way falling down a flight of stairs just happens one minute your at the talk of the landing and the next you are at the bottom and you will be damned if you can remember each one of the individual steps that led you between the two all during the time i was working at the gazette i found it nearly impossible to bring myself to tell anyone i was a telemarketer when people asked what it was i did for a living i simply say that i was sales in andwhen they asked what it was that i sold i would say dreams and then i would look at them for a moment whimsically then i would say that was only joking and then they would say of and i would become uncomfortabland then they would become uncomfortable then they would stop asking me any this as you might expect the hard thing about working at the gazette was that there was just much rejection even though you were calling almost two hundred people a day ninety eight percent of who wanted to see you dead you still had to bring a certain hopefulness to each call a feeling that this one the call you were making right now could be the one it was almost trying to hypnotize yourself and to believing that something a certain to say gravity did not exist and the next time you drop the apple it will not fall to the ground but it will float up into the sky a helium blood i would often pretend the people on the other end of the line were so puppets to soften the sting of their hang up i want shared this thought with a girl who had just started working there pretend there is a little talk puppet on the other end i encouraged all cute with coat button eyes holding the phone in his mouth she considered the logic of this for a moment how does he talk with a phone in his mouth she asked and for this i really did not have an answer in the pitching room we all wore these headsets that were connected to computers as soon as we hung up the computer automatically dial the next number that we were always speaking to some one without respite our boss was a man named ray and if you made two or three sales a day then you were doing o say and ray would not scream at you generally i found the repetitiousness of the job comforting you are never had a loss for words you always know what you are going to say because what you were going to say is hi my name is jonathan and i wanted to know if you are interested in reading the gazette newspaper one time a woman who answered the phone would not believe i was not a friend of hers named christopher stop playing around christopher she said but ism not christopher i responded will you cut it out christopher after several minutes of this i had to hang up on her i knew that christopher was going to get it for that from my very first week at the gazette i was surprised to discover that i had a natural gift for sales whatever i was and whatever askedpirations i had before i started working there i became an instant gazette ledge some times selling up to ten subscriptions in the course of a shift i got on the phone of g people and i made the want to listen i joked you we and in flirted with the women i mentally cajoled them bundling the up in my good strong tell marketing arms and toss them up into the air where they scream delightedly only to land back down with the brand new gazettes s portion i would look are owned me at the other sat says and the pitching room and wonder how they could go on to creeping by with their two or three sales a day tell a marketing had been my back up land but now i found myself faced with the uncomfortable fact that it was what i was truly did at i got myself a lucky ballpoint panda spent half a day's pay on he fancy had a shay case to put my needs in i even had a special way of filling out the order forms that involved clear capital letters and exes never checks and the box as marked mesa or master card there was a bell on ray's desk for when you made a sale and when i made a sale i had a special way of hitting it with the balls of my fingers that made at sound as crisp and clean as a glockansh i always kept to the one tap for sale rule i respected the bell not some of the other guides who rang the crap at t t it they were five year words writing their first to wheeler the office manager was a man named billy billy was a fat lad mouth green man in a skin tight human shirt one of billy's jobs was to keep us and spared with detox billy would explain to us when he first started working at the gazette he was sitting right where we were and that now he makes as much money as a plumber and that in fact we all had the opportunity to make as much as a plumber ism going out and eating a big fat stake tonight he would say just the way at the end of the day a plumber does eventually as happens to all the mighty i fell even now i cannot explain it you wrist my diet perhaps i started taking myself too seriously and lost my sense of fun who knows but whatever the case i suddenly found myself desperate for sales that at the end of a shift still with nothing i would order the paper to my own address and than cancel at the following week it is a very real thing the stink of desperation hit is an actual odor and people can smell it over the phone line your jokes become little more hurried and forced your confidence a little more false your pauses more awkward i soon found myself gazing longingly at the filled out order sheets clutched in the fist of the new office superstar a seventeen year old who is phone name was candy who would stroll past my desk coming taken care of business now when i came back from the bathroom during my ship ray would ask me what the hell took long the toilet was for closers a few weeks ago i got home and found this on my answering machine when the tell a make to realize that there was no one they are to pitch to he stopped himself but i want you to listen again and notice the long pas before he actually puts the phone down he says hallo he inhale and before he puts the phone down he pauses i some one who sold over the telephone for close to ten years i can tell you that the paws between the hollo and the hang up is a moment of reprieve you start to talk you realize you have got in an answering machine and then before you actually hang up you steal a moment you take shelter in those few seconds before you hit the hang up button and the onslaught of automatically died phone numbers begins anew delivering the voices of people who'll very soon hate you directly into the earphones of your headset and straight into your brain i played the message over and over listening to it not to better hear the chaos of the pitching room but to try and imagine what was going through his head and at the same time i tried to remember what wen through my own head during those pauses it was always sort of that moment in a her film but a guy who is having his head hell down an a bath up of water pops up one last time and got before he has pushed back down and his around for ever since the numbers were automatically dialed you never knew who was going to pop up in your head sad one time i got my friend mark's nicer on the phone a guy who i had not seen in years mark was in my junior high hired class he used to get excited while playing lowball that he clutched the ball to his chest and roll around the floor jeweling i tried to keep him on the phone as long as possible never saying who i was gleaning whatever i could about his life i could hear his kids playing around trying to steal the phone from him and all through out i was shocked by how unfailingly decent he was with me i felt the anonymous stranger who those up on christian day to test a family's kindness mark did not by the paper but he did not rush me off either it felt good to know that mark's nicer had grown up to be a really nice man there was also one time i got my grandmother after several minutes of talking about how weird it was that i had got in her number out of all the numbers in the city she told me that she had just learned that morning that my grandfather's cancer had come back i looked across the room where billy the manager was eating french fries and some one else was ringing the bell on race ask after i hung up the phone with her not a second later another call popped into my head sad hi am calling from the gazette i sad my grandfather would be dead within the year and then one day i got my own number i cannot explain it better than to say that having that happened is sort of rounding the corner and running into yourself at first you don't quite recognized that it is you you look a little shorter and less handsome but then all of a sudden in one naked instant you are face to face with herself my was the tell marketing dog that it caught its own tell maria and tale the message that i left myself because you just cannot resist leaving yourself a message when something the o here i am god this is awful was is horrible his has to mean something but of course it did not mean any g and then for the next several seconds i listened to silence on the other end of the line my own line as i worried about the rapid fire calls that would start again the moment i hung of when i got back home i had exactly two messages on my machine one was the message from myself i was surprised by how loud the background noise was behind me and how much smaller i sounded than had imagined all these years the other message was from my mother she was imploring me to go back to school and become a speech there us out of the boatswain is to hos to the podcast heavy weight whose ne see and starts and and ai

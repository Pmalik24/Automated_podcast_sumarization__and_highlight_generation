welcome to the supermen capon cans a science since tace to s for li i may drehubermen and on a professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing affine affine is one of the most widely use substances on the planet estimates are that more than ninety per cent of adults and as many is fifty per cent of kids that is adolescence and teen ages use affine on a daily basis affine is an amazing molecule most people are familiar with caffeine's ability to increase alertness and to reduce our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue and indeed it does that but what most people are not aware of is that affine acts as a strong reinforcer what i mean by reinforcer is that when affine is present in a drink or food and less indeed affine is present in many foods even unbelts to us when it is present in drinks in foods we actively come to those foods and drinks more than if waffle were not contained in those foods and drinks it reinforces our liking of particular foods and drinks and indeed it even reinforces our liking of the containers they are consumed from and the company we keep when we consume foods and drinks that contain affine that is affine is notjust a stimulant affine is a reinforcer and it is a reinforce are that place an active role in almost everybody's daily life we can say that i confidence because as i mention a moment ago more than ninety percent of people are consuming affine and most people think that they consume affine because it makes them feel more alert but there are many reasons why you are consuming affine and ism not going to tell you that consuming affine is necessarily bad in fact to day ism going to tell you about many of the positive health benefits of affine including neural protective effects ant i depressive effects and certainly performance enhancing effects both for mental performance and for physical performance now that said there are certain situations in which you want to avoid affine and there are certain people who might opt to avoid affine that is especially the case when one thinks about affine not just as a stimulant but as a reinforcer in fact affine is such a strong reenforce that if even tiny amounts of affine are present in certain foods and drinks you will very quickly come to prefer those foods in drinks over other choices which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what sorts of food and drink choices your trying to make to day ism going to inform you about how affine works at a mechanistic level i promise to do that with a minimum nomen cloture in such that even if you do not have a background in biology you will be able to digest that information easily and then it'll tell you how to use affine to your advantage or conversely how to avoid affine at certain times to your advantage today episode will focus both on mechanisms and tools that is the use and leverage of affine to improve mental health physical health and performance before w go any further into o days discussion i want to tell youabout some recent results about a molecule that is found in certain marinated beverages and that has been proving to be very useful for both weight loss mental performance and controlling blood sugar levels and that is g l p one or glucagon peptic one glucagon peptide one is found in the brain and body it acts both on the brain and body it does many different things but one of its primary effects its been discovered is to reduce hunger and it does that two ways it does that by activating certain neurons in your hypofalmus that istle brain region that controls hunger and satiety it makes us feel full at the level of the brain it makes us feel sated that is and it actually makes us feel full turns out that g l p one acts on certain receptors in the gut to make us feel as if we have ingested enough food t does not nesserely make us feel as if our gut is distended but it makes us feel full that is really interesting because if you think about it when we eat our stomach fills up obviously and that information has to be communicated to the brain such that the brain can then send satiny signals that actually shut off our hunger and believe are not the brain actually activates signals to reduce the desire to the when our stomach is full an g l p one as i mention works on the brain to create these feelings of satiety as if we have had enough and to reduce our desire to eat more and g l p one acts directly on the got to give us a slight sense of fullness in the gut which then is communicate to the brain really there are two parallel signals being sent when we have g l p one present in our system a little bit of relevant history on g l p on who was actually discovered in heels monsters these are these a reptiles that can go long periods of time without eating and a very clever scientists aside to study why it is that certain animals heelamonsters can go along period of time without ingesting anything it is because they produce very large amounts of g l p one they isolate the peptide from g l p one than they looked for the analogous peptide in humans and it turns out that does exist and as i mention it is released in both brain and body to make you feel full and sated why am i telling you all this well today we are going to talk about fine and there is one particular rafting source which is er hamate and there some other forms of ts similar to carbamate that stimulate the release of g l p one significantly there are also nowadays drugs which are called analogues of g l p one these are drugs that mimic or are identical to the kind of g l p one that you would make and those drugs are proving to be very effective for the treatment of certain forms of diabetes and for the treatment of city but they trigger enormous amounts of g l p one pathway activation those are extreme cases for people that are really struggling for weight lot but the clinical trials and the data that are out there in the general population ow are very very promising for g l p one analogues er hamate t provided it is not the smoked variety and i mention that because a number of people have cued me to the fact that carbamate ts come in s moved varieties and non smoke varieties in the smoked varieties are thought to perhaps be carsonagenic that is romancer causing i advise people to avoid smoked varieties of your borate t but yerbomate ts are known to stimulate significant amounts of g o p one release and they can be effective as a weight lost to mainly by blunting appetite and again they do that both at the level of the brain and at the level of the gut now all of what i just told you as been known for some period of time but there are new set of findings that were just published in sell reports medicine sell press journal excellent journal which indicate exactly how it is that g p one stimulates both retied end cantrigger additional weight loss through other mechanisms and i find the mechanism to be really interesting and actually really important given some other topics we have covered on this pod casts before the basic finding is that g p one whether not its stimulated through the release of a analogue drug that one is prescribed or by drinking your hamate t for instance and stimulate release of your own called indogenist get p one yes it makes you feel more full at the level of brain and body but it turns out it also stimulates thermogenesis nothermogenisis is the active utilization of more metabolic energy and fat cells in particular called age and brown fat cells are a potent source of thermogenic activity in your body the basic background is that you have white atapostcells white fat cells you have age fat cells and your brown fat cells in the age and brown ones are catcalls that you actually want more of they are not abundant under your skin there abundant really round your clavicle in your upper neck they are the ones that generate heat and the age and brownness of them is actually the consequence of having a lot of mite conduit in those cells when g p one is elevated in your system it turns out that it communicates to those white fat cells and helps convert them into age and brown fat cells that is it takes fat cells that are not doing anything useful for you except being stored energy and i think most people out there would to have fewer of those white anapest cells they're few of you out there that as shall need more of them that are too thin too lean but most people are suffering from having too many of these white anapest cells well when you ingest your borate t or you were to take a g p one analogue or stimulate g p one in any number of different ways yes you stimulate increase ta city but your also stimulating the conversion of these white fat cells into age and brown fat cells which makes you more thermogenic and over time rases your bail metabolic rate you are burning more calories even at rest it also makes you feel as if you are more comfortable and colder environments at rest this is very much the same as the mechanism that is induced when you were to say take a cold shower or do regular ice bats are get into cold water regularly that too stimulates the conversion of white fat cells to age and brown fat cell ls i these findings very much because they provide a mechanistic coherent they provide that is a really nice story as to how something g o p one could be effective for weight loss yes on the one hand g p one is reducing appetite and that of course will help people maintain or lose weight but it is also increasing basil metabolic rate and we now know how that is accomplish its likely accomplish at least through this one mechanism by the stimulation of conversion of these wight fat cells which do not do much for us at set at as energy storage units to these metabolically metacondrol rich age and brown fat cells which you can think of a sort of the oil in the candle that allows your furnace your metabolism to burn at a higher temperature and a higher rate that is the mechanism and the basic tool take away is that if you are somebody whose interested in losing weight and you want to leverage the g o p one pathway drinking a cup or two of bromate t early in the day would be a great weight to stimulant g p one release there are other ways to stimulate go p one release you can get it through certain forms of exercise in particular fast exercises is actually a vote in favor of fast exercise there is a debate as to whether not fasted cardie burns more fat than monastic cardie in the the data basically say no it does not really matter but that does not really take into account the longer arc of things go p one release that needs to be taken into considerations ho could do fasted cardie you could drink eurbomate t keeping i on the bromate t does contain fine will talk more about the specific forms of stimulants include canine that mate has mutate would be a a great weigh to stimulate go p one release and then of course for those of you that are interested in more robust activation of g o p one then perhaps you might want to consider some of the new prescription g o p one analogues that are out there but that is a more severe a stimulus for go p one of course and for everybody regardless of whether not your chino lose weight wainwright or maintain weight think we are going to be hearing a lot more about g o p one analogues and drinks and supplements one things o that sort that stimulate g o p one in the very near future because it does appear to be a very important biological mechanism before we begin it'd to emphasis that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and scene related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back to l ectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating look if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doom slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elemementy doom slash supermen let us talk about affine si mentioned earlier affine is consumed by basically most all adults every single day and consumed at very regular times each day in fact if you were to take a look at your affine in take or the affine in take of somebody close to you what you would realize is that they are do not do well if their affine in take arrives even ten twenty or thirty minutes past the expected or usual in take of faffing that is pretty remarkable and it brings to mind ideas that we are all quoting addicted to affine or that affine is somehow bad ism certainly not going to make the argument that affine is bad first of all i may regular affine user i would not call myself a affine abuser but i am i regular affine user and affine is known to have certain health benefits i listed off a few of them earlier but it'll mention those again now before going forward affine is known to have certain her protective effects and that is because of its ability to increase neramodulator such as dopamine but also other call katicolomines nor up ineffrin if you do not know what those names mean these are molecules that increase levels of alertness motivation and drive and then therefore not surprisingly the large sale analysis of the relationship between depression in affine shows that provided people are not drinking much affine that it makes them overly anxious that regular in take of affine is inversely related to levels of depression it may have some anti depress in effects and those could be direct or indirect what o i mean by that well you could imagine that people are in jesting affine and they are more motivated to do work and pursue quality social interactions then the probably that they will have depression could be lower it could also be that there are direct effects on the chemical systems of the brain that relate to mood and well being that could offset depression it is not clear whether or not the effects of affine in countering depression are direct or indirect none the less there is a relationship there and it is an interesting and positive one or i should say negative correlation positive a effect over all on mood and well being to be exact now it is also the case that affine can improve mental performance and physical performance this has been demonstrated in tens of thousands of studies i will review a few studies on this in particular to day but jo just give you a sense of how affine works at the level of it is timing and impact on mental performance and physical performance when we binge s affine provided that we do not have a lot of food in our stomach and that our bloodshuger is not particularly high generally we experience and increase in alertness within about five minutes and that increase in focus in alertness peaks around thirty minutes after ingestion of affine and persists for as long as sixty minutes now this is assuming that one takes affine in pill form or drinks the entire coffin drink within a short period of time but a titbit later it'll talk about how you can consume affine at regular intervals while doing mental work or physical work in a way that can further increase mental performance and physical performance but let us just touch on what coffin an take really does for mental performance an physical performance perhaps the most robust finding across all of the studies that have examined is that affine reduces our reaction time that is it improves our reaction time it doesn't make it longer it makes it shorter for instance in a laboratory study where people were asked to a hi a lever every time they here a tone you can greatly reduce the time between the tone and the pressing of the lever if people invest affine about thirty minutes be for they do that task now that seems a trivial task but this is also seen in the domain of sports performance and even in connive performance where people have to arrive at a particular answer to a question and the answer to that question has to be pulled from their memory banks within the brain there hippocampus for instance a brainstructure solved in memory and if you are asking people for instance to remember the capitals of different states or cities or to remember certain historical facts they will do that at a particular rate but if they have invested affine within the hour prior their ability to recall that information is much much better they are fast er end it does not appear that accuracy is reduce in fact in many cases accuracy is in hance and that is because coffin both works on the reaction time systems of the brain and body it'll talk about the mechanisms for that in a little bit but it also stimulate certain euro transmitters and called neuromodulators within the brain and body that give the neural circuits in the brain that are associate with learning and memory a lower threshold to activation what does that mean that means that we are better able to access the brain circuitry involved in learning an memory when we have a certain amount of coffin circulating in our system this makes fine and incredible performance enhancing compound and i could give you tens of thousands of examples of this in humans but before i do that i want to just touch on what we know about the existence of affine in nature and what the existence of affine in nature and its effects on other animals tells us about what affine does in humans because as i alluded to earlier what affine is doing for us is not just making us more alert improving our memory improving our reaction time and on it is actually acting as a powerful reinforcer of experience and it is acting is not just a powerful reinforcer of the affine contain dining drink that we drank but also the mug that it is contained in plus the person that we might be sitting across from when we consume that coffin and on and forth if it is a little bit hard feu conceptualize what a reinforcer is and why am calling it a reinforcer let me spell it out in three specific ways we often hear about the word reward and we think o we if we do certain things and we the outcome than those certain things are rewarded right if we are doing something we receive praise the praises a reward and therefore we are more likely to do that thing in the future a a lot of parenting is that and a lot of life's that however when we hear the word reward we often think about something that feels good to us and certainly if we have worked hard and we get some praise that is natural for the praise to feel good to us or for instance if we awe work very hard and we get a certain outcome a trophy a financial outcome a degree outcome recognition et camera all of those contact as rewards but those are all conscious rewards we are aware that they are happening reenforces are little but different because the word reinforcement can apply to conscious rewards of the sort that i just described but therefore also many ways in which affine stimulates the release of chemicals in our body that act as reinforcers but those reinforcers are subconscious that is we are not aware that they cause this preference for the activities that cause their release the study em about to describe beautifully i believe in capsulate how is it that humans came to consume affine and why affine exists in nature and the powerful effects of coffin as a reinforcing agent both in animals insects and in you an me and the title of the paper is affine and floral sector enhance as a pointers memory of reward keep in mind that affine is made from plants we say dug but i think some of us do not realize that the reason why there is coffin and coffee as because coffee comes from plant is a coffee been certainties which of course are plants people brew affine is contained in those tees such as ye are romance well why would this bitter substance because in fact coffin is quite bitter in high concentrations i with his bitter substance be something that insects or animals would want to consume at all turns out that in most plants coffin is present in small enough quantities that insects and other animals and in fact we cannot actually taste the coffin if i were to give you a little bit of pure affine yes it would be a stimulant for you but you would say that it tasted awful it is in a category of compounds that would strongly stimulate the bitter receptors on your tongue and would make you cringe and pucker and essentially walk away from whatever it is that contain that affine and from the experience that contain that affine well in nature affine is present in very low concentrations or is masked by other flavors within flowers beans and plants and what this paper really points to is that affine in nature is acting as a reenforce for bees that are consuming different nectar the way that it works is that bees of course go from flour to flour and they are consuming the nectar they are bringing nectar and plan back to the hive and that provides critical nourishment for the bee colony the bees are foraging in a way that includes information about color and particular ultra violet color things that we cannot see but they can see cause they different photoreceptor than we do what the study shows is that plants and nectar that contain very small amounts of affine are the preferred sources of food for bees and the study is beautiful because they were able to confirm that they could mask the affine taste its they know that the bees are not preferring the taste of affine but what they do is they pair affine with different fruit sources for the bees than they remove the affine and what they find is that the bees very strongly prefer flavors that contain affine not because they could taste the affine but rather for the way that those affine containing flavors made the bees feel how do those coffin containing flavors make the bees feel the same way that they make you and i feel a little bit more alert and thereby able to do more work for the bee the more work is the and sumption of more food which then has a further reenforcing effect s what really talking about here is the fact that e affine exists in nature in plants it exists in concentrations that are very low low in fact that they are not detectable to the tastes receptors of insects and in many cases to the taste receptors of humans and of course there can be high levels of affine in a plant but if the plant also contains compounds that mask the flavor of affine well then those plants are going to essentially be even stronger reenforces for the flavor of the plant makes an our talking about strong flavors plus strong now stimulant effects of affine and the most important point here is that all of these effects of fine are subconscious it is not because the bee or you likes the taste of coffin in fact most people when they take their first sip of coffee they find that taste bitter and kind of noxious they do not it you may not even remember that because it happen long ago and because affine is such a strong reenforceare that very quickly you come to the taste of coffin you might even come to the feeling of your mug in your hand you might even come to the smell of off and on and forth and that is because affine stimulates the release of certain narrow chemicals in the brain in particular dopamine and mental cop long two neuromodulators that increase our focus and alertness in our feelings a well being limit later it'll tell you that fine stimulates the release of opening in a way that is very much distinct from the classical opening pathway associated with addiction and reward in fact we can think of faffing as having a somewhat privileged access to the reward systems it'll give you a bit of a hint of where this is going affine stimulates the release of opening and assets coming not within the classic called mess limbic reward pathway that us fancy nurse speak for the reward pathways o the brain the associate with things sex and food and drugs of abuse cocaine mat them redefine but rather affine seems dissimulate the release of dopamine in the parts of the brain that are associated with alertness and cognition meaning the forebrain this is very important wee multiple opening systems in the brain and body and affine seems to stimulate opening directly within the components of the brain that are associated with clarity of thought and well being but more clarity of thought now ism also talking about affine as a strong mean former in that it makes you feel good over all and it does and that suggests that it also paths into the more classic reward pathway but it does that in a very interesting and of frankly almost diabolical way when we regularly in just affine it stimulates the increase in opening receptors at multiple signs throughout the brain but in particular within the reward pathways of the brain not the areas of the bring their associated with focus and clarity of thought and cognition it does that but it is also increasing the level of opening receptors in the reward pathway and what that means is that for any opening that is released in response to a plosive experience social experience or any number of the other things that can stimulate opening release there r more receptors more parking spots if you will for that dopamine to arrive at and to exert its increases in mood increases in motivation and over all feelings of drive and excitement there four ways the affine works that we need to understand first of all affine acts as a reenforcing agent it increases the probability that you will return to and engage in a certain activity or consume a certain beverage or food second of all affine increases dopamine enasito coming which are both demodulators in the forebrain which helps us improve our ability to think to modify our rule sets that is to adjust our strategies for different social situations and mental demands and physical demands and third it increases the number and efficacy of opening receptors in the reward pathways of the brain that is it makes things that would feel pretty good feel even better and forth affine acts at an antagonist to a debasing which offsets the sleepiness that we would otherwise feel from the accumulation of a debasing the t occurs as we are wake for me and more hours throughout the day let us talk first about coffin as a reenforcing agent again sons first most beautifully demonstrated in the study on honey bees where the bees prefer sectors that contain affine and that all makes perfect sense in terms of the apology of bees and flowers that contain sector ah there is an advantage least terms of adaptatchen that the flower benefits because of distribution of things from the flour which is good for the the flowers and the bees benefit because they are getting food and there is a kind of a symbiosis there but with humans we were consuming coffin containing beverages for our sake i i do not think we have it in mind nor do the bees have in in mind frankly that we are trying to preserve the plants that provide the affine i think we would all ism suffer perishes a ninety percent of adults would suffer greatly if all the faffing containing a coffee an tea plants were gone certainly but most of us are not consuming coffees and teas and kaffneg containing foods because we are thinking about the plants that come from and we want to help those plants were thing about how we want to help ourselves and yet the point of the reinforcing effects of affine are that they are largely subconscious we are not a ware of them now you might say no that is not true when i drink affine it makes me feel really good i am aware that it makes me feel good in over to illustrate how reinforcement really works let me give you the counter example which would be an aversive agents we have reenforcing agents and we have aversive agents let us say that there were compounds in nature that exist in plants that are aversive and indeed they are and lets say that these compounds we are present at such low concentrations that you could not taste them let say you wake up in the morning and you go to your for aerator and you open it up and you are thirsty unto you reach for a nice a rich red containing beverage in a glass jar it looks a cranberry juice ore something that sort or even a nice clear glass of water it looks a jug of water glass water and you drink that take find you maybe even tastes great to you then let us say about thirty minutes later you feel old queasy you feel all off feel going back to sleep you just do not feel very good you do not know why but you are nervous system is a predictive machine and it has a process in which it back integrates a oh my integrates backwards into your immediate experience that proceeded that not good feeling we can reliably say that there is a much lower probability that the next day when you wake up that you would reach for the same beverage or for that same container even and maybe if you are in a novel environment may be your staying in an area bee or hotel or something that sort you might even find that you do not really the kitchen in which you consume that beverage in the first place dad you do not know why and unless you got very very sick that the day before it is unlikely that you would have such a strong response that you would entirely avoid for instance water or glass jars can training liquids et camera let say you went back to the refrigerator and you consume beverage again and you just did not feel while you felt less good than you normally would well even without any ability to taste what is in that beverage and even without any understanding of what was happening to you at a conscious level there is a very very high probability that you will avoid drinking that particular beverage and certainly at that location and in the same volume in the subsequent days that is just the way that aversion agents work and they work by way of activating turns in the gut that communicate with areas in the brain that give us this feeling of breeziness and for some of you hearing this that pathway and that association with times in which you felt queen and as if you want to vomit is powerful that you might even be feeling some of that symptomatology now for certain people that is going to be increase salivation which precedes vomiting we know that there is a class of neurons in the brain relate to aware called very postrema that actually stimulates vomiting and if i keep talking about this it'll probably fit i want a vomit some to move on from this in a moment when we unjust affine containing beverages and foods it is the exact opposite cesarean to what i just described affine as a rein former makes us feel slightly better or a lot better in the immediate minutes an hours after we insist it it is acting as a reinforcing agent not just while you are under the effects of affine but for the things that preceded the ingestion of waffle which is why you return again and again to affine containing beverages such as coffee and tea or maybe even foods that contain affine even if the taste of those foods is not something that you would otherwise consider especially delicious in fact most people when they take the first sip of coffee or tea or other affine containing beverage they find to be very bitter and that is not because of the taste of affine it is because of the taste of the beverage itself independent of coffin however when affine is present and there they come to prefer that taste over most all tastes in fact they will as i mention early er will invest a lot of financial resources and time and energy to make sure that they get that beverage what they are trying to make sure is not that they get that taste but that they get the affine it is that positively reinforcing and the taste therefore takes on new significance new meaning and we come to associate it as positive and infant most of us including myself love the taste of espresso love the taste of coffee love the taste of your hamate even if the initial taste the very first time that we consume that beverage was either neutral or negative and that is all because of the reinforcing properties of affine and then of course there are the more direct actions of affine that is the faster actions of affine and just o list this off again very briefly thatyou have them in mind going forward affine also increase is the release of dopamine and assets coming both which are naromodulators in the forebrain which increases clarity of thought and your ability to rule switch your ability to move from one contacts to another and change and understand the rules of engagement social engagement physical engagement mental engagement and forth and as i mention before affine also increases the number of opening receptors in the reward pathway such that any good thing that happens to you any positive experience that you have we will have a more potent effect on your feelings of well being and last but certainly not least affine actual and a decisive antagonist it reduces your feelings of lethargy and fatigue and your desire to sleep by parking in the receptors for a decisive and not allowing a denizens to have its pro sleepy if you will affects on your brain and body it'd to take a quick break and a knowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve m delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast there's i start taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be the probiatics that i need for got health our got is very important at populated by up microbioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probiatics unathletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptegins vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste crime if you to tryathletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash superman and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plane et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitamin d three k too again that is athletic green stock cam slash superman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply o vitemend three say to id to just briefly talk about a decisive and some of its molecular features and again if you do not have a background in biology do not worry i promise to make this very clear to everyone first of all affine is what is called a metal xanthine it is an it is a plant alkaloid that is why affine itself is very bitter end if i were to give you just the tiniest little bit of pure affine you would find it to be extremely aversive i say these plants that have snuck small enough amounts of affine into them or that have mass the flavor of affine with other flavors such that bees and humans want to consume them a while we do not know what plants think a it does seem very diabolical and very clever in that we are seeking out these affine containing a plants beverages and foods even though affine itself is this alkaloid is very very bitter bethels arsine that is affine binds to a decisive receptors and there really two types of a decisive receptors there these called a one receptors an the a two receptors and there present different parts of the brain and body at different levels we do not have to get to far into receptor subtypes more importantly to understand is that a decisive makes us feel tired because of the way that it taps in to the e t p pathway the eight t be pathway is central to energy production and feelings of overall energy in our brain and body in all sells an organ systems when affine binds to a decisive receptors it prevents a decisive from breaking down certain components of the energy production pathway and the net consequence of that is increase cyclic am pe basically when we invest affine we are biasing our system towards the pro energetic aspects of these cellar pathways now it is really important understand that in biology even if you block a receptor or you prevent the activity of anenzim and at least in this case you end up with more cyclic ape more energy you are not really getting more energy you are actually borrowing energy against an overall system that is frankly non negotiable what do i mean by that well let say that you were to wake up after six or eight hours of sleep and to drink a lot of affine and keep drinking kaffinethroughout the day throughout the day blocking those a dentine receptors yes you will offset fatigue you will offset sleepiness because that a dentine simply camp function but at the point where the affine becomes dislodged from the decisive receptors you will have a massive glut a back rogue of a decisive and you will feel extra extra sleepy really there is no way to create more energy in your system really what you are doing is your changing the timing in which the sleepy signals and the more energetic signals are arriving and this it's really important understand as as the backdrop to the various tools that were going to get into next in which you can use affine for enhancing mental performance and physical performance and other aspects of health but it is very important to understand this concept that when you wake up in the morning provided that you slept well and enough the night before you are levels of a decisive will be about as low as they will ever be ash in order to get your a decisive levels really bottomed out you want to avoid affine and the first ninety to hundred twenty minutes after waking will talk about why that is because it turns out there is a way to completely clear a decisive out of your system in the hour or after waken but for most people a decisive levels are going to be close to their lowest after a good night sleep but there is really no negotiating the accumulation of a decisive it is going to occur and going to base towards feeling more sleepy than you would otherwise that is can occur throughout the day there is rally no way to eliminated decisive all you can really do is block its fun ton it for borrowing energy against the fatigue that you will inevitably feel now this artily has very important social economical relevant before affine was regularly consumed by human beings we were really slaves to the light dark cycle n this was especially true before the presence of artificial lighting but even before the advent of artificial lighting humans were largely constrained to the outside light dark cycle we need to be active during the day and working during the day and we need to be a sleep at night affine allows us to divorce ourselves from that circadian cycle circadian just means about twenty four hour affine allows us to do that at least somewhat by way of increasing our alertness that is spiking our alertness at various times throughout the day and even at night this is how we can have shift workers for instance that can sleep during the day and the drink a strong cup of coffee at eight p m and then work into the night that ability completely transformed our society of course the healthiest schedule we know this with certainty the healthiest schedule for brain and body is going to be to be alert during the daytime and asleep at night there is no question about that shift workers run into all sorts of health problems and thank you shift workers for doing the important work that you do we need you a airtraffic controllers paramedics firefighters police officers et camera but we know that there are serious health consequences negative earth consequences that is for shift workers but for most people out there about nine five per cent of people follow a typical schedule o their wake during the day and a sleep at night and yet it used to be before the advent of caffeine containing beverages that if you ware sleepy in the afternoon you either had to take a nap or battle that sleepiness that your activity rhythms and your sleep rhythms were governed by these circadian changes in s availability of sunlight and when you slept and you justify have the ability to invest a beverage that would increase your levels of alertness because you block at decisive this is important understand that nowadays we certainly live in a time in which we use in fact ninety per center more of adult half or more of adolescence and teenagers use affine as a way to negotiate with to borrow against this natural pattern of a decisive making a sleepy but again you are just offsetting the effects of sleepiness the decisive causes you cannot eliminate the adenine entirely the important point is that a decisive as a pro sleepy molecule is a non negotiable aspect of your biology in fact it is non negotiable that every twenty four hours you are going to release a decisive and you are going to release the decisive in direct proportion to how long you have been awake the long you been awake the more decisive circulating your system therefore really only a handful of ways to completely clear out a decisive the major one being to get sleep the other is to take a short nap which of course is sleep but its shallow sleep or non sleep deep rest called ones my are has been shown to reduce levels of a denissine and there are certain things such as viewing morning sunlight which because of its effects on cortex all can quote and quote clearcut a decisive will talk about this in more detail in a minutes and there is also evidence that certain forms of exercise provided that it is brief and in tents can also reduce a decisive noxious block its effects now that we talk about some of the incredible mechanisms by which affine changes our experience of life increases alertness and mood et camera i want to talk about the use of affine as a tool now affine is a very potent and useful tool for enhancing mental health physical health and performance but there are certain considerations one has to keep in mind in particular dose now first off not everybody will respond to the same dose of affix the same way but we can reliably say that your body weight is a good measure by which you can estimaight what a healthy useful dose of affine would be for most people investing one to three milligrams of affine per kilogram of body weight is going to be the range in which affine can have positive facts without making us feel overly anxious and give us that feeling that and we are jumping out of our skin and turn the otherwise positive experience of affine into an aversive one for those we that are not familiar with thinking in terms of kilograms and normally thinking pounds it'll just quickly give you some general estimations that for instance one hundred kilograms equals two hundred and twenty pounds for me i weigh a hundred kilograms that means that one to three milligrams again milligrams thousandth of gram one to three milligrams of affine per milligram of bodiweight would mean for me i could safely invest one hundred to three hundred milligrams of affine in a single dose in a single drank if that is the way ism consuming it or piliform if that is the way that ism consuming it and it is very likely that that will be a tolerable dose however if you are not somebody that is a custom to drinking affine on a regular basis i suggest you start on the lower end of that one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight range for instance if you are somebody who weighs fifty kilograms that is approximately a hundred and ten pounds and you would be pretty comfortable in jesting somewhere between fifty and a hundred and fifty milligrams of affine what i recommend is that people who are considering using affine as a tool or who are already in jesting affine start to think about the dosage of affine that you are investing or plan to in jest and the timing in which you in jest that affine relative to certain tasks throughout your day your wearing and your sleep and will talk about that in just a moment but the first step for you is to figure out how much you weigh in kilograms and then to go to that number of one to three milligrams of ka fine per telegram of body weight and that is a good arrange in which you might want to explore the use of affine in a single application meaning a single dose now i do realize that some people out there are drinking coffee all day long or having coffee the morning and en again in the afternoon what am referring to here is the injection of waffle in a single bout right one cop of coffee or two cups of coffin for instance to achieve that one hundred to three hundred telegram range if that is what is appropriate for your body weight but to avoid any confusion when i talk about dosage of affine what ism really talking about is not the total amount of affine invested per day ism talking about the total amount of affine invested in one sitting or setting that is and if you are somebody who is drinking coffin multiple times throughout the day you can imagine for instance essay the appropriate dose for you in order to get in enhancement in mental performance or physical per romance is two hundred milligrams and you are somebody who is doing some work in the morning and you want to have that lift in the morning to be able to focus better and you are doing some physical exercise in the afternoon or vice verse that you would invest two hundred telegrams of coffin at two separate times per day separated by about four hours now you do not have to separate them you could of you could put them two hours apart for instance but we will talk about half life of fine and forth just keep in mind that if you are investing two hundred telegrams of coffin and that is the appropriate dose for you based on your body weight and then you are investing another two hundred telegrams of coffin an hour later you are effectively in jesting a proximately four hundred milligrams of coffin which is going to start exceeding the dose in which you can normally tolerate without feeling anxious in jittery with all of that said there is a range of tolerance for affix that is based on two things one is a are existing disposition that is whether not you are genetics and nervous system and the backdrop of your life how much stress your experiencing tends to make you feel more anxious and alert in jittery before you invest any affine and the other is how called affine adapted you are we often here about tolerance tolerance mean something very specific it is the ability to invest more and more of something with a plateau that is a zoning no increase or an actual reduction in the effectiveness of that thing but here were not really talking about tolerance to affine what we are talking about is being affine adapted a simple way to understand whether not your affine adapted or not is that if you drink affine and it tends to increase your heart rate and make you feel more alert and a bit more anxious the chances are you are not affine adapted provided the amount of affine is within the healthy range for you that is the ranges we talked about a moment ago however you're somebody who drinks affine and you affix feel alert and relaxed chances are you are affine adapted and at various times during to day's episode it'll talk about people are affine adapted and people who are not affine adapted we will talk about the use of coffin every other day kino for you habitual coffin drinkers including myself just the simple mention of that probably sounds o aversive om but there is actually great utility to using affine every other day as opposed to every day but just keep in mind that some peoplewill dink affine and not get much of a lift from it at all other people will drink affine and they will feel extremely anxious even at dosages far lower than that one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight range that i described a moment ago you have to take into a count individual differences that said one to three milligrams of kafir per kilogram a body weight for a given sitting for your morning coffee or your or your morning your cremate tee is a good arrange from which to start and i do encourage you to go on line and look up the various beverages and foods that you might be eating that contain affine for instance some people are surprised to discover that the coffee that they get from some of the more standard popular venders out there the small coffee or the media coffee for instance con contain as much as four hundred to six hundred milligrams of affine and the large coffin that is often solder those commercial vendors can contain as much as one gram one thousand milligrams of coffin now you may be adapted to that such that it does not make you feel anxious but if you wonder why you feel irritable and you get a headache when you do not get that affine or that amount of affine at precisely the time that your used to getting it each day that is because you are consuming quite large quantities of affine on a regular basis i do recommend whether not you drink soda coffee a tea that you figure out the source of that o ass of figure out what vender you purchase it from what kind of coffee and go on line and spend a limit of time because the information is out there to discover what levels of coffin you are actually in rafting now if you happen to be investing more than one to three milligrams per kilogram a bodyweiht of waffle that is not necessarily bad however you do one to be careful about in jesting very high levels of affine over long periods of time in your life because there can be issues that start torose and particular a bias towards higher levels of anxiety and depletion of certain electrolihts because affine is a diabetic can cause sodium another another things to that sort and also just from simply a dependent standpoint it does appear that if you invest high levels of affine that is exceeding the dosages that normally you could get away with him get just as much mental enhancing and physical end hanging benefits that you can cause some disruption to the microvasculature you can bruise yourself towards headaches anxiety attacks and you can become actually quite irritable when you are not getting those higher levels of affine i do encourage you to figure out not just what an appropriate affine dosage would be for you but also how much affine you might already be investing the first tool i to talk about is one that have mentioned before on this podcast several times and it is something that if you have not heard of will be her my useful to you and if you have heard this tools be for ism going to add some additional features to the description of this tool that should make this worth while for you as well and that is to delay your affine in take to ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes after waking up on most days and it'll be very clear as to days in which you might want to invest faffing more closely to when you wake up why would you want to delay your caffeine and take to ninety to a hundred twenty minutes after waking the answer that is very simple many people wake up in the morning they drink affine within ten twenty thirty sometimes within to minutes of waking and they feel more alert naturally the make sense because of the effects of caffeine in blocking the effects of a denying the i talked about earlier end its effects another nurse transmitter systems but then what they find is that in the early afternoon in particular after lunch they experience a dramatic dip in their over all levels of energy the called afternoon crash and in most cases the way they respond to that is to in jest more affine which indeed can increase their levels of mood and alertness however as we will soon talk about there is a problem within jesting affine in the afternoon if it falls within eight or ten or dare i even say twelve hours of going to sleep and that is the affine in jested in the afternoon for most everybody it say for ninety five plus percent of people disrupts the architecture and quality of their night time sleep and i should say that it does not necessarily in pack o their ability to fall asleep and may be even sleep through the night but that the depth and quality of that sleep is destructed by consuming affine in the afternoon a limit later it'll talk about how you can offset some of those negative effects if you absolutely require affine in the afternoon but there is a huge advantage to restricting your affine and take to the early part of your day but not consuming affine within the first ninety two a hundred and twenty minutes after waking in fact many people find that if they delay their affine in take to ninety two a hundred an twenty minutes after waking up that they feel more alert in the morning and they completely avoid that afternoon crash now that said many people including myself do need a short nap or non sleep deep rest or other form of relaxation for ten to thirty minutes in the afternoon that is natural and healthy ism not referring to the need for that when i refer to the called afternoon crash on time on the afternoon crash is a inability to recover energy and focus and a need to consume more affine just to make it through the afternoon by delay affine in take from to ninety two a hundred an minutes after waking there are couple things that are accomplished first of all you offset that afternoon crash and this is an effect that many people experience the very first time they start to lag their canine intake to ninety two a hundred twenty minutes after waking and the reason this work well as the following as i mentioned earlier a denizens ism molecule that builds up the longer that we are awake it is a molecule that is reduced or cleared from our system by sleep when we emerge from sleep regardless of how long we have slept our a denizens levels are lower than they were when we went to sleep the previous night if you slept well enough and long enough those a denizens levels can be very very low but they are never completely zero when you wake up in the morning even if you are one of these people that springs out of bed and is ready to attack the day and here ism certainly not exidescribing myself ism not not one of those people attend to wake fairly slowly but if you are one of those spring up an attack the day or your one of the people who moves more slowly into your day regardless there still some residual a denizens in your system and this is particularly the case if you did not get enough sleep or enough depth of sleep the night before that the correct rations of slow wave sleep in rapid eye movement sleep and for those of you interesting optimizing sleep lie just refer you to are master your sleep episode of the suberin labpocast the perfect our sleep episode the superman labpodcast and we have a tool kip for sleep all of which are available zero cost time stamped et camera at superman labor calm you wake up in the morning and your a denizens levels are low but there not zero and if you did not sleep that well or deeply enough the night before you are going to have more a decisive in your system you might think the logical thing to do is therefor to drink caffeine and to block the adenine that there but what happens if you do that is there is an accumulation a sort of glut of a decisive that hangs around and then in the afternoon when the effects of that caffeine start to wear off you will experience the called afternoon crash as i mentioned earlier there is away to clear out the a decisive that is present when you wake up in the morning and to clear it out essentially completely without just blocking it is receptors and letting it accumulate or hang around and the wat to do that is to deliberately spike your coatis all now many of you have heard of cortical is called stress hormone as a bad thing and indeed chronically elevated cortical is a bad thing it deplete youremiun system it is bad for am cycle social effects it tends to make us feel anxious and on end on but cortical itself is not bad cortical is wonderful cortical enhances the efficiency the man system it makes us alert and focus at stimulates our metabolism it does a huge number of positive things provided that it is released in a carcatiane fashion that is at the appropriate times every twenty four hours and that it tends to pick very close to waking fact one the reasons you wake up in the morning assuming that you ware not woken up by some noise or or sleeping an environment that is too warm et camera is that your cartel level start to rise and shortly after waking your cortical level ills well start to reach their peak and when i refer to a martial pulse that is just biology nerved speak for a rise and peak in martial you want that martial pulse to occur early in the day close to waking and you want that for a couple of reasons first of all if you do not restrict that artist pulse to early in the day it will tend to bleed into the later parts of the day and actually a late shifted martial peak is want of the outmarch signatures of depression low level depression and serious depression and it can start to disturb sleep and certainly can disturb mood metabolism and your immune system to you want that martial peak early in the day how do you insure that that happens well you wake up in the morning and whether not you our a bounce out of bed type or you're more groggy you can a wade slowly into the daytime i am you wake up and you do not ingest caffeine fine and in fact beneficial to hydrate with water and electrolights terrific in fact i would say necessary to get bright light in your eyes ideally from sunlight have talked about this many many times before on the podcast if you wake up before the sun comes out than turn on bright artificial lights but then certainly wants the sun is out and even on cloudy days in fact in especially on clouds get outside for anywhere from five to twenty maybeven thirty minutes do some work outside take your breakfast outside if your breakfast eater get something done outside even of it is just to get outside and get bright light in your eyes why well because it is been shown in studies on humans that getting bright light in your eyes in the first hour after waking or as soon as possible after waking increases the peak of that martial pulse by fifty per cent five zero and that martial pulse yes increases mood yes increases alertness but it does one other very important thing which is that through an indirect pathway it can clear out any residual a decisive that might be present in your system when you wake up in the morning again this is going to be especially important for those of you that are not getting as much sleep or as much quality sleep as you would it is going to be very important for you to get that morning bright light ideally from sunlight get that martial peak going other ways to increase that cuartisall peak would be to do some physical activity if you do not have time to do a full work out well then getting some movement you ten minutes of skipping rope or even five minutes of skipping rope or jumping jacks or walking if that is all you have time for ideally while getting the sunlight in your eyes but that is going to zero out the adenosine present in your system if however you were to wake up and immediately drink caffeine caffeine itself can stimulate the release of martial a little bit more than it would otherwise be present in your system but by blocking those a decisive receptors and because of the indirect effects of caffeine on the cuartisall system you actually are reducing the clearance of a decisive that would otherwise occur i realize that is a mouthful just to be very clear if you wake up an you n jest affine right away you are blocking the a denissine receptors but you are not clearing it out you are also preventing coatis all from having its normal increase in rise such that it can directly clear out a decisive because coatis all can clear out a decisive and that is what you want you want to be at maximum alertness and focus in your morning and throughout your day and by delaying your affine to ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes after waking you set up your system that you get that morning carts all peak daily a pique that is even greater because you are getting your bright light viewing and then when you in jest your affine ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes after waking not only will you be craving it just a little bit but you will be drinking that affine on an already existing backdrop of increased alertness for two reasons one is a decisive is zeroed out and your coatis all peak is higher and now when you in jest affine you can actually in jest levels of affine that a little more reasonable that almost with certainty are going to fall in this one to three milligrams per kilogram dosage and will allow you to feel really alert and will carry that alertness well in to the afternoon hours without the need to drink more affine and thereby will prevent you from drinking affine and destructing your night time sleep and of course by getting better night time sleep you are going to beer out your a decisive even more what ism describing here are essential two tools ism telling you to get morning sunlight and may be some exercising conjunction with that even if its brief exercise but the main tool of delaying affine ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes after waking has immediate effects but it also sets in motion a cascade or domino falls that lead to better sleep and more wakefulness than next night and the next day and on and forth now i realize there are some people who just simply cannot or will not delay their affined ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes after waking for whatever reason first off let me say that if you are somebody who likes to wake up and do very in tens exercise within the first ninety minutes after waking will in that case it would be appropriate to in jest your affine just prior to doing that exercise not a problem not a prom but you should expect that the commination of drinking affine very shortly after waking plus exercising very intensely shortly after waking will increase the intensity of that early afternoon and afternoon fatigue that you feel now for some people that is a great thing that can afford to take an a or do non sleep deep rest step away from work and forth in that case i strongly encourage you to do whatever it is that allows you to get regular exercise because regular exercise is going to be very beneficial bat we did entire episode a call tools get for fitness that describes a couple of different but really one man structure that allows you to get thou appropriate amount of resistance training and cardyvassler training in flexibility training throughout the week i happen to follow that program and it works very well and it does involve some of those work out to come very early in the morning shortly after waking and in those cases i do in jest affine just prior to those within of ten twenty minutes of waking however on other days i personally delay my waffle and take ninety to a hundred twenty minutes and have done that am to great benefit and most people if not all people bit try that have reported the same i should mention that some people will find getting out to that ninety minutes to be excruciatingly difficult because there accustomed to in jesting affine close to waking up in that case may be just push out your waffle and take by about fifteen minutes each day until you hit that ninety to a hundred and twenty minute mark and that will make it much easier might take you a week or to get there but once you get there you will find it to be quite easy to maintain no thing is that if you are somebody who insists on drinking coffin very shortly after waking i would encourage you to drink half of your affine then and then the other half of your affine about an hour later that also will help offset some of the afternoon crash for reasons related to the local magnetics of coffin affine has a quarter life of about twelve hours that means if you were to in jest a cup of coffee at a let us say eight a m endless i a hundred telegram caff just for sake of a simplicity that about twenty five per cent of of that affine action we would not really take twenty five milligrams but about twenty five per cent of the affine action will still be present at eight p m that night which is pretty remarkable there is a long ark of kain facts this is why it can impede sleep if it is if we take affine in the afternoon but again if you are somebody who wakes up and you really need affine right away and you refuse to do this ninety to a hundred n twenty minute delay thing that ism talking about all then in that case i would drink half of your affine upon waking and in a little bit more or or the other half a about an hour later and that will extend the ark of that affine effects such that you do not need it again in the afternoon because you will not experience the afternoon crash because of the way affine works i should mention that if you in jest affine on an empty stomach it will have a more potent stimulant effect that will also tend to increase the level of jitteriness the affine can produce later it'll talk about ways to offset that jitteriness but it'll just tell you one tool now many people out to take a hundred milligrams of heading t h e a an pony therein as a way to offset some of that gitterinutes thing will reduce the jitteriness of affine which is why many energy drink manufacturers and even some coffin manufacturers are now putting thiamine and energy drinks and in ground coffee because no surprise it allow us people to consume more of that beverage and thereby purchase more of that beverage which is what these venders want without feeling overly anxious in jittery the you can take piliform thiamine if you want with your fine i do not tend to do that rather i control the total dosage of my affine i do tend to consume affine on an empty stomach because i you restrict my coffin an take to the early part of the day and i generally eat my first meal somewhere around eleven a m and then i generally my last meal some time around eight p m or those are those are averages i would say plussermin us an hour and that is not because ism religiously following any kind of a time restricted feeding is just tho that is tend to work best with my gradual and my appetite but againtet's a general theme there are days in which i wake up and ism very hungry and i might in jest something am small snack or something or if ism meeting somebody for breakfast sometimes it'll have breakfast sometimes i will not and on and forth the point is that you can get away with drinking less affine to get the stimulant effect if you do it on an empty stomach and if you are somebody who likes exercise on an empty stomach and ism one of those people well then nesting coffin just prior to exercise i can be a fantastic tool we will bit later will talk about some of the physical performance enhancing effects of affine but it'll just briefly jump to a point about that is we relate to morning exercise if you are somebody who regularly in jests affine and we can define regularly by if you invested affine every day for the last two weeks you are regular consumer of affine or as if you are somebody who only in jest affine somewhere between two and four times per week well then you are not a regular consumer of affine you are an intermittent user of kafir when your somebody is a regular user of affine the performance enhancing effects of affine are going to be most dramatic if you take two or three days off from drinking affine which to my mind as a i don't call myself a kaffinatic but a regular coffin user it's a horrible notion to me and is aversive notion because i do the effects of kafir much but if you really want to see the maximum performance an hanging effects of affine you will do either one of two things you will either abstain from affine for a few days or three days prior to investing affine or you will use affine on an empty stomach it is very clear that affine on an empty stomach in chances both the mental and physical end hanging effects of affine and of course all of that has to be stated on the back drop of consideration that if you h your you are very very hungry it can make it hard to concentrate and some on and forthsoi'm not encouraging people to starve themselves by any means i certainly do not do that but if you want to maximize the performance en hanging effects of affine you will consume it on an empty stomach and then as of final point to that affine is a dramatic it cause us to lose fluid and along with that fluid to excrete sodium because the effects of affine on various processes within the kidney one thing that works very well to maintain mood and alertness longer given a certain amount of coffin and take and to avoid the jitteriness and and what can sometimes feel a crash or low bludsuger feeling or even blurry vision its to make sure that you consume at least an equal volume of water with your k affine and ideally that water wold contain may be a small pinch of salt or some sort of electrolyte drink out or powder rather for me i use element full disclosure they are a vodkas to chili and sponsor but you do not need to do that you could simply just have a glass of water alongside your your coffee or express over your your borate and just put a small pinch of sea salt in that or even just plain table salt and that will help offset some of the jitteriness of affine lot of people think that when they just affine they get the jitteriness and crash because their blood sugar is low and while that can be the case oftentimes it is simply because of the excretion of sodium that is occurred when they have invested affine i incurve you to hydrate well and to hydrate with something that contains a little bit of sodium ovary not much that increases hypotension or something of that sort of a small about of sodium or an lecture drink element and their other electrolyte drinks out there that can accomplish the same of course just a couple of quick notes about theine because there are a growing number of products out there that contain theine and there certainly a growing number of people out there who are using theine for the effect that a describe before which is to offset some of the wateriness associate with affine containing beverages or foods and of course i should mention that have talked about the effects of then on sleep at that sleep tool kit that you can find as a free download you do not even have to sign up for anything you just download it from humeri lab dot calm go to the men you go to newsletter you see the tools kip for sleep you will see that the called sleep stack that ai use and recommend includes magnesium threat something called apiganine and theine although that sleep stack is design to be taken thirty to sixty minutes prior to sleep and i make the point there andi'll make it again here that in jesting theine prior to sleep is not a good idea if you are somebody who tends to have very vivid dreams night terrors or night walk but a sleep walking scusemi et camera in that case eliminate theine from from the sleep stack however a number of people are using theine and products are using theine to offset jitteriness from affine containing products during the daytime daytime consumption that is a couple of notes about theine theine is something that is present in green tea and it is now been a creates a supplement it is what is called a non proline monoacid who while there monoacid and prolines are of corsominoacids in non phones and theine is one such non protinaminoacid theine tends to stimulate that called glutamate and glutamine pathways chalk very similar to glutamate ingludomine and it has a lot of effects on a lot of different aspects of the nervous system but the general effect of theine is to compete for the receptors for certain narrow transmitters and the nor transmitters on referring to are all excusatory narrow transverse things glutamate and they govern a tremendous amount of our daily thinking in action and feeling et camera because their present at many connections between euros in the brain theine compete for the receptors for glutamate an and tends to reduce are over all levels of alertness really when people take theine along with affine what they are doing is there really a taking a slight i don't want to call it decrescent to the point where it misleedspeople and makes people think that it will make you depressed the word is comet misled but tends to reduce or blunt some of the more excititori pro alertness actions of anurans in the brain when you take along sycamine tense conic even things out of it i should mention that the dosages of theine that are effective for offsetting the jitteriness of affine is two hundred to four hundred milligrams and the studies that i was able to find showed that essentially up to nine hundred milligrams per day can be safe but that is a very high dosage of thiamine in fact much that it might increase sleepiness to the point where it wouldn't feel good there are also some plosive effects of daytime consumption of theine that are independent of reducing the jitteriness of affine for instance there's a study demonstrating that seventeen days of investing theine at these two hundred o for hundred milligram dosage of at one to three times per day can reduce depression and anxiety there a also some good date out there showing that theine can have positive effects on endothelia sells o blood vessels capillaries and on and increase some of the function of blood vessels allowing them to pass more blood through them give them a obit more elasticity if you will theine has certain pro sleep effects of its taken prior to sleep it can enhance the quality depth an duration of sleep again if you are a sleep walker or somebody who has extremely vivid dreams from which you wake up in the mill the night probably best to leave out theine or may be reduced the dosage down to a hundred milligrams an if that still too much than eliminate it completely but theine can be terrific for enhancing quality depth an duration of sleep it can also reduce the fieriness associate with affine containing beverages and foods and it has certain anti depressant and pro and aphelia affects that is it can offset depression it can offset anxiety although those are miner effects of a subtle effects and it has been shown to improve and dothelial sell that is vessel and gallery function and structure in ways that can be beneficial for both brain and body not one final point about theine that is worth paying attention to is that the synectics of theine are such that you do not need to take theine every time you invest a kaffanated beverage when we invest affine the peace effects of affine occur about thirty minutes after we drink it and there i am assuming one takes it all at once and this is a drypoint that come back too later might rather than sipping your coffees slowly over a couple of hours or an hour if you drink all two hundred or three hundred milligrams of affine in your coffee six hundred milligrams of your coffee if you regretting one those commercial coffees and you take thing along with it thing will block some of the jitteriness and anxiety inducing effects of affine that can occur for much longer than the effects that affine last the peakanthenine occurs about an hour after in egestion i suppose if you want to get really fancy and really dial in the connection you could ingest theine about half hour before youngesture affine but i think that is getting a little bit a excessive in terms of controlling your micro environment if you will i think it would be perfectly fine to take a hundred to two hundred telegram capsule of theine a long with your taffy or tea at forth and just realize that if you drink more affine or you extend your affine in take over several hours that you do not necessarily have to take theine repeated times throughout the day let us talk for a moment about when to avoid affine and in the same stroke let us also talk about some of the myths around affine prince its one of the major myths around affine is that it can increase onto paresis turns out that while there is a relationship of course between calcium and onto paresis that is reductions and bone density and it is the case that affine can extract calcium from certain tissues the large scale studies that are out there essentially prove that if people are in wasting enough calcium through their diet which most everybody is although certainly there r some people that need a supplement calcium or make it a point to consume more calcium containing foods but assuming that you are getting adequate levels of calcium there is no direct relationship between affine take an osteoporosis at least not that ism aware of i know this was debated for a number of years in the literature but the literature seems to have arrived at a general consensus now that affine itself is not going to create or exacerbate osteoporosis provided peopleare getting enough calcium through their diet that is through foods through supplementation or both some of the other myths around affine are that for instance affine will reduce testosterone levels or will reduce astern levels other myths out there are in exact opposite to that that affine will increase testosterone levels in particular freetestostron levels there been some large scale studies addressing the hormonofacts of affine they are little bit difficult to do i should just mention that mafia and the reason they are difficult to does because ninety percent of adults are consuming affine and therefore you can imagine it is very hard to find a control group to compare the affine consumers to in particular control group that is well controlled for other things life style diet exercise et camera however when one controls as well as one can for all the various factors that could impact hormones what one discovers is that affine in take at least of the dosages we talked about earlier one of three telegrams for kelegramof bodyweight or even up to double that that there are no consistent increases or reductions in testostronor estrogen in men or women that can be directly attributed to the affine intake and i say directly attributed because in these association studies one always has to wonder for instance if because people are ingesting more affine they have more energy and therefore exercising more and exercises known to have effects on testosterone estrogen another hormones whether or not the effects of affine on those hormones indirect and on and forth this all disunderscores the challenges of doing studies on humans in the wild in their natural habitat of living as opposed to an acute study is its call the bring someone into the laboratory and studying them just for those hours or moments with all that said there does appear to be a relationship between coffin in take and all sex hormone and binding globular which is a proline present in the body both men and women that binds to the sex storied hormones teststron and estrogen and prevents them from being in their free or active form it has been shown that ingestion of affine even in the sorts dosage ranges that are considered safe in that we have been discussing can increase sex hormone binding globular such that it can slightly refuse over all levels of free testosterone and free estradiol in women now those effects are relatively miner but they do exist if any of your interested in reading further into the effects of affine on hormones just refer you to a couple of studies we will link to this in the shoot avion the cuddle of the study is consumption of affine beverages and serum concentrations of sex stupid hormones in u s men and within this study there is a reference to a equally sized in powered study done on women both of which converged on the same conclusion by examining more than a thousands on this case fourteen hundred ten men or more then a thousand women that there are increases in sex hormone binding globular associate with increased intake of coffee in particular but the were able to narrow that down specifically to ingestion of coffin it is not coffee person that is causing the increase in sex hormone binding globular its actually affine itself now again the increases in sex hormone dining globular were not significant that at least to my mind they seem a concern although i think that it is worth noting that if you are going to consume affine that you probably want to consume affine in a way that is dosages and with the sort of timing that will allow you to get away with investing affine but not to excess to derive the benefits of coffin without for instance driving up sex hormone bininglobuland too far now why would that be a good idea why would you want to make sure that you have enough free testosterone and free estrogen we all some of that is related to the acute effects of those hormones an terms of well being and a libido and strength and mood et camera but some of his also relates to the longer term effects of destroyed hormones many people do not realize this but story harmony operate on the receptors at the surface of cells to have immediate effects but they also can enter cells and actually go into the nucleus of cells where the dean of tho cells are contained and control gene expression in those cells the sexstoried hormones testosterone and estrogen are controlling a lot of distecella or functions over long periods of time blunting their action over long periods of time is probably not a great idea but again at the dosages of affine the were talking about to day one of three milligrams for kilegramof bodyweight a unlikely that the increases in sex hormone dining globular that one experiences from that are going to be detrimental and certainly the plosive effects of affine that one experiences in terms of mental performance and physical performance and theffact that it increases energy to do the sorts of things exercise that we know can profoundly improve hormone profiles twofold or threefold improvement in hormone profiles in that case it seems that in jesting affine is over all a good thing provided its not in excess that also makes this o the appropriate time to mention one of the more impressive effective affine which is on overall levels of mood and mental health there are several studies on this but the one that am particularly fond of was publish in twenty nineteen in psychiatry research and the title of the paper is inverse association between affine and taken depressive symptoms in us adults and these are data from the national health and nutrition examination survey and the basic take away is that while of course there are a ton of different factors that are going to relate to whether not people are depressed or not life circumstances genetics and on that and here ism quoting from the study affine psychostimulant properties touch as means the ably o make us feel more alert and positive appear to protect against depressive symptoms and of course they acknowledge that additional studies are needed but this is just one of several studies pointing the fact that people who regularly in gest affine and the appropriate dosages do seem to enjoy and anti depressive effect over all i would not want any one to consider affine a treatment for severe depression rat least not alone or treatment for severe depression but provided the anxiety in during effects of affine can be kept in check through us of theine or making sure that the dosage and the timing of affine ingestion is correct then affine overall seems to be good for our mood and prevent depression or at least keep depression at bay when depression might otherwise surface or be more severe and of course there are the dots surrounding affine intake as it relates to sleep and to put i very simply sleep that is getting enough qualities sleep each night is the foundation it is the bed rock of mental health physical health n performance sleep and the power of sleep far exceeds any neurotic you could ever take any prescription drug you could ever take any health promoting tool for immune system your metabolism your mental function your physical function you could ever take sleep is the bed rock i know a lot of people experience challenge with sleep nobody is perfect about sleep that is important to keep in mind i think a good goal is to get enough quality sleep of sufficient duration eighty percent of the nights of your life and then as much as possible to make sure that the remaining twenty per cent of nights you are not getting enough sleep for good reasons i suppose i hard reason good reasons would include raising children that is important after all every species a desires to make more of itself and to a preserve and extend the well being it is young child rearing is a perfectly legitimate reason to get a lack of sleep but you really want a strive to get quality sleep most nights of your life which means that even if you are somebody who can quit in quote drink in a espresso and then fall right a sleep that you avoid affine in take in the twelve hours prior to sleep i realize not everyone will be able to do that in fact i sometimes violate that i tend to go to sleep around ten p m every night sometimes eleven occasionally twelve midnight but usually around ten p m every night i confess that my last ingestion of coffin is not always ten a my prior to that sometimes i will have coffin up until eleven a m or maybe noon and very very rarely it'll have an afternoon coffee or espresso or non carry containing soda or tea or something that is of that sort but i really try to restrict my affine in take to the early part of my day that is before noon given that i go to sleep around ten p m each night and i strongly encourage every one out there to try and limit their afternoon coffin in take this is something that doctor mat walker who is an expert sleep research er out of universe calfornia burly psychology in nursing department there author of the incredible book why we sleep he is been on this podcast many other podcast talking about the importance of sleep you will remind us and all remind you now that the quarter life of affine is twelve hours i mention this earlier but ism going to repeat it again and that means that if you invest affine at noon twenty five per cent of it is effects more or less causing broad stroke here to talk about quarter life twenty five per cent of that is still going to be by active at midnight that night which will disrupt the early phase of your night the amount of slow wave sleep which then in turn will disrupt the amount of rapid i movement sleep which will disrupt you are emotional processing during the following day and on and forth yet none of this is to say that you have the occasional cup of off in the afternoon that is going to completely demolish your sleep wake cycle forever but i really encourage people to avoid drinking affine in the twelve hours prior to sleep and if you cannot do that within the ten hours prior to sleep and if you cannot do that within the eight hours prior to sleep to really try and limit your fine and take in the eight to twelve hours prior to going to sleep at night and of course slow wave sleep each a deep sleep is the sleep that is associated with somewhat mundane dreams which makes it sound it might not be that important but it is also toe sleep that is associated with grothomone release which is important for proline synthesis repair of all bodily tissues and metabolism and slow wave sleep is also critically attached to your immune systems ability to clear out bacteria viruses that might otherwise infect our tissues now i to talk about affine and its positive effects on performance when used correctly and here we are referring to both mental performance and physical performance the exploration of affine as a pro performance tool has beenexplored since the nineteen thirties at least that some of the earliest documented literature on this although i have to imagine given that people have been using affine for much longer than that that long ago somebody realize that by nesting a certain plant that they felt much more alertness than were able to hunt and gather or do any number of different things better and as a consequence decide to consume more of that plant now these days we can some a lot of affine in the form of coffee and tea mainly and some people consuming in the form of affine tablets or energy drinks et camera across the word one finds that affine intake at a level of one to three milligrams for kilogram of bodyweight improves reaction time that is it reduces the amount of time to take a physical action or to answer a question correctly with a verbal response it can also improve coordination it can also improve memory although i do want to mention that were as most studies of the effects of affine on improving mental and physical performance involve taking affine at one to three milligrams for kilogram of bodyweight before the mental task or physical task there is also a pro performance of fact of affine on memory if one takes affine after learning certain material ora i should say being exposed to certain material will come back to that in a few minute if one examines reaction time mood alertness focus and memory were the ability to call up information for memory or physical dexterity power output insurance and over all feelings of well being during exercise and exertion affine has been shown in numerous studies in both men and women to improve all of those metrics signify faintly this is all just to say that affine is an incredible performance enhancing tool now what is not obvious from the statement that affine is a performance enhancing tool across the board and an in men and women and in different contacts is that the way in which affine is taken is very important because ninety per cent or more of adults consume affine finding controls for studies of affine is really challenging that is finding people who do not in jest affine regularly is a very challenging task for the researcher and as a consequence many of the studies of affine on human beings involve depriving regular affine users of fine and then examining the effects of affine given after a period of say five to fifteen days of abstinence in a person that is essentially experiencing mild withdraw symptoms because they have not had the affine that they were used to getting this is an important point and it is a point that likely exacerbates the observed pro performance of facts of affine now all of that is not necessarily a problem provided you keep it in mind and it actually points to a way in which even if you're regular affine user you can extract more of the benefits of affine the simplest way to do this for instance is to look back to what we talked about earlier in terms of the need to have most of your cortical increase restricted to the hour or hours just after waking in terms of mood and alertness in performance one of the ways to increase the peak of that cart is all early in the day is to consume affine shortly after that pike occurs and this was really nicely demonstrated in a study entitled affine stimulation of cortical secretion across the waking hours in relation to affine in take levels we will provide a link to this study it is a somewhat complicated study because they looked at a bunch of different times of day for affine in take and i should mention this study they used was three hundred milligrams per day or six hundred milligrams per days that is quite high although for people of sufficient body weight and who are accustomed to taking kaffineites certainly not going to be in excess of what a lot of people out there are taking but basic my what they observed was the following coatis all responses to affine are reduced but not eliminated in people who consume affine on a daily basis what this means is that if you wake up and as i recommended earlier you avoid drinking affine for the first ninety to a hundred twenty minutes after waking but you do get some sunlight or other bright light in your eyes in that time maybe even get some exercise in that time which would been better and then you in jest affine you will get a further increase in cortical which provided it is restricted to the early part of the day is a good thing over all for mood in alertness this is a simple performance enhancing tool which is to stay affine on the tail of that early artist all pique i should also mention however that in the study they had people do a five day affine abstinence prior to being tasted with three hundred milligrams or six hundred milligrams of coffin the simple tool to extract from this and other studies it is that if you want to experience the maximum alertness promoting effects of affine when you pasta early in the day you would abstain from affine for five days and then in jess coffin ninety to a hundred twenty minutes after waking i was still hope that you were doing all the other things that i describe morning sunlight exercise at camera correctly but regardless it is very clear that a five day abstinence from coffin however painful that might be will increase the performance en hanging effects of affine when you take affine on that sixth day now ism sure many of you out there are saying why would i ever want to abstain from affine for five days in order to just get this sixth day performance in hanging effect wether couple reasons for doing that perhaps a your planning to travel to a new timezone and you want to use affine as a stimulant to stay up during the day in the new timezone it is a somewhat unusual says others of you might be interested in the pro physical performance effects of affine will talk more about these in it in lug bit but you want to get the maximum strength increase or the maximum endurance increase from in jane in this case three hundred o six hundred milligrams of affine well that case abstaining from coffin for five days well greatly exacerbate the pro performance effects of coffin when you take it on that sixth day although admittedly those five days are likely to be pretty painful if your regular coffin user another variation on this however might be to have the amount of affine that you invest on a daily basis and then go back to your regular level of affine and take on that day in which you need the affine to really boost your mood energy and performance another reason why you might want to abstain from affine or reduce your affine and take for a period of time and then go back your regular an and take is simply to identify how much of an effect affine is really having on your overall level of daily functioning and mood this was something that was actually covered in beautiful detail in a book by michael pain all about affine it is available and audible i really enjoyed that book it describes his experience with the decision to completely abstain from affine for a period of months although i confess that after hearing that book what it basely made me want to do his never qudurinking affine because it sounded as if at least in interpretation was that even after several weeks or months of abstaining from affine that he still fantasized to the effects of affine but he did mention that when returning to investing affine after a period of long abstinence that it had almost ay a it's not call it a psychedelic property but it had such obvious effects on mood and alertness and feelings a well being that it really highlighted for him the extent to which affine normally was allowing him to just function what he thought was normally another words many of us do not even really know what or normal banal level of cognitive and physical functioning is because we are investing affine on c such a regular basis i confess that that as much as i enjoyed that book and as intriguing as his description of affine abstinence and then the return to affine was i do not intend t ever find out personally now a very good reason why you might want to abstain from affine for a deliberate period of time and then return to affine and take it's for it is physical performance enhancing a facts and here we can look to a really interesting study title of which is time course of tolerance to the performance of facts of affine and what i about the study is that while yes it does say that abstaining from affine and then returning to affine and take can enhance physical performance in a very sphysific way it also says that if you take affine regularly you can still see the physical performance enhancing effects of affine although they are not quite as robust as they would be had you abstain from coffin the desire of the study is pretty straightforward they had people either invest three telegrams for kilogram of affine for twenty consecutive days many people are already doing that i realized but they had people do that or insure that they were doing that or others invested a placebo for twenty days they abstain from affine without realizing it then after that twenty days of either investing affine or a placebo there pique performance was measured in terms of erotic output but prier to that measurement they had fine to are it is twenty days of affine and then a twenty first day of affine and then thefphysical task on that twenty first day or it is twenty days of abstinence from affine and then on day twenty one you get affine and you get the same physical task and what they discovered was that the injection of affine increased pile performance in this erotic output dramatically if people had abstain from affine but for people that had consume affine all the way through up until that day it is still was effective to invest affine on day twenty one but not as effective as it would have been had they abstain and in fact the magnitude of the what they call ergroganic effect which is the pro performance enhancing effect of affine was his on the first day then in subsequent days when they allowed people to continue fine and take the take way from the study is really straightforward if you want to get the maximum physical performance enhancing effects of affine you abstain from affine for twenty days then on day twenty one when you are going to do the physical thing the task you ones affine about thirty fence to an hour before you do that physical challenge o twenty days of abstinence is going be rough for a lot of people i certainly do not want to sign up for this study in which case you might want to do five days of abstinence as we talked about before and then on day six is the day that you in jest affine and do the physical task there are even some study showing that you can abstain from affine for just two days for just forty eight hours and in particular if you are a regular user of affine this allows you to on day three in jess affine at the seats appropriate for you and do the physical or i should mention mental performance task and perform significantly better than those that have been taking affine throughout the entire period leading up to the challenge you do not necessarily need to abstain for twenty days in order to get the pro performance effects of affine on day twenty one you can do five days of abstinence prior or even two days of abstinence prior or if that is intolerable to you as it is in my mind to me to just reduce your affine and take slightly or even perhaps had it if you can tolerate that in the week or two weeks or maybe en three weeks preceding some physical or mental challenge again this sort of implies that your going up against a marathon or you are going up against a series of long tests may be standardized tests in one day there i just really want to point out that there is an abundant literature showing that people perform best on mental tests if they are in the state that they were when they studied for that material a in college high new a number people who took this to the extreme thinking that if they were to study under the effects of alcohol that they would be best off am consuming call prior to taking exams and the turns out to not be the case here we are talking in particular about psycho stimulant of facts of affine and other compound a do not think that you can a drinker be under a the influence of t h c and then take when you study and then take an exam under the same influence in do just as well as you would had you not invest anything please do not let that be the take away however do let it be the take away that caffeine's effects are made more potent by a brief to not brief period of abstinence prior to taking a dosage of affine and then the final point to make is that if you are somebody who is not accustomed to drinking affine meaning you are hypertensive to affine or you do not regularly in jest affine please do not in jess affine on the day of any important mental or physical challenge or performance because what you will find is that because you are not affine adapted you will experience changes in your thermal regulation in your levels of anxiety in jitteriness and your levels of focus that could be very destroy mental to mental or physical performance you do not want throw yourself in the deep end am by investing affine if you are not use to it and i show mention that for people it are not accustomed to investing affine or are very sensitive to affine even twenty five to fifty milligrams of affine in the amount that is found in for instance a piece of certain types of chocolate can actually cause anxiety be careful there here ism referring only to people that are custom with affine and take what i recommend is to explorer the erogenic affects of affine during your training and then to make a decision about what you can reasonably in reliably doing terms of abstinence and then pulse with affine on the day of the challenge i get a lot of questions as to whether or not affine has different effects on the nervous system and on performance in particular depending on phases of the menstrual cycle i explored that in my research for this episode and i found two studies both of which we will reference in the showncaptions the first one is entitled faffing consumption and menstrual function it is actually the relationship between affine menstrual function we will do in entire episode about the menstrual cycle menstrual function but the other one as it relates to performance was publishing twenty twenty in the european vernal nutrition which is erogenic effects of affine on peikorobic cycling power during the menstrual cycle and the basic take away of the study frankly a very nice study showed that quote waffle increase pekorobic cycling power in the early vehicular preobulatory enmidludial phases of the menstrual cycle thus the in egestion and again here they use three telegrams of coffin for kilogram of body mass might be considered in erogenic ad for women who are in the menstrual cycle during all three phases of their cycle keep that mind women for those of view there regular users of affine or ear using affine to enhance physical performance there does not seem to be any menstrual cycle phase dependent effects of affine on performance that is affine seems to always increase physical performance regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle you might happen to be it i likes it touch on a little bit more of the use of affine for enhancing mental performance yes it is the case that in jesting one of three telegrams of fine per kilogram of bodyweight in the thirty minutes or prior to during a memory task or on sitting down to doing some studying or learning of any kind physical or mental performance of any kind is beneficial for all the reasons retachobut be for relate to dopamine an the steal calling et camera but it turns out that it is also the case that spiking ones a adrenaline and other call katacolamines this to be dopamine nor pin veteran an epinefran after about of learning can greatly enhance memory for the information that one was trying to learn that is right spiking adrenaline after learning can greatly increase memory for the material you are trying to learn in fact this is a practice that dates back centuries and was written about in a beautiful annual review of hero science on the biology of memory games mama talks about medieval practices of children being taught information and the being throw literally into cold water to stimulate the release of a adrenaline and that increase in a in a adrenalin while the mechanism was not completely understood it was understood that that sort of shock to the system from the cold water led to better memory and retention of the information that these children had been exposed to an it turns out the exacting thing is true for adults in the laboratory or kids in e laboratory and here ism not suggesting throwing any one into cold water if you want to get into cold water there is a reason we call it deliberate cold exposure on the podcast is that it should be deliberate and control by you not by somebody else if it is control by somebody else that may be a in military a screening or something but here we are talking about deliberately increasing your levels of a adrenaline and other katacolamines dopamine or up in efferent et camera you can do that certainly by deliberate cold exposure with a cold shower or getting in up to your neck in cold water of any kind but the other way to do that is to spike adrenaline by investing one to three milligrams for kilogram of affine after sitting down to try and learn some material i confess that more often than not i use coffin the same way that most people use it which is toque when a sit down eminent research information for a podcast or assemble om some information for a paper or grant and i want to focus i will drink a cup of coffee at the beginning of that i may be even throughout that or couple of geurbamate at the beginning or throughout that or it'll sip on one or both throughout trying to learn and that works quite well in terms of maintaining focus an alertness and retention of information but it is indeed the case that is the research supports the fact and have experienced the fact that if i abstain from affine while i am trying to learn something but then i drink affine immediately after somewhat surprisingly to me but certainly in a way that is consistent with the research literature memory for the information that i was focused on prior to ingesting that affine is much greater and here ism talking about as a personal anecdote but this is affix what the date point you both in animals and in humans ani you think about it makes perfect sense because the way that the memory systems of the brain a organized is that we go through life experiencing things we encounter surprises both good and bad we go through the motions of things both typical mundane exciting and and novel and not novel and then every once in a while something will happen that will spike our katacolamines dopamine typically of it is a positive surprise a adrenaline which can be associate with both positive surprise or plosive events and negative events or surprises and without fail increases in the catacolamines tend to lock in memories for things that proceeded the increase in those catacolamines again the katacolamines being dopamine pan efferent in nor up an difference sometimes all three in combinations sometimes just two of those sometimes just one of those depending on the experience it makes perfect sense that using affine at the end of a learning bout would enhance our memory for the information that we are trying to learn if you decide that you want to trying a extract this performance enhancing effect of affine what i recommend would be t o trying of stain from affine for a day or two prior but if you cannot to just continue with your normal affine in take but then when you sit down to study or learn something to not invest any affine as you do that but then afterward to invest affine now in theory could probably further enhance the memory and coding effects of a adrenaline and the other cataolamines by drinking affine and then taking a cold shower or doing deliberate cold exposure if you really wanted to or had the ability to or doing some sort of intense form of exercise and will talk in a moment about how affine exercise the adrenalin system interact but as a brief but relevant a side brief bouts of intense exercise ranging from ten to fifty minutes or have been shown to improve memory for information that one was trying to learn prior to the intense exercise this is work from doctor penny sizuki slap at and why you as well as other laboratories some of the work that is being done it stammered in the mind body laboratories and our laboratory points in the direction of these kinds of effects as well they all come back to the same general negro chemical there which is that when we experience an increase in these katacolamines that included adrenalin opening an norpaneffron the memory systems of the brain flip on in a way that try to capture the information and the perceptions in the experiences that we were exposed you just prior to the increase in catacolamines and affine but also exercise and also cold water and of course any of those alone or in commination all increase the levels of katacolamines it makes perfect logical mechanistic sense as to why this would work in infant it does work if you want to remember specific information you might consider using affine as you move through an absorb and are exposed to that information but you might also consider using affine after being exposed that information because studies and animals an humans show that that is a potent way to increase memory for what you were just exposed to i shall mention that what i just described also push his back on something that i know a number of people perhaps have heard about and may be even used which is this notion of the nappachino i remember hearing about this a few years actives a for trend if you will the trend involved drinking a cup of coffee or double espresso and then going down for a nap typically in the afternoon and then waking up in the idea was that the affine would hit your system right at the time that you wake from the nap and that you would be better able to focus an exercise there are couple things about that practise that i do not first of all a it implies in most cases that your napping and investing affine in the afternoon which i realize for many students and for people that are comfortable staying up until the we hours of the night and then waking up late the next day might be compatible with their gradual but again because of the sleep diminishing effects of affine we talked by earlier not crazy about the idea of people investing affine in the late afternoon in order to a perform better in the late afternoon far better would be to restrict coffin and take to the early part of the day as we talked about earlier the other reason is that the data on things non sleep deep rest and naps in the afternoon and again the rule here's that you do not haft nap but if you want nap it is been shown that naps of ninety minutes or to last or non sleep deep rest protocols andyou can find those for instances one with me speaking you just put enemy a supermen in to you too you can hear that complete let roost their other enemy a scripts out there now of course if you prefer those that those can all lead to increases in one of the katacolomines at least which is dopamine that is been shown in really nice nor transmitter labeling study not from my laboratory but from another laboratory but also can improve mood focus and alertness on its own without the ne to in jest affine prior to going into those states and in fact in jesting affine prior to a nap rejecting affine prior to enestiar is most certainly going to reduce the effectiveness of that nap and enestyar in restoring natural levels of alertness and focus that would lead to the performance in hanging effect ism not such a fan of the called napachino although if any of you out there have derived great benefit from it a defiling let me know your protocol man what you have experienced put it in the a comment section if you would i depreciate that there is another very important and potent use of affine for enhancing performance and this relates not just to the dopamine and epinefferin and the arousal inducing effects of affine and it does even just relate to the effect of affine on enhancing frontlet function it does include all that but it also includes those reenforcing effects of fine that we talked about at the beginning of the episode and the best way to illustrate these performance enhancing effects of affine that stem directly from its association with reinforcement is to highlight a study and the title of the study is blood dopamine level enhanced by affine in men after treadmill running and as the title sjestuice was carried out in men but there is no reason to think that the same results would not also be present in women there are some sects dependent effects of affine all touch just briefly at the end but those are largely present and kids that is adolescence and tines as opposed to adults this study is really interesting what they had people do was run on a treadmill and either in jest affine again three telegrams perkilegram of body weight or to not in jest affine and then they looked at levels of dopamine and other narrow transmitters and hormone such as prolactin and quartisal the basic take away is as the title suggests that exercise well on its own can increase cuartisall in healthy ways p provided it is not too intense and too long little note here if you have trouble recovering from exercise or you want to continue to derive the benefits from exercise general best not to do high intensity exercise for longer than seventy five minutes or ninety minutes lee being the outer threshold ire realize that there are some genetic freaks out there are people that are chemically assisted that can recover from very intense long bouts of exercise but most people do not do well rough long bouts of intense exercise on a regular basis and limiting their intense exercise to sixty minutes or less that does not include the warm up is going to be beneficial see the episode on a to kit for fitness if you details on that exercises known to increase levels of dopamine court is all and other catacolamins and gaur transmitters very potently and things testosterone and estrogen ways that we know our beneficial to us and of course have all these positive effects on the muscoskelital system and cardiovascular facts but unbenotes to most people investing three telegrams for kilogram of affine prior to exercise further increases the dopamine release associated with exercise specifically and this has too important effects first of all that increase in dopamine is great because it provides a long lasting increase in focus alertness and motive action notes during the exercise but also after the exercise and second it that is affine and dopamine in commination act as a reinforcer to make the experience of exercise and the period meet after exercise more pleasant and infant reinforcing in other words one way to enjoy exercise more and to enjoy the activities that follow exercise more and to experience a genuine increase in dopamine that is beneficial for mood an alertness is to invest affine prior to exercise now this is important because a number of people out there are exercising love exercise love eating grate love doing all the things that are beneficial for their health but a number of people out their really do not to exercise and that serves as a serious block for there willingness and their consistency to exercise in jesting affine gives us energy to exercise it increases the release of petrochemicals and hormones that are good for us during exercise but as of highlighting here it also increases the reinforcement pathways associated with exercise that is it creates a positive feeling about the general theme of engaging an exercise and it creates a general positive experience of the things that follow exercise i think this if nothing else is a a call for or support for the idea that investing affine as a performance enhancing to makes perfect sense but for those out there that do not en do exercise in particular certain forms of exercise in jesting affine can change your relationship to that exercise in motherworts make it more positive much in the same way that in jesting affine alongside a certain taste that would otherwise be neutral may be even negative can actually make the taste of that particular drink for food positive again this brings us back to the reenforcing properties of affine that are subconscious it is not just about the enhanced performance in the test or the infants performance on the treadmill or with the weights in the him it is enhanced feelings of mood and well being that a genuine because of the effect of affine on certainaro transmitter and hormone systems but it also is creating an overall mill e of reenforcing all of the things that led in to occurring and occur after exercise i do one to point out something that is very important as it relates to combining things affine and exercise in order to increase dopamine this is something that came up in the episode that i did on dopamine motivation and drive which turns out to be one of our most popular episodes again you confined that at supermen lap do cam install formats with timestams et camera this also came up in the episode on eighty high t because of the relationship between eighty eights and dopamine and that is this notion of dopamine stacking in the episode on dopamine motivation an drive i pointed out that while there are a near infinite number of things that can increase dopamine release most notably positive surprise a or positive anticipation or experiencing a win am certainly the compounds both drugs of abuse a food sex a and certain supplements that can increased dopamine to varying levels and to varying degrees both healthy and unhealthy that is all contained in that episode on dopamine motivation ta drive but what i pointed out is that if you are somebody who tends to experience difficulty with motivation that call dopamine stacking as i called it might be something the you want to avoid what is dopamine stack in dopamine stacking would be combining a highly caffeinated energy drink that also includes the monoacid tyrosine which is a precise a to dopamine plus loud music plus getting yourself really ramped up than an intense work out all of that can be great if you do it every once in a while but what you will quickly find is that the extent to which your dopamine peaks also dictates the extent to which your dopamine will drop after that peasant when i say drop i mean drop below base line a lot of people find that they stack a lot of things to pique their dopamine that then they experience a low and it does take some time for them to return to baseline and i highly recommend not engaging in activities or consuming compounds that are in attempt to accelerate that return to baseline because all it will do is drive that baseline lower and lower this requires being able to tolerate a drop in dreamy baseline for heard of time et camera now the resent bringing this up now in the context of this affine episode as i just described to study in which using faffing prior to exercise increases dopamine after exercise and you might be saying as pushieveyou heard that earlier episode weight is not that dopamine stacking are not you encouraging me to stack my dopamine well in some sense yes but keep in mind ism not suggesting that you do this every time you exercise just as in that earlier episode i emphasis the fact that while stacking multiple stimulus right affine or energy drinks and music and et camera for exercise or for mental work or for any experience for that matter is locate to do every once in a while for most people you do not want to get in the habit of doing consistently every time you exercise or every time you go out for instance you really want to be cautious that is you want a protect your both baseline levels of dopamine and your peak levels of dopamine that said for people that want to experience and increase in mood alertness and performance or who want to condition themselves because that is really what it is it is conditioning yourself by the reinforcing effects of dopamine to increase your liking or maybe even your loving of exercise occasionally using affine or frequently using affine prier to exercise is fine but be very careful and by being very careful what i mean as pay attention to how you feel in the hours and days after that dopamine increase wears off for instance if you in jest affine and then exercise very intensely and your feeling great afterwards but then eight hours later or the next day your feeling a li bit low i suggest you do not go back and do the exacting thing right away i would give you yourself alibi of time to let that base line of dopamine return to normal again stacking different things chemical and behavioral in order to increase dopamine can be done in a safe way that is beneficial to you depending on your goals but be careful about not stacking too many stimuli for dopamine too often that is the see early in the episode i mention one possible affine consuming skaduel that works very well that does not fortunately subject you to long twenty day bots or five day or even two day bolts of abstinence and that is the every other day shaduf of affine if you look at the half life of affine and you look at its effects on the dopamine system and its performance in hanging effects and how a period of abstinence cabin fact increase the performance in hanging effects of coffin but also taking consideration the affine can be habit forming and we can develop a sort of tolerance to affine well then what emerges from all of that is that being a person who consumes affine every other day can actually help you maximize most of the plosive effects of affine without subjecting you to the kind of misery that occurs if your accustomed to consuming faffing every single day and then suddenly going to a to or five or twenty day abstinence i myself have never r tried and every other day affine approach although ism considering doing it based on the literature that have read and ism considering doing in a very specific way which will be to only consume coffin on the days in which i resistance train and since i tend to do that about three or four days per week organize in a way that every other day again if you want to see the exercise saddle that i follow including carry of vascular exercise and weight training and all the reasons and rational for what i do and how it maps on to the scientific literature relate to hell spend and lifesimand bi reality et camera you can find that at suberin labor calm and we had a tool get for fitness that ought to be posted i to our weight before long the every other day schedule of coffin in take to me seems the most rational one if one wants to maximize on the performance in hanging effects of affine without suffering the effects of affine withdrawal that are associate with being a regular consumer of affine and then stopping affine and take such as headache and irritability and forth not i nor any one in my life a wants me to experience those effects and ism sure you do not want to experience those effects for you either your somebody that decides to try the every other day pro to call or you are somebody who is already doing that photo call please let me know what your experiences with that are at least by my read of the literature on affine and its performance in hanging effects but also the effects of affine on her transmitterent hormone systems the every other day affine gradual does seem to be the most rational and scientifically grounded one in order to maximize on all those effects in addition to call performance enhancing effects of affine there are also the well studied and now fairly well mechanistically understood pro health effects of coffin now here when i talk about pro health effects of affine want to be very clear that if your shaduf of affine in take that is your timing of affine in take or anything else for that matter offsets getting regular high quality sleep of sufficient duration well then you are undermining the prohealth effects of that thing this is true for exercises is true for affine this is true for supplementation this is true for prescription drugs again you do not want to be neurotically attached the idea that you had to get perfect sleep every night because that simply not true but is absolutely the case that anything whether notes good for you or bad for you in the short term that disrupts your sleep because of the timing in which you are doing that thing is going to undermine your immediate long term health before long with that said there are several well described health promoting effects of affine in egestion and once again when i say affine ingestion ism referring to that one to three telegrams per kilogram of bodywaigt dosage there really nice study showing that being a regular consumer of affine can help offset some of the probability some of the probability of developing parkinsons and may be alshimers related to geisha s well these are not terribly controversial data because of the fact that affine is known to increase the release of those katacolamines dopamine epinafran and nor up indifferent as well as a sector calling all those nor transmitter and nermodulater systems are the ones that are known to be defective in parkansons and alshimers although their other transmitter and hormone systems the defective as well there are beautiful reviews on the narrow protective effects of fine and neurotic general diseases there quite extensive and it'll just refer you to one and the references therein and will provide a link to this in the shown o actions the title as the am a topic hat can suggest is the new protective effects of affine and negro degenerf diseases this was publish in twenty sixteen ism sure there's been other reviews since then but includes many many quality references unstudied both in animals and in humans pointing to the fact that specific enzymes that are associated with the health of in particular dopamine neurons or made more robust by regular ingestion of affine it also points to the fact that the increase in dopamine receptors that is induced by regular ingestion of affine that refer to earlier is another way in which dopamine however many dopaminerons remain around in people with parkansons or people who are aging that lose dopaominerons naturally that dopamine can have its mat sima effect because of the increase in receptors for dopamine that affine induces end there other biological mechanisms that further support we affine ought to be negro protective including its effects on the assets cosine system chichis one of the major systems disrupted in alshimers dimension another words it makes perfect sense as to we affine would be hero protective affine has also been shown to diminish headache particular when taken in commination with aspirin and that is because of the effects of coffin and aspirin on blood fly there's also evidence that affine can provide brief but substantial relief from asthma i would not want people to rely on affine as a life a saving approach to an asthmatic attack that said for people that suffer from minor asthma that kaffinin take again of the dosages that we talked about before has been shown to alleviate some of the major symptoms of asthma for anywhere from one to four hours end i know this is of relevance to a lot of people out there because affine increases the katacolamines and in particular because affine increases dopamine transmission in the prefrontal quartan the sorry the brain of associate with focus and rule setting and contact and switching affine is known to improve focus and alertness in particular in people who have symptoms of eighty it or other attention and focus issues now affine alone does not appear to be as potent for the treatment of amity as are things riddling overall modafhanel and armodaphanen giants if you a tor h d by head comparison of prescription drugs supplements and things affine as well as coverage of behavioral tools and nutritional tools et camera that and positively offset some of the symptoms of radiate pile see the episode that i did on eighdieight she again that is available superman labor common all formats but that said affine does increase focus and it does it through number differ mechanisms not the least of which is to increase dopamine transmission in the forebrain just as a drug riddling or natural would although not to the same extent as a drug riddling or natural does before we close to day i do one tat just briefly return to the reinforcing effects of affine that we talked about earlier this study on the honey bees that show that bees prefer certainectors because they contain taffy even though they are not aware that those sectors contain fine they just come to the feeling that those sectors provide them much that they associate that in a subconscious way with the flowers themselves and they come to those flowers or human beings for instance children that in jest caffeinated beverages come to adore the taste of those beverages and beautiful studies have been done that describe how children an adults truly cannot distinguish between the taste of a kaffinaded and non caffeinated beverage and waffle can be placed into essentially any beverage in order to give us a preference for that beverage or food in fact the studies have been done with yogurt if you put coffin into yogurt of different flavors even plainyogert which most kids do not they will come to prefer whatever flavor contain the affine even if then you remove the affine from that flavor now eventually their preference for that flavor will be extinguished but all of this is just to say that many of the things that we whether not its coffee or tea or a given flavor of food or given experience or even exercise occur because we in jest affine in conjunction with those activities now these are not tricks that your nervous system plays on you these are real negro chemical reinforcing effects and i think that we would all do well to think about and to leverage these reinforcing effects much in the same way we would do well to think about and hopefully not leverage aversive effects of certain compounds right the simple way to put this is i or any one could get you to dislike something some one or some place by making you feel slightly less good lower mood do not you knave to make you feel cautious but less good after investing something or having a certain kind of interaction or being in a certain environment very straightforward to do that because of the way that your nervous system is wired for conditioning however there is the positive side of all this which is that it is very straightforward to reinforce the experience of a given food including its taste but all the contacts around it the container the texture the people you consume it with where you c consume it et camera for instance i wonder why we are not parring affine with rocky and that here ism not suggesting that people actually do that experiment or play that trick on people but you have to sort of imagine that if affine is this incredible reenforce of all sorts of things in particular things that we in wasting would want to invest more of if it is pared with affine well then you actually can use affine as a tool to increase reinforcement of different things and you can avoid affine as away to further reenforce things that youwould to stop and here i to just give the example of sugar cravings a lot of people some how do i avoid sugar cravings have talked about the use of all glutamine for that have talked about making sugar getting enough essential fatiacids and essential amenoacids as a way to reduce sugar cravings please note however that if you are somebody who likes to saviour sugar whether not it is a piece of chocolate or your desert et camera ism not saying that is bad but if your trying to reduce your sugar cravings ask yourself are you ingesting sugar along with affine could be the affine contained in that sugar containing food chocolate or it could be that your having a cup of coffee along with your pastry and then your struggling with sugar cravings well think about it you are not just being reinforced by the sugar and the effects of sugar on opening which are real and both conscious and subconscious through the gut to the brain opening system and direct on the brain opening system but by contesting affine you are also further enhancing the reenforcing effects of sugar the lipides all this is that you could use affine as a way to increase your appetite force certain things actually know somebody i will not reveal who this person is but they are quite prominent podcast who in jests a hundred and twenty five to a hundred and fifty telegrams of affine in tablet form in tablet form along with verbally and use us as a way to develop a preference for verbally because they found that coffee was giving them other effects that were not good for them it works quite well in animals and it works quite well an insects and it works quite well in humans i suppose animals insects and humans are all animals at the end of the day no surprise there but it all underscore sense to which affine is an absolutely fascinating molecular minutes of ability to offset the sleepiness system if you will this a denizens system and to control a schedules in that way to essentially take a withdraw against the bank that is a decisive and then pay that back later in the form of getting sleepy later as supposed to when we want to be alert it is ability to enhance focus alertness and mood and if taken after trying to learn something and remember it to enhance memory especially and it is ability to increase of via two man increase strength we name in talk today about it abut all just briefly mention that affine invested the sorts of dose s we talked about earlier because its effects on the corpuscular system and the calcium system associate with narc muscular exertion and fatigue can increase pique power output and muscle contractibility hanging performance there as well and of course caffeine does a number of other things just generally related tore overall in banal level of mood and alertness not the least of which are these increases in dopamine caffeine is really an incredible molecule it is affecting all these various nortransminter systems but not hap hardly it is increasing dopamine and a stocking in the forebrain to increase attention it is reducing fatigue it is improving mental and physical performance for some obvious and some not obvious reasons and what i think is among the more miraculous and powerful effects of caffeine it is a potent potent potent reinforcer of things foods people and experiences and it is one that you can leverage in any direction that you once you understand the way that caffeine exerts those reinforce in properties today have really tried to cover as much as i could about the mechanisms of caffeine action in the brain and body as well as tools and schedules and dosages in which you can leverage caffeine in order to meet your physical

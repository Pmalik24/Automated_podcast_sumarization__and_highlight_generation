when we were weak we told ourselves we were strong sometimes we were very weak we good ourselves we were very very strong i mean questionably i was by father must clothed member of my class i think an being a a pasty unathletic kid who was we'd looking and probably seemed overly eager o and i had friends that would come over on the weak ends for to play but than a school they would ignore me and pretend they did not know me and the ne was little cries wear the got he registering spent a lout of time thinking about super powers he drew super heroes over and over trying to get them right he ways wondered where somebody could find o her you active animal the one tho bit peter parked turned him into the amazing spider man a couple times chis thought that e might be developing his own super powers real a there was one morning when i was standing under the under the shower and coursewhn you get in immediately cause you are cold the water is extremely hot by contrast you have the the cold water turned up and as you standing their you get used to it you turned the cold water down and i was there for a very long time an i remember turning the cold and it would not go any farther and i thought that is where it must be stuck and i turned it more and it would not go any farther and did i realized i was standing under completely hot water but i i was it felt fine to me at actually felt warm almost cool and the longer i stood there it felt cooler and cooler and i the only explanation i could come up with as that i had developed the the ability to withstand extraordinary heat wan of course wed just iron not a hot water but at that time i did not know that that happened i thought hot water was was an endless commodity even did his own superhero called the hurricane we could shoot blasts of wind from his hands it was drawing with huge man we muscles e made a hurricane costume that he could were himself red tea shirt wit a black circle with an each on it an a mass that his mom made for him and yellow cape you know solenoid's really gopher cape there were a few times are actually came to school with bits of the superhero costume secreted under my school uni for him i guess i do not exactly know why i guess i thought it was it was it was going to give me some sense of power something that a corban i a mimic lass a to change your clothes oi was thinking there is one time i actually this is an is a into for for a superhero but i had actually drawn circuit boards on pieces of paper by ani mans explained other man and i had actually it'd actually taped o them on my legs to look real circuit try exposed as if i had mechanical legs or something that i guess i vaguely thought that somebody would catch a glimpse of it and think wo luck's yoni some of us we spent a long long time hoping that e more than what the world thinks of us and of course we would draw in to these stories these mild banned guys who underneath your closes were a costume in secret the powers nobody suspects and when we would older it all seems ridiculous of course it seemed really really dob it is embarrass chis wear though wont don't to draw fortunes for his living but the fortunes that he draws are novels the graphic novels about real people any time a superman type shows up in one of his cartoons he is always somebody trying to care kids but the costume and cape it is always a disappointment is just more interesting that way i think he is more a real dad that way i guess the more i draw i the battery gats ta in the morebaldi guess i guess i if you wore supermanteriou what o you care what you look he would not be all handsome and you just cannot i you eat whatever you fell you take whatever you wanted any eat and up looking really terrible after a while i thinks if i was a superhero i think i would proxy i mean who is get is going ta critics o what a mayn't already program superpowers for real life story is about how easy it is to be caught up in the dream of them the you be easy chico it is this america live i mire a glass as the supervillains say silence miss great our program has begin i one i visible man versus hackman we now pro en a kind of supercontest for you beloved superlistener be tween two ancient superpowers to with the superpowers which a fascinated human since antiquity an i should this kind of a superworshock last john hodman has been conducting an unscientific survey posing for people a very simple choice flit verse is in visibility this question is only for you whichever you pick you will be the only person in the world to have that particular superpower you cannot have both which do you choose i started wondering about this a few years ago it'd bring it up at parties dinners wetting receptions it as more interesting to ask them where people worked or where they went to school and clearly more fun to answer a magic word cream flying versus invisibility would instantly change an evening's character opening passionate conversation and debate but what surprised me more was how quickly everyone would choose as thou they've been thinking about it for a long time every one knew exactly which superpower they wanted and what they would do with it the plans were not always flash your heretic in fact they almost never were if i could my the first in o does fly into fly into the bar check out what is got on there fly back home i wit a tach my baby t me and fly to a doctors appoyment at eleven thirty fly bight back ut i think would fly would let it a i mi would ma i milk i i i a gat a round that i had a for fly on and i is a car a a ma i me ever at mi be re be i up in ti en eve y a i flip a fly e you e is i for i go in to barns i pick out the cashier sweaters that i i go into the dressing room the woman says how many items i say five i go into the dressing room it put those five sisters on and i sum in my powers of invisibility into the dressing room i turn in visible i walk out leaving her to wonder why there is a tag hanging from the door that says five and no person inside you would become a thief pretty quickly immediately still i had all the sweaters that i wanted and then i would have to think abut i take to typically this is how goes people turn in visible willsneak into the movies or on to air planes people who fly stop taking the buss here's one thing the pretty much no one ever says i would use my power to fight crime no one seems to care about crime handout think i would want o spend alone time you san my parer for good i mean if i do not have superstrength ism not dead invulnerable then i mean would be very dangerous you d rescue somebody from a branding building or something that you might you ketch on fire just having we i do not thing as necessarily why an not as you a as superstar i might still be weak when i got there i guess o i do not fight crime now and and people without superpowers do for in theory yes but you not not and what can i do at is i may either one of those i see you need a whole package is not much you can do with any one it'd go to parts the suppose it's not being superior well they may i could be e going parts man that sort of a superhero going to parts man is not a supreme and i have to say the strove me crazy little bit we are after all talking about superpowers why not take down organized crime bring hope to the hopeless swear vengeance on the underworld if only a little pit i proposed a variety of sample scenarios along these lines such as how would you handle a mad genius taking over the empire state building for a group of terra high tracking an oversees flight and who learned is some people should simply not be fighting prime the firstling that capers to me is an this got sneak up behind them very low and on it a knife bat they did not see and slice their adults tenant o now i somehow shall a sock in their mouth i something that that they cannot and rub rap me tap er run the mouth that the cat yell out am i have your sock mi to say same napkins of sop i i i cannot keep o that the man i have to get have to keep a bagful a step with me knives a to you think would dead the attempted to in this day ye than age helper on now i let thing t helper would be got a helper with a complimentary power there is no others anybody else it so pepawowi would just be at teen nineteen eight or can any now people who consider invisibility always one know do i have to be naked people who choose flight one know how fast almost all asked who up been in a fight mister invisible or flying man and i had to lay down some rules in visibility means the power to become transparent a will including your clothing but anything you may pick up is visible flight means the power to fly at any altitude within the earth's atmosphere at speeds up to one thousand miles or power but even then they start looking for loopholes hidden catches superpower fine print they start negotiating their dreams with me now when you are flying if you are flying it a thousand miles an hour at get a hundred thousand feet are you are you comfortable do you get very cold let say am in this from and i in visible and ism walking round this apartment and it visible and yes you right have to be completely quiet or you gave your my footsteps is that is a pain ye and also sonly to let you o can i carry somebody can somebody on on on my back can you carry someone on your back now a little people you little people y than you can carry little people in er bay done flight it is this is all part of what i call the five stages of choosing your super power sometimes this process occurs and just moments for example subject a polish man it glasses lodged into a cramped farrow corner begins as they all do with stage one cat reaction indistiually have a thank can perhaps in visibility next come stage to practical consideration because you have the ability you y walk around work perhaps show up at one point and perhaps i go away for little who turn invisible and then come back of this i n what they say about you yet the power to spy on your apsis and now it all be enlightening and and fine and in back a lit it perverted and am you hear that out in his voice that is the beginning of stay three philosophical re consideration at would i believe i be you would you would immediately turn into a life of complete depression you would you would get to really share with any on you now am and i know the be some like from it the at the firs of thank stage for self from an action in visibility teases you a the me as in visible person town a our was because your not goon miss out en your visible on you now to matter how many time you seen o woman making in a shower your gotta want o see it a gain because it is always a differ woman a an there is a light time a than and that that is not except able be gave no matter whether your visible an non and finely stage for except once had a but flight who chooses invisibility and who chooses fly in my experience though there lots of exceptions meddling toward flying women invisibility and many bread anxiously over their choice switching from one to the other and back again and that is because more than the ability say to burst into flame or shoot arrows with uncanny accuracy frighten in visibility touch an nerve actually they touched too different nerves speak to very different primal desires and unconscious fears my friend pristine chosen visibility what if ta power is about something that is obvious n the other is about something that is hidden an indicates your develop shame how do you mean a present riches is to fly has nothing to hide a personage is o be invisible wants clearly to hide themselves do you feel thatyou want hide yourself i want to a it'd to not tits that quest it all this ta de win guile wanting to be invisible me ins that you are more guile full person if you want to fly it mas your guileless i think the reason that i am conflicted about lying versus invisibility is it a had guile but i really wish that i did not flight of the hero helpless and confident and unashamed an invisibility the villain almost every one i talk to called invisibility the sneakier power flying as for people l you want to let it all in at in it inability is for fearful crouching master bars first of all i think that a lot of people are get to tell you that they would choose flight and i think there lying to you i think they're saying that because they try to sound all mythic and heroic because the better angels of our nature would tell us that the real thing that we should strive for is flight and that that is noble an all that can stuff but i think actually if everybody were being perfectly on us with thou they would tell you the truth which is that they all want to be invisible that they can shop lift get to movies for free go to exotic places on air place without paying for air line tickets and watch celebrities have sex at any one face with this choice in their heart of hearts but choose visibility yes or they have the a sort of inflated heroic mythical concept of themselves and a that infect they are not really giving during which bree tot n you mend is not i question of what kind of person flies and what kind of person fates we all do both perhaps that is why when i put the choice to myself an hopelessly completely stuff the heart of this decision the question i really do not one of things is this who d you want to be person you hope to be the person you fear you actually are do not russia to it think it over which would you choose a men s he other of many fine books was latest is called vacation land true story from painful beeches a the a a a a am a a a ma a tax to wonderwoman look at what are the ways to create a

result killing ma levers met somebody who tried we met in a bar in flagstaff arizona i just move back from cambodia and i was going out for one of my first berries back in the states not long into the first one i notice this amazon of a woman with huge blond and red street hair and frosty lips wearing a short red tank dress and at least fifty bracelets she six feet tall and showing a lot of lag people at the bar swindle their heads to watch her every move she stands next to me to order a drink and in this throaty voice says what are those pointing to my cigarette i tell her their cambodia her eyes light up and she shoots out a long tan arm and points at a table in the corner she orders me there before i can say now am following her to my seat she tells me she is ice international private investing he a bounty hunter and o mail bonds is forever and that her name is fora i sit there for ours was man to her within a week she takes me to lost fags we drive there in her red mustang

least two hundred dollars on lap dances from buff skies with names woman her get up is the same as before tease hair jewelry and the ubiquitous tank dress which i realize is the best way to show off her tattoos not is this big circle with blue and white swirls in it kind of a bowling ball on her left shoulder every guy she meets asks her about it and when they hear her answer they sometimes proposed marriage turns out the tattoo is a magic globe she holds in her dreams and in these dreams it gives her superpowers ever since i remember have had the dreams and they are very vivid but it series it usually involves fighting sometimes with guns sometimes a with super her powers lighting from my fist in all that and i usually have have superstrenthan i can fly and i have all those things and it is my most commonstead of dreams in it babies is sometimes as naval sometimes as futuristic sometimes s a gorilla for in at america can you describe that fora to me the fora in dreams very powerful athletically a but beyond the rules of nature that this world blows the six foot five and long almost impossibly long silver hair the sort of other worldly quality to er where her voice sound did not sound normal i sounded almost musical it became something that i aspire to be a spire to be this sort of superhero this sort of person who would fight for a cause that was my motivation in life ever since i was ten or eleven i resounded that that was my got fora took the dream seriously to seriously that at the age of twelve she sat down and composed a list of some thirty skills she needed to learn if she wanted to become as close to a superhero as any mortal could be she even gave herself a dead line to master these skills by the time she was twenty the this a new fora pulls out the old spiral notebook that was her diary at the age of thirteen and turns to the inside back cover there is list she old red t mom the list i included marcelarts electronics chemistry metaphysics and gliding helicopter an airoplaing plying perestruting mountain climbing survival threw out her teams in ones each time she started in e diary she would estate the list and write it in the back of

clues body building archerying demolitions and explosive she wanted to learn how to hunt animals and track men i have major physical conditioning and the most incredible thing about all this is that fora accomplished nearly every item on the list throwing stars an compound bows and throwing knives and yes it was a very interesting pastime to keep up with the goals set by the list she sped through school starting in the seventh grade she began completing entire school years during the summer term and finished high school by the time she was fifteen she got her b a at eighteen a masters at twenty and completed the corse work for a p h d and geopolitics by the time she was twenty one she wanted to live indaba ones spending half her time in the class room and half her time saving the

people are diligent they commit their dreams to paper and make it their life's work to achieve them how many keep a list amending adding to it taking things off as they go along well into their adult live after finishing the course work for her p h d re r decided to quit school disappointed at the lack of cliff hanging adventure and her doctoral programmed and since super heroes who live in the real world need jobs she decided to seek employment at the only place that would allow her to put all the skills from the list to use fora wanted to become an agent in the c i a and began a rigorous application process interviews psychic as a three day lie detect her test after that than the the sent investigators out to interview me interview my neighbors interview employ friends interview friends ex friends former colleagues people at work with you please to work with they threw a question out in the middle of an interview what would you do in the situation if a if you were driving down the road and you had a whole if your and i agents with you some one who going to give you some information and you were in ha third wold country somewhere and you you were driving a car and you accidently ran into a dog and people hade been outplaying the street children in the street they see the dog et killed and they get upset they rush towards the car what you do in that situation you do not want to draw attention to the person who's with you what i said was that i was a sow agent to get down lower in the car and i would get out of the car and a draw the attention myself and try to appease them in som wives either by giving them money more am but but and that was in accentual ans wit up action at the time when i was going through the process it felt everything was coming together and i had not felt much joy shall ever you tell hem about your dreams absolutely not i would tell them that i had a sense that i could combine the whole street smart intellectual the education was the sort of adventure personality and i was actually told that i had to perfuse personality for it and that and that i would do really well it was the fruition of my life that it was going to be the step into the next wherein where i would be using all that list in preparation for the next has which would be to actually put it into practice about eight months into the interviews fora got a letter saying she would been rejected she appealed over the next year and a half partly to find out why they turned her down but the best they could do was to tell her to try again in a few more years in the end the c a would not take her and they would not even tell her why party it took me more two years to recover i was a basket case i i was not i was not i was just down i would have to work i could not concentrate throw slump down staring at the wall i i put my whole life into examination all the years of preparation an n most of us give up our dreams of superhero adventure when were adolescent fora was only getting to it at the age of twenty seven here she knew how to fly at helicoid er and survive in the wilderness but for what she devoted a lot of time to thinking about why she might have been rejected by the c a maybe it was all those months she spent with right wing militias doing her doctor on reserve maybe she should not have told the c a how she ended up in a clandestine i a club one night while on vacation an ireland maybe the c a did not the fact that her father a professor at the university of minesoda is an outspoken urban nationalist or maybe it was simply her own fault that she could not turn herself into a superhero i had violated the agreement of the list violated the agreements of of that i made with myself that i had not become what what that the archetype was that had become something lacking the point being that at that my mythology should have guided me better and it felt such a final thing fora we made herself she had been virtually isolated from other people since she was fifteen when she started actively pursuing the goals on the list her parents were happy she was busy cause she had no time ways but now she started working for a woman private investigator one day when she went to sort she wore her first pair of panties because she was told it would help her look more feminine soon after she was schooled in the sheer power of lips a short skirt and a supermodel runway walk to control the minds of others these days sh works for an international private investigation agency that handles these kinds of cases

she is happy doing this for in a typical case were agency sent her on a mission to mexico to do what is known as a reverse scam the agency was hired by the family of a young woman who would recently traveled there and fallen in love with a man she plan to marry after knowing i for only ten days the family suspected some sort of con fora contacted him pretending she was looking for a girl friend who used to work with him in the travel industry she took a photo of a classmate with her to begin the scam i sort of place the distress america student going to the punish school and he invited me on a couple of dates and ask me to i come back for the bullfight what did you where no i for a little adbityskirt in in a a little tank tap i made it seem i had plenty of money and that interested him that in any kind of perked up at the he never mention the whole time that i ever spent any time within he never mention that there was ever a woman am and he i found him to be pretty emotionally open and very romantic guy but i honestly felt that he probably was not in love with her that he was taking is as an opportunity live in the united states and that was the report i gave before fora set out for mexico i wrote with her to the air port we relate in hurrying through the terminal just ten minutes to spare when she did the strangest thing she sat down in a chair far from the gate and would not move i told her she was going to miss her flight but she did not budge i sat down next to her she said she was scared about the case about which disguise she might wear about being found out no she said she said she was afraid that when she got to mexico people would not her the next time i was at her house i had not notice before but i realized her bookshelf was packed with advice on how to build confidence titles princess mockyavelit for women books that are not really far from the idea of keeping a list having an on going plan for self improvement believing that if he just put something on paper and stick to it you can change fora still has her list but while the old list was all about being perfect and saving the world the new list is very different i need to learn how to play tennis gall an my new list is when serving ten is gulf am i need did develop some kind of talent tam i need to learn how to sing properly but o do some kind of comedy or sketches acting acting any learn how to act oh i need to learn how to sing billy holiday she does not take the list seriously these days there are no dead lines she puts things on the list and lather decides not to do them it is not a grand mission any more now its just the list calling me levers hes those decent poorest bested podcast fora is currently doing a kind of superhero work she only yo went peacekeeping

continues this america life om ire glass he you can a program of course we house a theme bring your a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme to day's program superpowers and how easy it is to get caught up in the dream of superpowers we arrived at fact three at three the green team of super hero boy millionaires the amazing supermonkeing from panic crimson and the man from sham my friends they come in waves hundred year or more whole armies of them i looking about new superheroes created by the comic book companies it is rare for any of them to last more than a few wishes the weight gone and forgotten is as far as we can tell the authoritative arrive of these failed supersouls the got the runs the sight under the title your humble editor isjonathan marks he says that the few great superheroes have some common sense things going for them one they have powersthat make in tit of sense too they have a reason for fighting come three this stories have a human touch to them you can relate to them he agreed to come into the studio with a stack of some of the comics that do not quite measure up to those superstandards ism trentifind a very good one a catonicomics with me i let us see we have got ta captain marvel is one of the character's feature on the website his amazing powers that he can split by which we been his limbs fall off and then flail around ism hopefully i imagine hiding up the criminal ism not getting he says split his arms legs and head fall off and he screams yow i popped apart and with the word am he re turns to a returns the normal that is i allying into action i do not even know why that is one of the most disturbing things give ever heard this this company has a had a a number of characters who shared their names with preexisting characters they had a plastic man i who appearances very issue in fact but he was nothing a the the famous plastic man which reis always an embarrassment and he be ordering he be ordering on line or he gets his man all the time a it you make a reservation an a restaurant that he show up and not tale thought you were the other plaster and there's there is even a point where he hears people you'll plastic man on the street and he is not he is long past the point we think an maybe they mean me know he knows they ant i to bring all the press with me and was press the the first than president of the united states i a rather earnest young man name press ritard become and with a name that how could he not he becomes the first teen age president of he united states there this is a this is the issue right before he has to fight vampires to which i is not acts inlay is where the president had but apparently it is rather important a now what is his superpower whtwhat on a president does he make well he is he kind of fits him that dock savage that man would where he is mostly a very well trained human and thinks to his india companion eagle frees menagerie of animals he learns the learn several animal skills helping teach press record how to be faster a an analog swing a monkey fight a brings have always thought that that the united states presidents he would be much more effective if the president had the powers to communicate in control the animals we this one thing that press proves it is that the there is nothing that the president consoled with two fifth and ayin companion and a small army of birds and el if you were to explain to people the characteristics of a bad comic book superhereout there are a father obviously a lot of ways you can screw up i one of the ways is to just overdo it and and cram the the elements the character down the reader's throats a one o the the characters was b in and everything about him was bees his full name was very e ems a he was attacked by mutant bees which were sent to earth by space alien b people and he himself became a mutant b person who had be powers and lived in a hive and eat honey and stole gold because gold looked honey and he could sting you there is nothing be related this man refused to do it is if you you you meet somebody at a bar you start talking to m you realize he only has one interest in live that is exactly would everything would have gotten back to bees you stark time by which yo watch on telliwich on last instill say you not sun interesting yo one be a a a a the serum comic superhero as come out of particular a moments in the nation's history positively i that is another thing that that really works against a characters when their tied in too tightly to a fad or a tight in too timely to something that is identifying an air there is a character created in the seventies but who is supposed to be retro character from the fifties name of three d man to help hook up on the thready movies there were a craze in the fifties terrible flat character nothing going on and when you say three demean what was his power h a ad a a metrical pair of glasses and i have the strength of three man and that is it he was as strong as three people fast as three people whatever that means proxy three times faster that human being i they always describe is as something as much as three men but i do not see he can be three times as be the have the agility of three men t they this three goes were usual as make any sense his have little trouble of threading part of the problem with the with just naming off the superheroes are goingtrough their powers is that on the face value there is not a superhero who does not seem silly a because he have to do to a point where the man's wearing a nostrum and he is driving round fighting crime and then where it is the line company they rise above that do you have a theory on this about what makes a good one in a bad one i have sort of a half formed theory i know that one of the things that really a helps the superpower to get over with the audience get over with the readers is a if it something they can apply to their normal lives perhaps by way of fantasy and that is i think why superstrength supersede a if boner ability urges general toughness are often common yuan get on the court with it get that superaccuracy and get a slam dog from mid courts and and really just school over somebody than that is hardly a superpower you want a but when you start getting into powers am one carat to who had magnetic eyes of superpower which is a little too esoteric to you've understand the i do not even undersyellit what does it mean magnetic eyes of superpower but and his first appearance he announced that he had magnetic eyes of super power they would they would illustrate little beams coming out of his eyes making metal things shoot right at them which would be terrible works don an marks who brought a few of his fifteen thousand comments om

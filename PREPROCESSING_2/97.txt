republican contestants throw their hats into the ring for the next speaker of the house but does it really matter on do dances pours resources into i and you widen explains how to confront in transfer

plan right now its press be fans i come flash went again just one second when n get into the latest on the now open speakers race a race that is open for no reason i can actually perceive f first we have a ton on our sketch will lock going on a lot on our plate but here is one thing you can take off your plate by putting great meat on your plate with good ranchers what is that will shopping for me you care about your familiars does good ranchers that is hit they have spent years building relationships with local farms to source the best one hundred per cent americonbeef chicken pork and now wild caught seafood the best of the land and see can now get conveniently deliveratyure or right now they are offering two years of free ground beef to anybody who subscribes that is a four hundred

a time of inflation this a great deal go to good ranchers dot come promocood ben get over five hundred buck in savings subscribe to good ranchers today america meat delivered of a the house race to replace the speaker is on again the recriminations have only begun at this point because the fact the matter is this was a stupid fight that that choose nothing it is all about an sent o structures as i suggested yesterday on the show its not about kemicarty being a bad speaker of the house the truth is was bout saurian being a bad speaker of the use make a better case that was banner being a bad speaker of the house but the reality is that in all the situations these these folks have been use did largely because of divided government and then unrealistic expectations from other members of the political caulis whether have on realistic expectations or who are fibbing to their own crowd see for politicians it is the intensive structure is always to tell your own people the things they want to here and what your people wont here is if they vote for you they will get the sun the moon in the stars if they vote for you you will beagle ogive them everything an possibly have wanted and ten when that dust materialize you've a couple of choices one is you count be honest with them he tillusen we did the best that we could we got the most that we can the problem there is that you are going t be outflank by some one else who is going to come along and promise them the sun the moon and the stars we neither all on the intelligence of your voting base which you would do and i think the most honest and best politicians do do that is fillister we are shooting for one hundred per cent and stead we got eighty per cent we got steeper sent that is all we could get because that is the reality of life but it does put you in the political danger of being out flank by some one who is going to promise you everything in the world and the way that you were able to keep members in line to keep them from doing this sort of stuff originally was that the party structures were pretty significant meaning that they could deny you money that if you if you cross the party the party could punish you in some way well as the parties have become significantly less important in america political life and by that i mean the parties exert virtually no pull over their members any more that is certainly true in the r publican party less true in the democratic party where to see will follow nancy ploy not because show loves any ploy but because nancy blowy has the power to punished or did until very recently we in the republican party there is no power to punish in fact it is precisely the other way around in order for speaker mac earthy to a become speaker of the house can make promises to a very small cookery of members of his own causes bight be vast minority of is own causes that a single person could initiate a vote to take down the speaker he had to do that nor to get the speakership this will hat put him an inherently weak position here is the problem now when people say oh one place my earthy was so on better fine let us say the get him jordan i love him join him jordan great representative from shoes on the house override committed is real bull dog and own personally he is great or let us get she get steeve schools sleeves terrific i real likes tee blot let us he get either one of those guys as speaker of the house if the same rules applied to them that applied to even mccarthy it will not matter if they are quonnpoot better than even macarthy because in the end let say it comes down to another continuing resolution and you are one of these members of congress ho is not behold insure party but who does make hay by fibbing your constituents that the son the moon in the tars or possible well you can just do the same thing to him jordan you call him merino you say way way you wasn't willing to shut down the government over spending that is because you're in sufficiently conservative you you must be ousted the only way this gets better ironically is for mandates to have all of his power takin away by the new republican majority speaker that is the only way this works the only way this gets better is him jordan in making the deal to be come speaker basically rings on all the things that to my carte promised including the ability of people to challenge to speakership with one vote a the otherwise this just cent to keep happening all it takes is one all takes is five because the house majority or the republicans is damned slim by thewy one of the reasons that it unbelievably slim as opposed to what it was sup posed to be after the last election cycle which was a thirty seat house majority for the republicans the reason for that is because donate trump back to bunch of really bad candidates in purple districts and they lost that is the reason in fact moderate re publicans one in new york if they were god candidates florid they did really well clout of the place in the country they lost very tight races in large parpbicas they were very very grumpy and they offended a lot of those swing voters in the for the same reason that republicans did not winseniteats in say arizona or in georgia or in pennsylvania the the the problem is stomach is the point that i making and to pretend that this is a principal to act by mandates in company to oust my earthy and the if we get some one better in there that is con o fix all our promise now we will get spending under a control not true it is not true at if you believe that then you are just going t keep getting succored this a point made by represent of cloudyatenny she is a representative from it new york and again she is from new york which means she is vulnerable now you may say whet she she is a my now how how could she not one of lovers she does one lots mean she is also from it new york and here is the thing you want a national majority or do you prefer who keen jeffreys to be speaker of the house if you would the re publicans to be in charge of congress you need people claudyettenny in congress she is in a swing district here is clodottenny we would not have spend the documents we would a had g since smiths char the housewares a means committee who open the istle blower coral we would never have known what these little lovers brought for now under under to ass under threat of their jobs we would not know any of the s non of this men o my earthy had not been speaker an it is it about having ta carte these people are going a whole hostage whoever the next speaker is and that is right that is right i would hope the wether is him honor seevsclees whoever becomes the next speaker of the house the dictate is i need ism not ism not going to even alow emotion to hit the floor unless a majority of the re publican cocks want ism not on to do it ism not gan to have a motion to get rid of me a speaker unless there is a large contingent you lives on a majority a signore minority that does not want me to be here ism not on to do it for one vote men can do for for votes and that by the way should be the same thing offered by every speaker of the use candid an the probe you have collect of action robin there let us a steevscholees and jordan decide that they are going to silicon neither of us is going to take the speakers position unless we drawbacks from the powers the my earthy gave to gates and crew well allies going o take that point it is for some one to swing in from the right and a you'll give you what every one it'll give you at every one and all i takes again is for gates an cretosave we they are going t give us more power we go with them the insist of the incentive systems here are completely messaline even aunty chair woman at dona madaniel li think has done over all a pretty terrific job and the reason i say that is because when you lose consistently election after election twenty eighteen twenty twenty then twenty one twentytwenty two i do not no ho you maintain your job but apparently this is the new way republicans do things the more you lose the more we are loyal to you or something in any case you areas on iron a madaniel talking a talking about all this you blame mack dates an the the the apples on on the conservative side should they have not taken this step in the frustration i going to be a happy warrior carton my earthy and i let o say let us just get the basis of the america people dine let us get the speaker of to dine let us make sure we do not have this muss on the a a san we do not have cars the gan we cannot do this rats car we cannot do this and wen if this happens again we are faradize jeopardizing a very small hosmitarty o an she is right about that but the protect is all of these incentives have now been created you are better off being the free radical than you are being the person who actually cares about the party achieving victories and whether or not you it this was a pattern set by donate trumpet twenty sixteen he ran directly against the re publican party i understand their blood people hare very upset with the quoting establishment re publican party ism upset with them to i think they spent to much one i think they caved on socialists i think lot of the form policy is bat however this notion that you can simply much the entire system and that this somehow benefits the entire system have get to see that bar real results what are what or the real results of that whit where are they by he lek have to see them victory is promise let us he some victories achieved in a second we will get to the democratic part in all this plus the blow back first when you are running business your employs card all sorts of interesting situations we have ended you with

right now bomb dot come typing ben chipper o case mac earthy pointed out yesterday as he was leaving that democrats had pledge that they would basically bail him out with the with the radiates crew if they brought this motion to replace the speaker he mentioned this yesterday after we ad won the majority a had became speaker lest and many pollock came to messy with speaker the time on the way out i told i was having at issues with gain enough vote what is the promise that they want this one one person can without she was the only speaker that change we i had the power to call the vote on her but i never would i lost them votes because of it ah is she said just give it to always back you up i may the same off for de banner the samthink to a pal could i believe in the institution think could they was a political decision by the democrat i think i thank the things they have done in the past hurt the institution they just started removing people from committee they do started doing the other things that their is the institution felt he happens you wrist about this now is the smart i did place your trust nancy pluck of course is a very stupid idea to place your trust i nancy polucian to day ism seeing about a of hue and cry from the right side of the how that supports my earthy saying well why did not nancy but who did not the democrat stepping the democrats cod a save my earthy be cause this entire vote you for all the talk about rhinos who was eight re publicans who voted along with all the democrats to remove mac earthy and yes nancy ploy could have carved off in o five votes and she got a save mccarthy and then the institution would have continued to move on as normal but why would you trust democrats to do that what in your record makes you think the nancy ploce who even aballyat hell the predictable result of this is that again more norms are broken there are certain norms in the house of representatives thathave just gone by the wayside is earthy mention rat there one of them is that you do not remove members of the other party from their committees just cause you do not them he recall they actually did this the democrats removed certain republican members from their part of front from their committees even though they really did not have power to do an to republicans have now threaten to do the same two democrats as they shot the garlic swallow shul to be on the indwell committee for example ill can o marsh not be on the for affairs committee i get look a but the rule was he did not do that and the democrats broke that full and our re publicanstrign o break that rill in kine will now republicans are taking the revenge on the democrats by i evicting them from their highway offices according to s be news two long time democratic leaders representing nancy pollocian stinijhoyr have been a evicted from their called highway offices in the capital in the after math have kevmac carthorse asters house speaker policy con firmed on tuesday night the represent of iatric my henry the new speaker proem has order she immediately vacate my office in the capital this a fiction is a sharp departure from tradition said pollock of my badly listening to nancy pollock matter wall about tradition is is laughable this lady who is kneeling in can take coff in the halls of congress as speaker i gave former speaker hasted a significantly larger sweet of offices for as long's you wish office base does not mattered me but it seems to be important to them now that the new republican leadership has settled this important matter butts hope they gets work on whats truly important for the america people now again the highway offices the vary in size and location some are windowless rooms on the basement level others have high dealings shandaleaders big windows the highway office of the late senior sober herb was is really really nice office is not clear why they were toss but the evictions we are probably in revenge by the republican causes for the democrats basically allowing gates to hold up the entire process alexanderocazo cortex for her pachas ye the she does not care bout the institution of congress she treated out does any one believe for one minute mccarthy would help elected de speaker quotinquoed for the institution mccarthy sobers is a theme he loudly stated he would not no go so with democrats called virtually known trash those who helped with the s are and then expected devotes for free well an then she continues of mccartha cared much for the institution he would not have open a baseless and peach to that a house not the care for the institution wouldn't have voted to over try election results who have honored his get limit deal with the president and all the rest o a sot again i understand pardons optics but what goes round comes round and that is the we the is going to be mean this is the er in which we live any rule the democrats break is going to be met with equal an opposite firer by the republicans and frankly ism totally fine with that am totally fine with that democrats broke the tradition in terms of judicial moments suggesting that they could ram people through with the fifty one vote majority match maconall and put three of demo from nominees on the supreme cord with just over fifty votes democrats decide to break all the rules of a hard committed simony for publicans will responding kind is just going to be this this is going to be the way that it is because all trust between the parties is gone and just one second will get to what comes next two exactly even wants to be speaker of the house seems a really rape job will gets that in just one moment first imagine for just one second that you are living your life here not in a really nice can aria of of the world and suddenly your approach a a elderly gentleman who informs you then object in his hand carries the power to destroy the entire word than now it is your job to carry that ring all the wage the volcano and throw it in now at first you might think that is crazy but then he proves it to you with signs and visions at that point you might before you take off from the shire you might think about getting some life insurance policy genius makes it easy to compare life in burins close from top companies and find your lowest price whens from personal experience is great to a

life insurance clots see how much you could say that is posy genius tot come slash shipper okas who even wants this garbage show while there at least three people who have entered the fray one is the house majority leader stove sullies he announced his candidacy did o high representative him jordan germane d the house of judiciary committee here is him jordan yesterday announcing blat supposed to conference us if together and makes stent to fusion that you just described and comes to go f ye a hypothetically they say the person we need to lead us now is him jordan would you accept that leadership a again yet the competent it the competent the god that that that the petition but am in tat how to a ha to be when you have the when you only can roll the holp the representative in the lighted later brant democrat that tall of the o the white out an it ah and you got a rowboat majority in a how you got to have every one on word but the the curtain we want to lead o it got to be a a a cot of a bottom up competent e gid yo that individual going to be scolese's job has been as the house majority leader his his decision his his job has been i sort of bring every to together that is the case that his making is that his trying to on will build consensus were others thought it impossible he has good relationships a cross the conference to isn't particularly close with can mccarthy one probe is that dome he is being treated currently for blood cancers that is a serious concern him jordan is consider real firebrand his very closely allied with dona trump but unclear if the left wing of the party is going to support him jordan he ends out being close with mac martian was upset when he when he got tossed jordan has some early indorsements from de is of californium toms massive kentucky get banks of indaba all all which are good endorsements obviously and then there is a third member onclhoma representative haven hern he also is is running for the position he is the chair of their conservative re publican study committee he said he had not made an official announcement also chip boy might get in again unclear how all this is going to shake out at this point none of this manners if they do not actually change the rules in that there needs to be a change in the rules and terms of who can acting just get rid of somebody the motion vacate the chairs thou waster journal points out used against earthy is get to hang over the had of the next speaker mac carthyallied don't represent of don bacon of nobrasku and whoever get to eighteen if they get to a tune with these eight in governable people though always hold thus over their head those a man worth they busted the heaven om believing govern with these aid people others say the changing the rule be a condition for their support represent of carols hennas of florid he said the person who wants my vote for speaker has to commit to reforming the motion to mama because nobody can actually govern under these particular circumstances now the the truth is that mac carte again representative representaccount of the center of the of the republican party which e could say that there is one he as very grumpy but at the same time he was in favor of increased eights you crane but if the partaken want the a you crane who carrot out of the star he should pretty representative of of what the republican cock is wanted all these are the people o pretty strong positions scores has been working behind the scenes to replacemac earthy as speaker trying to shore up support according to fox news digital after houseman forty of ton emmer suggested cheese to make a good speaker scholese told reporters that he did not have anything to announce we will see how all of this moves for meanwhile the knives are out for gates and now on majesty on a pure tarmac level he deserves it he cause what he is doing here is absolute gran standing as a mentioned over and over again it is stupid counter productive it does not actually achieve anything senior markwane mulling of oglahoma when after machetes in a kind of different way yesterday he talked a little it about makes the a the personality the are than about the sky a this is a guy tat did not have that mediate in give a time at day to after he was access ta sleeping with a under age girl but there is a reason why no one and the corpses came to fin of him because we had all seen that videos he was showing on the housefloor that all is had walked away of the girls that he has slept with he drag about how he would a crush et medico an and and chase it with a with an energy drink he can go all night this is ogusyn before you got married and when that accusation cannot no one to finite and than no one on the media would him a time the day all sad he found fame because he opposed the speaker of the house back in nonmember and he is always stay there and he is not he was never on the leave and till he got this last moment o fame by sand y by goon after a motion to vacate it is important to no conman gates has never been charged with any extracting in crime any gave the statement to sand in response i do not think markwane mulling and i have said twenty words to each other on the house floor there a li from someone who does not know men who coping with the death of the political cures friend heaven thoughts ever sound things are gin gat uglier and things are arsing n that stupider one of the big suggestions the came out once the speaker was vacated was at donate trump for the speaker of the house ism sorry this is clown chostuff it is'just clownish it is clownish and ridiculous ton true for speaker the have now technically hound nave to be a member of the house to be speaker of the houstonia trump what are you kitting me you tank's non a whip votes donna trump is going to fund race on behalf of members of the house that yo gave no money during the last election cycle to anyone who is not name dona trolling what are you even talking about have we had enough sufficient shows of of sick of frantic bootlicking from members of the republican clack as yet that we have to actually talk about this kind of nonsense seriously you vote for trump for president that is fine dona trump did about good things as president speaker of the house a is any anybody who suggests this should be summarily laughed at it is ridiculous ism sorry to stupid on its faces they has no governing experience in the congress is not a single legislative procedure works he has spend his entire career they sicallye dividing republican against republican he achieved a massive victory against tolorclan he did wonderful things as president and he also would be the worst speaker of the houseboat like what are we can talking about this ay come on be serious for five seconds that trump was the asked about whether he would take the job and here he was the republican members of congress i or tot not march tailor created tit now this there can't back trump first speaker dead way in i on that this morning take a lessen trump then promptly went on so truth social and treated a picture of himself holding the speakers cavalry i you another people in the united sateswho actually rely on the federal government ism not talking about people horn well from time aulic people who are in business and want a predictable regime ism talking about people who do not want to see the national that blown out ism turn out people wo would just to go about their daily laughsithout worrying about the chaos clown circus that is congress and is this helpful marry tailor green again one of our brightest listen she treated out that you would only support doll trump the only candidate for speaker m crornently supporting his president oral trump he will end the warn you crane he will secure the border he will end the politically even as government by that he did not do any of these things as president of the invited states just go point that out he don't secure the border he did not end the politically ebonized government he will make a america energy independent again he will pass my bill to stop transgender surgeries on kids and keep men out of women sports he will support or military by morning horseman dos is speaker he is don't a run the senate that's a your es o can be president if he is the speaker and sol much more he has a proven for your record as president of the united states of america he received a reckon number of republicans votes of any re publican p residential candidate we can make him speaker an thentalect him president he will make america great again says marry tilegrie marry he is nothing a dato i seriously what in the what stop being clowns for five seconds just stop it just stop been i know it is too much as first party to sanity winds first party it sardines meanwhile president trump on the presidential level continues to be bog down with this ridiculous fraud case in new york again the the this frog case is based on specious assertions and because dona trump inflated the value of his real estate assets in negotiations with banks and then banks a section rely on this inflated valleys in order to make ones that somehow this announce to fraud which is every single person engaged in real estate in new york if you want to go about at this way i here is dona true correctly saying they have caponized justice and also you notice that were wrong about dona trump in the contact of his on legal troubles and not in a name that has not been mention far this entire so cotton why because when re publican set themselves on fire and then jump through circus hoops it turns out every one talks about them and not jobidin while jobiton is busy pummeling the america economy i know i hear is the iris dona trump going off about to the weaponization of justice which of course he is right and also this isn't matrobiton the is right he is right and also again what are we not talking about we are not talking right now about jobiton mean wile again trump continues to be by far far and away the pull leader in the club house right now for the republicans the latest at national average has non a trump at fifty seven per cent and the closest competitor around a want at fourteen latest economist got polls just come but yesterday has trump at fifty eight and to mantis at thirteen if you look at the state levels it is a little bit closer they haven't hade enough state polling in iota frankly at this point the sense has goneabout fifteen million dollar infusion hes putting it all into i we he is moving his entire staff into i the current pulling in i a still has dona trump om up on the field by thirty points in new hamster dona trump is still up on the field by thirty point the late joust say today suffolk pole actually has nice holy jumping into second place against to onto mantis that pull does have a margin of error of four and a half per cent or in the real color posies pulling average spastically trump and the a group of people daily at fourteen per cent to wants at ten per cent prissy at nine per cent bone line is there is no one challenger to trump at this point which means we can we talk about these issues as i say over an over again if is your bat is your bat i do not leans great strategy but apparently strategy is of no impacts at this point which is which is really exciting meanwhile abiding is running this economy into the ground a plain without wings we get that momentarily first let say that you have in employe now we will call him at watch and let

important to note if there is a brand new rasp me reports survey provided exclusively by daily wire about dinner dinner of course is a company that i have long had tremendous admiration for or a least i did up until a few years ago when we lives in californium we are annual gasholders over at disneyat is the best place to go with your ends i have pictures of myself with with my on parents when ism a small kid at isn't land my fourth day if my wife was a done land loved dinner product big dinner fan up until they decided a few years back to they were going to go completely woke they arguing to move to the left they are going to start in jetting bunch of el g b t k plus minus void by sine messaging into their programming particularly for kids and this is despicable stuff because you are taking legacy properties when you're still make your money off for legs properties while simultaneously promoting a woke left being a agenda that target's children tat is what dinner has been doing well now this rapes an reports survey shows that sixty per cent of re publicans have an unfavorable opinion of dinner including thirty five per cent in say they've a very unfavorable opinion that serve was conducted in t late september only thirty two per cent re publicans have a favorable view for democrats the results are precisely the opposite because of course for lot of democrats their perfectly happy with spoon feeding a bunch of leftist tribes into children programming then again this is no surprise there is another study they came out just yesterday from glad glad as the game let bean alliance against defamation pretty much all he big holly with studios prescreen their films can you to there a thing they actually do they prescreen their films ant l shows four glads board of censers and glad actually goes through and determines whether or not thesis acceptable to glad will now glad has has put out a report rating major holly with studios on how much l g b t u plus monist about by sin content they are squeezing ins their films an t d content and here is what they found they found that dinner is the top company along with relics that is what they call l g b t k plus minus i by sign inclusive in fact according two their statistics they give hem a forty one per cent rain which the good rating they made fifty nine total films twenty four of them where l g b t plus monist about by sign inclusive forty one per cent which is next to warm brothers discovery the highest rate they are one of only three studios that received a good rating from it glad and again all of this is is design for a purpose an the purpose is particularly when comes to a kids company dinner two target children and one thing for netflics to do this sort of stuff relics is largely designed not for children but shall dinner is designed explicitly for children it is films lite er which bombs at the box office largely due to the fact that one of the major story lines was bout a let been couple it is about the fact that dinner has decided that they wish to in the words of one of their own animators sledge hammer you with the not at all secret gayagenda okay meanwhile jobidon is doing a terrific chopigan we have now been through most of to day so and not mention mobile how is that possible when the president of the united states is running the economy into a ditch how is that possible the answer is when republicans once again kick themselves in the balls repeatedly every one point to laugh the guy kicking himself at balls even if the building behind that eye is completely one fire and children are running and screaming like that that is how it works that is how it works in any case jobidon continues to be terrible at is joshes yes yesterday how to confront family members ware ago family members and here is join it his most convincing and charismatic how to vise those people who do senior concern but maybe worry about talking to a mage part never porker how abstain to do at to wo but i also think that we should begging people war in o not not been worried saboteur labor talk to site say what wat you think why why i not can arguments butch this is wan you say this but how bout this force people to get and to a conversation well that is that is riveting stuff there from the dead presidents of the united states when these say dead presidents the many know the grison dollar bills now we actually mean the president of the united states who is a walking sonny at this point meanwhile the economy headed for disaster according to the pastry journal the guess has long been the lender of last resorts o the world during the emerging market panics of the nineties the global financial crimes of two thousand seventy two thousand nine in the pandemic shut down of twenty twenty those treasuries unmatched capacity to borrow that came to the rescue now the treasury itself is a force of risk know the united states is in deficit defaults or fail to sell enough bonds at its next action but the shall and upward trajectory of us borrowing and the absence of any political corrective now threatens markets and the economy in ways they have not for least generation that is the take away from a sudden a sharp rises in treasury yields in recent weeks the usual suspects cannot explain it the in elation pictures got marginally better the federals or of his signaled it is nearly done at raising rates instead most of that increases due to the part of yields called the term premium which has nothing to do with in elation or short from rates numerous of factors affect that term premium rising government steffisits are a prime suspect cuffs it is hae been wide for years now why should they macerate now the better question is what took long that larger duffs its push up at long from rates had long been economic orthodoxy but for the past twenty years interestraht models that incorporated i physical policy did not work no to record trey former get economist that is understandable central banks hand kept interest rates round zero while buying up government bonds that was in flatirons quantitative of easing they just put money into the system privates man oral credit was week this trumped any concern about s effigies mark we been see or managing director black rots as we had twenty five ut blissful years of not having to worry about this problem but to day central banks are worried about in elation being too high they have stopped buying in some case of their setting at their bond holdings suddenly fiscal policy matters again again s have said a thousand times whatever goes up starts to come down and that is true when it comes to the america economy when you in fleet things they tend to burst when you in fleet a bubble it tends to burst right now no one wants to buy you esse at whit is known wanted by you estate hell the answer is be get the bunch of answers one reason is because if the fad to fight in elation auto continue increasing rates that means that the bond that you bought yesterday is no longer worth money why ell because the bond that is coming out to morrow has a higher face yield that is why the yields on bonds are increasing bond yield by thewy when i a the ell about is it what i mean is the price of bonds is dropping typically speaking interest rates and price of bonds working inverse proportion as interest rates go up the rice of bonds drops why seems counter intuit of the answer is because people are worked the next increase interest rate increase makes the last bond worthless this what have a silicon vallebank rat they banked on a certain facial rate of interest on the boys they bought and then the fad are to issuing bonds and a much higher rate and all the bonds the silicon value bank was banking on were now worthless could not sell them in the open market meanwhile at the same exact time that the federal reserve is the entry in creasing those interest rates there there trying to sell bonds in the market m the tringsul us of bonds into the market which also under cuts the price why the sung bonds in the market because of the deficit because of the debt this is going to be a serious problem the federal debts the was over seven per cents of go p in fiscal twenty twenty three after a busting for accounting distortions related to student debt the is larger than any deficit since nineteen thirty outside of wars in recessions this occurring at a time of low on employment in strong economic growth suggesting that i normal times when things aracturally work debts its are going to be a lot higher by the way it is worth noting at this point the china an japan are not buying our debt in the way that they were according at to rioters foreign holdings of just treasuries rose in jury rising for a second straightmonth despite an in certain interestrat outlook muddied by mixed set of economic figures china stash of treasuries however drop to eight hundred twenty one plenty billion dollars the lowisins may of two thousand nine annals said that china has been under pressures to defending weakening currency and he selling of your stent may we been used for intervention purposes to prop it up s the putting more of our bonds old bonds on the market which floods the market with america debt which means hirer to raise the debt which means that we have to increase those interest rates that we are giving people in order to get them to by the debt which means were can hae to pay off those new interest rates at a higher rate of interest meanwhile jrobidon keeps spending into this because he is a more on yesterday preside en began announce student debt for likeness for another branch of america on wednesday months after the suprimecort blocked the administrations most ambitions at borrow relief plenty the in constitutional it is our been declared he cant unilaterally simply get made of studelon debt he is doing it anyway because thesis what he does the string of politically advantageous an ouncsments comes thanks the administrations use of existing programs tat allow the government to wave debt for certain borrowers the moves our separate from the administrations trouble the tom to cancel as much as twenty grain student debt for any borrower earning less than a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars year struck down by the supreme court wednesday's announcement of nine billion dollars and student debt cancellation for a hundred twenty five thousand borrowers the latest in a string of sizable discharges helps just a small place of the more than forty million people who owned at but again this is part of the inflationary policy of this administration is to basically blow motion to system by relieving debt the administration is touting those cancellations on the same way on the same week most borrowers return to making payments for the first time since they were paused in march at twenty twenty as part of the covenineteen pandemic relief the piecemeal approach to debt cancellation as up the administration has now wiped out one hundred and twenty seven billion dollars in student debt nearly one third of the projected cost of the failed mass cancelation plan the supreme ports as he cannot do it join just finds anotherwaye to it that is the way this works meanwhile mortgage rates are hiding seven point five per cent the real estate market is beginning to tank because again there is no one out there to buy up the real state is being put on the market and right now there is no inventories a weird sticky situation you're not con a seller house to get into an it per cent mortgage the you have a four per cent mortgage on your house right now there is not lot of inventory she price arn'treally dropping cause here

entirevitio and my series to bong to ire talk where i talk about plausible logical proofs forgot i think any of them are diapositive or inarguable of course not i do not think that you can logically prove that there is a god i do think that you can suggest that there are very logical arguments to suggest a god i think the you can say that there is a prevalence of the evidence that suggest that there is a god and again i artily do not think that most people come to god by being argued into its wit that sad one of thus expositors of the sorts of arguments is willing l and crag is a christian apologist his a great book all the color cosmological arguments ass based on ancient illogic sources it is discuss in mymonities the color cosmological argument is all about the idea that there is a first cause to the universe and wiling targets very detailed in this this is one of his more sophisticate bookstall has munch they're directed the more general reader totally worth the wort the reed willing long crags the color cosmological argument go check it out to day of can time for some things that i hate pope francs seems wildly in concerned about human sin but he is very concerned about climate change again ism not a catholic i do not have a dog in this fight other than his member of western civilization i think that the catholic church the catholic church moving away from its traditional roots in terms of morality is a massive mistake tat is going to lead to extraordinary vital consequences pope francs putting outsized impact on what he term social justice which is to say redistribution's economic and then he is adding on to that climate changing hes alike his top priorities meanwhile he is talking about how may be maybe maybe priest should beagle to give blessings to

be the biggest thing the your focus on well franchises message remained the same his voice has faded wednesday's document an a apostolic exhortation called locate drum or praise god amounted to a

think that he would be sight to use this new body that he created for the purpose ha a been made for o k he is kept in america its world were two bring on the notes but in fact he was terrified of just getting hit of the physical contact that should built into football and a week before practice he talks to a friend and he says to the friend he does not thin can can do it he does not tincal go through with it should he call the jetton to tell him he spotted over it is not for him i never forget what he said he said gay they will kill you they spent their entire summer training you an and feeding you you cannot you have to could truth with this he did he went through it it but the forms as john jetton put it he was a daisy in a field of weeds a lamp among conquerors you u put again to a buggy costume but does not always make him into a toga and of course a adults are always trying to convince kids and inspire kids about who they can be that is what could parents you that could teachers do but some kid lit marry just have trouble going along with the plan they want to please the adults they want o do what they asked but all the while they genuinely wonder can they actually become the person the adultery talking them to become is that down is that who they should be and it is totally confusing for them the adults in their lives seems to know wat the talking about there adults for god's sake there supposed to know better but the kids into wondering in a really primal way who am i i from baby chico it is this america life on or glass i show ta day in two acts in the second act i dolt to make it to a woman cannot even decide what is true about some of the most basic facts a at her on history but ism a dstrubbin this story a one marry story which were call in jerry short marry went to his first snooty practice and it was just as bad as he ad imagine it would be guys rush at him and smash into him on every play it is totally painful he is completely miserable bruised it was in this one play this guy hit me helmet to helmet and it was loud a gun shot and and everybody noticed it and they called it a biz and the way got its name was they said that the jetton as told me this they said the biz is the sound that it makes when you get hit in the head turn a game which is but and each week the the guy who had the best t hit on somebody else would get this tea shirt called the the biz of the week ta shirt and now we know that that these things these business that they were concussions but at the time in nineteen mighty eight the concussion protocol was pretty much you would you would and that first time that i got biz the reasons were proud of me they they hie fives me in they patted my my head the gull man got biz is first biz i was laughing along with them but i was i i hope that never happens again s everyday marry would shop at practice and heeded it i tail finally they started to play real games n these a just precedes and scrimmages but there against other high schools is a crowd in t e stands that changed everythingfrom the very first time they put him in on our fence they set up a play for me it is the pass where they just throw it over the middle they throw it up hi nobody can rage as high as i can jump i catch it it takes a couple of guys to to bring me down just because ism ism big and i want to run away from contact there were fans they were cheering i will say that was exhilarating goachestray amount wit defense he barely knows what he is doing and he sacks the other sides quarterback i had no technique debut i was just much bigger than this kid that that he could not outoutrun me because he was not as fast as me and he was not as strong as me h i was able to wrestle on to the ground anyhow we go in to the to the lockup and the coach is berating the other players on the team for for not being aggressive and he says the only person out there sticking anybody which i do not know if they still use that expression but i that express sticking anybody is marry gunman a kid who never play fool still this summer and i pul i had goose pumps and it was it it was a move it it is all happening just all haven't just the reasons had said it was uncanny open he gave me the real season the coaches start him this newly player he sacks the opposing quarterback right away and on all went they threw men the ball three times i caught every single one i mean that that night i go to my first high school party i never into high school party and it was such a let down could you see i red parties an movies the exciting in their season and i just sat on on a couch gas i did not drank and and it was an incredible at down but an i was fit a b yea can i was very gan yams for it yet you were there he now it you're there the bad e he made it and then sundae night the night before school a local newspaper reporter called me and interviewed me about this game he said that that i was the talk of it the town and talked about e everybody knew the ball was coming to me and they could not stop me and just the reasons that said there cone newspaper articles there was a newspaper article on the salon evening news the next day that called me mister raw potential bow ye and it did not last the season opener his first great game was also his last great game i had one more decent came when i caught a pass i made a really really good tackle but the teams started to do this thing were they would send guys to block me on my legs and they would send a couple of guys and they would just roll into my t my legs i thing it is called a a cat block if ire if remember properly but that that was how they would sort of neutralize ma and and did not the reasons have some technique u could use till i get around that i either either they they did not suggest one or i was not able to employ it opposing quarter backs learned to stay away from the side of the line that marry was on he was not sacking any one any more and after this one time when marry fumbled the ball on a big play at the goal line suddenly he says they stopped sending him out for passes no more here catches he was not making big plays he was not living up to all that bright potential and some dark part of his personality kicked in i maybe he was a waste after all the man costume had food them for a while he was still the same person quad always been he shed to dread practices and games i would throw up before every game on the sideline i would throw up because i was overcome by nervous and anxiety i started to feel really lousy about myself and and my grad suffered and and i just knew that i was starting to to disappoint these these guys and they never said anything to their credit they never said why we generally had high hopes for you it just i ice it sounds crazy i still have nightmares about it his plank than was make through the season one game a week never play again and in the middle of this a college football coach came in to our backroom and and introduced himself to me at my locker and that was sort of a a what the hell as going on here introduced himself to do me and said what he said i you had a great game which i i hand and i am an assistant a dartmath college and would love for you to take a visit to dartmesth yoga versed the thing the garret did not know or understand at the time as disheartened as he was his coaches did not think he was having a bad season sure they went sending i out for passes but the main reason for that john jets and told me on the found was not the fumble the marry had made marry obsessed over hit was that the quarter back could not throw reliable passes the team was in that good that year an sure yes garret did now haw to stay on his feet when players through themselves at his ankles but john jetton says he ad only been playing football a few months of course he had not mastered that the was not time to teach him everything the nations still saw marry as ha diamond in the rough garret was doing everything they asked ran his plays well was more reliable than most of the team and the coaches did what they did with any player with ton potential hey to viddiou of carry's best game that great first game made a bunch of c copies in send id around ta colleges and after seeing that video a parade of reporters showed up a marry school he get called out of class to meet them he was approached by hazard holy cross you mast university of new samphire university of man handsome top division one beg schools syricuses a boson college space would recently

expedition i mi a c no was it is y fa at i i get a i i goo yo thing in as many within n for nice cold the tapes and her memory proved what had happened to her as a kid it was a relief she would been worried that she was going to learn that her dad really did coach her to lie about her mum now she could put that aside she could remember him the way she always had as her best friend and a good dad but then cousin published a case study about nicholl he did not us her name he called her janedoll but cousin's case study became part of a huge dispute that was fracturing psychology in the nineties it was called the memory was and the argument was about where the repressed memories at out suddenly remembering to ma were real some scientist believe repressed memories were possible other said no way n colsvidio tapes and town's article wet counted by the side that thought repressed memories were real they thought colds case proved it down had not seen his coming ice spoken to him he says he was not on either side doctor elizabeth lofts red town's nodical with one eyebrows family rase she was a psychology professor at the university of washington and a big deal it was her experiments that proved memories invaluable and she was a stay witness in hyprophol your cases when she ogled that eye witness recollections on reliable when the memory was began she knew which side she was on she thought repressed memories what almost never real she wrote a doorstop of a book called the with of repressed memory when she read the jane case she was alarmed i knew that people were using this case is the new proof of repressed memory it was being discussed academically it was being introduced into court cases to prove that repressed memory is real and has been proven it best was being used against people whom i thought were innocent ah because they were on trial in their cases and we had to get to the bottom of it pot of has suspicion was the message and pot was the messenger she seen cousin testify in court on another case a patient accused that therapist of abuse and she did not find him persuasive there either i already had a suspicion about cousin and his judgment hi think going into this situation because of the work i had seen him do on this other case and how he had pretty much help to ruin the life of this poor female psychiatric who was the accused person in this other case you a saying that the female psychiatrist was accused of a you yes by by i think of former patient and down was saying that that had happened in many words yes he was he was an expert for the accuser loft's decided to investigate the jane do case she wanted to know whether the abuse had really happened but to do that she needed to know the real name of that little girl rather than ascowyn which would be normal for e such a looking into some one ease's study she decided to reground on her own loft's knew whet to stop close in the capes at some point in the tape he called her a cold and just made a little went no her name is ne cold he said something and when you were living in rest i thoutmn it has something to do with frena that kind of thing she contacted of private investigated to run down some times she such death records for ne colds father she found dozens of matches and she sorted narrowing them down closing in on the real jane do n cold meanwhile was thinking very little about her time as jane she left foster car and was making her own life as an adult she joined the navy she was leaning to find military helicopter ad she decided to become a psychologist she says because she wanted to be rowan she felt safe when she was token to him as a kid she was being listened to she wanted to make alter people feel that way she sorted acing her psychology classes at night while she trained as a pilot during the day a couple yearning to her military service stationed an howdy she got an odd phoncoll from a close family friend said either is something going on there a drive investigator looking for you what did you think oh mash when earth what on earth what is happening now and i knew within moments of hearing the words private investigator that this had something to do with dates vernal article it was the only thing she would ever been path that might be interesting to an investigator she cold clean who learned lotus was behind it loft interviewed nickels fastomam form a steam family friends who knew her growing up she would even interviewed holds bi logical mum and said she might have been wrongly accused nickel hearing about lofts was absolutely not why did you want how to stop i felt intruded upon i felt violated very vulnerable very exposed an an i understand that probably sounds weird given that i had already given dive my consent to publish a story about intimate details of my life but there is a very very big difference between some one asking you to investigate parts of your life and someone doing without your knowledge or permission i did exchange males with her and i asked her to stop what she was doing and what did she say and many words no did she ask you any direct questions while she was looking into the case no did that strike you as kind of and it struck me as come infuriating nicholl complained to lotus his university who told er to stop investigating the jane do case i just got the call from some administrator on my campus say are you looking into this case i said yes on look on the end o this case and a and they came and see to my files i mean i i i could not believe this was happening when when can when can the administrators come to your office and just take your files lofts was eventually cleared and she published her findings on janedub she ogled to the abuse might never have happened of course this was the opposite of what nicholl had believed and clung to since she was seventeen lotas printed eight pages worth of doubts in a magazine and cold the audible who abused jane do when nickel had the medical was on stand she took a friend from he military base and drove fifty miles to bonds a noble where they stood side by side reading it it was hurtful it was ridiculous to me that someone basically interviewed everyone in my life who had known me when i was a child except me and then when had and each work together this story that just happened to completely support her hypothesis how day she she just had no right she just had no right to do as she did who story is this this is not just her story this is this is the falsely accused mothers story this is a whole other people a part of this story i do not think one person gets to just aside i men i only tell the story one way and only let people tell it who believe me comuncritically what about the other people in the story i thought i was investigating an accusation against a possibly innocent person i do not think the claim is that you should have just believed her in critically i think i think nickel says that the way that you went around this ran such was aromatizing and demoralizing to heroine sh it made her feel she did not have any control of the her unrecods and her bunch confidential information from her childhood can you put yourself in her show that can you understand why she feels this was at tresses i well y as i i mean i think shed she had her away of of telling her story and o and she did not want there to be another way and and than that might be upsetting for her i do not i it does not seem to me what she was upset by was that there was another way of telling the story i think what she found upsetting was that you found out who she was and looked into her life without asking her without thinking about her i well do not you think that that that that is what journalist do all the time usually when you write a story about some one you contact them what you asked them what they think of the things that you found out i actually i i i there were times when i would have liked to have talked to her i think i even wrote up some questions that i might not i ask her but in the and we we decided that it was just too risky risky out i just remember there were going to be conditions and in and hit just made us nervous and we decided we would just publish what we had found out through many many other sources i and o and and leave it at that and that that is what we did nicholl sued with the help of a lawyer who took our case for free they went off to lofts and everyone who would helped write the article for twenty one complaints from defamation to invasion of privacy but even though she was angry with lofts nicholl read her article over and over again until something happened that she was not expecting she found herself agreeing with lofts a little it planed ta seemed doubt it did yes what was that to feel is this thing that you have been certain of for long that you felt you had resolution of with doctor cousin and seeing those tapes and then to have it be the subject of doubt again what did that due to you maybe feel very small many feel very insignificant as though my opinion on my own the events of my own life r the least important nicholls tot a changing her mind back and forth over and over some day she thought she would been abused o the days she thought she would lied about it i have to say a some one who spent months looking into lofts is article it is really hard to work out the responsible thing to think when i first read it i remember thinking game one there is no way nicholls mamma abused her but as i looked into each claim loft is mad what it seemed a nine on the convincing the scale turned out to me more a full li loft has found a report from a note psychologist who interviewed young nicholl we said she sounded mechanical and reverse when she talked about abuse loft has told me that was the evidence that impressed her most but i do not know he says quit nickel has told her story numerous times to a number of different people and she now sounds mechanical he could mean nicholls lying who he could just mean she is been ostotell it too many times and lotus intobewed nicholls hat ma'am a woman we'd been there for the custody battle she told lofts that she and nicholl's dad had tried to win custody with what she called the sexual angle loft has heard that as sinister but did she accidentally reveal that she would had an engender or did she misuse sexual angle as an unfortunate shorthand saying we one custody with the abused thing i take the burns loft has found out that nicholl has a jungle condition that makes skin peal a healing burn but there are photos of young nicholl's feet with big blisters could they be explained by a fonggis it genuinely torments me i still do not know what to think every piece of evidence seems to pinole back and forth this i went mad trying to find out the answer i thought if i read enough court documents it'd finally find the one thing that no one else had the thing that would give me certainty either way of course i did not and nicely did not either she sat every day in the suspended animation of not knowing court between two really distressing ways of seeing her past in one her mother abused er in the other her father manipulated her into lying and because she lied her innocent mother was cut out of her life and wrongly accused of abusing her child it just created this back in force that i continue to live with to day it did happen it did not happen some days i fall somewhere in between how de orienting was it to feel you had the truth and then you lost it dissenting is a good word an but it i do not think it fully captures an it goes too my identity it really goes to the heart of who i am and who i thought i was and who i think i am the most important the key memory on which i rebuilt and then rebuilt again my identity has now been called into question it is just frustrating multiplied by a million it is just frustrating there is and intangible to be gained from the process of transition from being a victim to becoming a survivor and in my case now the sudden ism an i neither i do not know and i either i i do not know nickels lord against elizabeth lofts dragged on and on over five years all the way out to the californium supreme cord in the end nicholl lost the first amendment protected lofts as journalist and nice had to pay legal fees nearly a quarter of a million dollars which she could not afford the court punished her military wages she quit the navy whilst two houses and her car was repossessed over all this she filed for bankruptcy these days instead of being stuck between believing she was abused and believing that she was it nicholl's found a third option she tries to care a little less she cannot did down the uncertainty she tries to dial down the stakes ism never going to know ism never can know and i even after all these years i think i still foot that at some point i would come to a solid decision yes or know and really really ism never going to know and that just has to be o my this much that nicollcot be certain of she ham me out a certainty about herself she found away forward she became a pilot she got two master to green in a tragedy in psychology she is now a therapist li she is wanted since she was six and she is never caught her mamma out of her life nichollsmamm has always said that she never abuse nicholl she maintains that to day and she says she did not tell miscall to lie to child protective services i mom's has seventies they live in the same state it is not an easy relationship there is a possibility that i ruined my biological mother's life there is a tremendous amount of gilt associated with that we are close fer be relatively close for a period of time and then things sort o fall apart again just as they have when was the last time ho spoke s five months ago and what was a it still it still awkward it is still very pressured if you will o she still wants very much for me to believe that she never did anything to me in and i still do not know it is it she really really hard to move past that major sort of elephant in the room do you have a to about it no is she able to accept that you might just don't no no i thinks she really wants me to believe that she did not do you think you could do you think there is anything that could change her mind no the waters are mud now there is no all never know when we hear the other nicholways know more certain about what happened to day than she was when she was sixteen she never flip to coin and piked something to believe but she landed on a certainty about want to do dot does not rest on want to believe does not matter what the evidence says she wants her mom o awkward smith aversion of the story is in her new book stop being reasonable how we really change her minds i got i a area o prove as o us say by any drumming in a manual burrier the people

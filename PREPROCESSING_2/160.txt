there just three and a half minutes after jess disconnected from nine own one a jess hears him say you will wait then who that e thrive and then she hangs up it is easy to read the statistics and still not be able to imagine what the overdose crasis looks in this country more than a hundred thousand people die from an overdue each year that means an america are now more likely to die from an overdose than from a car accident this hotline's purpose is simple and very single minded it is not to get people sober or push them into treatment it is just to keep people aline one injection or snort after another i wanted to know what it was for every one the callers and the people jess who said there will some one uses knowing they could die right there on the phone jest talks to people week after week s sometimes they just stop calling maybe it is because they are not using any more maybe it is because they are gone actual overdoses on the hot line do not hap an at often jess had no way to know what went on after she hung up that day with timber she kept answer and calls on the line tried to distract herself she says she probably walked around her yard put herself a sprite then she got a text from a pretty close front of hers i named stepped he is a dramatic he sees lot of overdoses she has him in her phone as pro he is a wood up homy a say at me all just live in a drain tikes some calls it to men you i calls which you do in hesalways did you dm at work to divan and all i forgot it i sturdy stepped works in massachusetts takes him back for this i o ya d and ever us long call i would is call in masschusets to day immediately her phone rings it is him instead of testing he wants to talk she answers he said where ass as a hold od on o remember he is a bit where is a bits is it old od i got to go get the book dial open the book northadams massachusetts the sob that left this mans shes it'll never forget hes that was me act too stepped stepped hurray the paramedic who responded to that overdose call jess took he had a lot of jobs before working in an ambulance each with a very different uniform the first was a black teashirt he was in a metal band then a sudan tie when he is in college she ran for a seat on the village council in one being a paramedic been wearing a button up with a scurry on one pocket an a badge above the other he carried his dispatch radio pretty much everywhere which is how a got the call that day am the came in s a on responsive possible overdo that is ala by to when i heard the address i was of textually close by it was right up the hill from the ambulance station basically on the same street worldly point four point five miles away i jump in how many people it was one engine company three police cruisers and so amasses we get there d and looking at the building in it is there is multiple young is within the thesis house he bangs on the door does not hear anything then he sees a little stairway runs up finds another door which is unlocked he lets himself in am hallo anybody here yo mess with the cops a by me there yelling on looking around and am i get down this hallway at the end there is the little bathroom and i find a girl lying on the ground a woman loan therm she very small and she look really young and she was blue and hows i crap why hold it why shall be know it's there and she is blue when some one's blue i know the not breathing you thought you were too late yes her my mind when immediately was at here somebody his alone she is blue on the ground and i find her pulse an it is quite slow it is liken the forties i turn to the opposite she is got a pulse the bathroom is quite small though and ism big and it is really hard to work on somebody when you cannot kneel down next to them and i put my arms under hers and i drag her into h living room down hallway to liver and at that point am the rest of my crew i brought all of our equipment upstairs they were they came up put down her back next to me if they would gotten there a few minutes later it might have been too late but now they had a chance seven's got a particular way he likes to handle over doses that he feels is easier on the people being revived because he is though about this lot if they do come to it is don't be a very strange experience some random guy leaning over you face upside down and if he just gives some one a big dose of narc it will throw them into withdrawal people sometimes wake up angry he's have a massive headache because they might not have been getting oxygen to their brain that lack of oxygen that is what he'll kill you in an over dose stepped starts by fixing that i grab the bag out mask out popped up oxygen and start to breathe for her and in the meantime i directed on of mi staffembers to draw me up at to plot or can and put a a kneel on taus i to give it inter muscularly cause i can control the dose better he has the police stand in another room while he works well because the thing is have seen people come out and valet and feel in well and when i first started ne amass i remember the police to be standing over them what did you use yelling at them is turn to think about what is that vironmen whet they wake up if it is a their r tony people in the room i will tell people the we outside stepson's kneeling over timber's head squeezing oxygen into her lungs one breath at at time then he gives her the smallest dose of nilocxon just to see how shore we act her color improves her oxen saturation comes up and she then wakes up do youremember what she said to you she looked upset upset despite all his effort but alive there is a conversation stepped sometimes has with people he is revived he does not remember were it happened with timber but often it is in the back of the ambulance where the driver cannot hear r the patient will say something he is much nicer than other amputees and in stepped will explain have been in your theses stepped the person who revived timber from her over dose he would also survived an over dose let me tell you it happen then started using drugs some time after he stopped touring with out metal bands head been straight edge then no nock all no drugs but then he went to college you a received my army an i academics had never been as thing the people that i felling with my group befriends i we all met at this the tables at wereoutside the doors and we but spoke cigarettes outside is this thing and am the guy the used to sell us are weed he was great he was to this really cools at i cave describe him he was am he would show up with a fishing tackle box full of drugs it was of many and he knew that i was i had been struggling a back a friend of the group named kelly had died recently she'd fallen off balcony really on a rocked stepson's world and he was a if i remember right he was a i try these to feel better and that was oxicotom sir drugs became part of stepson's very busy he is going to school working campus job head also on that seat on the local village council at the time they were saying i was the youngest elected official and ever happened in south florid a not that is verify bike that is what that is what people were saying about me and and here i am using drugs anytime he used in his car before talking to teeny news before bed he would lay out lines of ox for when he woke up at night and withdraw he was on my way he get back to sleep and he was getting way to skinny i used to wear eager close i take my parents that just that your on wipe i was a thing and i used to put under i conceal on my eyes to just the i have lictor of naturally dark circles under my eyes but because i had lost much weight in was sunken in they were very pronounce and i put under i concealer on before i going came with my parents oh an actual the camera would be faced backward where i had all my actualizes on the wall sirtithicat of election from the for elections and i got a letter from a congress then congratulating me on be elected and just those things behind me but on the other side of the camera my life was chaos yet stepped thanks see probably ode twice somewhere in there but luckily he came too on his own note about stopped him his family at some point had an intervention which he said you could see a mile away he walked into the room never was sitting there i no one was saying anything and he was oh i know what this is but he felt relieved to be found out he only had to go to rehab once but recovery was a long process stepped tried various jobs ran out of money went back to living with his folks they were retired in western massachusetts where he noticed they were looking for volunteer fire fires signed up and for some reason it is stock in my head in my mind in onestephen the panic an bounced even the firewater hi was ism fire render that is pretty cool eventually he became a dramatic stepson's experience with a diction is not what made saphena camber emotional for him though it was something else back when stepped was using his drugs were coming from pain cleaners known as tell tells but by the time he became a paramedic many of those had been shut down more and more people were getting drugs off the street that is when sentinel entered the scene that nolo could be fifty times stronger than heroine he was causing these cluster overdoses stepped would seethe from his ambulant he had have days we would go to five odes one after another he was saying more people die too one case stuck with him everything went wrong they were the station when he got the call and the the street address i was given well say for example that was three thirteen three one three and we get there and there is no three one three this is not that uncommon but usually some one here is the sirens and comes out says we over here and in this particular case that in happen and we u strick to go nock on doors and luck it that were on wed not out much doors and nobody ever came out and h o the thing that dispatch will trytidy is ill the to to call the person back ah repeatedly nobody answered on the call back ah and know eventually we have midnight resources the next calls are coming in we have to be on a little while later a different call comes in i call about a dead body a woman stepped hears the location and realizes this was the over dos victim from that original call in fact stepped had knocked on her very door whoever called nine one one the first time that mixed up the numbers was not three on three it was one three three something that in stepped in the cops fanned out went house to house stepped had craned his back to look in the window of the right building but he just could not see the woman who needed his help she was just out of view she was right around the corner from the from the door that i looked it ate myself i was six feet from her and when i got there she was trolly no we couldstelf saved her that was a she somebody that i had reverse in over is on in the past and stay liken a in real touch but she work to the community si see her sometimes stepped played this over and over again in his mine looking for ways it could have gone differently he understood that whoever called nine one one he were doing what they could to keep this woman alive but theywerelso scared scared that when some one stepped showed up therewould be trouble they left and in the end hit was leaving this woman alone that killed her he meant stepped could not find her that over does call solidified something for stepped with drugs getting more dangerous keeping people who used drug safe went making sure they were not left by themselves it is sometime around then that he heard about the never us alone hell line and in immediately made sense got valved to meetings stuff that that is how he met messy to get the word out where he was he made these little cards bike made this simple design on a this to plan and ism not a what design or o rat design or looks terrible but beastly as is the masters fine heres the numbers we do ah and i use my only crank car in about five thous of this he convinced programs the give out clean syringes to include these never use alone cards in their kits steppe had no idea if any of this was really working a lot of times he ad talk to drugs ears who said what i in call of some stranger tell him ism about to inject dope we kitting but a few hours before he revived timber she had gotten one of these cards bundled up wit the stuff she'd picked up it a needle exchange that was why she called that was the thing that saved her life stepped did not know that though when he dragged her out o the bath from that day and started given her rescue rests there was a self one with next to her he just did not put two and two together after timber opened her eyes stepped told her she had to go to the hospital for observation that went she had to do this walk of shame down her front steps and climb into the back of the ambulance is nearly summer but she put on her big winter coat pulled up the hood stepped started packing up before you left the scene he went to checking with his crew i they had the back doors of the alone open i stepped up into the back to to talk to them ad i it it done at me again you she was alone i said something on the lines of whoever was there with you called and left you need to tell a never a that again they need to stay with the until we get here and then she said i was not with anybody else alone i said ill that who called i an one then she said i called it of salon hotline o my god he thought when he got back to the station that is when he started testing jess and that is when an all kind of came out of him when she told me that she is the operator a started crying i could not believe it lit be sobbed on the found together out and as in my office these just a conference room thing this and i had the door closed n as tackinerson the lie crying in her an e now just s well stepped says over his time as the paramedic he pronounced made be thirty people dead from an overdose all of them were alone climber was alone too but she had the line the lined work it is rare to find something that actually protects people once their dealing with an election but when when you saved some one from an overdose it does not me they will stop using fact usually they do not the morning after stepped revived timber jess see her attack hi she wrote i am thankful you called she sent this belittle smile face and a green hardimoje we then a couple of hours kimberro back she thank jess asked how many times she got n arcane then fiber says i want to use again this morning but i terrified if you use again to day jess replied the likely to o view o doing again is almost guaranteed many arris coming out what is jess steal a a fight in a christy became parking that is in a minute colobus radio when a program continues tosmarein life my glass to day show the call story of one phone call to one telephone hot line asset after mouth kinda did keep using and kept calling the line and last time she was connected with jess which brings us to act three of our program jess again heres many arris jess is kind of the back stop for the entire hot line the whole operation if none of the other operators a available the calls automatically go to her and she prey much always picks up some times she will even give some one her cell and say just call me directly she did that with timber it she cannot help herself o i got call over i went time to visit jess at her home in georgia to watch her work e never he's alone is jess from the second i walked in she s taking calls still in her house dress and mishmashes socks the vibe was organized chaos she takes in strays seven cats one is missing an i a cholla and more chickens than she can count yo it look at our eggs what those e for your chicken a ye to the evenings wee got eating they lay their eggs in the garage i wanted to know how jess nurse ad ended up spending much of her time on this line and at some point and a pause in the conversation she said the my child has called this line before she was talking about can calends twenty three her only kin she is most magnificent creature ever met man she is also the tragedies bitch of her mean she is magnificent she is magnificent can is over dosed a dozen times in counting have you picked up the phone meets your daughter no she will let me now she would let me know that she was calling i hay mamma ism gin a call the line thanks for letting me now i do not it the a i thing i know that i could cut it all i could cut the mamma of i could keep the mamma cut off if she become unresponsive i know i could do what i have to do but what if i could watching her daughter nearly die again and again is kind of how jess came around to a whole new way of thinking and the hot line to she tried for years to force her daughter to change she wanted her to finish school she wanted her to go to rehab she wanted her to come home but wanting all that never made anything go differently it just made can push her any now for her daughter she really only has one goal it is the same goal she has for her callers do not die vessels serious about this goal and this one goal only she literally has a ta too in her forearm it is a bird taking flight it is carrying a banner in its be with a single word on it for as in i do not give a for my fucks are flying away jess told me this one story about a time can pulled up in from of the house

herself at her kitchen table i had many questions about this approach ism apparent i know how hard it is to stop wanting things for your kids stop protecting them stop pushing them toward some imagined better future the implications of abandoning that wanting we are radical to me i asked what if can never stop using drugs if if if if what she wants to dos continue to use she is be alive and healthy to do if what she wants to do is is one day kick and going in to something els she should be healthy and alive to i it i do you even see her no longer using permanently as a goal i do not mi i

bleeding she though her hands out to side she is a mummy what the funk to you wont from me and i threw my hands out on scrape back what i set a thousand times to you to day if you could just not do that would be right and that is when my hi me a that was bitterly the moment the moment my brine shifted because even sanding there bleeding i was looking at my babying she was o ki and that moment i was all the matter remember just was on her way to work when all this happened i was in my nursing uniform m going to teach i ma i teach collegiate i was going to lecture was going to stand at my podium looking my very best my very best professional nurse that i could possibly look going to teach all these baby nurses did you go to work i dad well i did what d you say the truth she told them exactly what had just happened item that fight in the parking ln gussie try to getting needles for cabin then she ordered narc she got a big box to distribute around town an inside was never use alone car just saw it an thought ho good idea good heard about never use alien one i ordered my own narc from the new york city seamen of hole you have to go to a training before they'll sennit to you the training tells you how an when re person governors and one o the power point sides mention the ho mine at the time i imagine never alone with some official thing nine one one but it is nothing that it was tried is pussy put it by bunch of drug users we are tired of watching the friends day when she first volunteered to answer calls the screening process to be an operator consisted of talking to one guy to see if ye were a fit the very same a ay she picked up her cell and got connected to some one who is about to get high as at hell he said ism train tor eats never es alone ism halls yet i guess yo did but dos i know what give not knew it needed to get his a dry's u i else cat the orbiter i but out the the if li he thought where you gan o get my from tan in one in from mason on need he is i o god he did hes a your on to let me din ism won me it seems that war right angels a help me out in the years since messes set up a whole system a script that operators can us a training regimen but this organization is still basically run on a gunlock in a prayer i hung out while jest took one call after another over two days never he's alone is jess the calls were intimate sometimes joyful one my talk to jess forsake half an hour about his life where he was going over the week and his girl friend his health you did good you drink in a i also water for ever kill a grand bodywat t aren't she take me figure that at the less ism a thought my another guy i me felt guilty for taking up vessels time he tried to have everything ready to go when he called and he apologized afterward listen he fit one for people you calling people me would not have nothing to do it'd be bored is hay i am glad you called me he told her he tapes nark hand to his arm and sits on his porch after getting high in case he passes out he hopes his neighbors ill find him there is no recovery talk sprinkled throughout these conversations were little reminders of how scary things are forth people who need this line jess gently admonished one caller who told her he would used on his own a few hours before without letting her know you care not call me ye know my heart would be broke if som happened to e i know that he says i know just just calls is to a bother even if it is a tiny amount o ki even at the tiny amount of oka you are worth at you are worth it every time ki it is notable that every one in his story as some kind of connection to addiction the people who started the hot line stepped the dramatic jess with her daughter and actually jess herself twenty years ago she would real polemist of veins i did beck in two thousand too it'd had a surgery and my daughter put me on ox thirties ism a nurse he time i called for refill of out for jess there as no rock bott om moment but after a couple o years she started running out a pills and she did not want a risked nursing license to get more she quick cold turkey spent three days sick on her bath room floor then it was over jest says her daughter can started using years later when a boy friend introduced her to heroine jess wonders about why a lot everyone has a why jess says clan's why she thinks sort had to do with her there pa circular er mother daughter relationship jess can be a hard ask clan too when cabin got pregnant at fifteen jess thought plan's boy friend was bad news she blocked him his family from calling clan sell clan was pissed she threatened to move out one morning jess told her to go ahead and do it she did than each other every once a while but he was not the same o it found that has a grandmother through a take's message when i had ben at the hospital for two days with her while she was in labor but she sent me home in said it'll be fin tat when something sorts happen in n me i found out the baby was here through it takes message not hard it hard because it is you go back nearly dunno what should we have done i do not go back in heavy y for grass i did the best i could with what i had at the time s all gat yemen when it became overtly obvious the i was really not down to best that i was making things worse but twee between me and her because we were always incredibly close n when i realize ore have your look in this of you got a find a different way you would got to do something else because his try here is not working over the years vessels watched kali go back and forth shelve months of sobriety then returned to use kale's been picked up by the copse had her photo posted on the local police department's casebook page while i was visiting jess called kali up kale said she would come by the talk but she never showed i think kale's part of why jess take many of these never along calls people her daughter on the other end she told me as much i did more to that this whole thing is about this whole kier every every every slogan dangle is that her not don about her no don hen about her nor home no done and then about her no homeland there home he is done and now it is about the entire almost when jess to that call from timber listen to her o d on the line she knew better than to expect that moment to change timber's life and the next day when timber thank jess for saving her and then quickly followed that up with i want o use again it did not surprised jess in fact for jess this was good news it meant she could encourage timber to keep using the line and it was an invitation sandtact she did she friend timber on casebook taxed her for no reason a few months after her od timber started calling jess mamma but timber would also drift away when she did that

there was the shut case she just luged home from re had and then she got really really sick after stepped forced her to go to the hospital she checked herself out within an hour and walked home puking along side of the road she picked up more drugs pretty much right away the whole idea of never use clone's approach is that as jess puts it you give the callers time one more day to fight their demons and timber had a lot of demons she says her parents both use drugs ut she was seven teen her brother was killed by a drug dealer the whole family can crumbled after that timber included timber wen her re have on and off for years she was a tunnadrugs realized things were getting a little out of control and checking for a couple of weeks to spindly as she put it she get clean enough to go back to

could not lay in the bed it was cold they had the easy blasting it was summer time course it you see's on but you you were going through which also you are cold and i could not lay in the because they give you these thin blankets i wit in the bath room where there is a heat or thing in there and laid on the floor and they dark me out they would not let me stay in the bath room the you cannot lay in here and then i waited for them to leave and i went into t that room the only thing that fell good was i stripped down naked it was a really small bathers was tile floors i had to throw my clothes out of the door back into my room and just lay on the tile and i had the blanket over i the heating then and i just had the he on there but like the coolness on my back and in the he on mi got it was the

she checked in she sent jess that text from a new hon i feel come in a stable enough place right now to reach out and let a back timber wrote tentatively jess said everything that you have been through has prepared you for to day you have not been wasting time you have been getting ready it'll support you however you need me to every step in the way for timber it is been a year of big changes she is in a new town but she still does not really trust herself round her old crowd it is interesting how this one call brought these three people together stepped told me when ye first met jess hey did not really each other too similar maybe but the call boat them somehow and timber right after that call she avoided stepped even though we kept reaching out she was embarrassed he lived in her town knew all the police she said she got to this point where she knew other people were sick of her basket because she was sick of her pulse that passed eventually timber to a trip with

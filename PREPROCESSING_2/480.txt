welcome to the superman japonicas the of science science pace to r i m indurhubermen and am a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an a in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens an treason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which a vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element dock calm slash huberement today's episode of the hubourman lad podcast is our forth and final episode in this month which is all about skills and athletic performance now in a previous episode we talked about science based in particular nerve science base tools for accelerating fatless previous to that we talked about ways to improve skill learning motor movements which also included things music and piano playing not just athletic performance and we have also been exploring other aspects of physical performance throughout the entire month to day i want to talked about something that is vitally important for not just athletic performance but for your entire life and indeed for your longevity and that is muscle now many of you when you hear the word muscle think muscle growth and building big muscles and while we will touch on muscle hypertrophy muscle growth to day and science base protocols to enhance hypertrophy we will mainly be talking about muscle as it relates to the nervous system and i cannot emphasize this enough the whole reason why you have a brain is that you can move and one of the things that is exquisite and fantastic about the human brain is that it can direct all sorts of different kinds of movement different speeds of movement movement of different durations we can train our musculature to lift heavier and heavier objects or we can train our musculature to take us further and further called endurance we can also build smoothies smoothness of movement souse me smoothness of movement as well as speed of movement suppleness of movement all of that is governed by the relationship between the nervous system neurons and their connections to muscle when you hear the science of muscle and muscle hypertrophy you might think ah well ism not interesting building muscle but muscle does many critical things it is important for movement it is important for metabolism the more muscle you have and not just muscle size but the quality of muscle that is a real thing the higher your metabolism is and indeed the healthier you are it turns out that jumping ability and ability to stand up quickly and to get up off the floor quickly is one of the most predictive markers of aging and biological aging and no surprise that is governed by the brain to muscle connection in addition muscle and musculature is vital for posture and we do not talk about posture enough we all have been told we need to sit up straight or stand up straight but posture is vitally important for how the rest of our body works it is vital to how we breathe its actually even vital to how alert or sleepy we are we are going to talk about the musculature for posture we also go no to talk about muscle as it relates to esthetic things now these are all linked muscle for metabolism movement poster and esthetics of course are like right as our poster changes ore aesthetic changes as ore poster an esthetic changes how we move changes and as we improve muscle quality whether not that is increasing muscle size or not that changes the way that our entire system not just our nervous system and our muscular system but our immune system and the other organs of the body work to day as always we are going to talk a little bit of mechanism ism going to explain how neurons control muscle and then we are going to look at muscle metabolism how muscle uses energy i promise to make all of this very simple ism actually going to keep it very brief probably about ten minutes total and by the end of that ten minutes you will understand a lot about the narrow muscular connection how your brain and nervous system control your muscle and how those muscles work then we are going to talk about how muscles use energy and can change how they use energy for sake of getting stronger if you for also increasing the size called hypertrophy of muscle and for improving endurance as well as for improving posture and how you move generally we will touch on some nutritional themes and how that relates to muscle particular a specific monoacid that if it is available in your bloodstream frequently enough and at sufficient levels can help you build and improve the quality of muscle and we will talk about specific exercise regimes as well as of course supplementation and things that can enhance narrow muscular performance over all we are also going to talk about recovery recovery as everybody knows is when things improve that is when neurons get better at controlling muscle that is when muscle grows that is when muscle gets more flexible none of that actually happens during training it happens after training and there is a lot of confusion about how to optimize recovery and how to measure whether not you are recovered and ready to come back in for another narrow muscular training session swell talk about that is well today is going to have a lot of protocols and you are goal come away with a lot of understanding about how you move how you work and these incredible organs that we call the nervous system and the musculature the called narrow muscular system before we dive into to day's topic i want to just take about three minutes and cover some essential summary of the previous episode in the previous episode we talked about fat loss talked about shiver induced fat loss we talked about neat non exercise activity through agenesis for increasing colonic burn and fat oxidation and we talked about how to use cold specifically to enhance fat loss i describe to protocol in vow sing getting into cold of some sort whether not ice bath cold shower some form of cold could e be a river or an ocean if you have access to that and inducing shiver and then getting out not crossing yourarms are huddling but allowing that cold to evaporate off you and continuing to shiver and then getting back into the colder environment of water or stream or shower et camera all of that is described in a beautifully illustrated protocol that i did not illustrate that is why it is beautifully illustrated at the cold plunge dot calm they have made that protocol for you and they have made it available free of charge for you there is no obligation there of any kind financially you can go to the coal plunge stop cam there is a little habits has protocols and you can download that protocol someone there i do not know who exactly illustrated it and you can come away with a periapt of what i described in the previous episodes i just want to make sure that you are ware of that resource the other announcement it'd to make is that many of you have asked how you can help support the podcast and there is a very straightforward zero crossway to do that and that is to subscribe to are you to channel if you go to you tube if you are not already there watching this now hits the subscribe button that helps us tremendously to get the word out more broadly about the podcast and we thank you for your support most people when they hear the word muscle they just think about strength but of course muscles are involved in everything that we do they e involved in speaking they're involved in sitting and standing up they are involved in lifting objects including ourselves they are absolutely essential for maintaining how we breathe they are absolutely essential for ambulation for moving and for skills of any kind when we think about muscle we do not just wane to think about muscle the meat that is muscle but what controls that muscle and no surprise what controls muscle is the nervous system the nervous system does that through three main nodes of control areas of control and have talked about these before on a previous podcast i will keep this very brief basically we have upper motor neurons in our motor quarter sons are in our in our skull and those are involved in deliberate movement if i decide that ism going to pick my pen up and put it down which is what ism doing right now my upper motor neurons were involved in generating that movement those upper motor neurons send signals down to my spinal cord where there are two categories of neurons one are the lower motor neurons and those lower motor neurons send little wires that we call acts on out to our muscles and cause those muscles to contract they do that by dumping chemicals on to the muscle in fact the chemical is a redo coaling have talked before about used coming in the brain which is vitally important for focus and actually can gait narrow plasticity the brains ability to change in response to experience but in the her muscular system a redo coming released for m motor neurons is the way the only way that muscles can contract now there is another category of neurons in the spinal cord called central pattern generators or c p gs and those involved in rhythmic movements any time we are walking or doing something where we do not have to think about it to do it deliberately is just happening reflexively that central pattern generators and motor neurons any time we are doing something deliberately that the top down control as we call it from the upper motor neurons comes in and takes control of that system it is really simple you have only got three ingredients you got the upper motor irons the lower motor neurons and for rhythmic movements that are reflexive you have also got the central pattern generators it is a terrifically simple system at that level but what we are going to focus on to day is how that system can control muscle in ways that make that system better now when i say better i want to be very specific if your goal is to build larger muscles there is a way to use your nervous system to trigger hypertrophy to increase the size of those muscles and it is indeed controlled by the nervous system you can forget the idea that the muscles have memory or that muscles grow in response to something that is just happening within the muscle it is the nerve muscle connection that actually creates hypertrophy it'll talk exactly about how to optimize that process in addition if you want to improve endurance or improve flexibility or suppleness or explosiveness that is all accomplished by the way that the nervous system engages muscles specifically and what that means is we have to ask ourselves are we going to take control of the upper motor neurons the central pattern generators or the lower motor nerds or all three in order to get to some en point of how the nervous system controls muscle hero physiology one o one ill give you one piece of history because it is important to know sharrington who won the hobo prize called movement the final common path why did he say that well the whole reason for having a nervous system the whole reason for having a brain is that we can control our movements in very dedicated ways that is one of the reasons perhaps the predominant reason why the human brain is large you might think of it is large for thinking and for creativity ah no when you look at the amount of real estate in the brain that is devoted to different aspects of life it is mainly vision are ability to see and movement are ability to engage in lots of different kinds of movements slow movements vast movements explosive et camera other animals do not have that ability because they do not have they mental real estate they do not have the neural real estate in their brain they have her muscular junctions they have central pattern generators what they do not have are these incredible upper motor irons that a direct activity the muscles in very specific ways we can all feel blest that we have this system and to lamina teach you how to use that system toward particular end points if we decide that we are going to direct our muscles and some particular movement of any kind whether not it is a weight lifting exercise or when it is a yoga movement or simply picking up and putting down a pen we are engaging flexes and extensors and our body is covered with flexors an extensors all over for instance our bicep is a flexed an our triceps is an extensor those are what are called antagonistic muscles they move the limbs in opposite directions if you bring your wrist closer to your shoulder that is flexion using your bicep if you move your wrist further away from your shoulder that is extension using your triceps and without getting into a lot of detail the way that the nerves and brain or wired up to muscle make it sech that when a flexed is activated when the nerve dumps chemical asked calling on to the muscle to activate the biceps the triceps is inhibited its prevented from engaging there was to by pass this but that is the typical mode of action the converse is also true when our triceps is inactivated one when we to our wrist away from our shoulder our bicep is inhibited and we have flexes our abdominal muscles and we have extenders in our lower back and many of you probably know this but some of you probably do not that your spine has flexes to move basically your chin toward your waist and it has those are your abdominal muscles among others and you have extenders that move your chin basically back alike looking up toward the ceiling in those are your extensors you have other muscles that are stabilizing muscles and things of that sort but those movements of flexion and extension in the fact that they are what we call recypically enervated or mutual inanition you hear different language around this is characteristic of of most of our limb movements ones hamstring and quadriceps the hamstring brings the ankle closer back towards the gluten basically its lifting your heel up right which is almost always done toward the back whereas your quadriceps is the extensor opposite to the hamstrings you get the idea there is flexors an extensors and its the neurons that control those flexors and extensors that allow us to move in particular ways now you have heard a nor muscular physiology in its simplest form but i do want this to be excessive i want to get just briefly just briefly into some of the underlying metabolism of how muscles use an create energy because in doing that we will be in a great position to understand all the tools that follow about how to optimize the her muscular system for your particular rolls in the previous episode about fat loss we talked about like politics the break down of fat into fattyacids it can be used as fuel and it ended in a step where we got a t p which is the bottle neck and final common path for all energy producing functions in the body there are other ways but basically i t p is the k element there now with muscles they do not function on fats normally what they are going to function on there ability to move and there ability to do things and allow us to move in any way that we want to is based on a process of glycolysis the break down of things glycogen and glucose into energy and it is a very simple process you do not have to know any chemistry if i say the words carbon or hydrogen or something that do not free out you'oflhave to understand any chemistry but basically what happens is you have got this available sugar resource that stored in muscle o k and that is glucose and that glucose has six carbons and six and six waters basically that can be broken down into two sets of three carbons art base you take glucose and you break it into these two little batches of carbons that we call private six doff by two is three get three and three pirates and that generates a little bit of e t p of energy but just a little bit now if there is oxygen available o k if there is sufficient oxygen there what can happen is that private can be brought to the mitochondria and through a whole set of things that you probably do not want to here about right now the electron transport chain and citric acid cycle what happens is it is broken down and you get twenty eight to thirty i t p which is a lot of e t p the only things you need to know the only things you need to know about this process is that glucose and glycogen are broken down into private you little bit of energy from that and when i say energy i mean the ability to move it is fuel literally just gets burned up but if there is oxygen available and that is key then within the might o conduit you can create twenty eight to thirty i t p which is a lot of e t p now what dies this mean this means that movement of muscle is metabolically expensive and indeed compared to other tissues compared to fat compared to bone compared to almost all other tissues except brain tissue muscle is the most metabolically demanding which is why people who have more muscle relative to tapes tissue to fat they can eat more and there more of a furnace they just kind of burn that up o k even if you did not understand anything that i just said what you probably did here and that i hope you heard is that if you have oxygen around you can create energy from this feel source that we call glycogen and glucose but what if there is an oxygen around and what is that well you have experience that ism not talking about oxygen in the environment ism talking about oxygen in the muscle if you have ever carried a box while moving or you are carrying heavy groceries to the car or you ere exercising particularly hard and you felt the burn well that burning which most people think is lactic acid is actually process by which private which as i said before normally could be convert into a t p if there is oxygen well if there is not enough oxygen cause that muscles working too hard or too long what ends up happening is that a hydrogen molecule comes in there and you get something call lactate believe ore not humans do not make lactic acid that is another species we make lactate and y u we think and we here that lactate is bad we need to buffer the burn or you now avoid the burn that lactic acid and lactate are what prevent us for performing as well as we ought to be able to or for going as far as we possibly could in an endurance event gets what that is not true at all lactate has three functions all of which are really interesting and really important first of all it is a buffer against acidity you do not want muscle to get to acidic because it cannot function you do not want anybody tissue to get to acidic that burn that you feel is acidity in that environment that and lactate what most people call lactic acid but again we do not make lactic acid lactate is there to buffer that to reduce the amount of burn most people have this exactly backward when you feel that burn that is not lactic acid that is lactate that is present to suppress the burn to suppress acidity it is also a fuel when you feel that burn lactate is shuttle to those areas of the muscle and there is an actual fuel burning process where in the absence of oxygen you con continue to generate muscular contractions now this is informative cause it also tells us that that burning that acidity that we feel can inhibit the way that our muscles work but that lactate comes in and allows our muscles to continue to function we will talk a litlebit more about what this whole lactate thing and the burn means but it is a really important process and it is amazing to me that most people understand it in exactly the incorrect way they think galactic acid is bad and the burn is bad no it reveals a number of really important things are going on with this it vital molecule lactate which can reduce acidity reduce the burn as well as act is a fuel now here is where it gets really really cool and if you do not have enough of an incentive to exercise based on all the information out thereabout how it will make you live longer and make your hart better et camera here is a reason that regardless of what kind of exercise you do if it is weight training or running or cycling or swimming that every once in a while about ten per cent of the time you should exercise to the point of intensity where you start to feel that called burn right the reason for that is that lactate shows up to the sight of the burn to speak and it acts as a hormonal signal for other organs of the body in a very positive way ski as you may recall from a verily early episode of the huborman ladpodcast i talked about what a hormone is and how it works with lots of different kinds of hormones but hormones are chemicals that are released in one location in the body and travel have have effects on lots of other organs of the body when i say that lactate acts as a hormonal signal what i mean is that it is in a position to influence tissues that are outside of the muscle and basically it can send signals to the heart to the liver and to the brain and it can have effects on the heart the liver and the brain that are very positive case just as fume out for a second i promise we will not get any more technical than this we will get into tools and protocols that are really straightforward but what i telling you is that if you feel a burn from a particular exercise or movement that burn is going to be buffered by this molecule we call lactate lactate will then provide additional fuel for additional work this is a good incentive provide you can do it safely to quoting duo work through the burn you are that burn is a a acts as a beacon to the lactate which comes in and allows you to do more work it is not a signal to stop necessarily man stop if you are doing something unsafe but it is a signal that lactate should come in and allow you to continue to do work and it can act as a hormonal signal lactate can then travel to the heart and to the liver and to the brain and can enhance their function in positive ways not just in those moments but in the period of time that follows many people are curious about how they can exercise to make their brain better that is one of the most common questions i get what ism telling you is that provided you can do it safely by engaging the called burn which is at a different threshold for everybody right your your hill run will be different in my hill run to generate the burn but provided you can do that for about ten per cent of your work outs or of an individual work out or activity of any kind you are generating the activity of this lactate based hormonal signal that can improve the function of neurons and it does that if you want to know for the effysionatos by improving the function of another cell type call the asterisks which are a leal cell type a which are very involved in clearance of debris from the brain there involved in the formation of snaps is connections between neurons in the brain put simply if you are an exerciser if your doing movement of any kind and your interested in allocating some of that movement toward enhancing brain heart and liver health there is a nice set of scientific data that points to the fact that getting lactate shuttle to the muscles by engaging this burning sensation is advantageous for the health of those other tissues as i mention that burn is present from lack of oxygen being present and then the hydrogen comes in you get this lactate but this process of lactate acting as if buffer a fuel and a positive hormonal signal for other tissues occurs only if there's oxygen if you feel the burn you definitely want to focus on your breathing at that point that would be the time to take deep inhales and try and bring more oxygen into your system it is deafly not a time to hold your breath and if ever you have run to the point of feeling the burn and than you ere exercise in any way on the treadmill or on the biker whatever and felt that burn and the you held your breath it feels much more intense by breathing you bring lactate to the site and you are able to alow lactate to act more as a buffer a fuel and a hormonal signal and the reason i brought this up to day is because as i mention many people are interested in using exercise notjust forsake of improving physical health and well being and performance but also for enhancing their brain and there are a lot of data out there speaking to the findings that exercise of various kinds can increase autogenesis the creation of new neurons well the unfortunate news is that while that is true in mice there is very little evidence for enhance neurogenesis from exercise or otherwise in humans there is a little bit and there are few cases within the brains such as the dentate gyros of the hippocampus which may be involved in the formation of new memories to be clear the dentil gyros is defile involved in the formation of new memories whether not the new neurons that are added there in humans is are involved in new memories is the evidence for that is weak at best frankly whereas en animals that the date are quite strong but most of the data point to the fact that hormonal signals things that are transported in the blood during exercise are what are benefit beneficial for the brain excuse me and that those signals are not causing the increase in the number of neurons in the dent gyros or otherwise that it is more about the health of the connections between the neurons growth factors of various kinds things beef one is e long list of these things if you have heard the exercise increases the number of neurons in your brain hell that is not true and that probably is a good thing frankly because we always here more neurons more neurons as if it is a good thing but the brain does not do well with bringing in entirely new elements it has a hard time negotiating that in making use of those new elements we know about this from things the cochlear implant where deaf people are given a device where they suddenly can hear some people really that deaf people really that in can benefit from it other r deaf people find that it is very intrusive that it is hard to take a an existing nerd circuit in the brain and incorporate a lot of new information into it new means as great as that sounds corner on mornerons it actually might not be the best way for the nervous system to change and modify itself and to promote its own longevity when i tell you a not such great evidence from a neuron's past puberty that is what the data really show in humans and i have knock back the data on exercise in neurogenesis do not let that depress you if you have dimension your family do not do not make that a do not translate that into a a necessarily that you will develop dimension understand the exercises still beneficial for the brain and other aspects of the nervous system but that it is going to be doing it through these hormonal signals things beef one things this lactate pathway a when you experience the burn from exercise and again you do not want to try and get this feeling of a burn throughout the entire epos a episode of exercise they'll be far to intense and would inhibit your recovery and only be good for performance either it is only about ten percent of your total effort in any one exercise bout that is on to give you this positive effect now how to devote a small portion of your exercise ten percent in order for muscle and lactate to benefit other tissues namely your heart your liver and your brain i now to shift our attention to how to use specific aspects of muscular contraction to improve muscle hypertrophy muscle growth as well as improving muscle strength there are lot or reasons to want to get stronger and i should just mention that it is not always the case that getting stronger involves muscles getting bigger there are ways for muscles to get stronger without getting bigger however increasing the size of a muscle almost inevitably increases the strength of that muscle at least to some degree reasons why most every one should want to get their muscle stronger is that muscles are generally getting progressively weaker across the life span when i say getting stronger it is not necessarily about being able to move increasing mounts of weight in the him although if that is your goal what ism about to discuss will be relevant to that but rather to offset some of the normal decline in strength and posture and the ability to generate a large range of movement safely that occurs as we age mention the beginning the episode we just tend to lose function in this nerd muscular system as we get older and doing things to offset that has been shown again and again to be beneficial for the her muscular system for protection of injury for enhancing the strength of bones and bone density that a lot of reasons to use resistance exercise they that extend far beyond just the desire to increase muscle size because i know many of you are interested n increasing muscle size but many of you are not t there is an important principle of muscle physiology call the hangman size principle and the hangman size principle essentially says that we recruit what are called motor units motor units are just the connections between nerve and muscle from a in a pattern that staircases from low threshold to high threshold what this means is when you pick up something that is light you're going to use the minimum amount of nerve to muscle energy in order to move that thing likewise when you pick up an object that is heavy your going to use the minimum amount of nerve to muscle connectivity and energy in order to move that object it is basically a conservation of energy principle now if you continue to exert effort of movement what will happen is you will tend to recruit more and more motor units with time and that process of recruiting more neurons more lower motor neurons as if you recall from the beginning of the episode these lower motors are in our spinal cord and the actually dump a a chemical suitable in a muscle cause the muscles to contract as you recruit more and more of these motor units these connections between these lower motor irons and muscle that is when you start to get changes in the muscle that is when you open the gait for the potential for the muscles to get stronger and to get larger if that is what your goal is and the way this process works has been badly misunderstood in the kind of online literature of weight training and body building and even in sports physiology the hangman size principle is kind of a a foundational principle within muscle physiology but many people have come to interpret it by saying that the wait to recruit high threshold motor units the ones that are hard to get to is to just use heavy weights and that is actually not the case as we will talk about the research supports that weights in a very large range of sort of a percentage of your maximum anywhere from thirty to eighty per cent weights that are not very light but are moderately light too heavy can cause changes in the connections between nerve and muscle that lead to muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy put differently heavy wights can help build muscle and strength but they are not required what one has to do is adhere to a certain number of parameters just a couple of key variables that it'll spell out for you and if you do that you can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy muscle size and or muscle strength if that is what you want to do and you do not necessarily have to use heavy weights in order to do that now ism sure the power lifters and the the people that to move heavy weights around we will say no if you want to get strong you abs lately have to live heavy weights and that might be true if you want to get very strong but for most people who are interested in supporting there muscular such that they offset any age related decline in strength or in increasing hypertrophy and and strength to some degree there really is not a need to lie about the hangman size principle which many people out there are doing and claiming that you absolutely need to use the heaviest weights possible in order to build strength and muscle som when explain all how all of this works an simple terms first of all serious talk about what hypertrophy is and what strength changes in the muscle are we can make this very simple as well if this were a muscle physiology class we would talk all about a mile fibrils and sarcoma's and all that off we are not going to do that that is not the purpose of to day's conversation ut if you are interested in that as well as a lot of the other information that i am going to discuss in more detail i highly encourage you to check out the ut channel from and the writings of a doctor and happen he is a pig and a full professor and exercise physiology he is extremely knowledgeable in this entire area of science base tools for hypertrophy how strength and hypertrophy really work his lab does everything from biopsy on muscles working with athletes and typical folks as well a lot of the information that you are coin hear from me in the next fifteen minutes or comes from a an extensive ta exploration of the work that he and his colleagues have done as well as of folks brad shown field another academic whose superb in this whole space of muscle physiology and from a lengthy conversation that i had with with and t doctor happen prior to this episode if we want to think about muscle hypertrophy we have to ask what is changing when muscles get larger or stronger and there are really just three ways that muscles can be stimulated to change let us review those three ways and talk about what happens inside the muscle there are three major stimuli for changing the way that muscle works and making muscles stronger larger or better income way and those are stress tension and damage those three things do not necessarily all have to be present but stress of some kind has to exist something has to be different in the way that the nerve communicates with the muscle and the way that the muscle contracts are performs that makes the muscle need to change this is very reminiscent of enrol plasticity in the brain something needs to happen certain chemicals need to be present certain processes need to happen or else a tissue simply will not change itself but if those processes and events do happen then the tissue has essentially no option except but to change muscles move as i mention because nerves dump chemical on to the muscles but they move because they have these things called niacin and act in filaments and if you want to read up on this you can a you not you can look on the internet you can put the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction if you really want to go deep down that rabbit hole it is interesting you can learn about this in a muscle physiology class but basically along the length of the muscle ye have what is called main and just think of man as it is a kind of a wire it is it is a it is a bunch of beads and wires that extend across the muscle i think that is the simplest way to describe it and the main is rounded by these little beads called actin the way muscles get bigger is that basically the main gets thicker it is a proline right and it gets thicker that put this in your mind if you are listening to this or even if you are watching it on you to the way to think about this whole act in main thing and muscles getting bigger is imagine that you are holding a bouquet of balloons a bunch of balloons by their strings except you are not holding the strings all at their bottom the bouquet is not nicely arranged is not some balloons that are all up at the top in your holding the strings down at the bottom imagine that one of the balloons the is very close to your hand another one is lie it higher up and this bouquet is very disorganized in other words the string extending out of your hand the strings rather extending out of your hand are all different lengths and the balloons are all over the place that is essentially what main looks in the muscle and those strings are what we call the filaments and then the main head that that is the balloon when you stress a muscle properly or you give it sufficient tension or you damage the muscle just enough there is an adapt of response that takes place where propene is synthesized and it is a very specific proline it is main the myosin gets thicker in other words the balloons get thicker the way to think about muscle growth and the way to think about muscles getting stronger is that those balloons get bigger and the muscle gets thicker now the question then should be as always how does that happen i mean the muscle does not really know anything about what is happening in the outside world the way it happens is the nerve the neuron has to tell the muscle to get stronger and it does that through a sea what we call signalling cascade it talks to the muscle in terms of chemicals it does not whisper to tor shout of hey get bigger whet it does it release a certain chemicals that within the muscle there are certain chemicals released rather that make those balloons as ism referring to them the main get thicker let us talk about the stimulus for doing that and if already in your mind your imagining o my goodness these balloons of muscle can get thick thick thick thick thick and netstrest can o spiral out of control do not worry about that people invest a ton of time and energy into trying to make their muscles larger it is aching much harder for people to do than you might think but i do want to give one exception because it illustrates and important principle of where we are headed next everybody has in balances in how muscles can grow how well muscles can grow or how poorly or how challenging it is for their muscles to grow now many people who are afraid of getting too bulky for instance are afraid of lifting weights but i think the research shows now that every one of pretty much every age should be doing some sort of resistance exercise even if that is body weight exercises in order to offset this age related to cline in muscle contractile ability muscle strength et camera improve bone density there is nothing good about getting frail and weak over time and people who invest the effort in to doing resistance exercise of of some kind whether not with bands or with weights or with body weight really benefit tremendously at a whole body level at a systemic level as well as in terms of muscle strength there is a good prefecture of how well or how efficient you will be in building the strength and or if you the size of a given muscle and it has everything to do with those upper motor nor on that are involved in deliberate control of muscle you can actually do this test right now you can just kind of march across your body mentally and see whether or not you can independently contract any or all of your muscles for instance if you are sitting in a chair or ah your standing see whether not you can contract your calf muscle just using those upper motor nor on sending a signal down in deliberately isolating the calf muscle of if you can contract the calf muscle hard to the point where that muscle almost feels like get trying to cramp it it hurts just a little bit it might not can be extremely painful worse it can have no sensation whatsoever chances are you have very good upper motor nor on to calf control and chances are if you can isolate that what they call that brain or mind muscle connection and you can contract the muscles to the point where it cramps a little bit that you hold a decent to high potential to change the strength and the size of that muscle if you train it properly now f you've a hard time doing that chances are you will not be able to do that if for instance you focus on your your a back muscle we all have these muscles called the teach the leticimis dorky muscles which basically are involved in chin up some things that but their function from a from it more ovicanesiology standpoint is to move the elbow back behind the body odds it is not about flexing your bicibits about moving your elbow back behind your body if you can do that mentally or you can do that physical movement of moving your elbow back behind your body and you can contract that muscle hard chances are that you have the capacity to enhance this strength end or size of that particular muscle because you have the curl control of that muscle this is a key feature of the curl m muscular system to appreciate as we begin to talk more about specific protocols because everything about muscle hypertrophy about stimulating muscle growth is about generating isolated contractions about challenging specific muscles in a very unnatural way if you whereas with strength it is about using musculature as a system moving weights moving resistance moving the body the specific goal of hypertrophy is to isolate specific nerve to muscle pathways that you stimulate the chemical and signaling transduction events in muscles that those muscles respond by getting larger there is a critical distinction terms of getting stronger verses trying to get muscles to be larger hypertrophy jersey and it has to do with how much you isolate those muscles muscle isolation is not a natural phenomenon it is not something that we normally do when we walk we do not think woke a right calf contract left calf contract no you just generate those rhythmic movements and of course there is no reason for them to get stronger or larger response to those movements butts a you were to do a constringe experiment of attaching thirty pound weights to your ankles and you were to do those movements well if you were not specifically contracting your calves in each step there is no reasons for the calves to take on the bulk of the work and you would distribute that work across your hypflexerers and other aspects of your musculature your whole nervous system seeks to gain efficiency it seeks to spread out the effort you can nest this as a principle for yourself which is if you want to get stronger it is really about moving progressively greater loads or increasing the amount of weight that you move whereas if your specifically interested in generating hypertrophy it is all about trying to generate those really hard almost painful localize contractions of muscle now of course how much weight you use in order to generate those contractions will also impact hypertrophy but i think most people do not really understand the mind muscle connection it sounds a great thing but it is actually one of the things you want to avoid if your goal is simply to become more supple or to become stronger you want to do the movements properly and safely of course but it is the opposite of hypertrophy wherewith hypertrophy your really trying to make that particular muscle sometimes two muscles do the majority if not all the work whereas in moving force loads in try to generate activity of any kind lifting a bar or doing a chin up or something those call compound movements in solve a lot of muscle groups if there if your goal is to be better at those you want to avoid isolating and any one particular muscle now i know this probably comes across as a kind of a of a obvious do especially to the u folks of spentalot of time in the him aimed at a getting hypertrophy but i think most people do not appreciate that it is the nerve to muscle connections and the distinction between isolating nerve to muscle connections verses distributing the work of nerve to muscle connections that is vital in determining whether or not you generate hypertrophy isolated nerve to muscle contractions verses strength and offsetting strength loss which would be distributed nerve to muscle connections if ever there was an area of practical science that was very confused very controversial and almost combative at times it would be this issue of how best to train i suppose the only thing that is o even more barbed wire of a conversation than that is how best to eat for health though seem to be the the a two most common areas of of on line battle and the scientific literature has a lot to say about both of those things again my sources of for what ism about to tell you are professor andigalpin and colleagues i know the other excellent people out there in the field but i really trust his work he does very controlled studies spent a lot of time in the space and what is really exciting is that in just the last three years or s been a tremendous amount of information to come out about the practical steps that one can take in order to maximize the benefits of resistance exercise of any kind ism going to talk about those and ism going to talk about the research i will provide some links both to a couple of the more depth a tutorials from of doctor gain as well as some of the papers that the information am about to tell you stems from there is a lot of information saying that you need to move weights that are eighty to ninety per center one maximum or seventy per cent or cycle that for three weeks on and then go to more moderate waits there there a lot of paths as o as some people say there a lot at weighs to ad up numbers to get a hundred in there is a near infinite number of ways to ad up different numbers to get to a hundred and what is very clear now from all the literature that is transpired and specially from the literature in this last three years is that once roughly your one repetition maximum the the maximum amount of weight that you can perform and exercise with for one repetition in good form full full range of motion that it is very clear that moving weights or using bands or using bodyweight for instance in the thirty to eighty per cent of one maximum that is going to be the most beneficial range in terms a muscle hypertrophy and strengths a muscle growth and strength and there will be a bias if your moving weights that are in the seventy five per cent eighty per cent range or may been going above that eighty five and ninety per cent you are going to bias your improvements towards strength gains this is true and if you use weights that are in the thirty per cent of your one repetition maximum or forty per cent or fifty per cent and doing many more repetitions of course then you are rising towards hypertrophy and what some people to call muscle endurance but that is a little bit of a complicated term because endurance we almost always think of as relating to running or swimming or some long bouts of activity thirty to eighty per cent of one repetition maxims it does not really seem to matter forsake of hypertrophy except at the far ends when your really trying to buy us for strength now it is is clear however that one needs to perform those sets to failure where you cannot perform another repetition in good form again or near to failure an there is all sorts of interesting coming cloture that is popping up all over the internet some of which is scientific some of which is not scientific about how you are supposed to perceive how close you were to failure et camera but there some very interesting principles that relate to how the nerves connect to the muscles that strongly predict whether are not this exercise that your performing will be beneficial for you or not here is how it goes for individuals that are untrained meaning they have been doing resistance exercise for anywhere for zero probably out to about two years although for some people it might be zeroth one year but that those are the called beginners there serve untrained for those people the key perimeter seems to be to perform enough sets of a given exercise per muscle per weak the same is also true for people thathave been training for one or two years or more what differs is how many sets to perform depending on whether not your trained or entrain let say you are somebody who is been doing some resistance exercise kind of on and off over the years and you decide you want to get serious about that for sake of sport are offsetting eight related declines in strength the range of sets to do in order to improve straight to activate these cascades in the muscle ranges anywhere from two believe it are not to twenty per weak again these are sets per weak and they do not necessarily all have to be performed in the same weight training session will talk about numbers of sessions it appears that five sets per weak in this thirty per cent to eighty percent of the one repetition maximum range getting close to failure or occasionally actually going to to old muscular failure which is not really full musculafaily but the inability to generate a contraction of the muscle move the weight in good form it'll go deeper into that moment but about five sets per weak is what is require just to maintain your muscles think about that if you are somebody use kind of averse to resistance training you are going to lose muscle case and straight your metabolism will drop your posture will get worse everything in in the context of nerve to muscle connectivity will get worse over time unless you are generating five sets or more of this thirty per cent to eighty per cent of your one repetition maximum per weak what this means is for the typical person who has done a t a weight training you need to do at least five sets our muscle group now that is just to maintain and then there is this huge range that goes all the way up to fifteen and in some case twenty sets per weak now how many sets you perform is going to depend on the intensity of the work that you perform this is where it gets a little bit controversial but i think nowadays most people agree and doctor gawped confirmed that tend per cent not to be confused with the ten per cent a we discussed earlier but ten per cent of the sets of a given a work out or ten percent of work outs over all should be of the high intensity sort where one is actually working to muscular failure now i say not true muscular failure because in theory you have a concentric movement which is the kind of lifting of the weight and then you have the eccentric portion of muscle contraction which is the lowering and eccentric movements because of the way that muscle fibers lengthen and that sliding act in myosin that we talked about before you're always stronger in lowering something than you are in lifting it but the point being that most of your training most of your sets should be not to failure and the reason for that is it allows you to do more volume of work without fatiguing the nervous system into pleading the nerve to muscle connection in ways that are detrimental we can make this simple perform anywhere from five to fifteen sets of resistance exercise per weak and that is per muscle and that in this thirty to eighty per cent of what your one repetition maximum that seems to be the the most scientifically supported way of off setting any decline in muscle strength if you are working the kind of five set range and in increasing muscle strength when you start to get up into the ten and fifteen set range now the caviar to that is everyone varies and muscles vary in terms of their recovered ability depending on how well you can control the contraction of muscles deliberately and you can actually figure that out by sort of marching you might take five minutes and just kind of march across your body and mentally trying control the contractions of muscles in a very deliberate way to the point where you can generate a hard contraction and you may have to move a limb in order to do this by the way ism not talking about just mentally can you ore contracting your biceps without moving your wrist ism toying about doing that without any weight in hand or any band or any resistance if you can generate a high intensity contraction using these upper motor on to motor lower motorcar on pathways to muscle you might think well i should perform many more sets right but actually the opposite is true if you can generate high intensity muscular contractions using your brain using your neurons it will take fewer sets in order to stimulate the muscle to maintain it self and to stimulate the muscle in order to grow or get star longer the more efficient you are in recruiting motor units re member henchman size principle the recruitment of more motor units which is not just muscles it is nerve to muscle connections the better you are at doing that the more you will recruit these called high threshold motor units the ones that are hard to get to the more you will kick off the cascades of things within muscle that stimulate muscle growth and strength if you have muscles that are challenging to contract it is going to take more sets in order to stimulate the desired effect in those muscles not fewer of if you have muscles that you are very good at generating force within it is going to take fewer sets now how many sets you are going to have to determine that it is going to depend for those of you that are using fifty per cent of your one repetition maximum because your doing a lot of repetitions you might find that three or four five sets will maintain the muscle you might decide to do that once at one point in the week and then do it again rights of you are going for ten sets a week you can divide that among two sessions you can do that all in one section the data really show it does not matter there are some differences in terms of whether not your trying to generate maximum intensity within a work out or wither not you want to spread that out but in general resistance work outs of any kind tend to be best favored by work outs that are somewhere between forty five minutes and sixty minutes and generally not longer than sixty minutes because that when all the a things coatis all in some of the inflammatory pathways really start to a create a situation in the muscle and in the body that is not great for you it is not a hard and fast rule that the ax does not drop at sixty minutes but it is pretty clear that performing this five to fifteen sets per week whether not in one work out or whats divided up across multiple work outs is really what is can be mouse beneficial and please do keep in mind hennamans a size principle and the recruitment of motor units and remember the better you are at contracting particular muscles in isolating those muscles the fewer sets likely you need to do in order to get the desired effect now what about people who have been training for a while if you are somebody who is been doing weight training for a while the data point to the fact that more volume can be beneficial even for muscles that you are very efficient at contracting now the the curve on this the graft on this begins again at about five sets per week for maintaining a given muscle group and extends all the way out to twenty five or thirty sets per week however there are individuals who for whatever reason can generate much force there good at training muscles that they can generate much force in just four or six or eight sets that doing this large volume of work is actually going to be counterproductive everyone needs to figure out for themselves first of all how often you are willing to do resistance exercise of any kind and again it does not matter if you're using bands or weights or bodyweight for instance on you are doing chin ups chances are unless you are very strong that you are not using weights you are just using something that you can hold on tour if you are doing push ups some of you will be working in that thirty to eighty per cent of your one repetition maximum range it does not necessarily mean that you have to be moving weights in a him for instance that the purpose here is to figure out what muscles you are trying to train that is an issue that will talk abut in a moment and then it does appear that somewhere between five and fifteen sets per week is going to be what the thing that is cannot work from most people now this is based on a tremendous amount of work that was done by any gaining colleagues bread showing field and colleagues and others a a mike robots that there is a huge group of people out there doing exercise physiology and a small subset of them that are linking them back to real world protocols that do not just pertain to athlete that is mainly what ism focussing on to day and surely there will be exception now if you are going to divide the sets a cross the week you are not going to do all ten sets for instance for a given muscle group in one session then of course it is imperative that the muscles recover in between sessions and we are going to talk about recovery both at the systemic level the whole nervous system and at the local level the nerve to muscle and local even muscle level will talk about that in about ten minutes we talk about recovery i do want to mention something very important which is that everything ism referring to here it has to do with full range of motion oke and you might ask well what about the speeds of movements this is actually turns out to be a really interesting data set for generating explosiveness and speed for sprinters or throwing sports or for people that want to generate a lot of jumping power it does appear that learning to move weights as fast as you safely can especially under moderate to heavy loads can increase explosiveness and speed and most of that of fact is from changes in the anurans it is not from changes in the muscle it is from changes in the weigh that the upper motor anurans communicate with the lower motor anurans and generating a pathway a nerd circuit as we call it that is very efficient at generating action potentials which are the electricity with in grants to trigger the muscle now of course there are events that happen from nerve to muscle but that take away from that enormous literature frankly is that if you want to get faster yes it can be beneficial to get stronger but if you want to dedicate resistance training specifically to jumping higher to running faster to throwing further and these sorts of things that learning to generate force with increasing speed is going to be beneficial on the flip side of that for people that want to get stronger it appears that the slowing down of the weight as things get harder is a key perimeter in recruiting those high threshold motor unites slew me phrase that obit differently think about a set in the him or think about a set of push ups are a set of pull ups initially you can move very fast if you if you want o generate hypertrophy the goal really is not nearly to move superslow but to isolate the muscle therefor not to use momentum rather than lift weights as they say challenge muscles if you want to get stronger you're going to be distributing that effort over more muscles and more of your nervous system for generating explosiveness and speed it is very clear that learning to generate forces quickly and to move heavy or moderately have loads quickly it is going to be beneficial because of the way that you train the motor anurans end of course changes in the muscle but this could look different for different sports and obviously you want to make safety paramount if you are injured you are not can to be able to train at all for sport or for any purpose that is and what this would involve is something sixty to seventy five percent of one repetition maximum and then in a controlled way moving that as quickly as one can throughout the entire set and certainly not going to failure because as you approach failure the inability to move the weight with good form the weight inevitably slows down in fact there are a lot of new technologies now that or focus on informing people of how quickly the bar or weight is moving i saw an advertisement for this the other day there are a things that people can attached to bars that will literally speak to you as you are doing a set and inform you whether not you are moving a four times more slowly a per rep than you were at the beginning and try to loan in on the exact speed of movement in talking to these experts prior to this episode it does appear that for sake of hypertrophy as long as you are not moving the muscle quickly that you start to distribute the effort to lots of other muscles it does not really matter because as the the set gets harder the motor units that you recruit will increase the number of neurons that you recruit in the number of muscle fibers and prove these high threshold muscle fibrous will increase and it is really only for purposes of hypertrophy that you really need to be concerned about how quickly the weight is slowing down however if you are trying to get faster more explosive in generate more speed and jumping power throwing power things of that sort you never really want to use a weight or get to a portion of the set where you are moving the bar very very slowly and ism sure as i say that some of the exercise physiologist in advance trainers out there will come after me with pitch forts which is fine it'd love to see the literature that shows that low gear slow movements with very have weights can indeed improve a explosiveness and that may in fact be the case but the data that i was able to access a was essential as i describe just a moment ago as you are probably trying to realize you need to customize a resistance practice for your particular needs in goals and i certainly am not the first to suggest that people periodic their training that they do things from anywhere from one month to six months and to see how it o is and to make modifications as they go because the nervous system in particular the her muscular system changes very quickly at the beginning of training in fact some of the changes that one can see when they first a embrace hey r start of resistance training can be very remarkable but they tend to slow over time we have talked about a few principles the fact that you need to get sufficient volume you need at least five sets to maintaining you probably need about ten sets per muscle group in order to improve muscle that moving weights of moderate to a moderately have weight quickly is going to be best for explosiveness that isolating muscles and really contracting muscles hard something the you can test by just when you are outside the training section seem wit the night can cramp the muscle hard will really a will tell you your capacity to improve hypertrophy or to engage strengthchanges in that muscle that your ability to contract a muscle hard is inversely related to the number sets that you should do in order to isolate and stimulate that muscle and there are some other things that can enhance the whole process of building nerve to muscle connections making the more efficient and generating if you more strength and hypertrophy one of them i loath to say a i was told is in between set contractions the other name for this is the people in the him does typically seem to be guides in the him fleeing their muscles in between sets and indeed the research supports the fact that contractions of about thirty second in between the actual work sets they are not going to favor better performance on the work sets if anything they are going to compromise them but those hard contractions in between its for a variety of reasons related to local muscle metabolism as well as what we talked about before which are stress tension in damage they seem to improve stress tension an damage and the nerve to muscle contraction in ways that facilitate hypertrophy in other words you see that person fleeting in between sets in the him provided that there really isolating that muscle and provided it is one that they ought to be improving not one of these people that always kips daytime of people the a were highly asymmetric although that is up to them that process of fleeting in between sets does seem to improve the nerve to muscle connection and enhance hypertrophy and i say it was loath to say it because you car nowadays with phones it seems a the end of every set includes a self that sort of the eleventh rap of every set i to joke at seems very few people are capable of actually going into the him and doing a work out without taking picture themselves which i think is is fine if that is your thing a although i must say that the the athletes that i know and even the recreational athletes that i know who seem to get the most out of their training and who also seem to get the most out of other aspects of their life seem to be able to control their phone behavior both in the gem and outside of the gem but that is more of an editorial a point there in an earlier episode i talked about estrogen and testosterone and during that discussion i talked about the use of resistance exercise specifically for increasing testosterone both in men and in women and indeed that is a powerful effect of resistance exercise and indeed it is mediated by the nerve to muscle connections we talked about that in that earlier episode i just one o briefly mention that protocol since is distinctly different from the other protocols have talked about to day the protocols have talked about today thus far of explosive movements or of hypertext based training provided the training is sixty minutes or less will cause increases in term testosterone that is been shown over and over again and if the session extends too long past seventy five minutes and is of sufficiently high intensity chances are testosterone levels will tart to drop and cortical levels will go up in ways that can be detrimental to recovery and the goals of the training but that is different then training that specifically geared toward increasing testosterone don can french whose one of the directors of the use performance center when he was a graduate student at university connecticut stores did some beautiful work he and his colleagues found the ideal training protocols for stimulating testosterone release which is something that many people want to do for variety of reasons and that involved doing six sets of ten repetitions even if it requires lightening the weight on one set to the next with about two minutes a hundred and twenty seconds rest and between sets which if you think about it is pretty short rest and is pretty darn hard work now what is interesting is that there is a very limited threshold for increasing testosterone that protocol of six sets of ten repetitions led to these big increases and serum testosterone but if people did ten sets of ten just four more repetitions per set than testosterone did not increase in fact you got more of this catabolic quartisal pathway you get other benefits from this for call ten sets of ten protocol but not the testosterone increase and may be even reductions in testosterone now is important to point out that that six sets of ten was done with big compound movements things squats or dead lav sort chirrups a things of that sort and those were done as single sessions not in concert with a bunch of other exercise although if athletes are doing that there is no reason why they sounded also do other types of training elsewhere in the week i askedtuncan about this hen he mention that that done twice a week is probably the maximum amount that anyone could do that and still maintain this increase in testosterone it is a very interesting protocol because as the negro scientist it it is amazing to me that six sets of ten repetitions with something causes best only souse me causes a distinctly different result in terms of hormone output than ten sets of ten of the exact same movement and it speaks to the in exquisite way in which nerve to muscle connections dictate the whole physiology of your entire system if there is a theme that i really want to bring forward to day is that weight training or resistance training of any kind is really used for either systemic effects right ten percent of training done where your feeling that burn which means lactate will be present and sending signals to your brain and your heart went your liver that are beneficial or isolating muscles which may also generate a kind of a a lactate or a which is associate with the burn result but that isolation of muscles distinctly different systemic verses isolated those of the two general ways in which resistance training can be applied i just wine to mention that earlier protocol because it is well supported by the literature if you were to incorporate that protocol you might ask where then can you do any other weight training during the week and sure of course you can provided your recovering let us talk about how if your recovering how if a muscle is recovered and how if your whole system is recovered because recovery is what dictates whether not you can come back and do more work of a different kind meaning how you do a leg training one day can you in should you come back and do upper body training the next day and it dictates whether not you will see any improvement from session to session at all before i talk about recovery i just want to make sure i nail down the details that i was able to extract from the literature and from my conversation with doctor gain if you are wondering how quickly to perform repetitions forsake of hypertrophy or strengthgains anywhere from a half a second per repetition all the way up to eight seconds per repetition it does not seem to matter again if your thing about explosiveness or building speed or your specifically use in resistance training to build endurance that is a separate matter we talked about explosiveness in speed it'll talk about endurance in a few moments we also talked about in between set contractions called self effect of people flexing a particular muscle isolating a particular muscle between sets stone ta mention that would be a terrible thing to do if your goal is performance on sets moving a particular mount of weight that is actually going to diminish the amount of weight that you can move it is going to enhance muscle growth in it is going to enhance the nerve to muscle isolation of that particular pathway again that flexing between sets is going to favor hypertrophy not performance if your trying to get stronger you are trying to move more weights your thing to distribute work and you are trying to do may be skill training with resistance then flexing between sets is absolutely the wrong thing to do for obvious reasons your fatiguing the muscle further just remaining still or walking around a low bit has been shown to be beneficial in terms of moving some of the lactate out of the muscle as well as just red veering between sets now how long to recover between sets the question for the testosterone protocol done conferencing colleagues found that it was about two minutes keeping that really on the clock two minutes not longer for hypertrophy and for strength gains it does seem that resting anywhere from two minutes or even three or four even five or six minutes can be beneficial and if your interested in expanding the volume of work that you can do in a given section at high capacity at high in tensity with a given weight plea see the episode that i did on cold and performance about supercharging performance which is based on the work of my college crag heller in the build you department t stamford which talks about palmer cooling of e you can cool the core of the body best through the palms using these a particular venous portals that are only present in the in your hands people are now doing this with ice packs or with jail packs their number of different ways one can do this i talk all about that in that episode it allows you to do more repetitions and more work at a given weight over time rather than getting ten repetitions and then eight and than seven and and six through proper use of palmer cooling one can do ten ten ten ten and even ad sets that is one way that one can accomplish higher volume work without having to drop the weight considerably that is where you can hit that really sweet spot if that is your goal of getting strong and generating some hypertrophy because as soon as you have to drop to lower to lighter weights souse me then you are shifting more towards hypertrophy and endurance and less board strength if been given muscle check out that episode the last thing besides between set contractions and whether not your distributing work or whether not your really trying to isolate muscles is this notion of are exhausting muscles it is been shown over and over again that for instance if you want to generate force and a given muscle and really isolate that doing the isolation work before a compound movement this would be ah leg extensions the thing where you sit and you extend your your toes up toward the ceiling leg extensions before squats will allow the squats to forget that muscle group more effectively and that makes perfectly good sense based on the hangman size principle and fatiguing motor units it should be obvious why that is the case but of course that is going to be anti performance in terms of how much weight you can lift and maybe even the form that you can maintain when you move to the bigger compound movement you really have to ask yourself a number of questions how good are you at isolating a given muscle therefore how many sets to you want to do how often are you willing to train therefore how many sets are you going to do in a given session verses how many are you going to distribute across the week are you aiming for performance are you going to distribute that work a cross the nervous system an musculature are you trying to move weights are you trying to challenge muscles if you've trying to challenge muscles then you really want a focus on things this preexhausting the isolation of a muscle before the compound movement your performance on compound movements will absolutely suffer but your ability to isolate that muscle and generate hypertrophy through the accumulation of larger maids in those bigger balloons will benefit and once again if you are trying to get faster then the speed of the movement really matters how do we know if we have recovered how can we test recovery and this is not just recovery from resistance training this is recovery from running recovery from swimming up until now have been talking about resistance training more or less in a vacuum i have an oven touched on the fact that many people are running and their doing resistance training or their swimming and their doing resistance training it is not simply the case that if a given muscle is fatigued you can just work other muscles because even if you beautifully isolated a muscle let say you have incredible abilities to isolate just your quadriceps for instance and you do a work out where you isolate your quadriceps you do your success of intense work or may be use palmer cooling in your able to do twelve sets of intense work and you are done and that muscle group the next day is certainly not in to be recovered unless your somebody whose extraordinary t recovery or you are enhancing your recovery through chemical means which will talk about at the end well you can access systemic recovery meaning your nervous system and your nervous systems ability to generate force both distributed an isolated through three main tests and fortunately these tests are very simple and two of them are essentially zero costs require no equipment h are tartrate variability has made its way finally into the forefront of exercise physiology and even in to the popular discussion have talked about each are before how when we exhale our tartrate slows down because of the way that our diaphragm's connected to our heart and to our brain and the way our brain is connected to our heart souse me when we inhale our tartrate speeds up and that is the basis of tartrate variability tartrate variability is good it means that your breathing properly and when i say it is good it means you want a lot of tartrate variability you do not want a heart heart rate that is high or low consistently over time that might come as a bit of surprise for you endurance athletes who probably are trying to accomplish your endurance work with at a steady cadence really hit that nice sweet spot where your breathing rhythmically your tartrates going rhythmically you in that steady tartrate and then away from exercise you have a nice low tartrate as they say well nice low tartrate is not necessarily always nice turns out that introducing bouts of increasing your tartrate during exercise and even through your waking day through stress full events even is provided their brief is beneficial a good nerve to heart system benefits from being able to increase tartrate and decrease tartrate tartrate variability is good you do not want high tartrate you do not want low tartrate all the time but tartrate variability is difficult for a lot of people to measure there are some devices that will allow you to do that various a watch is is an and devices there r more devices becoming available all the time hopefully soon some that are integrated with your phone that involve no contact or anything on your body but those do ere carry some cost and they are not perfect yet the measures of tartrate variability that one can use while in movement are still in the phase i would say of technology development where every one is not using them let us leave it at that there are two measures however whether not you recovered that you can use first thing in the mourning when you wake up may be after five ten minutes if you but ideally rite when you wake up in order to less how well recovered you are and therefore whether r not you should train your whole system at all that day the first one is grip strength grip strength the ability to generate force at the level of squeezing the fist or squeezing down on something might seem kind of a trivial way to assess recovery but it is not because it relates to your ability to use your upper motor nor on to control your lower motor nor on and to generate isolated force as that is really what your assessing when you do that some people will use a one of these u grip tools or that a there is a costello has this toy that shape a doughnut a and it is this hard rubber and have tried this before if have been working really hard not sleeping very well or have been training a lot any one or commination of those things my grip suffers i cannot actually squeeze that thing down as much as i cant costello because he was born with a you n a twenty four inch back and you nays never touch to weight a somehow he can just clamp down on that thing and it just he can turn into a pancake with ease and he likes to chuckle while i struggle with this thing but on a good day i can squeeze this thing that i eliminate the whole in the doughnut to speak you can also take a floor weight and excuse me a floor scale and squeeze the scale and see how much force you can generate i would do that as a base line to establish what you can do when you are well rested and then if you do that in the morning you can see whether or not your able to generate the same amount of force or you could use over the rubber donut or something a lot of this is very subjective with the scale your really trying to assess whether not you can generate the same amount of force if you start seeing a ten per cent or twenty per cent certainly reduction in that that is concerning it means that your system that your nervous system as a whole it is not necessarily fatigued it is that the pathways from nerve to muscle are still in the process of rewiring themselves in order to generate force and you might think well i train one muscle group one day why am i having a hard time doing this for completely different muscle group does not make any sense but there is something about the upper motor or on to lower motor nor on pathway generally that allows you to use something grip strength as a kind of a a thermometer if you will of your ability recover look for your ability to generate force in grip when you first wake up it is not can be as good as it is at the on three p m after a cup of coffee and and a couple meals but that the point is not performance over all the point is to assess whether not your getting better worse or the same from day to day the other one that astrally terrific and the and alpines group is using and ism delighted about this because it relates to somethingthat my labs very excited about as well is carbonado i tolerance this is a really interesting tool that endurance athletes strength athletes i think can all benefit from in fact athletes and people of all kinds you even if you are not an athlete even ore not exercising it all is a god question of whether not your system as a whole is doing o ka or not we rely on the thermometer do we have a fever or not we rely on subjective things youknow do i feel good or not and my digesting well or not those are all subjective the carbonado i tolerance test is it is objective in that it measures your capacity to engage the call part sympathetic arm of your nervous system which is the calming the aspect of your nervous system and it measures your ability to consciously control a particular skeleton muscle which is your diaphragm here is how you do the carbonado i tolerance test you wake up in the morning you have t use the restaurum first do that but try and stay away from your phone trying if you have yourphone put on airplane mode go to the timer or use a hand watch or some other way of measuring time stay off social media for just a few seconds it will be of and what you are going to do as you are going to inhale through your nose as deeply as you can you do this lying down a sitting whatever inhale through you nose and then exile all the way that is one your going repeat that for times of inhale exile inhale exile inhale exile inhale exile for times and ideally you are inhaling through the nose and your exiling through the mouth that is just the beginning of this carmodax i tolerance test then you take a fifth inhale as deep as you can through your nose fill your lungs as much as you can and if you can try and expand you a make your stomach go out while you do that that means that your diaphragm is really engaged you are inhaling as much as you possibly can then hit the timer and your goal is to release that air as slowly as possible through your mouth it looks you have a tiny tiny little straw on your mouth and your letting it go as slowly as you possibly can measure what we call the carbondoxide blow off time or discarded rate i know you can all sit with lung's empty after you eliminate all that air but do not lie to yourself do not stop the timer when you have been sitting with your lungs empty for while stop the timer when you are finally no longer able to exhale any more air skate fort you do inhale exile inhale exile inhale exile inhale exile slowly i just set it quickly for sake of time then you do this fifth big inhale through your mouth and then and ism not going to do it come for the full deration and then your measuring that time your carbonado idea discard rate will be somewhere between one second and presumably two minutes two minutes would be a heroic carbonado idea discard time thirty seconds would be more typical twenty seconds would be fast if your carbonado idea discard time is twenty or twenty five seconds or less you are not necessarily recovered from your previous days activities there is was to push through this but hold on to that thought for a moment if your carbonado idea discard time is somewhere between about thirty seconds and sixty seconds you are in what we would call kind of the the green zone where you are in a position to do more physical work and if your carbonado idea discard time is somewhere between sixty five and a hundred and twenty seconds well then you have almost certainly recovered your nervous system ism not going bout the individual muscles but your nervous system is prepared to do more work and aides lab has great date on this as it relates to exercise physiology i think that story should be out in the not to distant future my lab has been using carbonado i discard time to look at anxiety and recovery from bouts of anxiety to totally independent projects but using the same measure you have got eight a v which requiresome to a technology usually you have got grip strength which a you can access subjectively or you can use a a floor scale and now you have carbonado idea tolerance you want to do this in the morning when you wake up and keep track just right down in low book or may be just keep tracking your mind of your carbonado idea discard time if you find that your discard times are dropping even if there in the forty second range or fifty second range but normally you can do seventy five seconds or a hundred and twenty seconds if they are starting to drop by anywhere from fifteen to twenty per cent your veering in the direction of not recovering and i i really keen on this tool because everybody has different recovery abilities some people are eating really well in sleeping really well some people have minimal stress or can buffer stress really well other people a they dissolve into a puddle of tears if they read one ten message that is troubling ere whatever you known i realize and i say that was sympathy i realized people have varying levels of stress and demand in their life is just in possible to to prescribe an entire protocol says locate yes you should train to day and this is exactly what you should do know you should not use carbonado idea discarnate because a it is valuable it is informative be it is zero cost and see it is something you can tract objectively over time and that is really the key and i just should it'd be remiss if i did not say that what carbonado idea discard rate is tapping into is your ability to mechanically c control your diaphragm certainly that is one aspect of it but that relates in a very direct way to your ability to put the break on your stress system to engage the called para sympathetic or calming arm of your autonomic nervous system and another thing that and galopans group is testing is at the offset of training after your run after your weight training session maybe even after your cliometrics session we don't really talk about about jumping and throwing in that sort of thing a may will talk about it in a future episode but they and other groups including some lead athletes another groups that are very interested in physical performance are using a tool where they deliberately disengage for five minutes at the end of training they deliberately engage this calming or para sympathetic arm of the nervous system and you can do that through any number of different tools ism a big fan of respiration tools cause they are always available to you your breathing is always there i talk about some of these tools in previous episodes but you could use things nonslip deep rest and a stare at the end of a training session you could do ten physiological size double inhales through the nose followed by long exhales that will definitely engage the para sympathetic nervous system at the end of training rather than finish your training session and then just hop onto your phone serious athletes and people who are serious about recovery initiate that recovery at the very end of their training and they start to kickstart that train that recovery process rather and they measure so to tolerance in the morning there several groups that are doing that in fact i know several groups because ism working with them that are using physiological size between sets in order to recover their nervous system and maintain nerve to muscle contractibility maintain focus throughout their training session enhance their focus by doing a few physiological size to double inhale expel in between sets they are getting very focus very intents about their strength work or explosiveness work or muscle isolation work during their sets and then in between sets there deliberately disengaging the nervous system and then their reengaging it again i just want to emphasize that recovery is a complex process it is got a lot of things but the so too tolerant sessiould be a valuable tool now another tool for recovery that people are very excited about is the use of cold and the ice bath and this is important if you are somebody who uses cold through called shower or ice bath or jumping in a lake or a river whatever it is that use to generate cold as a recovery tool you should be aware that there are data starting to emerge that if your goal is recovery or strength improvement using cold within the four hours following a work out anus ma out palmer cooligomtime about whole body cooling or cooling from the knockdown yes it will reduce inflammation yes it will reduce the amount of delayed on set muscle soreness one redoubt of how intense or damaging a given work out w is not the only read out but it does seem to interfere with some of the things more pathways the mammalian target o rapamisin pathway and other pathways related to an inflammation that promote muscle repair remember and muscle growth remember stress tension and damage or the stimulus for nerve to muscle connections to change in for muscles to get bigger stronger and better and if you are getting into the ice bath after training or taking a really could shower after doing resistance training you are likely short circuiting the improvements that you are train to create now athletes who are trying to recover quickly that they can get back into more training sessions or let say you're somebody who does not really want to gain much straight or hypertrophy and your mainly focused on endurance and you want to do more endurance work and you've been wait training will tent exposing yourself to cold can be beneficial but you are not going to get as great of benefits from the resistance training in other words cold after resistance training seems to short circuit some of the benefits of that resistance training there are some other things that can short circuit the benefits of resistance training as well one of those it is antihistamines som interesting data ere published recently i believe it was in scientific reports yes that show that antihistemeans can prevent some of the benefits of cartevascular exercise of endurance type work is a running swimming of fairly long duration or even sprint type work as well as inhibit some of the processes associated with resistance training remember resistance training or endurance training that is a stimulus for stress and the adaptation to that stress is how you get better that you can run further fast a lift more a wait a hypertrophy the muscle et camera antihistomeans can be a problem obviously do not compromise your ability to breathe completely but antihistomeans generally work by blocking what are called mast sells and they as t mast cells are really interesting cells that will talk about in our month on burro in mine function they travel in the blood stream in their these will packets that burst open at sits of inflammation muscle damage and inflammation is a signal that something needs to change and taking intohistmeans it amperes can disrupt some of that inflammatory process you hassle want inflammation during and immediately after a work out than you want to bring inflammation down later and it'll mention how to do that the other thing are nonsteroidal anti in inflammatory drugs their trade names these are pain killers that many people take those as have mentioned in a previous episode can interfere with the benefits of endurance training and the benefits of resistance training in addition to that they block pain signals and pain is a very good signal that you might be doing something wrong and while nobody likes to be in pain i suppose er probably few people out their to be in pain with its in different story but nobody likes to be in pain the nonsteroidal anti inflammatories the ends as they are called the antihistomeans seem to prevent a lot of the gains the improvements in in during strength and size that people are specifically using exercise for be cautious about your use of nonserite anytime inflammatory drugs especially within the four hours preceding or the four hours following exercise i hope you's trying to get the picture in order to change the nerve to muscle inactivity in ways that will better serve you you need a stressed during the actual training which particular stressed depends on your training gulls but that stressed is almost always going to be associate with inflammation and then after the training you want to try and get into a state of reduced inflammation and that is why you would do some some sort of protocol nonslip depressed which we will long to an caption or perhaps you would use the hypnosis a that we have talked about before revery are e the e r my dot cam there is a great a a for accessing deep rest states or the physiological side to train get the system your system to calm down after training there are also tools that one can use to reduce inflammation and a kind of foundational level away from training and these are tools that have talked about many times before a but it'll just restate them again the kind of golden three according to and gain and the ones that he recommends are sufficient omagathrees again that can be coldish through diet through whole food intake or through supplementation or both in general getting above a thousand telegrams of opiate pray to keep inflammation a low or relatively low item indeed and in some cases magnesium palate magnesium palate seems to be particularly effective in offsetting delayed on set muscle soreness soreness itself is not required for improvements in strength in movements in explosiveness improvements in hypertrophy that is a myth now if you do experience to laid on set muscle soreness chances are you stressed that particular muscle pretty well or even may be too well may be istresseded too much and you need longer recovery there is a total debate out there about whether not you should train again when a muscle still sore i think the general take away is know that means it is not recovered and there are things of course massage fatal release and things of that sore sand cold that can perhaps accelerate a the movement from soreness to not sore but in general the omagathry vitamin dead magnesium marinate that maleate excuse me trio seem to be in effective way to reduce inflammation and kind of a systemic level but remember you want inflammation provided you are not damaging the muscle much that you are injured during the training session because that is the stimulus for change in those muscles i want to talk about a few other things that support the process of nerve to muscle communication and touch on some of the things that a lot of people are doing to train convince enhance their workout and evaluate whether not those are in fact enhancing workouts or not because weight training unlike a lot of other forms of exercise has a unique aspect to it which is this feature that i guess some people call it the pomp which is the fact that blood goes into the muscle when you train it is the only kind of training where you actually get a window into what the result might actually look before you actually accomplish that result f you thing about me go out for a hard run and let say you you out for a a two mile run let say your goal is to break a you want to a subteen two mile actually when i went to university a i was running cross country my seniorear high school and i wanted to walk on for the cross country team and i went out there and turned out you had to do a subteen two mile and a i think the best mile i ever ran in high school was a for fifty seven which is not terrible i cannot do that now it's not even close to what a high schoolathletes the best i schoolaphletes can do now but that would have mean meant doing it back to back as subteen minute two mile even come close until costellof this story the other day and hegusgon laughed at me was why would you even want a run two miles because costello is built almost exclusively of these type to fast twitch muscles their design for moving objects he is incredibly strong he has been since he was a poppy i mean that dog could probably drag a tractor if he wanted to but he cannot really go far whereas a greyhound or a whip it or some of these other sitehounds or senthounds can gigolo they have a her percent of the called slow twitch a muscle fibers they are much better at endurance a subteen two mile would have been very very challenging no chance i couldhave done that i do not think even even with a lot of training but lets say that you want to improve your performance in a given type of exercise let us talk about some of the things that seem to work across the board to improve strength improve hypertrophy and improve nerve to muscle communication and performance the first thing that is absolutely key for nerve to muscle communication and physical performance of any kind might not sound that exciting to you but it is very exciting and that is salt nerves nerve cells neurons communicate with each other and communicate with muscle by electricity but that electricity is generated by particular ions moving into an out of the neuron and the rushing in of a particular ion sodium salt is what allows nerve cells to fire if you do not have enough salt in your system your neurons and your brain and your nerve to muscle communication will be terrible if you have sufficient salt it will be excellent how much salt will depend on how much water your drinking how much cafenior drinking and how much food you are investing and whether not your taking any dramatics how hot it is et camera how much your sweating you want to make sure that you have enough salt potassium and magnesium in your system if you want to perform well i realize that salt is not a very glamorous a performance tool but it is vital it is absolutely vital and the endurance aft least in the people that train in high heat can a speak to the fact that when your electrolytes are low your brain does not function your body does not function nearly as well in fact even for mental work for studying and for writing and for doing math and coding doing analytic work of any kind even a hard conversation that is important to you having sufficient electrolytes is really in a help and being low an electrolytes will not help and just drinking water will not help because you need electrolytes the other thing that been shown over and over again numerous well controlled studies to improve muscle performance is creatine early on there is a lot of controversy about creatine but there are many studies if you want you can go to this website that everyone now knows i love which is this free website examined out come that there are no fewer than eighteen studies there a sixty six studies also eighteen studies supporting that muscle creating content can be increased by ingesting creatine how much creatine while i asked the experts and they tell me that for somebody who is about a hundred and eighty pounds five grams a day should be sufficient or heavier than a hundred d eighties if you get you're two hundred twenty pound or two an y three pound person ten to fifteen grams of creatine people lighter than a hundred an eighty pounds may be three to five grams approving excuse me creatine or even one to three grams creatine is a fuel source at for early early in bouts of activity for high intensity activity it is also a fuel source for neurons in the brain and it can have some cognitive enhancing effects creatine is very interesting molecule early on when it was released as a supplement it was a it was thought that you had to load it in higher dosages for a few days and then maintain it an at a lower dosages you take the on twenty or thirty grams a day than back off to five or ten it does not seem to be the case that you can get all the benefits from taking the dosages at the low level i just mention a few moments ago as they relate to bodyweight throughout salt and electrolytes absolutely die you need those present need to be well hydrated creatine seems to have a performance enhancing effect the sixty six studies sixty six showing that power output is greatly increased anywhere from twelve to twenty per cent and this is sprinting and running and jumping as well as weight lifting by creatine the ability to a hydrate your body is improved by cretin because of the way that it brings more a water in to cells of various kinds as an indirect of fact it can helping increase lean mass because of the way that it brings more water into muscle and probably also because of the way that if you get stronger you can generate more force in generate more hypertrophy it reduces fatigue seven studies have shown that reduces fatigue there even some interesting effects on improving cognition after dramatic brain injury although that is a serious medical condition and situations you absolutely should talk to a board certified physician before add in anything exon taking anything out of your current regiment ah there are few other effects that are interesting and notable am but the big ones are the ones that i refer to before about increase power output et camera and i just one o emphicise that cretin can increase this hormone that we talked about in the testosterone episode dihydrotestastrone which a is testosterone converted by five you for reduction to a hydrotestastrone its the more dominant androgen in humans leads to increases in strength and libido and forth it also can increase male pattern baldness some people not everybody experience some hair loss with creatine other people do not some people experience accelerated beard growth because basely ease has the opposite effect on heirpolicals on the face as it does on the scalp some people do not women ah who invest creatine there are essentially no data showing that it it increases hair loss or facial hair growth am but of course every one is different you can go to examined out calm you can explore those studies creatine definitely a powerful performance enhancing molecule the other one a one that a person have never tried but that seems to have a very strong and well supported effects a is data allege now data adenine is interesting because when you hear about weight training you thing about heavy dead lifts and bench presses all that kind of stuff the people are doing but data alleging seems to support exerciseive that is of slightly longer duration a a mix of anaerobic and aerobic tight movement things these are physical performance in the sixty to two hundred and forty second range you can use your mind and configure out you know things that weights of the am that limit you to eight to fifteen repetitions carry of vascular exercise of the sort rowing or sprinting interval work it seems to help with that kind of work were not time about long runs were not on about heavy deadliest the standard dose is somewhere between two and five grams again as always check with a doctor makes sure these things are safe for you ism not responsible for your health you are i do not say that just protect me i say that also to protect you but it really seems to improve muscular endurance improve anerobic running capacity reduce fatigue there even some interesting effects on reduction of body fat and improvements in lean mass creatine data adenine electrolytes these are of the the course three things that seem to improve performance in are well supported by the scientific literature and in the earlier episode on supercharging performance we talked about palmer cooling that is certainly a performance enhancing tool s nothing you invest your cooling your palms in a very specific way that is very powerful now what about for longer duration about of exercise wee mainly been focusing on resistance training but what about for long runs long swims these kinds of things well it does seem that beat juice and investing things argentine and citrine can improve performance for those long bouts of exercise that is mainly going to be due to of facts of those compounds on vest dilation it is going to open up the vascular and allow more blood flow do note that things citrine and argentine can have some a side effects if you will a they can increase the likelihood of having a harpy's cold sore outbreaks on the mouth the argentine is in the pathway by which i o not people north's but the hurt these virus lives on neurons of the trigeminal nerves that enervate the lips and the eyes a and the mucus membranes of the face this is the here's type one simplex virus that virus lives on those neurons and then periodically inflames those neurons and that what leads to the cold sort seems argentine and citrine can lead to increases in cold sores and canker sores and outbreaks of those kinds you want to be aware of that a that is not everybody but and not everybody is curcarrying a acts we one a just be aware that i think it is now eighty or ninety per cent of people a by time they are twelve years old their conthey'e contracted ago we want its very contagious a antipicallypable yet one outbreak and then only under conditions of stress or heightened argentine or ceturaline injection will have them later a again this is the this is not a a necessarily a sexually a nest this is a a sexually transmit infection this is can infection that is pass very easily from mucus membranes just in terms of touching objects an things of that sort very common in in the general population any discussion about muscle and muscle performance would not be adequate if we did not mention something about nutrition but rather than have a whole discussion about nutrition cause the lots of information about that on line for instance if you want again muscle that you need to have a clerk surplus of about ten to fifteen percent a you could have cleric surplus of more if you want to avoid am gaining weight than you would not in in create colonic surplus at cider you can find all that information on line that is not with this podcast is really about we had a month ah where we talk to lot about hormones and food and moods we talked about foods but more as they relate to the nervous system when it comes to supporting muscle to supporting the synthesis of larger what i call main balloons it does seem that ingesting seven hundred to three thousand milligrams of the essential monoacid lousing with each meal is important ow that does not necessarily mean from supplements in fact most people recommend that you get yore proline you get your a monoacid including your essential menaces in your loosing from whole foods high quality prolines a density prolines what do you mean by that well it is true that a lot of sources of proline are found in things beings and not some things that that all the essential monoacid can be found there but per unit carry if it is in our practice if in it is inpour ethics to n jest animal prolines it is true that for instance two hundred a calories of stake or chicken or fish or eggs we will have a higher density of essential men acids than the equivalent amount of calories from nuts or plants that is just simply the way it works ' not for the vegans and vegetarians ism certainly a not saying there is no way that you can of support muscle growth you absolutely can some of them might want to supplement loosing but this seven hundred to three thousand milligrams of loosing per meal is one of the best ways that is been shown to support the synthesis of more main if your goal is hypertrophy and it is also thewy tat yowled support muscle repair if your goal is strength s that specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy and strength and i encourage you to think about this proline density issue and it whether not you n invest animal a prolines or you do not to think about whether not your getting sufficient essential monoacid especially loosing now many people have address the question of whether or not you need to eat six or seven times a day it turns out that you do not that is kind of the old school thinking that you need eat very frequently i think for certain athletes ere very active for dragusisted meaning people that are enhancing their testosterone levels to superphysiological levels where they are experiencing very lighten levels of proline synthesis and that can utilize all that that might make sense again ism not supporting the use of those performance enhancing drugs but there are people doing that and that is one of the reasons why they eat frequently and much proline for typical people who are not doing that i imagine most of you are not then it does appear that you need to eat but you do not need to eat six or seven times a day it does seem not eating once a day is also important somewhere between one meal a day and six meals a day lies the more reasonable two or three or may be four times o day i think that a whole discussion about this is is warranted and will have this discussion with doctor gain in it at a future time of how whether or not eating proline more frequently can enhance this meat main synthesis but i think the simple take away from the literature that i was able to extract and for my discussion with with him is eating two to four times o day making sure your getting sufficient a a men acids that in a way that is compatible with your ethics and with your altricial regiment is going to support a muscle repair muscle growth strength improvements et camera just fine there is one more thing that it'd to cover which is the relationship between particular kinds of exercise and our ability to think and perform cognitive functions we all hear that exercise is vital for our brain that its supports our brain health in our body health and indeed that is true provided its done correctly however many of us are familiar with the experience of going for a run or going for a swim or working out hard in the him and then not being able to use our brain to be essentially useless for cognate functions for the rest of the day i discuss the s with doctor galop in this morning and i learns on the very interesting which is that hard bouts of exercise of the sort where your training near failure or you are generating focused muscular contractions for obsession that lasts anywhere from i own o thirty forty five minutes may be sixty minutes or a long run where you are engaging in some interval training during that run after exercise there is a reduction in oxygenation of the brain series actually at quite significant dip in the amount of oxygen that your neurons are getting and there for your ability to think it is important that you control the intensity and the duration of your training sessions that you are still able to do well in life and lean in to life the way you need to because ism guessing most of you are not in a position to just prioritize your physical train you also need to use your minds ism certainly familiar with wanting to get exercise but also the requirement of been to perform cognitive work throughout the day it also turns out that you can leverage something interesting about exercise and nerve to muscle work in ways that can benefit connive function and focus and it has to do with the way that your body and your nervous system predict bouts of intense focused effort let say your doing resistance training two or three times a week may be in four times a week and you are doing it consistently at a given time there are clocks literally biological clocks within the liver and within the brain that learn to predict that focus and that intense work if you are trying to get intense cognitive work done you might try scheduling that connive work on the days when you do not do physical training at the same time when you normally would do that intense focus physical training because the systems of the body that generate a see o calling release and other normodulators the systems of the body in brain that generate focused effort those are on this sort of clock mechanism in a way that you likely will find that after just a week of training at regular times you will be able to focus readily on other things when you are not training provided you do it during the period of time of day when you normally would train this is a kind of an indirect positive effect your harnessing the focus and the expectation of focus in your nervous system for that particular time of day and of course we be remiss if we did not talk about time of day for training turns out that whether not you do whether not you train in the morning or in the afternoon does not really seem to matter for sake of things hypertrophy and strength et camera everyone seems to have a time of day that they prefer to train have said before and their reasons based on body temperature rhythms and costs all release that training thirty minutes three hours or eleven hours after your normal waking time can be very beneficial and can provide a sort of predictability or regularity to when your body will be ready to train and best apt to train well there is some evidence that training in the after noon is better for performance whereas training for body composition changes and strong changes et camera does not really matter when you train you also want to make it compatible with sleep compatible with work there really gets down into the weeds of optimization but i think it is interesting to note that if you are going to train at a regular time you can take the days when you do not train and use that to enhance your cognac focus for things that have nothing to with exercise o this might be writing or reading or music or math et camera typically i restrict these podcast episodes to about ninety minutes called all radian cycle for learning to day was a bit longer and i admit that i tried to pack a lot into this it is the last episode in this month on physical performance i figured in this case more is better especially since everything is time stamped for you you certainly do not are to watch it all at once and you can come back to it over and over again into the promise locations in the episode that you in order to take notes or extract the information that you need id to point you to doctor and galleon's page a i highly recommend looking into the work that he is doing if you want more details he is very very skilled excellent communicator hes superb it what he does he is a professor he works with at late he works with typical folks in the exercise and muscle physiology world brad showinfields work i also have a lot of respect for have never met him i do not know him there is no paid indorsement here there not sponsors are related to the podcast in any way is think the work is of very high quality and they are both on the academic case and the practical side and of course their other people out there in doing fabulous work in this area as well if you this podcast and your benefiting

this podcast is set up the information is batched into for or five episodes all centered around a given theme or topic hormones sleep the episodes on sleep for instance that we are way back in canary what seems way back are still every bit as relevant to day as they were back in canary for somebody that has challenges with sleep and wants to understand sleep and get better at sleep or wants to understand their dreams or how to use sleep in dreaming to leverage neral plasticity an learning if you pass information along about the podcast toasts grate and as always please put your questions about the podcast episodes and s questions for future episodes in the comment section i really do read through all those comments it takes me some time but i do red through those i reply to as many of them as i can but i do read them and their great way for us to get feed back on apple you can give us a five star review if you think we deserve that and if you want to do all these things you are welcome to if you want to do just one of them we understand and if you do none of them we still appreciate that you come here to digest the information about science and science related tools and as mentioned the beginning of to day's episode we are now partnered with momentous supplements because they make single ingredient formulations that are of the absolute highest quality and theyship international if you go to live momentoustock calm slash supermen you will find many of the supplements that have been discussed on various episodes of the huberumen lad podcast and you will find various protocols related to those supplements laspenot least i want to thank you for your time and attention to day and as always thank you for your interest in since

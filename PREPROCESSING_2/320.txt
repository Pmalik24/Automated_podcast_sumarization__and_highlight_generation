welcome to the hubermanlatponcans ne as science science the ton fry by may druhubermen and om our professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine my guest to day is doctor robot rustic doctor robot lusting is an enderchonologists that is he is a specialist in the function of hormones in the body and a professor of pediatric enter chronology at the universe of californium sanfrancisco he is authored more than one hundred previewed studies exploring how different types of nutrients that is food impact our cellar functioning our organ functioning and thereby our health during to day's discussion we discuss the idea of whether not a carry is indeed a carry and whether not our body weight and body composition only reflects the number of calories we eat verses the calories that we burn we talk about how different food types that is how the different macroneutriants proving fat and carbohydrates are processed in the body and the important roll that fiber and the got microfilm plays in that process and we pay particular attention to the topic of how different types of sugars and crook tost in particular can indeed be addictive to the brain and can modify the way that hormones in the body in particular insolent impact our liver health kidney health and indeed the health of all of our cells and organ indeed doctor lusting is an expert in how sugar impacts the brain and body we talk about how certain types of sugars can indeed be addictive in the same way that certain drugs of abuse and behaviors can become addictive in other words how sugar actually changes the way that the brain works and we discuss how the food industry that is the commodification and sale of particular types of food has altered the way that we eat and indeed the foods that we crave to day's discussion covers all of that and by the end of today's discussion you will have a thorough understanding of how foods are processed when they enter your body and how those different food choices are impacting our immediate and long term health before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity a spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now a key component of getting a great nights sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees one of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes accuse at the appropriate times at the beginning an throughout and at the end of our night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that is what eight sleep allows you to do it all own you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fallen stay deeply sleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed in menershise have been sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover for almost three years now and it has dramatically improve the quality of my sleep much that when i travel an i men a hotel or an verbena bean i do not have access to my eight sleep i very much look for to getting home because my sleep is always better when i sleep on my eight sleep mattress cover if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dot calm slash superman to get a hundred fifty dollars off their pod three mattress cover eight sleep currently ships in the u essay candida u k select countries in the e and australia again that is eight sleep dot cam slash superman to day's episode is also brought to us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods effect your health by giving you real time feed back on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor one of the most important factors in your immediate and long term health is your blood sugar or blood glucose regulation with levels you can see how different foods and food comminations exercise and sleep patterns impact your blood glucose levels it is very easy to use you just put the money on the back your arm and then you take your phone and you scan it over that money now and again and it downloads the data about your blood sugar levels in the preceding hours using levels has allowed me to learn a tremendous amount about what works best for me in terms of nutrition exercise work schedule and sleep your interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor you can go to levels dot link slash superman levels has launch a new s gum censer that is smaller and has even better tracking than the previous fission right now they are also offering an additional two free months of membership again that is levels dot link slash superman to try the new censer and two free months of membership to day's episode is also brought to us by arrow press aero press is similar to a french press for making coffee but is in fact a much better way to make coffee i first learned about aero press well over ten years ago and have been using one ever since aero press was developed by allay adder who was an engineer at stamford and i knew of allay because he had also built the called a rob frisky which i believe at one time perhaps still now held the jinnis book of world's records for furthest throne object and i used to see allay believe or not at parks around palloalto testing out different army fairy he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different feels of engineering that turned into commercial products now i love coffee ism somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day usually about ninety to a hundred twenty minutes after i wake up in the morning although not always sometimes if ism going to exercise it'll drink coffee first thing in the morning but i love love love coffee and what have personally found is that by using the aero press i can make the best possible taste in cup of coffee i do not know what exactly it is in the aero press that allows the same being to be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better as come spared to any other form of brewing that coffee even the traditional french press the express is extremely easy to use and it is extremely compact in fact i take it with me whenever i travel and i use it on the road in hotels even on plains or discuss for some hot water and l threw my coffee tea right there on the plain if you would to try arrow press you can go to aero press doctor slash hubermaen that is high e r o p r e s s doctor slash supermen to get twenty per cent off any aeropress coffee maker aero press ships anywhere in the u sea canada and over sixty other countries around the world again that is aero press doccalm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off and now for my discussion with doctor robot lusstik doctor robot lust welcome pleasure truly a just being here being invited a his honor tell appreciate and it is not doctors just rub c rob have been looking for to this conversation for a long time have seen your now famous we also say infamous but famous to video about sugar will put a link to it in the shownote captions it is been viewed many many millions of times tan i still can figure to why that is you know well i beg my mother would watch it and she did not but twenty four name million people did well i think people are very interested in what to eat what not to eat and will start off simply talking about what most everyone believes an understands which is that a carry is a form of heat energy that is given off during the pressing of some food bit or some thing if that is mysterious to people just understand that a carry is a unit of energy and i was taught and still many many people world wide believe that a carry is a carry meaning if i consume more calories in whatever form then i metabolize by thinking feeling moving exercising et camera then i will wainwright and if i consume fewer calories than i burn i will lose weight and we could talk a lot about where that wait loss comes from does it come from adipose body fat stores or from muscle or from proline er muscle of course is proline et camera but let us start off with is a carry truly a carry when it comes to the processing of different types of calories everyone thinks that obesity is about energy balance that is calories in calories out therefore to behaviors gluttony in slough therefore if your that it is your fault therefore that an exercise therefore any carry can be part of ha balance tight therefore do not pick on our carries go pick on somebody ease's calories this is actually what the food industry uses to assuage their culpability for the change in the food supply and the rise in ability and chronic disease diabetes now it is true that a carry is that unit of energy that raises one gram of water one degree energy and therefore a carry burned is a carry burned i do not argue that that is true that is the first lauthermodanamocs but that does not mean a carry eaten is a carry eaten that is not the same and that is where people get at from let me give you some examples of how that carry eaten is not a carry eaten you almond i do me too as are great eat a hundred and sixty calories an almost how many of those do absorb hundred thirty eat a hundred sixty absorb a hundred thirty where the other thirty go in the process and of that food energy no turned out the fire in those almonds both soluble and insoluble fiber by the way fires sort of the key to the kingdom in this story forms a jell on the inside of your intestine the insoluble fire the cellulose forms a fish net if you will a lattice work on the inside of your duodenum the soluble fire which are globular plug the holes in that fish net together they form a secondary barrier can actually see it on electron microscope be a whitish jell and that prevents absorption of those thirty calories yes a hundred thirty get absorb but many of them do not they end up going further down the intestine to the next part call the jejunum d that's where the microbiumis now every one knows about the microfilm nowadays it is and the bacteria we always say when women are pregnant you are eating for two well we are always eating for a hundred trillion no they have to eat what are they eat they eat would you eat the questions how much dull you get first is how much they get well if you at almonds they're getting those thirty calories even though you count the carries at your lips that does not matter what really matters is counting the calories at your intestinal brushborder and they are not the same if you feed your gut that a good thing because then your got will take those carries and turn it into things shorchained fatiasis which and thus being protective against chronic metabolic disease hat citrate proving a butyrate vary those are actually good their anti an fumitory anti claimers because you fed your microfilm even tough you eight a hundred sixty you absorbed a hundred thirty sol carry eaten s not a carry eaten because if you ate it with fiber it was not for you it was for your bacteria but that is not the way you count up that is problem number one rob number too men acids we all eat proline let us say you eat too much proving ye the porter house stake now if you are body builder those men acids might go to muscle and you might increase your muscle mass because your body builder because you are putting a excess a force on those muscles and your growing those muscles of but let us say you are not a body builder let us say your mere mortal me or let us say you are a kid going through puberty to synthesizing a lot of muscle not because they are lifting weights because but there cause to ask drones making it happen absolutely but let us say you are not let us say you are just tot slump off e the street ta younjoshmo and you eat that porter house you have taken on all these aminoasces there is no place to street other than muscle your liver takes the excess and d emanates that a men acid takes the emend group off to turn it from a men acid into an organic acid and then that organic acid can then enter the recycle the trycarbic silk bicycle what goes on in the mitochondria in order to generate high t p the chemical energy that your body needs in order to power itself oke now that is a good thing it takes double the amount of energy to prepare that men acid for burning as it does to pa prepare a carnal hydrate for burning or to that for was one ask about when you asked about almond why the the one sixty verses one thirty i thought it was the process wintered out it was fiber you are saying for proline let us it let us make it realistic for a really nice big porter house stake which i love by the way let us say let us say eight hundred galleries wallet tun ow how much of that is is that is what goes in your mouth right my mouth how much of it is actually on eaten in a to stay with the your calorie is not a calorie in the processing of that what percentages actually goes into your total colonic intake about ten per cent of everything you eat goes to just maintaining body temperatures can the thermic effect of food but when you are eating proline you actually generate more heat the reason is because it takes too big t p to fuss for alate that organic acid as oppose to one high t p to a fuss for alate that carnal hydrate for a consumption you actually have a net loss of energy because it was a an mean o lasted verses a mono sybarite a sugar ow you you brought up fat fat does not need to be phosphor late it actually does not have any a thermic effect the food at that point depends on what it is as to whether or not you have lost cause o but wit this it is make get actually realistic a sixteen hundred calorie a porter house with a nice slab of a after grass butter on there i get is every once and a while not not yet often it basin cream spinach and maybe son mushrooms along the side oi i when ism meeting a porter hose i do not want to adulterate the taste with anything else ex that may be some some butter may be a said afterwards butut let us ay sixteen hundred calories of of it is got some fat in there for short an a let us say a thousand of those calories is proline and the other six hundred are fat don't buts something that then ant how marbled it is gas was ton what you just said about the thermic effect of food and praying in particular of that thousand calories how much actually is can we count ism not a carry counter but does one include as calories truly invested well if you invested sixteen hundred b that is a wit in the mouth but but but but what is is going to go against your your a burn debris it right i would have to actually do the math to figure that out but l as a guest get back of the envelope back the envelope calculation you going to lose about twenty five per cent of that well we're talking seven hundred fifty calories now for it into translate this a bit we were saying here as if you are somebody who is trying to lose weight or maintain weigh or perhaps even gainsaid you eat sixteen hundred carry porter house with a slab of butter on it six hundred those carries we are saying in this it's is fat but the remaining thousand calories that is that all went in your mouth don't count it at your mouth right but seven hundred but then when you compared against your energy burn for that day to maintain temperature brain activity physical activity really it is only seven hundred fifty calorie that is right that is a huge difference exactly another reason why calories not a carry now let us take the third let us take fats we here we have till make a threes hart healthy anti inflammatory anti alshimers save your life an over here we have translate the devil in carnet consumable poison because you cannot break the trains double bond you do not have the saturate to break that transdouble bond it basically accumulates lines your arteries lines your liver causes clinic medal disease causes insolent resistance will make a threes do not even get broken down for energy because they important they stay in tact because your brain needs em your heart needs am where is translate an't be pro ain't down because of that transdouble moment one save your life other one kill you there both nine calories program if you explode him in a boy calorimeter because a carry burned is a carry burned but a carry eaten not a carry eaten because one will save your life one all kill you and finally the big corona the one that blows everything else out of the water fructose in glucose i now glucose is the energy of life hear ere talking carbohydrates i think most of our audience will be familiar with the call back from new francs we talk about fat and this hates omens there is some mat fire an there probably a little bit of carbohydrate lo no bet talked about the porter house with butter it came hungry already that is preaching in fact very little if any carbohydrate i should mi zero essentially is a bolero hero yet om and then now we tie about carbohydrates and we are gin to subdivide that into glucose and fronts right lactose basically becomes glucose in the liver we we can dispense with that unless you have a disease call elect to seems which is about one in twenty thousand o and comes the natal men in gitisand a disease as a pediatric in the chronologist i would take care of but we can dispense with that for the moment at glucose fructose glucose is the energy of life every sell on the planet burns glucose for energy glucose is damn important that if you do not consume it your body makes it it will taken o men acid and turn it into glucose that is luck i oogenesis on yourgenesis retreat it will take a fatty act and turn it into glucose specifically the glycerol portion of the a trugglesriht will turn into glucose the into it they don't have any place to go carbohydrate that ice the wale blubber it still us seem glucose level the reasons because you had to you have to have us sir glucose level in order to power your rain in order to power your heart yes your you can use ketones of course you can but only if you are in a keydogentic state will you use exclusively ketones and you also need glucose for structural changes in specific proteins and particularly hormones glucose molecules will stud t s h l h was ah different pituitary hormones in order to increase their potency it is one of the reasons why aging leads to defective formonogenesis for instance hipogonat as a highbofiratism is the loss of gleccoscillation on individual a a a petite hormones because of a the inability to add glucose because those insulin coins no just it is an agent phenomenon at will come back to this casting cat's million portent the idea that ingestion of carbohydrates and the as you called it the studying of carbohydrate molecules on hormones can augment the function of those horns and with aging that is a lessefficient process tit sufficient process but it is not because of consumption it is repeopleare still i i see the the a plenty of folks who are a sixty five and old are eating plenty of carbohydrates you are saying a lot of them have deficient devoid to postpone estrogen r a prolactin et camera because of the wade there is those carbohydrates are not studying the a de hormone exactly there the whole of those are like approaching hormones let us tee that up for later cause i think that is in yous a very i porhaven you to go and there is and there is a disease in children in in babies called congenital disorders of gleoscillation where you cannot put a locos mole a molecules on specific prolines an across severe mental retardation all sorts of metabolic have it and lots babies die for that matter it is an important thing i but that is how important glucose is fructose on the other hand this sweet molecule the molecule we see the reason why the food in the street studs every food in the grocery store i seventy three percent of all items in the america grocery store have added sugar on purpose for the foudenstries purposes not for yours because fructose addictive activates the lucky succumbed the reward center of the brain in the same way that ho cocaine heroine nicotine alcohol do and drive demean receptors down just negative in alcohol in cocaine heroine do that molecule fructose s number one a completely vestige to all vertebrate life there is no biochemical reaction in any vertebrate that requires dietary fructose that is number one number two cares us ariominajus desert you are saying that even though we can process facts we have a limited capacity to process it in the same way way have a limited capacity metabolize alcohol if you have one drink o day yourocet you've to drinks to day depends on how big you are you and i can pro li would argue two drinks a week as the maximum but let us not go there the a but but in terms of your saying when you say fructose processing afroctos is vastidul what you are saying is that we do not need to do it that is is the appendix it is an organ for which it has no function exactly and fructose has no function in the human body period you do not need it you do not need it do not need it but i it is replete with it in fact o fructose consumptions gone up twenty five fold since the beginning of the last century i half to ask his now i love fruit i e berries glower specially since the price of berries seems to have come down i us to be the only get i certain times a year not what you call a drive by blueberry eater it'll just walk passage to take a tisfulat you cannot put them in front of me without me eating them as is even difficult for me when other people i do not know or eating them i i lots of blueberries in strawberries blackberries if there in season i love them you problem loaded with fructose no plenty of fire lo fructose lofructos om berries berries of the lowest fructose a one oilers about asking this to day not of i and fruit is o k because of the fire the molecule the fructose molecules the same whether it is in a berry or in in banana or for that matter in a cococola the fructose molecule is the same molecule the difference is that in the berry it comes with a whole lot of fire in the banana comes with a whole lot less fire and in the cococolat does not come with any fire and the fire is what mitigates the absorption when you consume the fructose with fiber your blueberries your feeding your mike opium that fructose was not for you got it such a relief and a i i must say recently ad a whole body am a i as a of rya nothing as how much is that was great i got to watch an at flicks in there and now i never had a homebody ever i learned a few things that were useful to me give got a clean bill of health that is gran lis need one of that piece of fee back i got is a that my got was filled with this very high contrast ism stuff and they asked do you consume a lot of blueberries and i said indeed i do why and they said in because that high contrast of it shows a white on the scan it is i high concentrations of magnesium i that we see in people that in jest large amounts of blueberries which is pretty rare and yours are comparable to a bare in blueberry season hell i and busy my entire got was filled with with blueberries i suppose i need to cut back a low bit but now i know that fruit is o k especially if the fruit has a lot of fire but fructose itself especially if it is not partnered with fire is first well not required for survival at all but your time me is a problem after yes and let me tell you why it is problematic we have not got into that yet we are just talking about whether it is vestigial verses needed now let us talk about what fructose does turns out fructose inhibits three cone three separate an times necessary for normal mitochondrial function now i you are might country make e t p you are might a to t you have to work at you efficiency that is what metabolic health is is might conjure working a pique efficiency well there are three ensiles that are inhibited i facts number one a m p kinase i mpikinaseis the fuel gauge on the liver cell it is the thing that tells the liver to make for mite conjure fresher mite conjure because if your a m p levels or high that means you have dephosphoralated a bunch of high t ps and you have to regenerate you need some more mite conjure was negative f back pathway well you need that a m pekinese to generate that mitaconjio biogenic signal except that fructose a metabolic of rectos call methyl glioxel m go sits in the active side of the gamasubunit of that a m kinase and actually binds to argentines in that act of sight rendering that a a ends i now dead it is an irreversible inebicien because of the covalent bonding of that methelgloxel that alcaide to the argentine and now that endgame is dead a cases of it easily acts a key that does not turn the lock but prevents the the key that you want in that lot therm entering the fetlock it is it is glueing a lock shut yet to it that that one of the denim that is one second one a head el anal come dhadragin a long chain this is necessary to cleave to careen fragments of fatty acids to prepare them for a a metabolism inhibits that one and the finally it habits carnations palmitate transferase one o s p t one now that is the enigma that regenerates carnations carnations is the shuttle mechanism by which you get the fatty acids from the outer mite con membrane thru to the inner mitaconjo membrane that they can be data oxidize for energy if you do not have that s a s p t one your basically carnatineless and therefore you can generate a bat oxidation e said forts inhibits all three these aromatic pathways yet as by all just ti have to ask how potently does it inhibit them i mean cause there is there are drugs that block receptors and then there drugs the block resapteris within unbelievable affinity i m a mechanistically in a dish meaning an nitro even the all sorts of things but how how significant is this for for ability for mihtaconju function in vive in as sola the the dose determines the poison i paracelsis fifteen thirty seven a there are toxins that are parts vermillion and will kill you seen prison dioxide bother ionizes a good analogy because it is work on myth conjure it is basically causing myth conation to see have completely defective i then there are a intermediate toxins arsenic and carbentetro chloride parts vermilion and they take a little longer to work than not in kill you on the spot that is why i can eat an apple seed that has a low bit of person i can at but are not in to die right and then finally there and by the tobacco smoke goes in there and then finally you have a a weak toxins i and youknow where it is not one exposure that will kill you its ten thousand exposures that will kill you alcohol were toxic people yet e tons of well sometoetimes at i ha at enters that i sometimes it on mildly toxic feeble anyway the point is that fructose is in that last category it is not what you do one day that kills you it is what you do every day that kills you and if you basically eat ultraprosess food i in sugar for ten years in a row it is goon o show up in terms of your comobidities and ultimately yet it will kill you and we have the data to show you know how many years you'll lose right now in america we pay and eight year longevity tax if you look at japan who that they have a mean age of death of eighty eight we have a mean age of eighty we are paying in eight your lunjevy text just by living here and we are told about the healthy people now if you have met a bolocindrome it is a fifteen year longevity tax and a if you abilities of fifteen year lunge text yet met balendro it is a twenty year longevity tax that is primarily not complete but primarily sugar it is also ill make a six is its out translate you know left over because now they are gone but you know people still suffering the ravages of the translate from the previous generation are they gone i m i do remember as a kid when we had larger and and and our refrigerator the are a big t ait in my home at one parent i want identify which a was pro bargeman the other was pro butter anti larger and i on the marriage hat last but there were other reasons that is probably a i went butter a buttered mutters fine in fact time declared you know front cover butters back you margin was the bad guy without question and we know now but back when we thought it was gallery was a gallery we thought o bargeman it is the same nine calories program and we said it lowers your triglessurides bad i dead it was because what it did was it find your liver because you could not break that tries double mind and a so they are they are now gone from our foot supply they are legal there legal they are band but you can make transacts in your own kitchen by taking olid oil and meeting it to beyond the smoking point they are not completely gone they are just gone from ultra process food now sugar is the big problem because of these three insignes that you are inhibiting the point is were we started this with a calories a carry well if you are inhibiting matacongial function then i calories not a carry is it you are reducing the a intensity the furnace ye exactly this whole calories a carry just makes no sense and it has not worked at any level and there is no study that actually shows that cutting calories makes a difference and i can show you voluminous data that shows that virtually every weight lost study that a that led to in a color restriction basically did not work not for any length of time just to round out our earlier discussion cause i find it fascinating and i know other people will as well talked about that under and sixty calories hit is actually under and thirty at the business end of things of almonds we talked about the porterhouse stake with butter and the twenty five percent reduction in what is actually cuotincuot eaten and it'll get back to this was at this quote quote issue i think the promise there is there is a lack of useful language to dissociate this stuff you know even just calling fat fat people think it mats gain t make you gan body fat if we call the adapts tissue and lipids we nit would have avoided this confusion i i do not wat it yet they are just yet but i want to make surest the for industry does this on purpose wen oh absolutely they haves tell you a sugar is a sugar which is not true they tell you a calories a carry which is not true and they tell you a fat as a fat which is not true this is very specifically when you are talking about sugar you talking about dietary sugar we talking about blood sure cause blucher is blown a you coast we are i lit of drawers dietary collateral or circulating collesterall or you absolutely we we have done this a they know to ourselves but the food industry has really promulgated because we farmed out nutrition policy and information to the food in the street they actually uses for their purposes one of the problems in this field as we all know quality nutrition influences of course our physical health but also our mental health and our cogent functioning our memory our ability to learn new things and the focus and we know that one of the most important features of high quality nutrition is making sure that we get enough sidemen and minerals from high quality unprocessed or minimal process sources as well as enough robotics and robotics and fiber to support basically all the cellar functions in our body including the got micro b mom now i most everybody try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods ideally mostly from minimal process or non process foods however one of the challenges that i and many other people face is getting enough servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day as well as fiber and robotics that often accompany those fruits and vegetables that is why way back in two thousand in twelve long before i ever had a podcast i started drinking a g one and am delighted the a g one is sponsoring the superman la pod cast the reason i started taking a g one and the reason i still drink a g one once or twice a day is that it provides all f my foundational nutritional needs that is it provides insurance that i get the proper amounts of those vitamins minerals robotics and fiber to insure optimal mental health physical health and performance if you would to try a g one you can go to drink a g one do calm slash supermen to claim a special offer there giving away five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too again that is drink a g one do calm slash supermen to claim that special offer for the third category macronutranes carbohydrates i defrentiated i glucose and fructose if i invest i let us a a half a bagel am sis wartime at new york you are sit origin they have greabagles on the west cost yen yet is not is its it is pretty pit if the same it the pieces as do as law the claim it is the the the water when whatever it is it is different back there in its better the half a bagel let us say two hundred fifty calories mostly carbohydrate this is an an unlined in no cream cheese no schmear as they call back there no no cream cheese no butter other thing just half the they endervift calories that is what i at you are saying that a gallery eaten is not a carry eaten how much of that carbohydrate given that it is probably most let us assume it is mostly glucostlets do it this way yet it is it is blumerise glucose plermoenucos how much of that is actually utilized were burned verses am that the ouriginaunty fifty if you look at what happens to energy in the body sixty five per cent of that which is ingested goes to resting energy expenditure just to power the body ten per cent goes to the spermic effective food and then twenty five per can goes to activity that is the break down of were the a energy goes an that is calories from fat proline and carbine yet from everything together and glucose a perfectly good example of how that works the point is though that when you in guest glucose you are getting a big glucose excursion in your blood stream you are getting a big luck spike and that glue spike has to come down well what makes it come down the hormone insolent insolent is the bad guy in the story the hire your glucose goes the more your pan cerous will release insolent in order to bring that glucose down well turns out that glucose rise was not benin that glucose rise led to en the filial dysfunction transient but none the less end the filial dysfunction can cousin remind people what end thealial sells are inside of your arteries we and it will change blood pressure we have got plenty o dated to demonstrate how it changes blood pressure and over time that will clause corner artery disease that will clause kidney disease et camera but it is the insolent response that is really the bad guy now people think insolent is good because it lowers blood glucose after all diabetics take insolent to lower their blood glucose oke let us take a diabetic pa nation with dies blutshugar's three hundred that is bat we give a shot of insolent in the arm butshugar goes down to one hundred blutshuger went from three hundred to one hundred oke where did the two hundred points of blood glucose go ism assuming that the insolent with sequestered it to where ism assuming to the liver to the fat interested for storage that is insolence job insolent takes whatever you are not burning and puts it into fat for storage insolent is not the diabedisworm on invent is the energy storage horme how quickly does it do that because quick because if ism having om that a very busy day were that diabetic person is having a very busy day and they are moving around a lot then you got insolent bound glucose in the blood stream a r how don't no insolent does not bind glucose insolent binds to its recepcharisecaris and allows for glucose transitortors every but for some period of time while that person is active there is an opportunity to utilize that glucose w at right a but how quickly is insolent managing that glucose we know that the spite comes down quickly but the glucose is not available for energy utilization after what it is iris t a sequester to the the adipose to the fat tissue at within an hour task about ninety minutes but i left you if you are if you are active if you eat e muffin and you are active your muscles are going to take up that glucose irrespective of insolent in fact muscles our insolent independence they have glucose transporters but they are insolent in dependent because if they were not then every patient in diabetiquitoacidosis would be paralyzed e glucose will end up in muscles irrespective of energy status and a insolent status and in muscles its used as immediate fuel and glicaging both oil and glikageind storage in the muscle absolutely i now if you or active then you'll clear locos into muscle therefore your bluglucos will not rise as much as it went into muscle and therefore your pancreas will put out less insolent because it does not have to clear as much from the blood stream and that is ho cay that is good but let us say you did not exercise you have got a big glucose excursion now you have a big insolent response and that insolent is going to take the excess that sinuous blood it has to clear it and it will go to fat for gorge that insolent rise turns out to be particularly aggriegious in terms of metabolic disease and i can prove it there is a mouse my favorite mouse i loft this mouse this mouse turns medicine on its head and teaches every doctor why they have to go back to medical school and learn it right this mouse is called the podurco mouse pod cacao is it discovered by pederco no no is a discarded onions lavs manufactured and ronconslep this is a tissue specific insolent receptor knockout mouse i arch in lass insolent receptor in unit is vedic kidney in the kidney intone drop comglumerular poeticize insolent receptor knockogous we have not talk to much about transgenic models and knockers and knockout i just in ten second r last basically these are mice that are genetically engineered you lack the receptor for insolent specifically in the it glemerial poeticize tho kidney in in the kidney and everywhere else in this mouse insolent as its thing normally exact great these animals are you glisimic normal bluglucos levels these animals are normally glucose tolerant that me go up they go down just every other mouse these mice are not fat these mice are not thin these mice are mice except they have the worst diabetic neuropathy on the planet to their her of their kidney is degenerated their kidneys degenerate to nothing i now they have normal blood glucose levels they have normal glucose tolerance they have normal insolent tolerance whole body but their kidneys are dying how come cannot be the glucose it is the insolent because insolent the bad guy insolence actually making the kidney disease and these animals that are insolent resistant they have the a better neuropathy without diabetes the insolent is having a negative clearly negative effect on the kidneys without binding to the receptor example circulating insolent can stuff without dining to its receptor well it is no mines to its receptor in different parts of the body other parts of the bod i putting the grey it cannot cause it is a nob because it is not yet right the point is insolent does stuff by it self and turns out insolent drives growth now every cell in your body once to burn at one time in life at once to grow at another time in life every cell has those two pathways burning growth burning growth what determine wether a cell should be burning whether a cell should be growing i do not know what makes it ism burning but resembles in the has only do with my to condo it has everythinton every cell needs to burn needs to grow at a different time n life here is a way to think about we all start out as a i goat a single cell we end up in adult now that single cell had to become two cells those two cells had to become forces those foretells had to become eight cells an on anon anon anon every cycle there is doubling how many doublings to get from a i goat to an adult what is in exponential growth yet i do not i do not know it oft the top of my head forty one forty one forty one two to the forty one doublings you give you an organ is ten trillion cells we are ten shillings otentrilions we know that yet two to the forty one o it now of those forty one doublings some of them had to occur in uteri some of them had to occur post natal i need two numbers that ad up to forty one how many in uteri how many postnatal we way more you start off with a lot more than you end up with but then you've cells that turn over throughout the life spans this is a tough one get skin sells turn over with neurons it is it is pretty straightforward because your gan i it someone glen to gey in with en it right well you are and you are born with somewhere between three and ten acts of what you end up with depending on the brainstructur but whole body wide i do not know how you would come up with that number thirty six and five thirty six doublings prenatal five doublings postnatal i can prove that to you two typical baby weighs seven pounds first doubling fourteen pounds second doubling twenty of eight pounds sext doubling fifty six pounds next doubling hundred twelve pounds next doubling two hundred twenty four pounds and doubly its recent flies does there i not to not all be in wen astral author robes ah but some people who are certain heights or below or yet two undredrover robes point is the sell has to know when to grow and when to burn the turns out that the signal for that is oxygen because oxygen's necessary for my country to be able to burn in the absence of oxygen the sell only knows how to grow this is actually why ta hamburg won the local prize in nineteen thirty one for the hamburg effect he asked the question how come cancer cells do not need oxygen to grow and the answers as no cell the oxygen to grow in fact oxygen is the thing that prevents growth famous article from the new inland journal of medicine nineteen fifty one mount verist in throw because every fetus is oxygen deprived normal partial pressure of oxygen hundred millimeters mercury out here right coif ivy checked your blood to be about a hundred right i hope how about a tumbrel am guessing t tomercells probably is it double bout forty for a you just doorsill pressure of a oxygen in a tumorcell is about forty for we you've told me that what tomercells which grow wild right they grow wild because they do not have oxygen but they but there is some of t heres what is peculiar about it tomercells are some of the most vascular cells er a tumors are or have a the at crying an't coming one way to what a way a the you octrecal want is to to de vasculeriza to run yes and you any genesis and ambition at several in is a big deal doutifulcmen an all that from harvardyou know the access of blood to a tumor is the attempt to bring in oxygen that it is not yeti that is it is suppose to delivering lots of oxygen and tat lies grin that is right but fetus what is the partial pressure in the placenta six to thirty one it is actually a mile above mount evert that is how much oxygen the dentist gets and it is the for that reason that you have got thirty six doubling and then as soon as you are out you cot the cord and you star breathing and now your partial pressures at a hundred that is when growths slows down has there been any effort to treat tumors by oxygenating tumors yes and what is that look its hyperbaric oxygen thereby it is a thing o ye ye yet we all probably do an episode on hyberbery chambers is they the the reason we have not yet is it is pretty nectar t it by their people who on these things who sit in these things i skate we got here by way of by way of carped by the bagel right am i just want to oriental i they you just that two under fifty calories the bagel we talk about glucose courage is that insolent rise that is driving the atipocidiins also driving the growth in the absence of oxygen is if you have oxygen and you do not need that much insulin of it be raise you an a burn instead of store got it in terms of the the a the rawmatabolism of carbohydrate thou that glucose if i eat two hundred fifty calories of glucose how much of that i did i cornicort actually eat how much as is used ho much is you yet was assume that ism ism at my ask working or i walking around a little bit ism not ism not exercising hard in that in the subsequent hour used for what is the question i exactor the calories is the carry carry clearly the answers know be based on the processing of different times of carries we establish if for fat the algins we stalorsit for proline the porter house with butter and now were were trying to stylish that for the two hundred fifty calories of a bagel which is glue cops so the glucose has to be us for elated vena lose ain the t p in the process or fungo high t p got to a d p ad then that i d p will go to a m p a denying monophony pate which will then go to i m p a inositol monophosphate which will then go to uric acid and that your acid will be than released from the cell circulating blood stream an hopefully go out in the kidney in the process that uric acid can inhibit matacondual function and that can also inhibit and the filial nitrocoxide sinthase which is the inside in your musculature that is your indigenous blood pressure lowered by expanding blood vessels and capillaries exactrite this is the mechanistic a foundation of the drugs that were originally used for a improving prostate function but are used to treat erectile is function which are the the p p d five inhibitors which allow natrocoxide to be a around longer and more of it right he lase it r other purposes to ism now now on forget if i new it up without tat example we we are in the genital intensive carny it it closes patent up is arturiosis which is a big deal in in the the an italy a world loco i i will not ask you us at but but om i heard two things one is that am glucose and the insolent that goes with it increases uric acid uric acid a while certain important functions in health too much of it you said can inhibit natricoxide ye can hi a hydro cost that means that the blood vessels and calories against a more constricted blood pressure's in to be higher than it would be no sit and then your acid is also inhibiting mite conduit function that is of am but eating half of bagel is not necessarily a terrible thing if it is within your cleric requirements it and it all depends on how much a you clear and how high your salon got now let us compare that two hundred fifty calories of glucose to two hundred fifty carries of fronts ah let us it let us come up with the food example two hundred fifty carries of fronts would be trivial to a consume in the form of hifroctos corn sure yo remember the hifroctos corn surplice half glucose hard o cast let us not one twenty five one twenty foil si it is not use that well let us assume a s he's i bout a soda for a to get that that a two nor fifty calories easily am i base if it is not a can or a european size bottler enounce done can of soda o was o enounce can soda am and maybe it let us include of food item wits talk that storebought package cooky couple trios two words i get you that two fifty or many for or e three or you am trio lovers everywhere celebrating three two hundred fifty carries of fronts what is the effect on your acid what is the effect on close burn what the effect on anything for that matter that a we should be aware first of all the trio has plenty ofroctos in it keep that my o the a if let us say you consumed a two hundred fifty calories in a bagel cause that is pretty much plumberies glucose verses say the soda the bagel verses the soda that is with equivalent calories equivalent a war the the bagel versus lets a two trios and all bit of am and got two trios number one there is only half the glucose in the soda because the other half as fructose seen twenty five on twenty five your glucose rise will not be as i your glucose excursion will be lower this is actually one of the reasons why there is this thing cold glyceric index glusimic index is word it is garbage it is complete n utter is the glass index absolute yes it will nothing nothing is more a a egregious in terms of argument then then then the glicimc index and this is one of the things dieticians as promote an a spouse one of the things ta s catalo i ye isn't this is an idea that must die oi we will get back to why the glib mic index has got a die ah but that two hundred fifty calories and act can we can we make these equal just forsaken of simplicity can we say two hundred fifty calories of glucose from the age very is two hundred fifty calories of fructose how do we get two hundred fifty calves of purfroctos we do not you cannot of he got to bring the glucose we lap lab fronts of have to i then let us say wit or your touches at half glucose hafrotthai mean there is no fructose alone in nature even cracker some of the ones that our salty are also sweet if kotos ya a for i froths on service ye that is why it is impossible to eat just one need and om what is happening by chemically t as a consequence of the fructose component specifically the fructose will first of all go into the intestine the intestine will metabolize some of that fronts through what is known as intestinal the novel ipogenisis about ten percent of that fronts will be turned into fat right in the intestine that is cops fructose it is wants to be fat fructose ants to be fat fructose is the biogenic substrate here were not time about body fat we are talking about fat molecules that can potentially be used as energy that is right triglisride molicoc to ten per cent of tat fructose will be turned into trials ate right in the intestine and be released into the blood stream and it is the reason for a post prandial triglisuride response as geranial is a and ism including myself in the scrip is nerd speak for after eating logic typically it is longe so that is actually one of the drivers of cardiovascular mythology that intestinal dental ipogenisis turning that fructose into trials ride right in the intestine no there is a limit to how fast and how much the intestine can do that the rest oft fronts will be absorbed into the portal vane but not before some of that fronts will make it further down and it will i trade tight junction prolines toga portalvan of acetone sotovangos to the liver portovangos from the viscera from the intestine to the liver to cabin does not getting ocolcuin intestine to liver of but fructose nitrates tight junction proxies i explain that to your audience your intestine is a suer definition f a our a pipe with shine e that is its suer a interns or users there is junk in the center and the job of the intestine is to move the junk through to the ones absorbing the good stuff why you cant the intestine is made up of cells intestinal epithelial cell that are bound together and they are bound with prolines that basically form a barrier those barriers all tight junction prolines is clouding n how zonulan is the navy one cay the others but zonulan is the one that goes is defective in ciliactasies what defines a tight junction is it is the completely impermeable or samupermiable completely impermeable unless its function is inhibited turns out if you alter the a a fosrolation status or the nitrate status of that tight junction it will become transiently permeable and fry tost i traits tight junction prolines causing them to be transiently permeable allowing some of the junk in your intestine to get through ins your blood stream this is leak gut this is leaky it this is what causes leaky gut fructose is a driver of leaky gut got it that causes inflammation at the level the liver which ultimately leads to to steric inflammation one of the reasons why higcenc it see our put since titty see our p is high in patients who eat ultroprocess food see a p we reactive proline which is a marker of a something inflammatory i mean response exactly you do not want it too high and ninety three per cent of america to day are inflamed does i mean the ninety three per cent of america have leaky guts ye it does cause that is where it comes from in addition to limiting fructose take what ere things that o support the tight junctions of the intestinal pathway there are three barriers in your intestine to keep the junk where it belongs in the center that it can get pooped out the you are behind three separate barriers one is a physical barrier called the mason layer is a layer of mucus that actually sits on top of the intestalent aphelia selves now that mason is a jolly salaried and the bacteria can use that mason layer for its own purposes it will eat your mason layer if you do not feed your bacteria you must feed your bacteria or back your bacteria will feed on you you are in concert with your microfilm if you deprive your microfilm of the food that it needs it will use you as it is food and that is one of the reasons why fiber is important fiber to build up this music layer is one way to reinforce the the on the fencethat that is the tight junctions et camera exon between your intestines in the blood stream this raises an interesting point about fasting a many people including myself due a sort of judo intermittent fasting may you my first meal somewhere between eleven and new an are not strict about this the eleven verses now thing and rally eat my last but of food somewhere round eight am and occasionally eats outside that window i have done this for a long time at is feels best to me at other people use a shorter eating window one thing that i learned from a colleague at male the studies the got microfilm that was surprising to me is that when you do when you eat in that way there is a long stretch of time sometimes longer for people that of a shorter eating window longer fasting window that is where your actually eating up your own intestinal lining this idea that fasting is great for us on the one hand might be true on the other hand your your actually consuming components of your you are not feeding your got microfilm and you to plead it but that here is where i was a positively surprise when you do eat provided that you eat enough fiber and in regular high quality for rented foods lotion an fermented food it seems that the the lining of the got and the got microfilm is replenished to a level that is greater than if you had eaten for longer periods of the twenty four hour cycle yet i have that right we u o have it right and i do not know why that is true but it does seem to be the case and for rented foods they it part because they got already short chain aliases in them see that is an prefer food of the microbial well it is what the microfilm actually turns fiber into it is probably helping you are intestinal at the filial sells in the same way what the microfilm turning fiber into short chain facias itself it is what we call a post biotic you have periotic which is the food for the bacteria you have the robotic which is the bacteria itself they have the postbiotic which is what the bacteria make in order to he will you gonna and short chained aliases are post bionics ad therefore lot of people selling short chained fatiaciss you know drinks and supplements n what having whether they work or not is another story if i consume froths in the a form of gets say a highly process food as minimalantiocidends but is got plenty calories typically ah and it is destructing the ti junctions making my got leaky but ism also eating fire you arm having a a meal that includes a salad of having having some robotics and then i wanted a couple rec's pein a butter cups lay in the dart chocolate ones in particular i do not do this any more but i used to eat that more often as as time as gone on at becomes i do not to call it stricter but more i intend to healthier foods over time and i think you can get away with different things at different stages of life although you work with young people i will get to very young people who will get to this but how how much damage my doing by investing any forgot in the form of a highly process food it'll make it very simple andyou i am for desert for dessert i am not for desert for breakfast lunch snacks in dinner if you want to have a couple of reason proof butter cups as your desert in the same way as you might have a conic for desert that is fine i have no profit that the question is are you can to eat resisting of butter cups for breakfast not i do not eat breakfast well no by dicta i see your point the national school breakfast program which twenty nine per cent of school children to day consume is a boll of fruit loops in a glass of orngetes that is forty one grim of sugar medical her association says that the upper limit for children should be twelve grim of added sugar pray that is forty one grams of added sugar and it is just breakfast and that is fructose rich total it right completely the question is which deserter we talk about it and right and can we can we adjust that morning meal am to a different reality cause i agree that therefore plenty of kids eating that or a muffin that might be the equivalent and do but what about the parent who says local let us come up with a healthier option that the kid still likes a thingy aback to my childhood i a honey nutchurios or something not fruit loops which is kind of the extreme am take a look at the side of the packet no out for now lets say they go with am some are waffles that are made without with remade a mix some irksome butter am its mom or dad is making waffles gray it sounds healthier but then if you do the break down o still ending up it very high are we bus eating desert for breakfast an we ego waffles or we m a making waffles a de nova you know from scratch in your own kitchen let us say make difference because the eggs waffles you know replete with sugar on purpose because the food entry knows when they add it you by more because it is addictive and we actually have the a a a demographic the mechanistic the imaging and also the economic data to demonstrate that sugar's addictive and the food in the street knows it give yo ever heard of a phenomenon call price elasticity price elasticity is an economic term that is used to ask the question if the price of a given good goes up by one per cent that should result in reduction in purchaser consumption because price influences consumption how much does it influence it if it is if something is price elastic when the price goes up consumption goes down equivalently a food that is price elastic the most price elastic food is eggs when the price of eggs goes up one per cent consumption of eggs goes down point six eight per cent meaning that eggs have a price elasticity of point three to got it got it now what is the most price anaplastic food the top three most price anaplastic foods are fast food cereal point ate one i a good quiz as we point ate one a a a of drinks at point seven nine and juice of point seven seven meaning people will pay not whatever ut they will they are willing to pay more more more readily willing to pay more because of the sugar because it is addictive because its hedonic many many years ago and you probably remember something called mansion economics a casino economics was based on this concept of the rational actor and the rational act can determine value which is utility over cost and if your a rational actor you should be able to say yet it'll buy that but i will not buy that in nineteen seventy nine and you will canoe and amostersky n well prize whine not dalcanman describe the irrational actor now the irrational actor cannot determine value and the reason is because he is risk verse the cost is always too great utility may be the same but the cut goes up because that is why they have averse give tendencies it the irrational actor geffrey sacs has described the hedonic actor who also cannot determine value because it does not matter what a cost they need their fix and this is what is going on and the foodanstree knows it and that is why every food in the store has been spiked i to take a quick break to acknowledge our sponsor element element is an electroelike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolyte sodium magnesium and potassium and that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve cells your neurons relies on electrolytes in order to function properly when your well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes in your system your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved i drink one packet of element dissolved in about sixteen to thirty two ounces of water when i wake up in the morning as well as while i exercise and if have sweat lecturing that exercise i often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about thirty two ounces of water after i exercise element comes in a variety of differed flavors all of which i find really tasty i the centrists i the water melon the raspberry frankly i cannot pick just one it also comes in chocolate and chocolate men which i find taste best if they are put into water dissolved and then heated up i tend to do that in the winter months because of course you do not just need hydration on hot days and in the summer and spring months but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry if you to try element you can go to drink element spelled elements doom slash supermen to try a free sample pack again that drink element doom slash supermen doctor deserve for breakfast in the form of cereals yet some of which are i disguised for couched as he there i think of conning not turbos it seems healthier than fruit uses its looks health you are the cut just by way of color it looks can a weepy color but let and in terms of lunch mean one of the things that i love about rope is that the breads are amazing depress not terrific and i a and i them because they are not as sweet exactly and a sandwich from not every belly but from a typical sand whit shop or that one makes with storebought bread sliced bread in the yours has a lot of fruits i look do ti look the up prior to do that discussion to day in some ways desert is being woven into foods that are that parents and or kids everyone thinks our savory art rashly eating sweet exactly right but we cant but we do not taste them as sweet at a conscious level necessarily read but our tastebuds do right that is exactly it the question is why do they do that question for your audience you buy a loaf of bread at the local bakery how soon before stales two days avast ye if it is really great bread that is right anthem better the bread the quicker it stales you buy a loaf of bread at the a neighborhood grocery store how soon before stales a you have got probably a week and then there is a the moldy pieces at the end a trust that if you are in college in your means ah what can last up to three weeks dependent right you could throw it in the freeze are if i do that with the bakery bread but it is never the same nepenthe less neverisin the question is why is that the answer is sugar the answer is sugar the grocery store bread had sugar added to it on purpose because when you bake it the sugar does not evaporate it stays in the bread and the sugar's hygroscopic meaning it holds on to water sis a phenomenon that the food in the street uses cold water activity and it will hold on to water and it will stay spongy it will not stale as quickly as the bakery shortbread which did not have that sugar added to it even something as benin as bread has been turned in to something that ultimately leads to chronic meltable disease we have pivoted somewhat from cargo hydrate divided into gloglucos and fructose to discussion of sugar can you the it the link between sugar and fructose table sugar what percentage of table sugar is fructose what percentage of brown sugar is fructose what percentage of the sugar that is added to food is hifrocts corns are on average just because hear what we are talking about is it am what you are describing as an intentional lacing of food and is something that is a fictive but that is also process very differently at the level the kidney at the level of the liver om and it is bat it is a tats it is a bad situation a when we talk about sugar i think we need to be as careful in describing what we really mean as when we talk about a carry i complete lire let for your audience let us be very very clear on definitions let us not use the word sugar because it has multiple definitions let us use euros euros is what you put your coffee it is the crystals it is canesugar beach sugar the stuff that you teaspoons of right this was all that was available for many many years that is one moleculeglucos one molecule of fronts bound together for the chemist out there an doglike a civic lineage the ends in your invest and called surface cleaves this doglike civic lineage in about a nanosecond you absorb the molecules separately the glucose goes to the entire body general an insane response the fronts goes straight to your liver generates fat that is euros heyfractos cornsyrp is essentially one moleculglucos one molecule o fronts not bound together no doglike a civic lineage they are free the engine sucres does not care as the blonds already broken ultimately they do the same thing and that is why hydrates cornsyrp and euros are indistinguishable metabolically what they are is they are very different economically and the reason is because hyfractos corners half the price of euros because euros we get from importing and hyfrchtos corner we make at home euros is in bags hyfrachtos corner is in barrels euros you can sell at the store hyfroctos cornsyrp you sell to the i k ultrocrosess food manufacturer you cannot buy hyfrtos corner at the at the grocery store they are very different in terms of what they are used for hyfrchtos cornseurp is particularly egregious because it is missile because it is already a liquid you have probably remember chipsohoi cookies in the old days they would often would seem the sugar in the a cooky had crystallized cause the sugar content was high it is been will since have had one that they were not particularly good yet we now but you eat two of them and then you think they are good and anyone eat for the it's when touch ad the first body is in like the and then it is boys away there you go bell now it is techies of i cookies i creme reasons much that is hiforktos corner because because the two molecules are free they do not crystallize can actually up the dose several times throughout to day's discussion you have talking about the cortocot food industry case ism not a conspiracy theories but i now but i understand that most businesses exist to make money many businesses start off with good intentions and drift in order to stay i to stay competitive i and many many businesses as we know i not all of which are entirely bad such is the farmer suitable industry i you there bad they are finances of the of yod crisis but then there are drugs from the fharmicical industry that help save lives i mean that is my my stands i the food industry i think they are good actors and they are bad actors but where tine about the food industry y whet we die about the exercise industry we doe about the podcast industry and in you got good actors and bad actors but what you have alluded to several times here and you are more inform than i am is a a a concerted effort to lace food with a form of sugar that makes people crave more of that food and that is causing metabolic illness disrupting met country a and on and on exactly and you are the physician not me i you have worked with patients or struggle with city and for various reasons not me and i we could probably spend hours if not days talking about all the terrible things that the forgot food industry is done but what do you think is that the pure motivation right i do not think that they want people to be sick but they want a sell product and this sells more product then it raises two questions if why is it that more people do not know about know this information although many more well know after was conversation but and certainly in government it is a me regardless of what side of the isle your honor if you are right in between they are they are clearly people that care about the health of themselves and others i can understand how things might have got into this point but what do you think or the barriers to getting people to appreciate just what a problem this is and and getting people to change their choices in terms of what that they are eating are they truly addicted to the point where they are sick they cannot make good decisions a a drug attitudes highly addicted to heroine is a sick person they have an illness and they need treatment but until they get that treatment they cannot make good decisions let us take an analogy also forty per cent omericans teetotalers never touch a stuff forty per cent of wider cent do not great ism not a big fan of aldol have never seen it make anyone better at anything than really matter no because that is drinking it is know us o completely vestibule there is no a by chemical reaction in the body it requires alcohol for the same reason by wifroctovs a forty per cent of social drinkers i can pick up a bur put it down ism in that category ten per cent or bens drinkers and ten per cent of chronic alcoholics now do you deprive the forty per cent of social drinkers because of the twenty per cent of bens drinkers an chronic bucolics i bell not people should be in choice but i believe people should know what they are doing that they can be in choice well right do as you i would say and i said this about the call episode which turn out to be one of our most prolific episodes where i said the no more than two drinks is the rows better than any and more than two drinks per week it you need to do other things to offset that and its problematic that what nose or what they day to say but i but i would they do as you want but know what you are doing well i would say that that is exactly what the food in the sure wants you to think that is that is the food industries mantra is you your own choice personal responsibility the question is is personal responsibility work answers know it does not every a public health tobacco in the history of mankind started out as a personal health as due before became a public health crisis and you can pick your a you personal responsibility issue whether it be exposures whether it the addictions whether i the infections bottom line is ultimately it required a societal response we can talk about syphilis we can talk about to birculosis ultimately needed a public health response we can talk about a teen pregnancy we can talk about tobacco tobacco ultimately needs a public health response because the sheer enormity of it and the a the egregiousness of it requires that public health response well turns out this is no different in order to exercise personal responsibility four criteria have to be met those four criteria are the following number one knowledge yet does the knowledge because if you do not have the knowledge and how can you exercise persona responsibility well in fact the public being kept from the knowledge we are doing this now in part to in to in train that knowledge to to get people to understand what the problem is ye i consider myself pretty informed about nutrition and health but a already to day have learned two does in facts about processing a fortes in color calories generally that i had no knowledge of prior that is good o k cause it is not about the mass it is about the science e they wanted to be about calories we have this thing call food science we have this thing could nutrition and we have this thing cold metabolic health they are not the same food science is what happens to food between the ground an the mouth nutrition is what happens to food between the mouth and the cell metabolic health is what happens to food inside the cell but all the chronic diseases that we are suffering from type you diesis i prevention slip a demiacarty of ask as these cans we dimension fat deliver disease papistical german disease those eight diseases which make up seventy five per cent of health care expenditures in the country to day are all inside the cell because they are all mitochondrial the function and there is no medicine that gets to the mite country although you and others at standard hazard et camera are starting this with metabolic psychiatry being one instance i inland you see us all as well for ai a get enjoys yes you you're home institution wonderful institution read up the road from afford wont things are changing people are string to think about myth contra they are o i say you miss off the first the first thing you said there four things that stand a very first one was in all name o second access cause if you do not have access than how can you exercise person responsibilities access to healthier alternatives exactly which means cost fit men i love buries from the farmers market more than love berries from the store i love the farmers markets generally be takes time energy to go there and the cost is actually lower at the level of what you hand the vender typically but a volume is tough to achieve they actually have me at a at a quota air not allowed to buy as many berries as i want at is the give sit of the people want my yes there is that right people have to feed their family that and well what were used to eating a lot of volume but you are able to at least go there sometimes we are talking about people who live in quote food deserts weals to talk about people who live in food swamps when tongue bat food swamps were not talking about and plethora of healthy foods were talking about all the junk that is what they live in the swamp of junk if you live in the swamp of junk how are you suppose exercise personal responsibility number three for affordability you have to be able to forger choice and society has to be able to forger choice and right now we cannot afford that choice because health care cause right now are at four point one trillion dollars a year but many things in a behavior all economics and health it is hard for people to see that the the immediate choice is leading to a higher cost on the road there just too many nodes of separation for people ha realize ay when ism reaching for this serial as opposed to making waffles for my kids from scratch or they are thinking time efficiency cost efficiency volume the kid's not throwing cantrumscause they are not no longer getting the serial and it is it very difficult to see this is the reason why health care costs or going out they are just too many notes of separation could not agree more but ultimately it is because the government separates an silos a food in the sure profits from health carecosts if you actually combine those because they allele be are the same you would see the problem global the food in the sure roses nine trillion dollars a year health care cut global cost eleven trillion dollars a year dietary related health carecosts environ mental costs cost seven trillion dollars a year and productivity costs out one trillion dollars year when you do the mass nine minuses eleven minus seven minus one means that there is a ten trillion dollar a year deposit because of out cleaning up the mess of the food in the street makes and while numbers tat at not affordable right i agree in while numbers that land really hard i find that for myself and for many people statistics that are hard to keep in mind in a way that is online about the human brain that hears that and goes wo where that war costs that much and this food issue costs that much and then we go to the store and were hungry and the kids are a are are hungry and and your and those notes of separation its it is almost a curl slash memory slash forefront of quarter issue to me and of course i look at everything through the lands of her biologyutoo not everything but most everything and how how could i not how could we not but then the the issue is wellthere still food on the shelves and and it is very what do we do to connect it is at brill closer together these not each on is i the government so the question is is their food on the shelves let me finish the fourth one and then i want to come back to that point let me just finish a concept affordability and number for externalities your choice cannot hurt anybody else but what if your choice does heart somebody else for tobacco second hind smoke it for also drunk driving but what is the argument for teen pregnancy that someone else was get a to raise the kids exactly but what about for food well how about the fact that your employer stand for university has to pay two thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars a per year in ability related health care expenses that they have passed on to you even though you are not bees that is affecting you that guys be city right there that is effecting you a but there nowadays it is especially tricky even to have the conversation ism willing to have it now which is that es have it there is this whole concept of fat shaming rights o somebody is ones whose fault is it and if we even talk about it is a are we subject to a attack legitimate attack it let u calling something oh some one ones at a clinical level i eking were you are an expert in do not it talk cloth do not talk about ability let us talk about diobedies o case it talk different consequence of o be city yet let us talk about the metabolic health issue itself the fact is that tiobedies is now eleven point four per cent of america what was it twenty years ago it was it is twenty years ago it was about eight per cent i was wondering this earlier twenty years ago there was a lot more majoring and refrigerators but people were thinner and there was less diobedies everything he tall us about martyring and translate is that is bad bad bad now butter is back as time magazine and you said right clearly cannot be the transition away from transfers that is increase o be city o no no it is con be the increase in sugar and the increaseinsr in undies hidden sugars and exactly that is right i the the keytho is tack stay in india because the and china they are not that but they have fourteen per cent diobedis rates and the thin the reason is because of ultriproses food are there any countries in the world that do not allow hyprochtos corn sir for at least not at the level that that we do oh the frlotloads there will boat loads of countries that a do not import hyrochtoscorn support do not make it i scan avian countries and the avian countries most of rope a the other than the age of pacific rim a japan has it facts invented in japan nineteen sixty six sogamedical s school talk a saki at all a a care has it a but australia does not have it land does not have it but they have just as much of an a obesity in diobedies problem as we do because they have sucrose because hook to scoinsurpend sucrose or no different metabolically it does not really matter that one to one it is we one to one thing exactly of ucosanfrta here is the question answered is one of go back to that you said all this food is still on the shelves is it food what is the definition of food can it give the definition i think most people would give that is not other the one i would i would give but a something that has c contains cleric energy re i i could eat this microphone abut it is not unprovided much useful energy the definition of food straight from the dictionary i believe me i looked it up and memorized it i believesubstraight that contributes to either growth or burning of an organism interesting that is the definition of every scientific one hundred per cent correct growth or burning any substrate that passes your lips that contributes to either growth or burning that is food who can let us do it lets do burning first i just showed you that sugar which is the worker of ultraprocess food and seventy three per cent of theaters in the grocery store are spited with sugar inhibits burning it inhibits those three endives involved in myth a conjugal function now it is do growth my colleague doctor from monsinego or non who is the chairmen of nutrition at her universal jerusalem actually looked at this question and showed that ultraprosses food actually in habits growth it inhibits cortical on growth it inhibits a tribecular bone growth it habits a chancellor spoke growth it habits linear on growth it high jacks growth for can sir because it inhibits it a country and you have to then grow instead of burn and this was work that was done in in vive or in nitro in vive invents to these are people that are eating high amounts of highly process exactly how did he find those the in the least that they found in israel they found bottom line is if a subtract does not contribute to growth and does not contribute to burning is it of food i see answer is now well that is seventy three percent of whats in the grocery store i would argue you said the foods there now it is not that is not food in fact it is consumable poison this leads to an important question of what is laughed read you remove all that what is caught i just anecdotally and what i sometimes call anecdota i and have had several friends in there forties and early fifties say they want to lose weight and get in shape and that the thing that is worked every every single time for them to lose significant amounts of weight quickly and keep it off and many of them were already exercising but then also increase or exercise was i just since ism not a dietician nutritionist or anything i just say eat meat fish eggs vegetables fruits you are nock in to eat starches you are nock in a drink you call you are nock in a drink soda you can still have coffee t you can still have artificial sweet news i will get to artificial n yeas an i bee we have to go that ism and the reason i say no starches even though i personally eat rice of meal pass o things that sort some in in moderation depending on on what for t of exercise and om doing in how much is because of the fact that nowadays many those things contain chfroctos and inevitably every one of those people is blown away by the fact that it quoting duo works and as soon as that is all because of reduced carry and take over all no and they lose anywhere from thirty to fifty five pounds and s keep it off and the this is great i can always till e retie stakes in salads and but there not eating crotons there and in some sense it looks extreme it sounds key to panic but it is nothing that you are just saying basically stay away from your limiting process foods your eliminating liquid calories in in general you and on and on and there is nothing s sophisticated about it and to my question to you is how much of that weight loss of fact you think is a calories universes calories out the fact use there eating a lot of food and in some cases and how much of it you think is the elimination or near elimination of this froths or this glucose fronts combination it is nothing to do with the calories it as everything to do with the insolent if you get the insolent down you're not shunting inters you to fat you can lose weight you are fat we will give up the the a the the truglastrides stored in it as soon as your insolent goes down insolent is pushing on your fat cell all the time and as long as your insolence up your falsely cannot release it the minute your insolent goes down you can now engaging what we call lipolysis foremost sensitive lie pace is a and andsi'm in the fat sell that is a inhibited by insolent as soon as the insolence gone foremost sensitive lie pase can turn that store trials ride into freeway acids angles oral and release it and you can lose weight get the insolent down and id all work the question is what makes insolent go up while two things refine cargo hydrate in sugar those are the two things that make insolent go up in addition branch chin to menaces make insolent go up as well lucky nice luring sailing which is in corned beef chicken and fish process food all right here is here is here is the deal in one concept my colleague doctor carols montero who is a professor public health at the universe of salpallo has done the world of great service he is developed a system for categorization of food promise it is called the nova system just means new but he is basically categorized every food anywhere in the world into one of for classes easiest way to explain this would be example let us take an apple noble c ass one would be an apple picked off a tree nova class too would be apple slices the stem deleted de skinned maybe nova class three would be apple sauce cooked macerated possibly it preservative ad maybe some extra sugar may be not nova class for would be a my dona's apple pie now does that mac dona's apple pie look anything that apple now is there even any apple in it maybe a maybe not maybe a time bit it is all flavoring hands et camera turns out this is epidmeologic data but none the less prospective have to etiologic data it is not useless that nova class for that ultra classes food category which is seventy three percent of the america grocery store is the class that is associated with all of these chronic minable diseases nova class one through three no problem now when you say associate what percentage of one's daily total clock can take needs to come from nova class for before that statement you just made is true because it it i love the recommendation you made earlier or that let us say the the contour of a you do not have to avoid desert you can enjoy desert rut do not et deserted at other times of day and mayor do not get desert every single night is their rule that people have to t desert every signals the answers about seven to ten per cent would be the upper limit you can get seven to ten per cent of your color can take daily clock can take from these nova class for foods and still they'll be o c still be oke so this is i know o ta that is not what is happened right i know some very healthy physicians who did on observe how people e moved was that i would pay attention in my your field right i was oh people all around me at stamped you see us have its are worth successful or else they would be there as i who looks healthy who can make it up the stairs and does not have to take the elevator how much exercise or people doing at a given age are they fanatic the know four in the morning runners ism not king to do that consistently muss i have to om and i i observe that many of the healthiest people i know they move a lot during the day they hate very well many them skip breakfast or launch not always and then i also knows that they would drink very little or no ow call and then but they would enjoy a ow there is one physician you see us have in particular something of who really enjoyed his dark chocolate kick cat after launch any sort very om ceremonial about the ironraveling that a the f was an the in the the and is i oke you are talking about that small percentage of calories if this that is if that is all you do hey god bless you but that is not what people are down that is the problem notum line that nova class for is wore all the action is n arms of chronic metabolic disease the questions how can you avoid that how do which is which we have a solution my colleagues and i have developed a web based tool that is available to the entire world right now and you will put it in your show notes that will put a link to this absolutes called perfect p are each t you can find it at perfect dot to and what it is is it is a recommendation engine not a i where you talk about a i in a minute but it is a recommendation engine based on the science of human metabolism that categorizes foods based on not their neutral content but on their metabolic effect resin and there is a nova filter which will filter out all the noble class for stuff and it will go to your grocery store and will tell you what you can by that will be a noble class one through three which turns out to only be twenty per cent of the grocery store it means basely thing on the periphery of the grocery the as that is general it in general a yes rot is to meat the air the all the things you mention in fact ism not low care ism low insolent and there lot of ways to get to low insolent get rid of the refine carbydric get rid of the sugar increase the fiber get rid of the branch chain o men acids a eating fish is a good place to be a even eating a stake is o say if it is a a pasture fed stake let us talk about your stake would you look a better for the animal thread it is absolute you mention marbling before we love a marbling it you can cut our you ask great mistakes with a butter knife because there tender it over been to argentina an my father's argal right that is not your are are not anyhow they only know who they only know grass god the only the idea that it hows would eat anything but grass its sorter the idea that a then there's a a it would it would fly absolutely new zealand same thing the meat is gorgeous its homogenous its pink its the life i been argentina the meat is fantastic but you have to use stake knife you cannot use a butter and it takes more chewing it and it takes us showings i cutis in you that is a it is a different experience entirely it is delicious but it is kind of a little that tougher turns out that marbling is intromit cellular lipid that animal has metabolic control the america and corned the america corn fed animal because that corn is filled with branch chain menoasses lucid saluting sailing brinchchinomioasses or what is in n proline powder that is what a body builders put in they're smoothies to build muscle and if you are building muscle that is o say because twenty per cent of remind acids in muscle or branch chain am you know if you have got a place to put them you have at it yet there is a need there here is an origan down ye but if you are not if you are you and a mere mortal me you consume those excess branch chinomio acids they are going to go to the liver they are going to be deaminate we talked about earlier and they are can end up as branch chain organic acids they are going a flood the mite contra the might a conjure not an to be able to deal with the volume and they are going to divert the excess and turn that into fat and now you have got hipertruglis ridemia and chance for fatty livened disease and insolent resistance what kind of meat you eat has a lot to do with your metabolic health what about the egg the whole egg near were perfect routine score in terms of its am a availability am exiterific there is nothing wrong with eggs there are better eggs than others theater well there is yellow a yoke eggs and they are orange yoke eggs what is the difference between a yellow o get and an orange o egg ism guessing that something about the a the feed of the the mother chicken am and ism guessing it probably also has something to do with cosine content will make a threes ah interesting the orange a yoke egg has a lot if will make a threes in it what are other great sources of o megatheres i have i know some off the top of i head by to hear from you case marine life is number one of a fish provided you are not bring in heavy medals wither well yes i mean that is always the the the argument the question is is hat the mercury that you make a threes ultimately i think its homage a threes that is more important but yes i do understand the mercury issue a a ultimately there are three ill make a threes there is ale a a line panic acid which you can get vegetables there is e p a i cosopento exotic acid which you can only get in marine life fishy cosoroyl r and finally d h e do not go hex exotic acid which you also get from marine life but you can get from ally you can get algal oil which the vegans will use do you am personally take anything to increase your omega three in take i know the there is even prescription o mega threes i take oupshoil you take o facial yet ye the i dike three i only take three supplements o gid to know it of that i will say that i always always always the behaviors first like during down s behavior is nutrition then only if needed and one can afford it then supplementation in prescription drugs and ism a big consumer of supplements and always have been frankly what ore the three a you take fish ofishol and do you take to get above ace in threshold of p about a thousand milligrams o say about a armada armada i i a it hm inset how much vie him in see a thousand pilgrims day you engine is palling yew enol it is actually for my rotation have got ta a a skin issue and invite helsehe health through helps with that interest and finally vote him and now i will tell you vote him indeed is a complicated one i an we can talk about vote him indeed and how either important or non important it is because there is a there is a work divine him indeed and a ait is important for your audience to know about its everybody in his brothers you know towtingvit him indeed s e tiger for everything it is or noting h is it that you have your supplement lovers haters and agnostics but vote him indeed somehow made it through the she everyone is provide him indeed is really interns o movie him indeed people are comfortable taking a we a vitehim indeed tail cap but other supplements where you say all may be om this might be good for a all m get threes fish ow them pupealobit more stand office it is really interesting that the kind of psycho social stuff around this how much vote him indeed do you personally take i take five thousand units to day i a do i vote him in the complicated though here is the problem if you look at the literature vote him indeed deficiency is associated with all these chronic metabolic diseases however supplementation with vote him indeed has not fixed any of those if you invite him indeed deficient why would not supplementation fix it couple of reasons one one of the reasons for it him indeed deficiencies cause everyone is drink in offerings that is one reason but there is a more important reason a sugar and artificially sweet in strings yet can deplete vote him indeed utile is it willow not consuming day was your consuming offerings but i cannot tolerate milk any more well yean take it i in but here is the here is the real nugget of truth and this is a little complicated but the indechronologists in the audience will get it vote him indeed is a are pro hormone it is not it is not active at all vote him indeed s converted in the liver first step to a compound call twenty five i drop vote him ended that is a prohormon it also is inactive it has no activity whatsoever from there twenty five hydro invite him and can be metabolized one of two ways it can either be one alpha hydroxilated in the c kidney to the active form one elephant it is one o twenty five die hydroxy it em and which will then do all f the business a it em and such as calcium absorption from the gut suppression of the immune system at the toll receptor four that sound a bad thing no as a good i know but i had to bring that out as it when ye says suppression that you insisted pe are ma aura suppress no that sound aids a good it suppresses inflammation it is a good thing at suppression infection and that is actually the point that were were getting to there are lot of good things about one twenty five i hydroxy item and however that twenty five hydroxy d that came out of the liver can be metabolized a different way it can be twenty four hydrocalated in inflammatory tissue light to berculos i sarcoid got inflammation and you will end up taking your twenty five hydroxy d which is a prohormon and turning it into the intact of twenty four twenty five i hydroxy d which then just gets excreted out in other words you consumed all this item and and it did not go where you needed it to go and the reason was because you are inflamed you have to fix the inflammation before the item and can be effective and ninety three percent of america are inflamed giving them item and it is nonfat into a damned thing to is reducing forts in take that one of the primary ways to reduce the steric inflammation absolutely what are some others reducing oxidative stress in general heavy metals adieu in cadmium very high and chocolate specially south america chocolate sorry now i am not a fan o chocolate i cot occasionally a little dark chocolate i said a if people are going to a e chocolate they should be careful how much chocolate well is get of in south america challah in process chocolate i mean the really good lo a me on the witless of many industries takes a that at on ta all i can tell you is have been on the witless for a decade numbs there you are just one big target it regret i got i it is on my back in a tictinywhere i ready got that a a there are a the main thing is to make that got work right fiber shorchain facias a production from fiber i is a huge a boon a reduce inflammation reduceinflamma not improving sleep is there any evidence that unochronic slight sleep deprivation can increase inflammation well what it will do is increase quarter soul and chronically increase quarter sol will definitely lad to increased inflammation in which is funny crabs cuartersouls usually considered the anting flamritoy but on we acutely right chronic cartel elevation does the also say f if we can w contribute to i have this secret a agenda which is net which is not a secret which is that people think coatis all is bad when in fact acutely coatis all does wonderful things provided its happening at the right time of day plan shifted sort is all bad too much or too frequent sort is all bad but cartel you you need it it is essential and i think must fee which is here carts all in his benssociate with all things bad and and may we can shhalpchiff that negro it's very happy evidence an into chronologist of this is in a were my well house is where i live a cartel is a good news bad news deal many things short tern gave for long turn pain when you are in what we call apostasies that is perturbation of homeostasis that is a stress in acute stress cartel is one of the things that helps you manage that bodily and mental stress an english test a for accident running away from the lion i o famous in o pig me running away from the lion all of those require carte soul in order to manage and mitigate that stress the upcoming twenty twenty four election that is chronic stress it is not a kinostress me it's the worst they will be the only mention of politics yes monas a and we do not have to go there but we are all chronically stress and we can talk about why that is and what is going on and ism actually very interesting that an a colleague of mine in parts and i have built a computational model of the limbic system which focuses on the stress center of the brain the misdeal to understand how chronic stress is different from acute stress and how that chronic stress ultimately leads to metabolic and mental health disaster very interested in learning more about that before we touch on that you have wort a lot with kids a people age as you put it zero to nineteen i do not know bout the the exact numbers but when i was growing up there were some kids in school that were over weight but it was the occasional kid it now it seems to penny on wire one draws the threshold for over weight it seems that there are lot of kids that are overweight a how about twenty five per cent jobs and forty per cent overweight i obviously a serious problem serious now an going forward and what about adults in the ass am remember seeing at a meeting a map of of sit in the you ask and am over time and it very quickly filled in from very few people we obeys to very many colorado is this a was this l brain of of of fit people but now it is no longer and that is be she to o a it'll tell you why the there are for things that can increase my ticondrial aby a genesis you you tell me altitude is cold i o my colorado lessons altitude that is my color a is less obis and a a r the other two but those with the reason tit had nothing to do with being more fit it had to do with cold and altitude example switzerland compared to germany they got the same crafty food but switzerland has half the obesity the germany does i on switzerland is higher i love the food when i go to eunuch i love the schnitzels an wonder to our crowd and they got that switzerland to i the great food switzerland lessobios it same way colorado lessons it is because of the altitude you mention cold a many listeners this podcast are at least interested in some a also practise deliberate cold exposure cold showers cold plunges mainly for the am i think the best ate are the increase in catacomb means up an ifronarpan iran dopa mean that are long lasting people feel a big stateshif they feel better but when one looks at the effects on metabolism they are pretty slight they are is their slight however studies that to me always seem a short sighted in the sense that if there is a longer art of effect on the might of conduit that is affecting other things in terms of how calories are processed or how calories are feeding into a mite cordial function or dysfunction there i could see how it might shift the am shift the scale to speak i mean cold as it is an amazingly powerful stimulant and am i think of light cold food movement sound the core for ways in which you can shift physiology easily all f these things are eminently manipulable and for almost zero dollars but you have to know what you are doing and right now we have been actually kept from that knowledge and if you are addicted it is really hard to predict yourself that brings us back to this thing about am food industry conspiracies government conspiracies and the rest boy the sis can to be an interesting god action by what are we do if you and i go up to cap capital hill which have done which you've dawn in and may be it'll join you some day and you are see us all om down at stay for your cognition ism a scientists and and a public health advocate a podcast and we explain to people hey listen there is that the food is laced with the drug it is it it is not even really food it is it is right s not food it is an aggregate of food and non food parts that make you think its food it is ore s time people hay your kids are you other swimming in a swimming for looks water but it is actually part poison in it is and it is harming them it is giving them o if you say those kinds of things i mean congress men and women are they are reasonably smart people right i mean are are they gin to do something about it no what where is the conflict is it that the food in destroy has om the government by the short hairs that is exactly right and they have them by the shorthands where i mean is it they lining their pocket's something where where there is the average acts actually exerted o case the they are lining their pockets that is number one that is absolutely true we have the day to support that blanch lincoln who was a senator from orkansel who is the chairman of the patrician committed you he t see her campaign contributions every time she was up for reelections it is all about getting reelected or it is about them having a a third home in h champions i think it is the third home in the champions who can within is it is really as bad as it is as some of the documentaries without mas believe without question good no and pecan an we have the data there is a a an organization that a absolutely one to call out because they are you a chemist egregious organ a a political organization on the face of the earth they are called the america legislative exchange council alit or alit and they right bills they are a bill mill and they are for whoever gives them money and who gives them money big farm big aura big i and a a big food an your so your including big farmer your physician you have written scripts before you have written prescriptions formations before is not that farm that provides the drugs that allows your patients to feel better well the question is do they do they feel better this is a big question let us you want ta going writing o go i but you are writing the script i mean that ma ism just try ohuntrin agism nothing you but i see oo you do not the you hove to be instances where some one stroy deficient and you give them too if if you have got a disease and a medicine will replace what is missing sure k for deficiency diseases which as an in chronologists that is what i do absolutely and i did that with no compunction of a a impropriety whatsoever but that is not what we are talking about here let us talk about what we are really talking about let us start with states states lower el die o k the states reduce hart disease yes or not i seem to be lifting to day on all the quizzes and a r ma at the level ism on a go with no but but i will say my friend and i think is expert a physicians well you o peter area and others has talked about some of the positive attributes of states in certain cases for cerise certain cases that is exactly right and i completely agree and by the with peter's a friend and some day will all all go out drinking together i will not drink wet a wo y have awisharis day shares ya her a a solute you got it you gas i do not i do not if you you d drinks the we er if you are listening e you drink the low or house on me don't you desert or the or the i can any more but but ism and it is not so i can love to be honor in titian's i can to the next morning and and a keep up with you guys it is in i get the for primary prevention that is your elderly high you need a state that is primary prevention you have not declared yourself you have not had an event for primary prevention the mean increase in life's pan for being on a state is four days for was tor days rs an an to who that is that is a and the risk for diabetes is twenty per cent increase what about any improvement and in quality of life none for primary prevention now for secondary prevention for secondary other as you have already declared yourself you already have a problem for secondary prevention that is where states shine there is a value to them ism not arguing that and if you have familial hypoclestrialemia which is one and five hundred not only you need a state but you needle of father and a priest tuque there is definitely a value to states but not for primary prevention but that is whateverybod whatever doctor's doing o your eddy ell its over eighty you need a state that is ridiculous that is absolutely a joke and the data show that in fact in fact my colleagues seem malhotra in the use participated in an analysis where they took the entire you k population and they took out everybody under age sixty five looking at people sixty five to ninety and it turned out that the media level correlated with longevity the higher the elder the longer they lived when you took out all the people who had problems evil is not really the problem and the reasons us there too ell dells there is one cold large boy into this one call small dense turns out dietary fat raises your large buoyant your large buoyant is irrelevant it is cardie vascular neutral but that is the one the state's effects the small dense that is the pathogenic particle when your small dense el delis high that means you are not clearing trugliseride pearly because that is with small dense show you that is that that is what happens to trugliss ride is because they becomes small dense can i take a guess and say that the best way to reduce small tennis to reduce insolent yes by reducing sugar because that triglasrrite is made in the liver ts one palmitate and that the only fat that the liver knows how to make and traglaserite is your liver output of carnal hydrate that is how you have to look at truglistru arugulas try turns out to be much more important as a crazy of sclerous factor then dial ever was dis the does big farm and big food do they know all of thus yes i know they knokecause they have told me and but they have states to and foods in the i the know of class for they know this to you woman optimist ere what what is a going to take to really move the needle an you described the four barriers were trying to add to the knowledge component now yo what is again take is i going to take a having a president an office or a congress people in office that really understand care about this stuff ye mean to really revamp the whole system et right now the system is completely and utterly broken completely newly broken and there is a reason why it is completely nearly brookecause the food in street likes it that way well it is profitable for them obviously there are fifty one different federal agencies that manage our food fifty one and none of them know what the other ones doing and the food in the street likes it that way communication across these fifty one organizations would help well if we had a centralized food a car or food if we split the food of t f d because it is it is not the it it is the d or the it is not the food and drug administrations the federal drug administration they spend a lot of time on drugs my spend almost no time on food lit is think about where there is been success i can recall when people smoked on plains i actually recall going to a him in rope and there was an ash tray molded into the squat rack yet that was telling i do not see people smoking cigarettes around stamford hospital any more but i remember when they initially said that people could not smoke anywhere except in with this one little designated area and that is typically what you see nowadays and my understanding of the anti smoking campaign at least for kids for people eighteen and younger was that telling people it was bad for their health did not work it's showing them lungs that were de credit did not work that not what worked was showing them commercials of cackling handwriting whit guys who were talking about how much money they were making off of these a naive kids who were buying cigarettes another tobacco product it became a the the effective campaign t and smoking g in young people was to high jack there inherit rebelliousness of youth and then they were no enol in a a mandzrekit to them that the as my friend calls it the two bit the two finger business car an no and that worked that work i somebodies making a come back when vaginas a separate episode we want it into that but because nicotine dill addictive but you do not see a lot of people smoking cigarette we work something that you would never imagine could ever work work well yes no i mean that is part of it ism not o to tell you that is not it is part of it a and we actually have an example of how that could be applied to another a a a tons exsuptans sugar we had berley versus big soda that is how berley ended up with its soda tacks that dates back to two thousand and tecitiof berley city berley we just celebrated the five year anniversary of the berley soda tacks and we have been able to actually look gestational diabetes wait down i be city down slightly not a lot but a little bit a cart ascus disease down dean shillinsire and christmadson at that you seeasef and you see berley just presented at san francisco general just a three weeks ago a t attacks the cigarette tax is make soda expensive exact you tell me that it can cop that i buy on static avenue and berley cost more than a canna coke that i buy in on university avenue in pallautha it does ski by a dime and now was and sufficient enough to to create this kind of change well yes it i money hurts cause money hurts exactly angry there have been four counter four cultural tectonic shifts in america in the last thirty years and they are all undeniable here they are number one bicycle helmets and seat belts a everybody uses thus two smoking in public places nobody does that three a don't driving hopefully f your people are doing thatfour condemn and bothers condemn in bathrooms and bothers in public bothers ye you see those of more available in thirty years ago if a legislator stood up in a state house and proposed legislation for anyone of those four and i do not care foison a state you sir and a congress or parliament or the damar anywhere else in the world that again laughed right out of town any stay liberty an shoes get out of my bitch end get out of my bath and get out of my car today all face life nobody's bellyaching about any of those point is we were able to solve those for public health to buckles how did we do it how did we solve those for no one could imagine that we would ever solve smoking right but we did sort of and brought consumption down by half that is pretty good when you think output i wen addictive how many fewer people are dying of longcancer nowadays and the of it is eighty per cent lower wat is also ban improvements in treatment but i no but it is it is dig nose tit it is into incident intents gone t amaze eh because tobacco's gone de the question is how did that happen the answers very and why did it take thirty years to do it we taught the children the children grew up and they voted and the nay layers are dead that is how you make a cultural tectonic shift we now have this real food movement we have people who ere arguing against ultraprocess food we have kids who are demanding different in their schools and by the way what is the biggest fast food franchise in the united states get this wrong try me again i do not know have never tried it but have heard of a is it chick fall no tit make locals i do not know it is this nation's public schools ah you can add up mac donates subway burger king my and a wends and every other a fast food franchise jack in the box every flatfoot franchise in the entire country and would only be half our nations public school how could you imagine a world where they were no class three were class for nova foods allowed in in public schools and we are doing it i am the chief science officer of a non profit and put this in the show notes called eat real eat readout or and we have a new business model for public schools in nineteen seventy one the department f education issued an administrative ordinance called resolution to forty two another did this purely on monitariisions recent is was under ninon and what this resolution to forty two said was that all school cafeterias all throughout the country had to make book they had to basically cover their costs they could not be lost leaders for the school they had to fend for themselves well this sent every foot service director in he country scurrying for in how pagan a do this cause i got all these a you a lunch ladies which personnel and and food preparation equipment and and and cops that mounting how ami going to break even they could not do it in walks oramarkand a disco and agugenheim and monads and they say hey will do it for you will provide every kid in america with a nutritious meal every single day hot lunch well they did not say hot oke the just at lunch nutritious they said nutrition and i put that near quote to cause it was not nutritious and here is the added benefit you can take your food preparation facilities and your a a footprint in the school and you can turn that into class rooms cause your gin a meet and that was the got because as soon as you have moved the food preparation facilities out of the school you are now hostage to the food in the street for the rest your life and i could also see how that allows room for them you use these commodities foods food that have very long shell for life exactly right because you want to make sure that me off you only sold i two thirds of the lunch is that were prepared that on next tuesday after the week and you could still give them food that is not moldy exactly right and t i will tell you that is how it happened and you can actually trace i us schools and reading and math scores in this country down from nineteen seventy one to today when i went to school i was allowed to get i call that hot lunch cause it was usually hot it was am allowed to get the school lunch one day a week one day we other days i had to bring my lunch and that one day was pretty special you feline you were getting a treat i was usual corn dog at were a hamburger the hour was pretty poultry but anthem as a commodities tan bury i commotion hamburger m yet to go looking for the party organ a and the bread was sweeten and as it was different but i i do not remember nearly as much wold be s i went to high school in the early nineties i see your saying that now if i went to a high school it would be a lot more sodas and donuts and i peetethe and got pets as a vegetable didn't i they claim ins a vegetable congress said pieces of vegetable my clobeshar made pets of vegetable may they need their eyes because the biggest frozen pets a a a producer is it minister i in cad o visit vegetable was it was a was a scratch but at least it it made sent on the nova system of going from tomato all the way to a to a catch i to can since hook to corn surplice the primary ingredient and catch i indeed the point is that our kids are suffering under the wait the burden of this chronic disaster of ultraprocess food which is not food and no wonder they're all obese and a a a sick and i you no doing truly in school and by the way also depressed ultraprocess food has now been shown in three separate studies to correlate with depression in tea natures what is the relationship between process food or maybe we call it nova system level three four foods and depression another psychiatric challenges and if you could you separate out metabolic centrum from obesity om in answering that is there is something inherently depressing about carrying excess anapest tissue a setting side any kind of aesthetic i a stuff o how people want to look or are perceived just is there anything bad about caring lot about body fat independent of the metabolic centrum for wooden and over all sens of well being ism really glad to ask that anthem we should have actually covered this earlier am everyone thinks fates fat as we have learned fat is not fat and a fat is not a fat but a body fat is not body fat there are three fat depot and they are metabolically different first is the does this bathing suit make me look fat fat by the way never answer that question that is called subcutaneous fat or big but fat if you will here is the question how many hounds or kilos of subcutaneous fat do you have to gain before you become metabolically ill ism no idea that ten kilos about twenty two pounds why the reason is because that subcutaneous fat drains into the systemic circulation you have to have a lot of side o kinds coming from those subcutaneous ataposites to raise the blood level ossific kinds to the point where it starts doing damage at the level of the liver fats are releasing side kinds which are groin lavatory exactly and then they're doing that at rest any fat sell any fat any fail but if it is going to the systemic circulation you of a volume of distribution of six leaders you have to lose you have that a lota side a kinds to get the concentration up now just out of fairness to the fat how many did o kinds does a muscle cell release i mean i are we unfairly picking on anapest tissue cause why would tapes tissue make be groin lavatory i mean a single fat sell we oi have got a fat sellisitting at you on my shoulder some place river i mean ism not is yellow fat at my shoulder why would it be proineflamatory in fact the fat sell itself is not here is what happens the fat ell has a fat vacua it has a storage place for this lipid droplet you stuff it stuff it stuff it the fat vacua gets bigger bigger bigger the parilyphe and border that that encompasses that fat vacua that borders the the it is the space ultimately cannot get my bigger and it starts breaking down when that happens it spills the grease into the fat sell the fat sell dies becomes ne credit that calls macrophages in to clean up the grease and it is the macrophages that release the side o kinds i in fact the fat sell is not the problem it is the break down of the grease that lea leads to the macrophage activation that is the problem but when you do it in subcutaneous fat it is going into the six leader tank and the concentration does not go very much ten kilos before you start seeing some effect fat depot number too visceral or big belly fat how many pounds r kilos of big belly fat to have to gain before you get metabalcleal i do not know but ism messing its less than twenty two it is wayless for once i got answer right to tat not five that five pounds now questions why number one the visceral fat does not drain into the pinto the systemic circulation it drains into the partial vein which goes straight to the liver sou getting a bigger load going straight to the liver of side o kinds not to the kidney not good thing about getting an answer wrong folks as they never forget the correct answerthat is what i always the tell mys entry it'll never forget that in the got and the question is what made the visceral fat in the first place was it calories no it is quartersaw it is stress it is the combination of the sympathetic nervous system and quartersaw and the reason we know this is because you can take nations with major depressive disorder with indigenous depression or suicidal who have to be admitted to the hospital to keep themselves from killing themselves stick them in a scanner and they are losing subcutaneous fat crashers there not eating but they are gaining visceral fat because of the high quartesoul on the stress to there is something about the it turn a cuorticuoi to receptors in that area that just preferentially demo fat there when cords all's high indeed because that is the metabolically active fat i and five pounds will do it and then finally the third fat depot the liver now how many pounds of fat can the liver store before you become metabolically oi got a be even lasbecause the livers not nearly as large as the abdominal region half around quartervicul how much is a healthy liver way healthy liver ways fifteen hundred grams no it is not very try translate quickly to pounds if we we are going matrix we are going n at he standards fifteen hundred grams would be three pounds basically half around as not very much because that is where the action is and when you have fat in your liver it causes metabolic dis function right away the question's where did that fat come from that came from alcohol or sugar alkali on sugar most metabolically aggreegious cause it affects the liver directly stress second most because it effects the visual fat and subcutaneous fat the least important in terms of metabolic derangement yes it may not look good in the bathing suit but from a metabolic standpoint it is actually the least importance the question then becomes all right what are you trying to fix if your trying to fix liver fat it is really easy get rid of the alkali on the sugar except of course they both the fictive will that also liberate any fat that is already in the liver absolutely that's one of the reasons why interment fasting works is because it gives your liver chance to basically awe load what it is already start that is one of the things that interment fasting will buy you is a little at a less liver that is a good thing i now stress on the other hand as and as we have talked about n as you have hat doctor less apple on your a podcast before yo stress is tough trying to mitigate stress especially in to day's environment and i hope you will invite me back some time to talk about teethe roll of stress on a the mig gladly i and then finally subcutaneous fat when people go on diet sweetness what are they doing are they really reducing the fat the answer is no want try to artificial sweeten or itificie diet sweetness of any sort you can pick your artificial sweetener a spar ertaam or into surely suable o be a stove mong fraud o a the new ones you knower the one that people are more excite about nowadays is a lo hall yous expensive it tends to have less of an artificial sweetener taste that people can detect right om you are saying that regardless of oh and we should ism remembering from the comment section i do read them artificial sweetness an non colonic sweet nurse yes because an when the mommy say artificial people say what about stein what about all soles us say om a none colonic sweetnurse can wrap our arms round all that entire category unless we need to distinguish among the different participants in that category see you are saying that even though people can om lower there total color can take pretty effectively have seen the studies that show of you deters who consume o water one my is there main liquate versus diet dos with aspartame typically or stein the diet soda drinkers actually lose more weight but were know that but your saying there may be deposition of fat in the liver in those individuals be specifically because of the artificial sweetener because of the insolent turns out there still an insolent response the very famous study done in a copenhagan a hundred normal individuals twenty five in four different groups one group one of one leader of sugar soda per day for six months one leader that is a last sugar yet one group one leader of dianoia per day for six months i pride to that in gradual one group one leader of milk per day for six months pride to that when i was an infant and finally one final group one leader of hate per day for six months i do that now i do more than that but ya the one leader of soda per day in six months gain ten kilasthe sugary soda e sugar ten kills maculas no surprise the one leader of water per day lost tubular also no surprise those were the easy ones now's do the ones in the middle one leader of milk per day no change per only that was full fat milk i baa euro full family they there the that to fat million change why is that there taking on an enormous increase in total color can take ism guessing that the s a blunted in clean response due to the fat in the milk and also because lactose is not a very a a big driver of insolent response and because this as satiny effect that is the eat less to food and finally the key the kicker r to the whole thing diet the one leave of die her what what would you predict their weight would do more weight lost than in the water group based on my understanding the literature they gain two kilos old because they hate mar well you tell me why did they gain to kilos if they were consuming the leader of diet soda which are zero calories the answers because they still generated an insolent response and that insolent response generated more hunger more more weight and more hunger exactly and that is the key they did not gain the ten kilos they gain to kilos it looks better compared to the sugar a a version but it looks a problem compared to the water version or even the milk version unless you boots trap calories and hold that constant you are into see weight gain to to artificial sweetening exactly right and that is been shown fifty ways from sundae at a whole bunch of different studies compared to sugar ye it's better but compared to water it is way worse and the reason is the insolent response you put something sweet on the tongue message goes tongue to brain sugar's coming message goes brain to panties through the vaguest nerve sugar's coming release the insolent and tongue does not know if its sugar or not it releases the finds that pancreas releases the insolent which drives energy into fat whether it was enough from the a diet sweet or not i i saw some really interesting data from data smalls croup at male up showing that when people have a diet soda with food says the diecokue with the san nicer with the burger may ben with the post the insolent response from the food and the insolent response from the diet soda are compounded but there is a classical conditioning effect pavalovian effect such that than later if they just drink the diet soda they get an even bigger insolent response just to the diet soda than they would have originally if they only have the diet soda separate from food another words the the insolent the food induced insolent response is conditioning a greater insolent response from the diet soda and we act would have another study that demonstrates the same thing out of singapore a say at all a in mericonjernal clinical nutrition two thousand eighteen i believe that looked at a similar paradise here is what they did they took a bunch of people and they admitted them to their clinical r search center for times a week apart and they did have ben random order and each time they a started the morning the fasting and they did either a sucrose tolerance test or an a aspartame tolerance test or sucres tolerance test or a monk fruit tolerate test two hours in jesting one of the the one of the four and measuring glucose insolent over the course of the next two hours fasted fasted then it was time for lunch and they let them have whatever lunch they want it was a metabolic buffet they could eat whatever they wanted off the buffet except that they were n being clocked and the same for dinner they are being clucked but they could eat whatever they want any given period of time in the twenty four hours they're n from seven a m to seven p m whenever they went home turn out they so cross talents ts generated an in silent response as you would expect they on fruit the sit the be a a scrolls and the aspartame did not but then when they ate lunch they if they had one of the three diet sweeteners in the morning they ate more at lunch and more at dinner and generated an increased insolent response both at lunch and dinner that the area under the cure of the whole day was exactly the same they eat a big significantly more ye because they had the diet soda in the morning wile well i drinkdrinks that contain stein and i do not worry about it too much but what your saying is even if i woulds strap my calories there is a possibility that the insolent response could have direct of facts on the liver exactly right and not for the better and not for the better now having said that a we have undertake an interesting project which i do not know if about a in two thousand twenty during the pandemic i was approached by a food company in the middle east cold quay danish dairy company kat my it is the neatly of the matdleast now they make all sorts of jump frozen roger flavored milks i scream confectionary biscuits tomato o says e quite has an eighteen per cent diabetes rate and an eighty per cent be kitty rate big zereigt zero we in the adults i now the company recognized that they wanted to be a metabolically healthy company and they knew they were not they contact to me and said would you put together scientific adores retene to advise us what we need to do to change the food in order to be a metabolically healthy company and we want a lead and i said weld be ha it'd be happy to do that with one proves o we get tho publish what we did that i can serve as a road map for the rest of the food in the street they said fine and i convened on scientific adores ream my colleguble from older sin who restored the very first farmers market in losangelis and is now actually the director f sustainability nutrition for kat my a a temparlin who is the head of culinary medicine a gorge washington university rather saw who is a fatiacid expert who ran the all make a three for egad d trial at the anna ah and address cornchtot who actually a computer scientist from standard and we basically stripped down every single thing that kat my did in terms of procurement in terms of ingredients in terms of packaging we submitted every single ingredient to build chemical analysis we cause you could not trust what the venders were basically telling kat my was in the food we had had to actually know what was in the food that was a half a million dollars will by itself i mean this was not a cheap littleyou knowavesojourn into the woods this was a big deal we basically re engineered there entire one hundred did item portfolio and they have now turned over ten per cent of their products to be metabolically healthy and the precepts that we set in this paper which is in frontiers in nutrition in march of this were two thousand twenty three threshings three principles if you adhere to these three principles you can turn any food healthy including ultraprocess food number one protect the liver number two feed the gut number three support the brain if you have a food that does all three of those it is healthy if you have a food that does none of those three then it is poison because is n tough food insane i always con say it does not unlike love that is the right the right descriptor in that case exactly and if it is does one or two but not all three there can be somewhere in between the goal was to take all of katydid's products and move them from the lowest here up to the highest here by adhering to these three principles and we came up with some very simple things number one got to get rid of the sugar number two got a ad fiber number three got o atom make a threes number four got a do something about the emulsifiers cause the emulsifiers are causing the got inflammation because after all emulsifiers in nutrurgents they hold fat in water together they burn a whole the music were they are actually contributing to that good inflammation and emulsifiers are in stream throughout ultraprocess food them were heard about hidden sugars e lot i drink to day's episode and elsewhere but based on everything told us of bout artificial excuse me low callous sweet nurse am it makes more sense to me now why foods that are not towed as diet foods would be laced with things sukerlos because it should drive the craving for that food through increases an insolent and craving of other foods later that day and later that evening is that why non clerk sweetness are added to all sorts of foods now that because typically one things non clerk sweetness probably only added to concodiet foods lowcalory foods but that is not that is there o your is it is that that is not the case and they are adding that is wat die sweetness to foods that you did know how that sweetness in i that is right therefore two reasons that this happens one is insolent because insolent blocks lept in signaling at the level of the hypothalamus and the newly seccumbence with the block slept and lepton is the hormone that your details make that tells you brain you have had enough if insolent block slept in it makes you hungrier and it also extinguishes it stops the extinguishing of reward by that food that you want more of it it does both because lept an normally suppresses food and take and reduces craving the analogy that comes to mind is a slot machine that encourages you to feed more money and hit go to pull the lever but it all blinds you to the outcome even if you win you do not even know that you have winds it is also blinding you to your losses your effectively becoming a a tomato of just eating without any conscious understanding of what your your bringing in or tasting the food any longer exact right it is not this an onolemki when she came on the podcast a author of opening nation and nevis ahead of a a due die not is a diction cleaning one talked about these these a consumptive behaviors where the scrolling social meeting are consuming porn or a consuming drugs are you call in a way that they are not in touch with the pleasure of of the substance or behavior any more they become automatons but they but if they do not do it they feel lousy the pleasure is gone the pain ans deaconry to waiting tolerance in dependence that is the definition of edition dope is not excusatory narrow transmitter it excites the next neon always there is no such thing as dopamine exhibiting a postnaptic hero dopamine stimulates the next neon and it does not matter which dopamine receptor it is one through five it is always elucidatory now there's to be excited that is why they have receptors but there is to be tickled not bludgeons chronic over stimulation of any neuron and this leads to neuronal sell death and the reason is because the neuron needs energy the neuron is the most energy dependent a tissue in the body it needs those might conjure it to be pumping out eight p crazy to engage and nerve transmission well when you're firing non stop you risk sell es the thexcitatory neuron tattle pussinatic grant has a plan be it down regulates the receptor it down regulates the dope me interceptor there is less chance that any straight opening molecule will find a receptor to being to and this is its plan be in order to try to mitigate the risk of dying well what is tat mean in human terms it means you get a hit you get a rush receptors go down next time you need a bigger hit to get the same rush i receptors got down need a bigger hit a bigger hit a bigger hit until finally need a hit to get nothing that is cold tolerance and then when the horns do start to die that is cold addiction that is what we have got and that is what is happened in terms of food addiction the question is what is a fictive is fat eductive no cause if fat was addictive than all the people on the catkins diet or on the kutojenicti e would be gaining weight not losing it and it'd be craving revise all day i o revive pretty often actually but i know i know people say no but e lit my limits are in in line and i i do not want many starches an i certainly avoid sugar although now ism thinking i might want to really reduce my a localerie a sweeter in take i do not see myself reducing my stein and take to zero cause it is in somethings i really endure i am not the foot police a own ways say that you're not a cop but dam why but but date our data and and health date are the the it dato say that if that is not helping you any that is with the at o say a point is that the it's not the problem the salt's not the problem the canines a problem realafines he classic a fictive captions an y level abut a others vile problebut if if one can cut out caring by the early afternoon or even sooner in the day and it is not consumed to access am and it is in the former coffee your hamate some other form that is really is it really that much of a problem a i love coffee o you neat tontthat is my edition with a capital ell underline bold face i i i i i feel your pain and the answer is no one has shown that coffee is toxic it is addictive but it is not toxic now if you mix the coffee with alcohol i got for loco now it is toxic but innit of itself canine is not a toxic and that is why there is a gearbox on every street corner but it is highly reinforcing i did not eposes on canine wit om covered some data that was publishing the journal science one of three ape journals am and if you put taken unbeknown to the consumer into plain yogurt people will crave plain roger in the much more i mean people the feeling of being canary as longs as not creating anxiety levels of energy eat on ism artistic with caring that is fin can li we have beentell you loved about the hypothalamus as well as some primeval got base mechanisms for hunger and satiety i this is a great opportunity to talk about some of the goop one agonists that are now i widely use thing it t typically call those aspic but goop one wood on petite one ism originally discovered in the help monster which eats very seldom and some really smart biologist tat la biology this sat how come they do not have to eat very much will they have their blood is loaded with got one i and they only have to one whatever heels monsters delight in per year or something outrageous that humans make cop one well minor standing is that go p one that that not that is injected but that one i makes naturally is acting on both the brain and the got to increase the tied is acting on the brain argument but the primary action is only g go p one decreases the rate of gastric empty that is it is primary driver yes it does affect the braining that arguing that it does but the primary effect is to reduce the rate of gastric emptying you stay fuller longer because the food does not move through the stomach in the intestine interesting south a mess was in a beguine argentine is long thought that i your remote consumption which we know very modestly increase is got one and by the way a lot of other things due to i that people were taking it for its of after meals for its laxative of fact harshly b that is yo pleasant fun but that is that is a the to the clean that is a the mi h on rate bet stomach but it is use fairly effectively for people to space their meals without snacking that our the know and maybe its the go p one may be t something else m but people are injecting themselves with got one analogues now n at certainthing no e solos o month yes hat what it costs that is what close right non and it seems to be pretty effective at inducing weight loss although a significant mound that way lost seems to be from a skills muscle tissue and we are me to talk about and whatare your thoughts on aspic as as a primary i early you talked about primary and secondary control i y u refer to it a will but differently in the contacts of stations i e kid comes in his ones or slightly over weight as i will not nought to do ism try in eat better exercise or a person comes in says hey a have had a really hard time getting that last twenty a nine pounds off for many years will you prescribing of epic the sure in so is number one ism retired not to prescribe in anything but let us we let let us let us go wither the data so that geese one analogues semiglutide and now tersepitide which is a lily's version amongoro is the diabetes version zip bound is the obesity version on same way that osmic is the diabetes version for a a novonortos and we got is the obesity version they are all help pe one r all he's the copy one alter synthesize in a lab it looks goop he once tells i grope when taxi hope one when injected there's episode the a lily one actually has a duel function it a binds to the g i p receptor might have double duty and the data show that it is actually even slightly more effective at weight loss than the novonortos version will be seeing a shift in terms of a a consumer preference soon no doubt but here is the thing you look at the data one year a treatment sixteen per cent weight loss and that sounds great and on the same as bad and goodeople are not craving food all the time is that because people are feeling full longer right s there eating less there eating less tan is a gallery an carry out model there eating less and they are losing weight i not arguing that and they might be craving alcohol lass according to some reason yes ye we were can go there for a minute too in a second here is a probe when you look at that sixteen per cent weight loss as you just said when you put people in a deva scanner they have lost equal amounts of fat and muscle is a good to lose muscle it is not good ask any little old lad who breaks er hip if she wish she she had a little bit more muscle or somebody who died at lost a lot of muscle cause they were not offsetting the weight loss with resistance training or some other form of exercise and the amount of food that they can eat in order to maintain that weight to put it in scientific terms socks and we mention peter a tea earlier we in out live he is made at very clear that sarcopenia lack of muscle mass is one of the drivers of mortality losing muscle is not a a a a good idea but you lose equal amounts of fat muscle what else causes loss of equal amounts of fat and muscle starvation in fact the reason that all these grope one analogues work is because you stop eating the it creation ye just the muscle the olmossers a gree chalky to me well ask another helomonster but unfortunately whatever answer it provided was not not inane the point is that starvation is not good and if you think about why it is working dit is reducing gastric the rate of gastric emptying i well it turns out that that is the reason for its side effects the reduction in gastric emptying that why you get nausea that is why you give vomiting that is why you get pancreatitis and most importantly now pastor paresis your stomach turns to stone and you cannot move any food through your intestine at all and worse yet when you stop the medicine the gastraparisis does not get better this is not a good idea this is the opposite of the our bromaandioust effect which has a sort of probative gastric emptying maybe help one agonist gash oke it is obvious why people who have struggle to lose weight it especially if their struggle to lose weight was at least in their mind the consequence of being hungry all the time and needing to for or was it because of the reward and the their dependents because in fact yes a a a the is giopione analogues reduce reward and that is one of the reasons why they have notice that you n thing a a reduction in alcohol consumption a as well and that sounds a good thing except there also numerous cases now of major depressive disorder in response to these drugs it's anything now treats on or something for the treatment of addiction well you an sometimes can be useful but now but the your attempting to remove the the am the amplitude of that reward signal ism an a lot on paper it make sense but the but it does not always an a hacks it does not play out that is right and ism in a refer you now to a an old a literature that a was from two thousand six there was a drug that was approved in rope called romonabant hate a trade name accomplish and was approved in a rope for weightless and it was pretty good at weightless caused about twenty per cent weightless it also cause severe depression and twenty one suicides it is no longer available because it was the end yet it was pulled from the european market never approved in the united states and the reason this happened because this was the untie marawana drug this was the anytime munchies drug this was an end canabonoid antagonist well when you reduce reward you also reduce your desire to live and that is why this concern about reduction an ala consumption we have already seen major depressive disorder in patience receiving osmic are we going to see the same thing play out as we did for romanabant ism worried about it or even well fence did not have a a ne cardiac it was cardiac y head cry k problems a due to the fin fluorine because of the u stone of one be receptor a against right ism just referring to the fact that these these quotiquat block buster drugs for a b city they tend to follow a concur of very promising very exciting lot of people losing weight suicides are very promising look people losing weight am cardiaccursutes very promising losing weight and now your saying the stomach turns to stone sound it sound biblical a well indeed that is the question and then finally we can really talk biblical if everyone in america who qualified for of an p got it that would be two point one trillion to the hear system which is cully at pourpoint one trillion sow be a greater than fifty per cent increase in health car close k has thirteen hundred a months conversely if we just got sugar consumption down to just a midlines by basically you know putting some limits on how much added sugar the foot in the street can put into any given product fruit loops we could reduce weight by twenty nine per cents and save three point zero trillion dollars we would get better weight lost and we would save five point one trillion dollars which makes more cents to the us government well early are you are alluding to government a big food big farm a relationships having there is a huge wing here for whoever manufacturing these umslpe one analogues in the am but the lesbians who is paying the tab while we are a now the questions why cannot the government see that the answers because the governments on the dull too because the government a a through tariff on you s made foods grosses a fifty six million dollars a year they are player they are not just a regulator they are an actor to play never devil's advocate a little bit let us ma be last person an step in an to and to fend government as as a unified body are not qualified to do that but you could see how it if you look at it checkers instead of chess you would say o cake here is a drug that is going to allow many millions of people to reduce there over all body weight over all body weight is a risk factor for a number of things and there will be savings on the back and as a consequence of that weight loss and that is the checkers version the chess version is how you are describing it and i think that i mean clearly people in government are are while most som perhaps are smart enough to play chest not checkers or till he is understand it but there is very little incentive for the chests model what would cot at solve this or problem is the same thing that happen o fen fen were this from romantic on wants warm it which is if suddenly there is a major issue with the drogue then everyone stops taking it and traditionally that is how it is gone it sounds lithe is creepy one analogues er gan to make it through the shoot though ye i mean there is a very clear downside to these medicines on the other hand there is an upside and ism not sad that these medicines exist ism for them ism not against them ism for them for the right and right now it is not the right nation who is getting just the stands what if somebody who is taking a one of these analogues makes it appoint to do resistance training and here you mention body builders early ism not ism not suggesting they become body killers but we now know wan i think meteor to another would agree that everybody should be doing some form of muscle loss offsetting resistance exercise a great at least past there reaching a there dull height or something i i know there re those that say weight turning does not blind your height but anyway others to say that from it bring early twenty's onward does he that tin especially if you are on these medicines right in order to maintain muscle mass that is a different picture right om people are drinking less alcohol age on plain devil's advocate here om if we look at these these compounds not in a vacuum but o gay the person's been carrying that extra thirty pounds is now only carrying a few extra pounds of adipose issue they have lost a lot of muscle but now they feel well enough to exercise and om the depression part it worries me but anyway ism just ism just trying a round the contour of it what we have seen in children cause that is who i took care was that often they needed a jump start and there were different ways to get him to jump start stomach stapling well that is not jump start that is that was what a lying down land i i have a friend hes he what was and sadly still is really beg and he always talked about the stomachs aping if i could just get fifty pounds down quickly then i could exercise but exercise is painful this kind of thing and and sadly he is he is continued to maintain or creep up in in very excessive way and that is the point is that this concept of jump start actually if you are only doing it yourself does not really work and the question is why is his weight creeping up if he is had the stomach stapling the answer is cause he is a sugarattic ye he is awfully addicted to the superbug gulp soda and if you drink your calories it does not really matter does it now and and he is got such terrible siriasis and joint pain and all is that the prospect of exercising is a you mights well timed it to flap his wings and go to mars the apropos is a driver of immune function if he got off you can tell him from me if he got off the sugar his siriasis would get better his weight would get better his arthritis would get better and he could have then that jump start this is a perfect example to bridge to the brain component of all this because have long wondered based on what understand about narrow circuitry n narrow plasticity i know we share in this knowledge that at some point carrying a lot of adipose tissue means that the brains were represents the body differently and we we know there these these sematotopic mat maps of self a but that the narrow machinery in the hypothalami sure which responsible for motivated states et camera but but also just the entire mapping of the self change is in other words if one is fat long enough that it becomes increasingly hard to get to a a healthy weight because of the way that the narrow circuitry is impact it it basely remaps to maintain that that on fat person notnetily even just at the level of appetite but just in terms of what what a big animals do i had a bulldog the way nine pound bulldog massive he was very economical with his movement i get extremely power tell he could run at elastin when he was younger but if he could be still he was still as supposed of a certain smaller animals that are parypotatic right because because he was leapt in resistance lepton as we talked about briefly is a the hormone that tells your brain you have had enough if you are leapt insensitive you are happy to burn if you are leapt in resistant your brain thinks you are serving if your brain thinks you restarting is going to effect you are behavior in two ways s can make you one o eat and can to make you want a con serve because the goal is too try to increase the leapt in levels in order to overcome that resistance which of course you can never do because ally toast laid down more fat and make more lepton and makes ore says because lepton comes from the adipose exactly that leapt in resistance is what you have to be able to break through you have to fix the leptin sensitivity well what is the driver of the leapt in resistance insolent insolent inhibits lept in signaling it does it at three separate places in the pumpsener on the proopiumlanacorton neuron in the hypothalamus it does it at a virus to insane recept o substraight to it does at it suck three suppressive side a kind signaling three and it does it at pip three phosotitle in us to a to tryfosfate those three separate arms of the a a leapt in receptor are all physically put to sleep by high insolent insolent blocks leapt in signaling the higher the insane goes the more your brain thinks you are starving and the more your brain thinks your starving the hunger y you get and the less you want o move the gluttony in sloth that we have been tag king about all all in a podcast is really bile chemical it is secondary to this phenomenon of insolent blocking lept in signaling you got a fix that first get the insolent down any way you can and the best way get rid of the refined carl had written sure that is were you start it makes much sense it works too how about that that is always it is i once heard you say i think it was in a conversation with peter tea on his podcast and this really stuck in my mind that when a person consumes glucose that it activates a number of different brain sides you do not baron's loving glucose but that when one in jestfroctos that it preferentially activates neurons in the reward pathway a er at may be seven times the the magnitude or r something that glucose activates the basil gangly a this is work from wulnerhouse and and a switzerland and also ercstei at prison o sines movement planning an execution exactly a fructose basically stimulates the uncles accumbent the reward center it is just heroine just cocaine just a nicotine it activates the reward center it does not do anything for the basil ganglia it is a fictive anything that stimulates the reward center in the extreme is a fictive we have chemical addictions heroin can the catinocal sugar we have behavior addictions hoping gambling in an a gaming social media pornography the matter they all stimulate do not begin in the reward center and in the extreme they are all addictive the question is if you were addicted is that personal responsibility well it is a a very om it is a question i think about a lot because i know a lot of people in the addiction recovery community i both from the treatment and in the titan and this always comes down to this question when somebody is suffering from an addiction of any kind and their resistant to getting treatment if you look at it them as a as being sick at least in that moment is a sick person in the baster worst or at least diminished position to guide their own treatment tolerance is somebody with i mention when you ask them do you want go see neurologist you might ask them that but are they the best person to make that decision to this is the problem that this is this is where person responsibility fallsdown person responsibility as can we talked about four criteria have to be met none of them re met that is the first issue second one is a little bit shall we say cheekier who invented personal responsibility and e i dead ism defiling agates this one are all ye you give you the i ready i do not know the tobacco industry the notion of personal responsibility invented it there was no personal responsibility until tobacco in nineteen sixty two cause they were getting killed on the science and they needed to invent another reason for you to smoke in fact there is a paper that came out horsemen at all that looked at the new york times in the washington post and they did a entire its search of the entire of a thrall the output of those two newspapers for decades to look for the term personal responsibility and the very first time it was ever mentioned was nineteen sixty two and it did not pick up in speed until nineteen eighty six which was the same year as sipoloni we light in the the supreme court which basically said that the a that a a the cigarette industry was a was guilty of a of a applying people with the addictive substance this is very specifically industry driven and we have the data to prove it amazing w i wonder along lines of personal responsibility on given that many listeners this conversation are going to be thinking about their own food in take and food choices that of their children and other relatives now we could play a little a little not a game but a little rapid is fire cue and e never done this before in this pods but i think it is particularly appropriate for a discussion this that weeks out into many areas and i absolutely will invite you back and a perhaps a long pleasure am miss apple to talk about some of the exciting work you got a doing as are much we could cover but people are going to wonder in a very practical sense whether or not they shoulder should not be consuming certain things and i know you are not the food police about the en ism not a cop and i do believe people should are should be in choice about these matters but i also believe that because your gest on the potcasting your an unarmed and and have done clinical work and research for many years in this area and you have such a clear stands on the role of big food and and we really really appreciate e your honesty in directness he tot you be willing to provide comment about us couple of different terms that all throw out and if you choose to say really nothing to say about that fine that would be a quick pass am here we go a and we covered a orbit of this earlier but a fruit in whole form a has froths but has fire a thumbs up thumb sideways or thumbs down for fruit consumption fruit is fun fruits s not great thank you white rice verses brown rice and among the white rice is the sticky rice am and the rice's with added sugars which you find in a lot of am a lot restaurants brown rice because of the fiber white rice polished number one all the item and be one gone and of course a march larger glucose excursion that glyceric index thing which of course i hate is it is glyceric load that matters and that is a very high glyceric old brownie brown rice is better than white rice yes o in a meaningful way in a meaningful way of a earlier you mention tomato sauce i love tomato sauce that is made from just tomatoes can tomato is are most tomato saucers filled with sugar perfect or little a recommendation engine looked at this question and it turns out that only ten per cent of the available tomato sauces out on the market do not have added sugar you have to know which ones when you can look yourself or you can look up perfect and it will tell you which ones you can buy if people chose to consume bread which many people do a is there a way to is across the board without just baking your own or see or looking at the ingredients less to make a better choice is sour does tend have less sugar then blank am will sour dough has been fermented it will actually consume some of the sugar it would be a better choice but really the best choice is the highest fire breads no if you look at a wheat berry it is twenty five per cent o fire the husk is twenty five per cent of the weight of that wheat berry that means that the cerebral hydrate to fire ratio of a wheat berry is three to one a good bread should have a carnal hydrate to fire ratio of somewhere between three to one the five to one tops anything above that means that they have stripped the fire away s that something you could do but the easier way is to actually look at up on perfect you mention meat and meat sourcing am egg and chicken sourcing earlier may we just revisit that am meat fishing eggs a thus up them sideways thus down or it depends it depends depends on where the meat came from it depends on whether it was pasture raise depends on whether it is organic or not if they a animal was injected with anobiatics stay away from it because those anabatic are in the meat their on up basically sterilize your got and then the bad bacteria are going to take over we have not really talk much about the microfilm to day but that is a whole potcastle by itself we can touch on a a little bit more a from low sugar fermented foods thus up them sideways thomfermen it food short chain fatiasseds all good what are your favorite sources of fermented and i kimchi i him childlike some of the live sour crowds yet that is also good but with the right the right to act accoutrement a the one thing i would be a a careful about is yogurt there are yogurts with life cultures and their a whole lot regrets with dead cultures and if it is a year with dead cultures its kind of irrelevant and the chances are they have actually covered up the sourness with sugar commerce o large commercially available roger be very very careful e if it is a artisan yogurt made by a people or trust that is a very different story a yours with life cultures intermix fasten do you practise at in what you think about it a i do not practise it but i am for it for the right patient turns out who is the right patient the patient with liver fat because the recent at works is cause it gives deliver chance to basically burn off the fat that its stored zero carry soda got it definite know and i do not even have to ask about sugary soda because tat a that that basically just poison and again food comminations a give a feel i know your answer is but the glicimic in sex which we know your feelings on now a asserts that if you combine some fat with a sugary eating ice cream you have a more blunted insolent response than if you were toe pure sugar of equivalent calories but am but what are your thoughts on food combinations as a way to blunt the insolent response food combinations are great if there some fiber associated with it comes back to fiber again and by the way and by the way i you know full disclosure i am the chief medical officer of a fiber company what is it it is called bioluman and it is a proprietary fiber it is a a micro settle of sponge seven mi cross in diameter to the size of red blood sell you swallow it it ghost your stomach it expands seventy fold over its original size a to give you a feeling of fullness as its taking up space and stomach but more importantly when it expands the nooks in the crannies in the sponge become available and imbedded in those nooks and crannies are a set of proprietary hydrogen's soluble fiber which sequester locos froth mucro simple torches and render them unavailable for early absorption in the drain them thus reducing the glucose response reducing the insolent response protecting the liver and moving it through the intestine that microfilm can shit up for its own purposes feeding the gut we can reduce glucose absorption by thirty six per cent fructose absorption by thirty eight per cent sucks absorption by forty per cent simple starch absorption by nine per cent and increase short chained facias it production by sixty per cent without an increase in guess when do people take this with the meals so it comes as a sachet a teaspoon sprinkle it on your food or take it as a in a drink just mix it in and slug it down and then eat breakfast lunch or dinner and it will basically act you ate real food it will turn process food into real food in the intention and we have clinical trial date of the demonstrates that is it available o commercialist is available it is called munch munch now i hate that name i haven't make it up well a a is you narrate marge that you marketing tour stocks be the products runs amazing am villain dote great thank you for that sorry munch munch targeting he ma i yo got of munch munch to a new produce baa but it sounds a very interesting produce and it actually answer my next question which was about am fire supplements fire is good but therefore two kinds of fire the soluble and there is insoluble they are not the same soluble is what goes into fire one bars that silly a inulin a a a pecan what holds jelly together a that is good not saying it is bad but you need the insoluble fire the selfless the stringy stuff in celery the cardboard if you will a together they form this jell that we talked about earlier if you only consume the soluble fire which is what the food in the street will add to to food cause theinsoluble fires not missile if you only ha the soluble fire back you are not getting the benefits of the entire fire compliment early er when talking about the nova system and how most all of our foods are nine but say i know i seven remember sent letting ninety five per cent but they are on the side of better a ninety five per cent our food should come from nova system class wanted class to foods or three or three o can staying away from those am nova class for foods and you give us some examples of nova class wanting class to foods am it just brought broadly speaking nova class one is any food without a label period if you see a label on a food it is a warning label but there is ground ground beef has a label casts o that is well does it same time out apply when i bide it it has a label ism asking because people are in a wonder wet does have a nutrition facts label is there nutrition facts label on a thing of granny i buy that is that a grounded for a consume venison i we if you flip it over it says how many galleries o my approaching it there is a label i by are not but it is just be for venison o o not done that is class want a egg egg is class one and ism course fruit apples rims o get it does not matter if has it has a name a name tag as long as it it does not japan unrefitions last label got it f real food does not need a label it is only if they did something to it that it needs a label you have to look at every label is a warning label now the problem with the label is it only tells you what is in the food with you really need to know is what is been done to the food because it is the ultra process food that is the problem they do not want to tell you that that is secret secret from a proprietary standpoint but also secret because if you knew what they did to it you would not need it youould never buy it they do not want you to know they only tell you what is in the food that is not what is important it is what is been done to the food that important and that is why this noble class for important and that is why perfect its important cause it will do the work for you i well deftly am paddling stole of these if you could pick one thing to recommend to people that want to improve their health get ready sugar very very clear hat's number one number too go for a walk act the exercise piece go for we and if you could recommend one thing that the general public can do to try in i assist in this advocacy for not redefining but actually clearly defining what is food and what is not and making people aware i at the level of policy and chines and school lunch is am if they were want them what can we do i mean i you clearly activated miner on surrounding that that the set of problems that exist and it that the pats to correct them but should we be writing to our congress people should we be i getting angry at hospitals because they have got all these fast food machines and that the cafeteria of food is likewise is it is illness promoting a no e as off we have got rid of sugar beverages we have the healthy beverage initiative don't to can machines s cop machines wait you see us oh standard check that out cause it you now people always send me pictures of the of the coke machines and the school medicine i list and i did not put hem there but i i i i have the model for the public i mean where where was the first place the smoking was band hospitals because we knew if you get rid of the you do not a i soda if you get er to the sugar soda at the hospital you are telling people something yet i think that every hospital and really every public menu in america need's to clear out the junk postphotos of junk that are suppose to be in ain health promoting institutions and an i guess we iron a cancel jam matranash o ism petty oppose to cancel cuter but here we go an it ransom marvelous it is actionable at straightforward it is low costly time an vestment a zerocoslet a very low time investment thank you for that and look up eat real because we are doing it for your kids you need to help support it any school district in america can do it what are we do we have a business model whereby the a food services director a either purchases or rents a dilapidated factory in the center of the district we purposes it into a food preparation facility they can make twenty seven to thirty thousand meals a day cay with a you know skeleton crew and then they and and you control what is in it and because you are buying in volume it actually reduces the cost it is cheaper than buying it from cisco or remark or sedecsover wherever and then you farm it out they know truce bus to all the different schools every kid gets a hot meal made from scratch each day and we can solve this problem cannot help ut ask this one last question for people they want to cut out sugar which you clearly stated is the most important thing to do for one's health how do we know how much sugar is in something i should people be looking at labels and just looking for how much sugar how much care hydrate or could we even go far as to say if it says am hyfhrotos corn syrup than it is it is on the noflilist do not do not do not can it the problem the problem is that there are two hundred sixty two names for sugar and the foodintre uses all of em the reason they use all of em is because they can include a different sugar as number five number six number seven number eight number nine on the list when you add it up it becomes number one they hide it in plain sight and they do it on purpose now do i expect everybody to memorize all two hundred sixty two names no of course not can you figure it out yourself well the insert know unless they have the line where it says added sugars if it says added sugars it is either sucrose or higfructos corner hora's adding lactose we that is not our glucose they not even add in glucose because locos is not that sweet locos is not that interesting you do not see people going around hugging care syrup do you a that is glucose who cares yet might be good in the molasses cooky but that is it i it is fructose you need to know what is been added if it says added sugars that is a good place to start no greater than one teaspoon per serving no greater than four grahams preserving of added sugars anything greater than that leave at the stor an aim for this now of a type time navy for no am for novertypes on two and three and if you do not know whether it is no type wen two or three you can use perfect and if you do not look at that then go look at the nutrition facts able and anything that has more than four ingredients is noble class for robot lusting thank you much you have provided such an incredible education in nutritional bi chemistry the processing of fat proline carbohydrate sugar fronts in particular the clear detriments of consuming fronts on summing different organ systems i love love love that you separated out food science nutrition and metabolic health it yourself that is just i that is a that is a gazillion dollar to delineation for people to understand and to shape their understanding of all the information that is out there is o enters into these different categories you have given us many actionable tools u it you conceptional frame works you have given us a real aortic force to day in a just is oh clear language i want o thank you i i learenton and and i know everyone else has as well and if people have questions they can course put them in the comment section on you two that is the best place will provide link to all the the companies and a websites that that you reference and some of your other work and listen i just am grateful that you exist and that you have done the work that you have done and and your passion and your advocacy for health is it is just o clears o thank you much i want i want t thank you and the reason why thank you is first inviting me that is nice you norther's good but the reason is because people need to understand science i in completely in agreement with you the public in the to understand science they listen to you because you number not provide the science and number two you do not talk down to them you treat the mas equals and that is truly remarkable as one o thank you for your service well your most welcome it is a labor of love and a i think was the great maxwell brook that said a when teaching assume sorrow knowledge and infinite intelligence and i do believe that humans are infinitely intelligent a though sometimes as a whole we mask it people deserve that the knowledge of thank you much for sharing that knowledge to day and let us absolutely have you back my pleasure thank you thank you for joining me for to day's discussion with doctor

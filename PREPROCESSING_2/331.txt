welcome to the superman lance discuss science science pace to for i m under superman and om professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine my guest to day are mark zoukeberg and doctor priscilla can markzukeberg as everybody knows founded the company face book he is now the c e o of betta which includes casebook instergrahm whats and other technology platforms doctor priscilla can graduated from hazard and went on to do her medical degree at the university of californium san francisco mark iceberg and doctor prisilla can are married and the founders of the c z i or can zukeberg initiative a philanthropic organization whose state goal is to cure all human diseases the chanzzokeberg initiative is accomplishing that by providing critical funding not available elsewhere as well as a novel framework for discovery of the basic functioning of cells cataloguing all the different human cell types as well as providing a i or artificial intelligence platforms to mine all of that data to discover new pathways and cures for all human diseases the first hour of to day's discussion is held with both doctor priscilla can and mark zukeberg during which we discuss the c z i and what it really means to try and cure all human diseases we talk about the motivational backbone for the c z i that extends well into each of their personal histories indedioll learn quite a lot about doctor priscilla can who has i must say an absolute incredible family story leading up to her role as a physician and her motivations for the c z i and beyond and you will learn from mark how he is bringing an engineering an a i perspective to discovery of new cures for human disease the second half of to day's discussion is just between mark zokeberg and me during which we discuss various met platforms including of course social media platforms and their effects on mental health in children and adults we also discuss v r virtual reality as well as augmented and mixed reality and we discuss a i artificial intelligence and how it stands to transform notches our on line experiences with social media and other technologies but how it stands to potentially transform every aspect of everyday life before you begin it'd to emphasized at this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity i spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that getting a great night sleep really is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance one of the anythings to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that the temperature of your sleeping environment is correct and that is because in order to fall in stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees with eight sleep you can program the temperature of your sleeping environment in the beginning middle and end of your night an has a number of other features tracking the amount of rapid i movement and slow wave sleep that you get things are essential to really dining in the perfect nights sleep for you have been sleeping on an ehtesleep mattress cover for well over two years now and it has greatly improved my sleep by fall asleep far more quickly i wake up far less often in themiddle of the night and i wake up feeling far more refreshed than i ever did prior to using name sleep mattress cover if you to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dock calm slash supermen to save one hundred fifty dollars off their pod three cover eight sleep curtly ships to the u ss a canada u k select countries in the u and australia again that is eight sleep dock calm slash huberment to day's episode is also brought to a s by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of electrolytes sodium magnesium an potassium and no sugar the electrolytes are absolutely essential for the fun toning of every cell in your body and your neurons your nerve cells rely on soda magnesium and potassium in order to communicate with one another electrically and chemically element contains the optimal ratio of electrolytes for the functioning of neurons and the other cells of your body every morning i drink a packet of element dissolved in about thirty two ounces of water i do that just for general hydration and to make sure that i have adequate electrolytes for any activities that day it'll often also have an element packet or even two packets in thirty two to sixty ounces water if ism exercising very hard and certainly if ism sweating a lot in order to make sure that i replace those electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink l m n t doc am slash superman to get a free sample pack with your purchase again that is drink l m n t doc come slash supermen ism please to announce that we will be hosting four live events in australia each of which is entitled the brain body contract during which i will share science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance there will also be a live question in answer session we have limited tickets still available for the event in melbourne on february tenth as well as the event in bribing on february twenty fourth our event in kidney at the kidney opera house sold out very quickly as a consequence we have now scheduled a second event in kidney at the aware supertheader on february eighteenth to access tickets to any of these events you can go to superman labor cam slash events and use the cote superman at checkout i hope to see you there and as always thank you for your interest in science and now for my discussion with markzukerberg and doctor priscilla can priscilla mark great to meet you and thank you for having me here in your home i thankstravines on the pots yet to talk about the coz eye the can zukerburg initiative i learned about this a few years ago wen my lab was still is now at starwort as a very exciting philanthropic effort that's a truly big mission i cannot imagine a bigger mission man be he tell s what that big mission is and then we can get into some of the mechanics of how the big mission can become m reality at your mentioning in twenty fifteen a we launched the chance limber initiative and what we are hoping to do at sees i was think about how do we build a better future for everyone and looking for ways where we can contribute the resources that we have to bring philanthropically and the experiences that mark and i have had for me as a physician and educator remark as an engineer and then or ability to bring teams together to build builders a mark has a been a builder throughout his career and what could we do if we actually put together team to build tools a do great science and within our science portfullyve we really been focused on what a some people think is either an incredibly audacious goal or a inevitable goal but i think about it as something that will happen if we sort of continue focusing on it which is to be able to cure prevent our manage all disease by the end of the century old disease all disease that is importantly then a lot of time people ask which disease and the whole point is that there is not one disease in it is really about taking a step back a to where i always found the most hope as a physician which is new discoveries an new opportunities an new ways of understanding how to keep people well come from basic science our strategy at sushi is really to build tools fun science a change the way basic scientists can see the world and how they can move quickly in their discoveries and that is what we launch in a twenty fifteen we we do work in three ways we a fund great scientists we a but old tools i right now southward tools to help move scions along make it easier for scientists to do their work an we do science a you mentioned stamford being a important teller four science work we have built at what we call bilehubs institutes where teams can take on grand challenges to do work that would not be possible in a single lab or within a single discipline and our first bilehub was launched in san francisco a collaboration between stamford you see berley and you see self making a curing all diseases a implies that there will either be a ton of knowledge glean from this effort which i am certain there will be and there already has been we can talk about some of those early success is in a moment but it also sort of implies it if we can understand some basic operations of diseases and cells that transcend baptism huntingtons parkinsons cannot sir and any other disease that perhaps there are some door principles that would make the bigmission a real reality to speak an what a base he saying is an how are you attacking this a might belief is that the cell since at the center of all discussion about disease ism given that our bodies made up of of cells and different types of cells maybe a just laminate for us the bit of what the cell is in your mind as it relates to disease and how one goes about understanding disease in the context of cells because ultimately that is what we are made up of yet well let let us get to the cell thing in a moment but just even taken a step back from that no we do not think that it sees the eye that we are going to cure prevent our montage all diseases the got is to basically give the scientific community and scientist surround the world the tools to accelerate the pace of science and tan we we spell a lot of time when we are getting started with this looking at the history of science and try to understand the trees and and have the play out over time and if you look over the this very long turn ark most large scale discoveries are preceded by the invention of a new tool or a new way to see something it it is not just in biology right it is having a telescope i in a came before a lot of i discoveries ain astronomy and astrophysics am but similarly in microscope and am an indifferent ways to observe things or different platforms the ability do vixens preceded the ability to can of cure a lot of different things am this is sort of the engineering part that you ware talking abut about building tools we were you are goal is to try to bring together some scientific and engineering knowledge to build tools that empower the whole field am and that is that sort of the big ark and in a lot of the things that were focused on including the the work in in single cell and in sell understanding which i you can you can jump in and get into that if you want but ye i think i think we generally agree with the primus that if you want a understand the stuff from first principles m people study organs a lot write thy the study con of how things present across the body but there is not a very widespread understanding of how can of each cell operates and this is sort of a big part of solely initial work that we try to do on the human cell at less and understand what to the different cells and there is there is a much more work that we wanted do to carry that forward but am but over all i think ewe think about the next ten years here of this long arc to try to empower the community to to m bald to cure prevent or manage all diseases we want that we think the next ten years should really be primarily about be able to measure an observe more things and inhuman biology there are a lot of limits to threat's you on a look at something through a microscope you cannot usually see living tissues because it is hard to you see through skin or things the hats for there there a lot of different techniques they will help us observe different things and this is sort of ware the engineering background comes in a bit because and it is when i think about this is from the prospective how you would write code or something you are the idea of tana d roger fix a code base ponopuletlike step through the cod line by line that is new not in happen within d that the being of any big project that we do a at betta and we to spend a bunch the time a french is train instrument things and understand in n or pecan to look out and how we can a measure things before a we know we are making progress and know what to optimists and this is such a long term journey that and we think that it action makes sense to take the next ten years to build those kind of tools a for biology and understanding a just how to human body works in action and a big part of that is tells an do you n jump in tack took about son the affirms old i a just a intrude briefly and just ask about the the different am the different interventions to speak am that easy eyes is in a unique position to to bring to the quest to cure all diseases i can think of i mean i know as a scientist that a money is necessary but not sufficient right t when you have money can hiremore people you can try different things that that is critical but a lot of philanthropy includes money the other component is you a you want to be able to see things as you pointed out am see wont to know that normal disease process but what what is a healthy cell what is a disease sell our sells constantly being bombarded with i challenges and then repairing those and then what we call cancer is just kind of runaway train of those challenges not being met by the all itself for something that am better imaging tools and then am it sounds there is not just a hard ware component but a software component this is where a i comes in may we can that is somephont we we can break this up into to three different avenues one is understanding disease processes and healthy process will lump those together then there is hard a re microscopes lenses did you'd old convolution ways of seeing things in bolder relief and more more more a precision and then there is how to manage all the data and then i love the idea that maybe e i could do what human brains cannot do alone i manage understanding of the dateixcause it is something to organized date it is another to say ow unit ye this as you point out the knowledge with tod that this particular gene and that particular gene or potentially interesting word as a human being would never make that potential connection the tools that easy i can bring to the table we we fun science your talking about an we try to a there is lots of ways to fun science and just to be clear what we fund is a tiny fraction of what the and i each fun for instance we new if you got have been generous enough that it is a it evilly om holds weight into air a anus contribution yet and but i think it every every under has its own role and ego system and for us it is really how do we incentive new points of view how do we incentivize collaboration how do we incentive open science and a lot of our grants include am inviting people to look in look at different fields our first narrow science am for they was a aim towards in sentivising people from different backgrounds i monologist micro biologist to come and look it how our nervous stem works and how to keep it healthy or a we as that our grantees participate in the reprint movement to accelerate the rate of sharing knowledge and actually others being able to build upon science that is the funding that we do am in terms of building am we we build software and hardware i you mentioned we put together teams that a can build tools that are more durable and scalable am then someone in a single a lab might be incentivize to do there is a ton of great ideas and a nowadays most scientists can tinker and build something useful for their lap but it is really hard for them to be able to share a that tools sometimes beyond their own lap top or forget the next lab over or across the globe we partner with scientists to see what is useful what kinds of tools in imaging a parry it is there is it is a useful image innovation tool a that it is borne from in open source community and how can we contribute to that or a sellbygene which a works on single sedate sets an how can we make it build a useful tool that scientists can sharidate a sets analyze their own and contribute to a larger a corpus of information we have software teams that are building collaborating with scientists to make sure that we are building easy to use durable translatable tools across the scientific communion the areas that we work in a we also have institutes this is where the imaging work comes in were we are proud owners of electronmok rescore fine now a it its gun tore installed am et our imaging institute and that will really contribute to the way where we can see work differently but we can e more hardware see does need to be developed were partnering with a fantastic scientists am in the rehab network to build a a a media face plate to increase to line the electrons through these am through the electromicroscope to beagle to increase the resolutions we can seem in sharper detail to a there is a lot of innovative work within the network that is happening a and a these institutes have grand challenges that they are working on a back to your question about cells sells are just the smallest unit that er alive and em are your body every every all of our bodies have many many many cells there is some estimated thirty seven trillion cells different cells in your body and what are they all doing and how what they look when they arehealth in you are healthy what do they look when you are sick and em were were at right now with or understanding of cells and what happens when you get sick is basically we have we we have gotten pretty good at from the human genie project looking at how different mutations in your genetic code lead for you to be more susceptible to get sick or directly cause you to get sick we go from a mutation in your done to wow you now have huntingtons tizzies for instance and there is a lot that happens in the middle and that is one of the questions that we are going after at at sleazy eye is what actually happens an analogy that i used i to use to share with my friends is right now say we have a recipe for a cake we know there is a typo in the recipe and then the cake is awful that is all we know we do not know how the she interprets the typo we do not know what happens in the oven and we do not actually have know sort of how it is exactly connected to how the cake did not turn out how you a ad expected a lot of that u is unknown but we can actually systematically try to break this down an one segment of that journey that we are looking at is how that mutation gets translated and acted upon in your sells an all f your cells have what is called em ranee em prince are the actual instructions that are taken from the donee an what or work in single cell is looking at how how every cell in your body is actually interpreting your done slightly differently and what happens when healthy cells are interpreting the dean instructions and when six cells are interpreting those directions and that is a ton of data i just told you there is thirty seven million ells there is different a large and sets of maria an each cell but the work that weep in funding is least looking at how a first shall gathering that information u we have been a incredibly lucky to be part of a very fast moving a field where we have gone from in twenty seventeen funding some methods work to now having really not complete but nearly complete atlases of how the human body works how flies work how mice work at the single cell level in being able to then try to piece together how does that all come together and when you are healthy and when you are sick in the neat thing about the sort of inflection point were we are at in a i is that i cannot look at this data and make sense of it there just too much of it and biology's complex human bodies are complex we need this much information but the use of large language models can help us actually look at that data and gain insights look at what trends are consistent with health and what trends are a are unsuspected an eventually our hope a through a the use of these data sets that we have helped curate in the application of large language models is to be able to formulate a virtual cell a cell that is completely a a built off of the data sets of what we know about the human body but allows us to manipulate and learn faster and try new things a to help move science and then a medicine alow do you think we have catalogued the total number of different cell types your every week i look at great journals cell nature and science and princes i saw recently that using single sell sequencing they've am categorized eighteen plus different types of fat cells we always think it a fat delvers as of muscle cells a now you've got eighteen types am each one is going to express many many different genes and arouse emaronase and perhaps the one of them is responsible for what we see in it advance type to diabetes or in other forms of obesity or where people cannot lay down fat cells which turns out to be just as detrimental in those extreme cases now love got all these lists of genes but i always thought of single cell sequins saying as necessary but not sufficient but you need the information but it does not resolve the problem and i think of it more of i as a hypothesis generating experiment a you youocase you of all these genes he could say while this gene is particularly elevated in the diabetics cell type of what ay one of these fat cells or muscle cells for that matter whereas it is not in nondiabetics then of the millions of different cells maybe only a five of them differ dramatically then you generate hypothesis oh it is the ones that differ dramatically that are important but maybe one of those genes when it is only fifty per cent changed has a huge a fact because of some network biology effect and i guys what ism trysted get to here is how does one meet that challenge and can a i help resolve that challenge by essentially placing those lists of genes into a a ten thousand hypothesis cause it'll tell you that the graduate sun's in posters in my lab get a chance to test one hypothesis and no and that is really the challenges let alone one lab and for those are listening o this and you know whofleet's not getting outside the scope of of kind of standard understanding of the understanding we generated here but what busy saying is you have to pick at some point more do it always sounds great but then how do you decide what to test no we do not know all the sell types um i think one of the one thing that was really exciting when we first launched this work was cystic firsts cystic fibrosis's caused by mutation and c it re that is pretty well known it affects a certain channel that makes it hard for mucus to be clear that is the basicisystic fibrosis when i went to medical school it was totes fact they're lungs fill up with fluid these people carrying around sacs of fluid filling out by ye known people have worked with people than they have to early dump the fruit out exactly cannot run or do intend exercise life is shorter life is short and when we applied single sell methodologies to the lungs they discovered an entirely new cell type that actually is affected by mutation in the c mutations an cystic fibrous this mutation that actually change as the paradise of how we think about mystic fibrosis is just enough i do not think we know all the cell types i this we will continue to discover them and we will continue to discover new relationships between solemn disease which leads me to the second example i on bring up is this large state sat that the entire scientific communions built around single cell is starting to allow us to say this mutation where is it express what types of cell types its expressed in and we actually have built a tool at we i called cell bygone where you can put in the mutation that you are interested in and it gives you a heat map of crossbill types of which cell types are expressing the a gene that you are interested in and then you can start looking at o q if i look at gene as and i know it is related to heart disease but if you look at the heat map it is also spiking in the pancreas that allows you to gentry o hypothesis why ism and what happens when this genus mutated and in you rein the function of your pancreas really exciting way to look and ask questions differently and you can also imagine a world where if you are trying to develop a therapy a drug and your your the goal is to treat the function the heart but that it is also really active in the pancreas again what is there going to be an unexpected side a fact that you should think about as you are bringing a this strung to clinical trials i it is an incredibly exciting tool and one that is only going to get better as we get more more sophisticated ways to analyze the data must say i love that because if i look at the advances in nervous science over the last fifteen years most of them did necessarily come from looking at the nervous system came from the understanding that the man system impacts the brain everyone prior to that talked about the brain is a mine privileged organ but you just said also bridges and they divide between single sells organs and systems i because ultimately sells make up organs organ to make up systems an there all talking to one another and everyone nowadays is familiar with got brain aces or the the microfilm being important but rarely is the the discussion between organs discuss a to speak i think it is wonderful that that tool was generated by cosy for sexy i funded that tool he does his re built that we built that he built it as it built by meadow is as better is got has the ton engineers got it y it a completely different organizations credible and and a graduate sooner postoctors interest in a particular mutation could put this mutation into this date o base i that grave sooner stock might be in a laboratory known for working on hart but suddenly find that they are collaborating with other scientists that work on the pancreas yet which it also is wonderful u because it bridges the divide between these fields fields are silted an sign s not just different buildings but they people rarely talk unless things this are i mean the graduate student is someone that we want to empower cause one there the future of science as you now and within calla gene if you put in the senior interested in and it shows you the heat map we also will cull up the most relevant papers that g and read these things fantastic as we all know quality nutrition influences of course our physical health but also our mental health and our cognac functioning our memory our ability to learn new things and to focus and we know that one of the most important features of high quality nutrition is making sure that we get enough sidemen and minerals from high quality unprocessed or minimal process sources as well as enough robotics and robotics and fiber to support basically all the cellar functions in our body including the up microfilm now i most everybody try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods i really mostly from minimal processed or non process foods however one of the challenges that i and many other people face is getting enough servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day as well as fiber and robotics that often accompany those fruits and vegetables that is why way back in two thousand in twelve long before i ever had a podcast i started drinking a g one and ism delighted the a g one is sponsoring the superman lab podcast the reason i started taking a g one and the reason i still drink a g one once or twice a day is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs that is it provides insurance that i get the proper amounts of those sidemen minerals robotics and fiber to insure optimal mental health physical health and performance if you would to try a g one you can go to drink a g one do come slash supermen to claim a special offer they are giving away i are travel packs plus a year supply of sideman d three k two again that is drink a g one doc am slash supermen to claim that special over i just think going back to your question from before are there can re more sellotapes there and discovered i assume rite me no catalogue of the stuff as ever you it does not seem we're ever done when we keep on finding more but i think that that gets to one of the things that i think er the strengths of of a modern ellalems is the ability to kind of imagine different states that things can be in from all the work that we have done and funded on they the human sell atlas there is a large corpus of data that you can now train a a kind of large scale a modern and one of the things that were doing a it sees ow which i tank's pretty exciting as building a what we think it is one of the largest non profit life science a i clusters write syce the order of a thousand g pus and in it is larger than what most people of access to an academia you can do cenluxurious engineering work on and am and ouknowbody easily training a model with all f the human sell gutless statant in a bunch of other it puts as well were think you will be able to basically imagine all of the different types of cells and all the different states that they can be in and when they are healthy end diseased and how they'll interact with a no different a interact with each other interact with different potential drugs but i mean i think the state of emblems and this is worth it is helpful o understand you no have a good understanding and be grounded and the modern state of a eye m these things are not full proof ride mean one of the flaws of modern elites is they hallucinate right the question is how do you make its of that that can be an advantage rather than a disadvantage and i think the way that it ends it being in advantage is when they help you imagine a bunch of states that something can be in but then you know is the scientist tor engineer go and validate that those are true whether there no solutions now a proline can refolded or possible states that a cell could be in when it is interacting with other things but you were not yet at the state with a eye thatyou can just take the outputs of these things as as gospel and run from there but that they are very good i think as you set hypothesis generators or ism possible solution generators that then you can go valid and that is very powerful ism thing that we can basically in building on the first five years of science work around the human cell atlas anal the data that is been built out carry that forward into something that i think it is going to be a very novel tool going forward i and that is the type of thing that i think we are set up to do well i mean you all you had this exchange of a little wile back about am you running levels and how easy eyas you are just sort of a drop in the in the in the bucket compared to an i each but i think were have this the thing that i think we can do that is different is am funding some of these longer term bigger projects that it is hard to galvanize the in pull together the energy to do that an it is a a lot of what am most science running is is relatively small projects that are exploring things over relatively short time horizons and one of the things that we try to do is is like build these tools over in five ten fifteen year periods there often projects that require in hundreds of millions of dollars of funding and world class engineering teams and inform structure to do and that i think is a pretty cool contribution to the field that i that i think is there are not as many other folks whoa whore doing that kind of thing but that is one thereasons why ism personally excited about the virtual sell staff cause it just it is the perfect intersection of all the stuff that we have done and single sell a previous ism collaborations that we have done with the field and a bring together the the am industry and an a expert his round thus i completely agree that the model of science that you are put together with easy eye is is not just unique from an age but it is extremely important at the i independent investigator model is what is driven the progression of science in this country and to some extend in northern rope for the last hundred yea ears in its wonderful on the one hand because it allows for that image we have of a scientist kind of tinkering away or the people in their lain than they break us an that hopefully translates to better human health u but i think in my opinion we have move past that model as the most effective model or the only model that should be explored i just think it is balance it tat now what you want at you want tat not you a how this people i think tat that is these tools of sowers and their mechanisms to do that an h but but it is hard to do elaborative science is it is sort of interesting that we are sitting here not far for because i get upright near here as well m not far from the garage model of tax right he will a jacked model not far from here at all and the ideas that you know the tinkerer in the garbage the inventor and then people often forget that to implement all the technologies they discovery took enormous factories in where house you another there is similar there to face book met et camera but i think in science what imagine that the scientists alone in their laboratory and those you reacommoments but i think nowadays that the big questions really require extensive collaboration and certainly tool development and one of the tools y keep coming back to as these elites these large language models and they ye could just elaborate for for those that are not familiar what are what is a large language model it for that the the uninformed that is it and what is allow what is allow us to do that different types of other types of a i do not allow i what more importantly perhaps was allow us to do that a bunch of really smart people highly informed in a given are of science staring at the data what can do that they cannot do sure i think a lot of the progression of machine learning has been about building systems curl networks are other wives that can basically make sense and fine patterns and larger and larger amounts of data and there is a break through a number of years back am that some folks at gouge actually may it call this transformer model architecture and it was this huge break through because before then there was somewhat of a cap where in if you fed more data and to a hurry network pass some some point it did not really glean more insights from it where is transformers just and we have not seen the end of how big that can scale to yet i mean it i thin that there is a chance that we run into some some ceiling but it wet never ask some dotes we we have not observed it yet but we just have not built big enough systems yen i would guess that a ah no in that this is actually of of the big questions and in the a i called to day is basically our transformers and a the current model architecture sufficient if you just build larger and larger clusters do eventually get something that sike human intelligence or superintelligence or m is there is some kind of fundamental limit to this architecture that we just have not reached yet and once we we cannot get a little bit further in building them out that we will reach that that we willed a few more leaps before we get to in that the level of of a a i that i think we will unlock in a ton of really futuristic in amazing things but there is no doubt that even just being able to process the amount of data that we can now with this model architecture am has unlocked a lot of new usecases an the reason whether called large language models is because one of the first uses of them is am people basically feed in all of the language from a base of the world by web and you can think about them as basically prediction machines if you you you fit in am you put in prompt and it kin basically i a predict i version of what should come next in a you type in a headline for a new story in it can on a predict what it thinks the story should be or you could train it that it could be a chat pot right where if if you are prompted with this question you can get'this response but one the interesting things it turns out that there is action nothing specific to using human language in it if instead of feeding it human language if you use that model architecture for for a network and instead you feed it all of the human sell gutless data then if you prompt it with a state of a cell it can spit out i different versions of of what have that sell can attract or different states that the cell could be a next when it interacts with different things does it hat to take a junkies class princes if ye give in a bunch at you noise not it you have to say by the way and then you give it tunes class to it understands the oud you get data ran m ran and proline i think that the music the basic nature of all these machine learning techniques is there they are basically pattern recognition systems there these very deep statistical machines i there very efficient at finding patterns m it is it is not actually and you do not need to teach a a language model that is trying to yous speak a language am a lot of specific things about that language either you just feeder in a bunch of examples and then you'll let say you teach it about something i in english but then you also give it a bunch of examples of people speaking italic i it will actually be able to explain the thing that it learned an english an italic right even though it is tattle cross over in just a pattern recognition am is the thing that is pretty profound and powerful about this but it really does apply to a to of different things another example in the scientific community am has been the work work that alphophold that the basically the o the folks a deep mined have done i on proline folding m it is you nor just basically a lot of a the same model architecture but instead of language there they folded that they confer in all the the proline data andyou can give it a state and it can spit out solutions to you those prolines get folded it is very powerful i do not think we know yet is an industry what the a what the natural limits of it are and that that is one of the things that is pretty exciting about the current state but a it certainly allows you to solve problems that just weren't solved with the generation of machine learning that came before it softly cities is moving a lot of work that was just done in nitro in dishes am an in vive in a living organisms model organisms are humans to insilico as we say am do you foresee a future we are a lot of medical research certainly that the work of sis i am included is done by machines i bean obviously its much lower cost a an you can run millions of experiments which of course is not to say that humans are not going to be involved em but i love the idea that we can run experiments in slice a en mass i think the in sell experiments are gimme incredibly helpful to less things quickly tit cheaply into a is just unleciallot of creativity i do think you need to be very careful about making thrusts till translates and matches this humans am one thing that is funny in a basic sciences we have basically cured every single disease in mice mice have a we we know what is going on when they have a number of diseases because the were their use as model organism but they are not humans in a lot of times that research is relevant but not directly one to one translatable to humans you just have to be really careful about making sure that it actually works for humans someday what nisi eyes doing as ritually creating a new field c i as ism hearing all this something hi this this transcends menology department card tragic surgery a me narrow scenes the idea of a new field where you certainly embrace the realities of university in laboratories beta hat's where most of the work that your running is done is at right is to maybe we need think about what it me institute science differently and i think that is one o o things that is most exciting alongmost lines it seems at bringing together a lot of different types of people different a major institutions is it going to be especially important i know that the initial see we ibiohub gratefully included stamford we will put that first in the list but also you see us oh ye forgive me the many friends that you see us at and also burly but there are now sum additional institutions involved maybe you talk about that and what motive are the decision to branch outside the bay area and and why you selected those particular additional institutions to be included wham all all desk part of a big part of why we wanted to critiditional biohubs as we were just impressed by the work that the folks who are running the first biohub did am and i also think and you should walk through the the a work of the chico biohub and the new york biohub that we just announced but i think it is actual an interesting set of examples that balance am the limits of what you want to do with physical material engineering and and i and and where things are purely biological because the chico team is really building more censors to full t understand what is going on your body but that is more a physical con of engineering phalange where is the then you team we mostly talk about this is a cellular endoscope of being able to have a lecanamunecellar somewhat can go and understand a in what is what is a thing that is going on in your body but it is not a physical piece of hardwoods a sell that what you can basically am you have have am auriscope report out on on on different things that are opening inside the body did avion to cell the microscope to a can an an an eventually actually being up to act on it but i mean but you should you shall going to have more you tell on all this court principle of how we think about bilehubs it is that it has to be a a when we invited proposals it has to be at least three institutions a really breaking down the barrier of a single university oftentimes asking for the people designing the research aim to come from all different backgrounds a and to explain why that the problem that they want us all a requires inter disciplinary insisted university institution collaboration to actually make happen a we just put that request for proposal out there a with our san francisco biahub as an example where they have done incredible work in single cell biology and infectious disease and we got i want to say fifty seven proposals from over a hundred and fifty institutions a lot of ideas came together and we are excited that we have been able to launch chico and new york a chico is a elaboration between you i you see a university of illinois a ran champagne and university of chico and northwestern a eff obviously these universities are multifaceted but if i were to stript describe them by their step typical strength north western has an incredible medical a a system and hospital system university of chico brings to the table incredible basic seen strength a university of illinois is a computing power house and they came together and proposed that they were going to star thinking about cells in in tissue a that one of the one of the layers that you just alluded toe how do the cells that we know behave at act differently when they come together as a tissue in the hurt one of the f rest tissues that they starting with i skin they have been already been able to is a collaboration under the leadership of shanakelly design art engineer skin tissue the architecture looks the same as what is in you and i and what they have done is built these ti supersuperthin censors and they in bed these censors throughout the layers of this engineer tissue and they read out the data they want u see how these cells what these cells are secreting how these cells talk to each other in what happens when these cells get and flamed inflammation is an incredibly important process that drives fifty per cent of all debts and this is another sort of disease agnostic approach we want a understand inflammation and they are going to get a ton of information out from these censors that tell you what happens when something goes are cause right now we can say when you have an allergic reaction your skin gets red and puffy but what is the earliest signal of that and these censors can look at the behaviors of these cells over time and then you can apply a large language model to look at the earliest statistically significant changes that can allow you to intervene as early as possible that that is what chicagofs doing they're starting in the asking cells they are also looking at the our muscular junction which is the connection between were a neuron a attached to a muscle and tells the muscle how to behave superimportant in things ail us but also in aging the slowed transmission of information across that our muscular junction is what causes old people to fall they brain cannot trigger their muscles to fact fast enough and we want to be able to embed these censors to understand how these different interconnected systems within our bodies work together in new york a they're do in a a related abut an equally exciting project where there am engineering individual cells to be able to am go in in identify changes in a in a human body am what they will do is a they are calling a it is a yow get man o man its this is i only go on a tangent for those that want ta look up adapt objects there is a lot of i distortion and interference when you try and look at something really small or really far away and really smart physics a figure out hell use the interference as part of the microscope make those ashy lenses of the microscope talk about imam young several ow is is hat a me ha that in your spirits extremely clever along those lines it is not intuitive but than when you hear it it is it makes much sense it is not immediately into it take the cells that are already to navigate to tissues or in bed themselves an tissues be the microscope within that totally e love it a the the the way that i explain this to my friends and my family is this this fantastic voyage but real life am we are going into the human body and we are using the mean cells which are privileged and already working to keep your body healthy and being able to target them to examine certain things you can engineer in a mean cell to go in your body and look inside your coronary arteries and say are these arteries am healthy rare their places cause because places lead to blockage which lead to hart attacks a and the cell can then record that information and report it back out that is the first talk what the necrophile have is going to do the second half is can you then engineer the cells to go do something about it can i then tell a different cell i mean cell that is able to transport in your body to go and and clean that up in a targeted way and a it is incredibly exciting they are gin a study things that are a sort of a mean privilege that you mean system normally does not have access to a things ovarian ampancriatic want sir am they will also look at a number of nardegenerive diseases since a the mean system dare not presently have a ton of access into the nervous system abut they it is it is both mine blowing and feels she phi but science as actually in a place where a feu really pushed a group of incredibly qualified scientist say could you do this if given the chance the answers probably give us enough time the bright team and resources s audible and it is a a tentifift in er project ye but it is it is swim engineer itself e i love the optimism and and the moment you said make the cell the microscope we unless yes yes and yes it it it just makes much sense what would have are the decision to do the work of of cry my in the contacts of existing universities ay supposed to there is still some real estate up in redwood city where there is a bunch of space to put by ate companies and just hiring people from all all backgrounds and and saying hey have at it and and doing the stuff from scratch hemming its it is a very interesting decision to do this in the contacts of an existing frame work of graduate turns that need to do e thesis and get a first author paper it's all set of structures with in macadamia that i think both facilitate but also limit the progression of science now that indeindependent investigator model that we talked about a earlier it it is cord to the we science has been done this is very different an frankly sounds far more efficient if ism to be to completely honest and a you no we will see if i renew my in age funding certain what am but i think we all want the same thing we all want it as scientists and as a it as humans we want to understand the way we work and we want am healthy a people to persist to be healthy and we want sick people to get healthy i man that is really ultimately the goal it is not supercomplicatis just hard to do the teams at the b hub are actually am independent of the university to it each bilehobwill probably have in total may be fifty people working on sort of deep affects however it is it an acknowledgment that not all the bass scientists who can contribute to this area are actually am going to one want to leave a university or want to take on the full time scope of this project it is the ability to partner with universities a and to have the faculty at all the universities be able to contribute to the over a project am is how the bile structure cot it but a lot of the way that were approaching sees i is this long term iterative project to figure out try bunch a different things figure out which things produce the most interesting results and then double down on those in the next five er push right were we just went through this period were we inhale wrapped up the first five years of the science program we try a lot of different models or it all kinds of different things and am it is not that the hub model we do not think it is the best or only model but we we found that it was sort of a a a really interesting way to unlock a bunch of collaboration and bring some technical resources that allow for this longer term development and it is not something that is widely am being pursued to cross the rest to the fields we figure stock this is a an interesting thing that we can that we cannot push on but i i mean yet were do believe in the collaboration am but i i also think that we come at thus with i we do not think that the way that were pursuing this is the only way to do this or the way that everyone should do it we were pretty aware of not that am i what is the rest of the ecosystem and how we can play a unique roll in it feels very energetic with the way science is already done and also fills an incredibly importance that frankly it was not filled before am a long lorn s of implementation let us say am your large language models combined with imaging tools an a reveal that a particular set of genes ism acting in a cluster a am set up an an organ crashed us say the bank the bankers crash as of particular stage of a pancreatic answer am still one the most deadliest of the go the cancers and am i there others that you certainly went one get but that is among the the ones you would not want to yet the most you discover that then and the ideas that today then a e i reveals some potential drug targets then bear out in metro in addition in a mouse model am how is the actual implementation of to drug discovery or e it may be this target is durable maybe it is not maybe it require some other approach a later lazeroblation approach or something we we do not know but ultimately is easy i going to be involved in the implementation of new therapeutic is at the idea i less la o a that is this is where it is important to work in an ego system and to know your own limitations there are groups and start ups an companies that take that and bring it to translation very effectively i would say the place where we have a small window into that world is actually are work with rare disease groups a wee we have a throw rares one portfolio funded patient advocates to create am where disease organizations were patients come together a and a actually pool their collective experience a they build be registries registries of their natural history and they both partner with researchers to do the research about their disease and with a drug developers to incentive drag developers to focus on what they may meed for their disease and one thing that is important to point out is that her diseases are not rare they are over seven thousand rare diseases and a collectively unpacked many many individuals and i think the thing that is from a yet basic science a perspective them incredibly fascinating thing about rare diseases is that they are actually windows to how the body normally should work and they're often a mutations that when when jeans that were when they are mutated cause very specific diseases but that tell you how the normal biology works as well not it you discuss basically the the goals major rolls initiates of the easy eye for the next say five to ten years and then beyond that the targets will be explored by bout get companies a doll grad those targets and and tasethemen and implement them througalso i think been a couple of teams from the initial biohub there were interest in spinning out ideas they an't have start up a that is just is even thought is not a thing that we are going a pursue because an were a philanthropy a we wanted a maple the work that gets done to real tat get turned into companies and things that other people go take and and and run towards towards building in ultimately therapeutics that that isn't that is anotheresound but that is just that is not a thing that working to do about it i gather you are both optimism no is that part of what brought you together regime for get smutching to a personal question but i love the optimism them that that it seems to sit at the route of the easy i i will say that we are incredibly hopeful people but it it manifest in different ways between the two of us ye would you for how would you describe your optimism worse as mine it is not a loaded question i do not know i man i think ism more probably technologically optima stick about what can be built and i think you because of your focus as in an actual doctor am kind of have more of a sense of how that skin of effect to actual people in their lives ism work for me it is in a lot of my work it is in it is a we touch a lot of people around the world i an the scaleless sort of sense tan i think for you just it is being able to improve the lives of individuals whether it is no students at any the schools that you have started or any the stuff that we have supported through the education work which is not the got here or in li just being able to improve people's lives in that way i think is the thing that have seen you be supersession about an wat to that do you grave that characterization on grant on tana yet i agree with that i think that is very fair and ism sort of giggling to myself cause in a data day life as partners a relative optimism comes through as a mark just is overly optimistic about his time management an well get engrossed in interesting ideas ism and he is late i every physicians are very portal and because he is late i have to channel mark is an optimist whenever ism waiting for habit nice i i allstart using that that is what i not goon ism in the drive way with the kid's waiting for you ism mark s an optimist am and his optimism translates to some tardiness whereas ism a sort of ism hottest what is has horses can happen ism in a opens harshest and we know star putting together plan and a putting pulling to you all the pieces calling people to a sort of bring something to life but is it is one of my favorite quotes that is optimism tend to be successful and pessimists tend to be right and can i i think it is it is true in a lot of different aspects of life right la who said a did you say that marks tax it i did not invent it a why v it to you will put it just dot you but i i do think that there is really something to it right in there is if you are discussing any idea there is all these reasons why it might not work and si i i think that and those reasons are o probably true the people are stating them are you probably have some validity to it but the question is that is that the most productive way to you the world and yet i think i cross the word and i think the people who tend to be the most productive and get the most done a you cannot need to be optimistic because if you do not believe that something can get done than why would you go work on it the reason i ask the question is that that these days we here a lot about the future is looking dark in these various ways and you have children you have families and you are a family excuse me and and you also have families independently that are now merged but i love the optimism behind the easy i because you do behind all this there is sort a set of big statements on the wall one the future can be better than the present in terms of treating disease maybe even you said eliminating diseases all diseases love that optimism and that there is attractable path to do it ink what were in a but put little your money and time and energy and people and technology and a i behind that and u i have to ask a was having children am a significant modifier in terms of your your view of the future wile the ye heareall this dooming gloom what is the future going to be for them did you sit back and think what would it look if there was a future with no dis desks am is that the future we want our children and i ma not ism voting a big gasp when i can when i in indicate that at all but was having children a sort o an inspiration for the easy in some way no i think my answer to that em i would die backwards for me em and it'll just tell very brief a story about my family ism the daughter of tines enemies a refuges my parents and grandparents were boat people if you remember people left venom during the war in these small boats into the south tynasee and am the there were stories about how these boats would sink with whole families on them and my grandparents who both hat the grandparents who knew each other decided that there was a better future out there and they were willing to take a rest for it a but they were afraid of losing all their kids i my dad is one of six my mamma is one of ten and they decided that there was something out there in this bleak time and they parred up their kids one from each family and sent them out on these little boats before the internet before self pounds and said we will see you on the other side ow and a the kids were between the ages of ten to twenty five young kids my my mama was a tea nature that early team when this happened a and every one made it and i got to sit here and talk to you how could i not believe that better is possible and i hope tat that in my epigenesis somewhere an i care that on that is a spectacular story is not that while it is spectachow can i be a pessimist with that i want it and i appreciate that you became a physician because you were not bringing that optimism and that epigonetic understanding and cone of understanding and emotional understanding to the field of medicine i a i grateful to i the people that made that decision and then when i think you do not reive have always known that story but you do not understand how wild that fields until you have your own child nearly well i cannot even i i refuse to let her use glass bottles o i that y o my god the risk in the sort of willingness of my grandparents to believe in something bigger and better a is just astounding and it of an our own children set have given a sense of urgency in sotalcular story and of you your sending knowledge out into the fields of science and bringing knowledge into the fields of science and i love this will it will see on the other side ism confident that it will all come back thank you much for that i a mark up you have the opportuneatog about did having kits change your world of you bandit is r enough to feat that is aka they were also your children i e a i you get i yet om to for the price of one intima having children deffromy changes your time rise and sung that that is one thing ass you just like of thermal these things that i think we had talked about it for as long as we have known each other that you are eventually wanting to but teniasis o or having is we we need told get on this right i there is actually one of the checkout the baby check us before the first as the pings in per a o i darts you the eye truly sitting in the hospital delivery i finishing editing the letter that we were going to published i to announce them a we wen axis in the alteration it was not we really were auditing the final drought birth sense r y s well it is it is it an incredible initiative i i been falling it since its inception and and it is already been tremendously successful l and everyone in the feel of science and i a want a communication with those folks feels the same way and and the future is even brighter for it it is clear and thank you for expanding to the midweston and new york and we are all very excite to see were all of this goes i share in your optimism and thank you for your time today think you like you ill hare not ado i to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood ending e to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health coals have long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood last i made your problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and forth but you do not know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things metabolic factors lipids hormones et camera but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition behavioral modification supplements et camera that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you would to try inside tractor you can go to inside tracker dock calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside tractors plans again that is inside tracker dock calm slash supermen and now for my discussion with mark zukerberg slight shift of topic here you are extremely well known for your roll in technology development but by virtue of your personal interests and also were met technology interfaces with mental health and physical health you are starting to become synonymous with health whether you realize it or not om part of that because there is postfootage of you rolling jugitzy you want a jugitzy competition recently i you are doing other forms of martial arts water sports inly surfing in and on and on you are doing it yourself but may we could just start off with technology and get this issue out of the way first which is it i think many people assume that technology especially technology that involves a star screen skives me of any kind is going to be detrimental to our health but that does not necessarily have to be the case could you explain how you see technology nesting with inhibiting or maybe then promoting physical and mental health sure ism in think this is a a really important topic it is am you knar the research that we have done suggests that it is not all good ore all bad i think how you are using the technology has a big impact on whether it is bisk positive experience for you and even within technology even within social media there is not can o one type of thing that people do i think at its best your forming i meaningful connections with other people and yon there is a lot of research that basally suggests that youknwit is it is the relationships that we have and a friendships that cannot bring the most happiness and in our lives and it is some level end up even correlating with living a longer and healthier life because in of that kind of o grounding that you have and community and s a being important for that have no bad aspect of social media which is i know the ability to connect with people to understand what is going on and people's lives have empathy for them i communicate what is going on with your life express that that is generally positive there there are ways that it can be negative in terms of a bad interactions things bullion m which we can we can talk about predators a lot that we have done to basic we make sure that people can be safe from that give people tools and give kids i an builder to have the right parental controls that parents can oversee that but that sort of the interacting with people side there is another side of of all this which i think of is just passive consumption which t it it is best i it is entertainment right an entertainment is an important human thing too but i do not think that that has quite the same association with the long term well being in health i benefits as being able to help people connect with other people does i and i think to it is worst i some of the staff that we see on line i i think these days a lot of the news is just relentlessly negative i that it is just hard to in a come away from an experience where you are in a looking at the news for in half an hour and feel better about the world i think that there is a mix on this i i think the more that social medias about connecting with people i and the more that when you are find of consuming and using ism the media part of social media am to learn about things that can entitle and can provide inspiration or education as supposed to things that m just leave you with a more toxic feeling that that sort of that the balance that we try ta to get right across our products and i thin were pretty alined with the community betas at the end of the day in i people do not want a use a product and come away feeling bad and there is ally the lot that people talk about i value it lot o these products and terms of information and utility but i get's as important when you are designing a product to think about what find of feeling you are creating with the people who use it it whether that is can of an aesthetic sense when you are designing hardware or just cone of what what what would you make people feel and generally people soft want to feel bad right i i think when that does not mean that we want a i shelter people from bad things that are happening in the world but i i do not really think that in it is not what people want a in a for us to just be count of just showing all the supernegative stuff all day long a sweets we work hard on all these different problems i a making sure that we are helping connect people as best as possible helping make sure that we give people good tools a to block people who might be bullying them or harass them or especially for younger folks in anyone under the age of sixteen defaults into an experience where they are experience as private we have all these parental tools a s that way your parents can can kind of understand what what their children is up to and it are up to in a good balance a and then on the other side we try to give people tools to understand how they are spending their time a and we try to give people tools that on awful curtain and in you are con of stock in some in a loop of of just looking at one type of content will nod you and say how you have ben looking at content of this type for a while like how about something else and heres here is a bunch of other examples thing that there ware things that you can do to count of push this in a posit give direction but think it just starts with having a more new aunts to view if this is not all good and all or all bad and the more t you can make it count of a positive thing that the better this will be for all the people use our products that makes really good sense in terms of the negative experience i agree i do not think anyone wants a negative experience in the moment i think we are some people get concerned perhaps nothing about my own interactions would say integral which i use all the time ism forgetting information out but also consuming information and i happen a love it it is where i essentially launch the non podcast agent of my podcast and continue to i can think of experiences that are a little bit am highly process food where it tastes good at the time it is a it is highly engrossing but it is not unwarily nutritious and you do not feel very good afterwards you for me that would be a mighty the little collage of default em options to click on an istergrahm occasion i notice and this just reflects my failure not instergrahams right that they are a lot of a street fight things of people beating people up on the street and i have to say these have a very strong gravitational pull ism not somebody that enjoy seeing violence person but y i find myself a click among the what happened and it'll see unlike you it get hit and that is liable mayday on the street or something and though seem to be offer to me a lot lately and again this is my fault it reflects my prior searching experience but it i notice that it has a bit of a gravitational pull where you know there is i did not learn anything it is not teaching me any kind of useful street em self defense skills of any kind and at the same time i also really enjoy some of t the cute animal stuff and i get a lot of those also the just pillar is you know collage that is offer to me that reflects my prior search behavior you could argue that the the acute animal stuff am is just entertainment but actually i that it fills me with a feeling in some cases that truly delights me i delight in animals where not just time ma kind i made animals have never seen before interactions between animals i never see before the truly delight me they energize me in a plosive way that when i leave inter graham i do think ism better off ism grateful for the oar of them in that sense but i guess the direct question is is the angry them just reflective of what one has been looking at a lot prior to that moment where they log on or is it also trying to do exactly what you a described which is trying to give people a good feeling experience that leads to more good feelings ye i may i think we try to do this an a long term way right i think one simple example of this is we have this issue a number of yours back about clickable news right articles that would have am basically i a headline i bat grad your attention that made you feel like i need to click on nest than you click on it and in the articles actually know about something that is somewhat tangential to it a but people clicked on it v the naive version of this staff the ten year old version it is a go people seem to be clicking on this maybe that is good but it is ecthoul pretty straightforward exercise to instrument the system to realize that my people click on this and then they do not really spend a lot of time reading the the news that after clicking on it and am after they do this a few times they i it does not really correlate with them in a saying that here having a good experience some of what you some of how we we measure this is just by looking at how people use the services but it is also important to balance that by having real people come in and don't tell us ki we we show them hear the stories that we could have showed you which of these am are most meaningful to you or would would make its that you have the best experience and just kind of mapping the algorithm and what we do to that ground truth of what people say that they want i i think that through a set of things that we really have i made large steps to minimize things click bate over time it is not gone from the internal but i think we have done a good job of minimizing it on on our services within that though i do think that we need to be pretty careful about not being paternalistic about what makes different people feel good right man i do not know that everyone feels good about ago cued animals and i cannot imagine that people would feel really bad about it but may they do not have as profound if a positive i reaction to it as as as you just expressed am and i n know may be people who are more into fighting would look at the in the street fighting videos some that we're within our community standards i think that there is a level of violence that we just do not want to be showing at all but that is a a separate question am but if they are i mean the you know like in a prettiest mama i not get a lot street fighting videos but if i did maybe i it'd feel i was learning something from that am i i think at various times in the company's history we have been a little bit too paternalistic about saying this is good content this is bad you should this am this is unhealthy for you and i i think that we want to look at the long to facts you dot wat to get stuck in in a short term loop of bucket just cause you did this to day does not mean that is what you aspire for yourself over time but i think as long as you look at the long term of what people both say they want and what they do giving people a fair amount of latitude to the things that they i just think feels the right set of values to bring to this i now coursethat doesn't go for everything there are things that are kind of truly offline at and and in a things that bullying for example or you things that are really inciting violence things that and we have a the whole community standards around this but i think except for those things which i would hope that most people can agree you kept bullying is bad right i hope that in hundred per cent of people agree with that in not a hundred may be ninety nine per cut ism except for the things that kind of get bad sort of very youth that feel pretty extreme and bad that i think you want to give people space to what they want alike yesterday i had the a very good experience of learning from the mediteem about safety protections that are in place were kids were using a met platforms and frank the i was really positively surprise at the huge number of filter base tools and and i just ability to customize the experience that it can ism stand the best chance of enriching not just remaining neutral but enriching their mental health status i one thing that came about in that conversation however was i realize the all these tools but do people really know that these tools exist and i think about my own experience within stern mi i love watching patisseries fridge canals because he explains a lot of the tools that i did not no existed mum and people have not seen that highly recommend the they watch that i i think every takes questions on thursdays and answers an most every fridges if ism not aware of the tools without watching that that exists for adults how does met a look at the challenge of making sure that people know that they are all these tools an me dozens and dozens of very useful tools but i think most of us just know the hash tag the tag the click stories verses feed we now not that you knot all suppose to threads i means t we know the major channels and tools but this is owning a vehicle that has incredible features that one what does not realize can take you off road can allow your vehicle to fly at a lot there a what c what you think of be done to get that information out maybe this conversation could cut people to give that is i part part o the reason why wanted to talk to about this as i men i think most of the narrative around social media is not look at all f the different tools that people have to control their experience its the kind of narrative of is this just negative for for fourteens or something and then i think again a lot of this comes down to to i you know how s the experience being tuned and is it actually you our people using it to connect and in positive ways and if i think it is really positive am yet i man i think part of this is proud me to get out and talk to people more about it am and then there is an introduce aspect which is if you are a than an you sign up we take you through a pretty m you'd extensive experience that i tries to outline some of this but that is limits to rite because when you son up for a new thing i if you are bombarded with to cures a list of f of features i just sign up for the sound really understand much about what the services let me go find some people to follow ism who are my friends on here before i learn about controls to and prevent people from harassing me or something i that is why think it is really important also show i a bunch these tools in contact in if you are looking at moments i and in a few if you go to in o to lead a comment or i you go to add it something in a try to give people prompts and lines they did that you can manage things inn these ways ism around that or when you are in the in box and your filtering something right it is a remind people in line like not just because of the number of people who use the products in the level of new aunts surround you to the controls i think the vast majority of i a that education i think needs to happen in the product but i do think that through conversations this and in others that in a went we need to be doing we can cred a broader a wariness that those things exists that way at least people are primed that way when those things pop up in the product peel o ye i i knew that there is this control and yours here is how i would use that i find the restrict function to be very useful more than the block function in most cases have i do some times yet you but the restrict function is really useful that you can filter specific comments some one might have a you might recognize that soon has a tendency to be will aggressive and i should point out that i shall do not really mind what people say to me but i try ad maintain what i call class room rules in my comment section we i do not people attacking other people because i would never tolerate that in the universe class room om i can tolerate them in the comment section for instance ye and i think that the example to you just you just used about restrict first block gets to something about product design that is important too which is that block is sort of this very powerful tool that if some one is given you a hard time an you just want them to disappear from the experience you can do it but the design trait off with that is that in order to make it that the person is just gone from the experience am in that thou do not show up to them they do not so up to you am inherent to that is that they we will have a sense that you block them and that is why i think some stuff restrict or just filtering i edged on to sea is much stuff about this topic am you people using different tools for very subtle reasons rain maybe a maybyou want the content a not show up a be you do not want the person who is posting the content to know that you do not want it to show up maybe soft want o get the messages in your main in box but you do not want to tell the person that you u that you actually unowthat you are not friends or something that a you actually to give people different tools that have different levels of of kind of power and new ants around how the social dynamics are in using them play out am in order to really allow people to tailor the experiments an the ways that they want in terms of trying to limit total amount of time on social media i i could not find really good data on this i how much time is too much i mean it i think it is going to depend on what one is looking out the age of the user et camera ye might liker i i know that you have tools that cue a the user to how long they have been on a given platform are there tools to self regulate thing about the the greekmith of the sirens and people you are tying themselves to the mast and covering their eyes that they are not drawn in by the sirens is there a function aside from leading the a temporarily and then reinstalling it every every time you want to use it again is there a true lock out self lock out function where one can lock themselves out of access to the a why think we give people tools that let them manage this and and and there is the tools that you get to use them there is the tools the parents get to use i to basely see how over us sure works but yet i think that there is there is different count of and i think for now we have mostly focussed on you helping people understand this and then don't give people reminders and things that ism it is tough though to answer the question that you we are talking out before this of is there an amount of time which is too much it does really get to what you are doing but if you fast forward be unjust the apse that we have to day to an experience that it as a social experience in the future of the augmented reality glasses or something that that were building a lot of this is going o be you are interacting with people a in the way that you would physically as if you were kind of lakehang out with friends ore working with people a but now they can show up as telegrams and you can feel at your present right there with them i no matter where they actually are and the question is is there too much time to spend interacting with people that well at the limit if we can get that experience to be can one as rich and giving you as good of a sense of presence am as you would have if you were physically there with some one then i do not see why you would want a restrict the amount that people use that technology to any less then what would be the o amount of time that you would be comfortable interacting with people physically am which voices not to be twenty four hours a day you have to you father stuff i you work an get to sleep but i think it really gets to con of how you are using these things whereas if what you are primarily using the services for is to you say you're getting stuck and loops reading your news or something that is really kind of getting you into a negative mental state then i do notknow i mean i think that here is probably a relatively short period of time that may be that is can of a good thing that you want to be doing a but again even then it is not zero recon that it is it is et just cause news might make you unhappy does not mean that the answer is to be unaware of negative things that are happening in the world i just think that there was different people have different tolerances for what they can take on that a i think we in it is generally having some aware recess probably good as long as it is not more than you are con of constitutionally able to take o i do not now i to to not be to paternalistic about this this hour approach but we want to empower people by young them the tools both people and if you are ten your parents to have tools to understand what your experiencing an and what the i an how you are using these things in than and i go from there i think it requires of all of us some degree of self regulation i the idea of not being too paternalist i coming that is i seems at the right way to go i find myself occasionally having to make sure that ism not just passively scrolling that ism learning i forging for organizing and dispersing information that is been my my life's career i have learned much from social meeting i find great papers great ideas i think comments are a great source of feed back and ism not just saying thatcause you are sitting here i mean it it is dream in particular but other metal platforms have been tremendously helpful for me to get science in health information out one of thinks that ism really excited about which i only had the chance to try for the first time to day is your new caviar platforms the newest oculus and wit then we can talk about the glass is the armbands a those are still that those two experiences are still kind of blowing my mind especially the the the the layman glasses and i have many questions about this ill resist but i memetic to that o get well ye i have some experience with the a my lav as used we are jerry baylinsons lab it at i stamper is one of the pioneering labs of are in and mixed reality i guess some least call augmented reality but now mixed reality i think what striking about thee are that ism get i have me try to day is how well it interfaces with the with the real room let us call it then the physical room cause i i could still see people i could see where the furniture was right it was not in a bump in anything i could see people's smiles i could see my my u my water on the table while i was doing this what felt a real marshal arms experience except i was not getting hit a kiwi was get in it virtually but it is extremely engaging and yet it on the good side things it really by passes a lot of the early concerns the bylaws and lab again a jerry slab what's early to say that oh there is a limits how much o e are one can or should use each day even for the adult brain because it can really district you're a vestibular system your sense of balance all of that seems to have been dealt with in this new this new iteration of the are we did not come out of it feeling dizzy it all i did not feel i was re entering the room in a way that was really jarring ere going into it is obviously well this is a different world but you can look look here last and say oh why someone just came in the door hay hows it go and hold on and playing this game just as it was when i was a kid playing an intend you and some one walk in it is fully engrossing but you me hold on and you see there there first of all am bravo i incredible mum and then the next question is you do not what is this what we even call this experience because it is truly mixed it is astrally mixed reality experience semi mixed realities is sort of the umbrella term that refers to the combined experience of virtual an augmented reality augmented reality is in what you are eventually going to get with in some future version of the smart glasses where you are primarily seeing the world right but i but you can put holograms in it right that well have a in a future where you can walk into a room and back as many holograms as as physical objects for if you just think about all the paper the to art physical games media your work station and you referring if tit let us ay an m i i i we could dead up on the table right here and just out it repeat as the stay turning and looking into scree have not or much any screen that exists could be a hologram in the future with smart glasses right there is nothing that actually physically needs to be there for that when you have glasses that can put i a hologram there and and it is an interesting thought experiment jo go around and think about a what of the things that are physical in the world need to actually be physical your chair does because you are sitting on it a hologram is notion to support you but i that art on the wall inland that does not needs to physically be there and i i think that that is that sort of the augmented reality experience they were moving towards and then we have had these head sets that historically we think about as we are and that has been something that kind of it is a fully mere of experience but now we are kind of getting something it is a highbred in between the two and capable of both which is a head set that can do both virtual reality and some of these augmented reality experiences and and that that is really powerful ism both because your can get new applications that that cant of allow people to collaborate together and i it maybe the two of us ore here physically but give some one joins us and it is their avatar there or maybe in it is some version in the future we are having a your having a tea meeting and you have some people there physically andyou have some people dining and and they are basiclek a hologram they are virtually but the you it have some a eye is that a personas that are on your team that are helping you do different things and they can be embodied as avatars and around the table meeting with you pes oo going to be doing first dates that are a physically separated i could imagine that some peoplewould is it even worth leaving the house type day and then they find out another they meet for the first time ai mean maybe i think u now i dating has physical aspects to it too i and i do not be i not be they want to to whether not it is worth the effort to head out to what when not n it i one of i i li divide right it is possible i mad i know some of my friends who are dating basically you say that in order to make sure that they have a safe experience when they are if they are going on a first date they will schedule something that is shorter and maybe themiddle the day to have it is coffees that way if they do not the person they can just cone to get out before going in scheduling a dinner or a real full date o do now maybe in the future people will we will kind of have that experience it's a where you can feel your count of sitting there and it is and it is even easier and lighter weight and safer and if you are not having a good experience you can just tell aport out of there and beyond ism but yet i think the this will be an interesting question in the future is ism there are clearly a lot of things that are only possible physically that or much better physically and then there are all these things that we are building up that it can be digital experiences but it is this weird art a fact of of how the stuff has ben developed that the digital world in the physical world exist in these completely different plans ore you not interact with he digital world when we do it'll the time but we pull out a small screen or we have a big screen it is basically weren't teaching the digging world through these screens but i think we fast forward in a decade or more it is i think one of the really interesting questions about what what is the world that were on to live in i think it is can increasingly be this mesh of the physical and digital worlds that will allow us to feel e that the the world that we are in is just a lot richer because there can be all these things that people create that are much easier to do digital than than physically ism but it be you are going to have a real count of physical sense of presence with these things and not feel interacting in the digital world is taking you away from the physical world which say is just much sorely richer and more powerful i i think the the signal world will sort of be bedded in the in that and i and and we will feel kind of just as vivid in a lot of ways that is why i ways think andwhen you're saying before and you felt you could look round and see the real room victualling of there is an interesting cunt of philosophical distinction between the real room and the physical room ism which you historically i think peoplewoud have said those of the same thing but i actual thing in the future the real room is going to be the combination of the physical world with all the digital art facts and objects that are in there that you can interact with them and feel present where's the physical world is just the part that is physically there and i think it is possible to build a real world that is the sum of these two that will actually be in a more profound experience than what we have to day i was struck by the smoothness of the interface between the are and the physical room a your team had me try a i guess as an exercise class in the forming but was sensibly hatting its boxing he target's boxing natural ya and and comes at a fairly fast pace at than picks up it is got some tutorials very easy to use and certainly got my heart right up ism in at least decent shape and have to be honest i never once desired to do any of these onscreen fitness things ism n i cannot think of anything more aversive than it a flatlet i soft wat insult any particular products but writing a stationary bike while looking at a screen of pretending of on a road outside i cannot think of anything worse for me maybe li you the leader boar it a yo best a very competitive p a your gin to be running on a treadmill eat least give me a leader board that have beat the people who are had of me i moving outside and and certainly an exercise class or a robin's class as they used to call them but what the experience i tried to day was extremely engaging and have done enough boxing to he least know how to to do a lit bit of it and really enjoyed it gets your hart right up and i completely forgot that i was doing i in onscreen experience because impart because i believe i was still in that physical room and i think there is something about the mash of the physical room and the virtual experience that makes it neither of one world or the other have i really felt at the interface of those and and certainly got presence this feeling forgetting that i was in a virtual experience and got my hurried up pretty quickly we had to stop as we were in a start recording but i would do that for a good forty five minutes in the morning and ah and and y there is no amount of money you could pay me truly to i look at a screen while peddling on a biker running on a treadmill again bravo i think it is can be very useful it to going to get people and their bodies more which certainly social media up until now and a lot of technologies have been accused of limiting the amount of physical activity that that both children and culture engaged in and we know we need physical activity rope proponent of in practical or others clack to be si is this a major goal of media get people moving their bodies more and getting their hart rates up and and on i think we want to enable it i think it is good but i i think it comes more from a philosophical view of the world then it is new sir lemon i do not go into building products to try o shape people's behavior rut i i believe in empowering people to do what they want and be the best version of themselves that they can be to know agent that is said i do believe that an there is the the previous generation of computers were devices for your mind and i think that we are not brains and tanks ism it is elect thing that theirs sort of a a philosophical view of people look at you you are primarily in what you think about or your values or something itsicno you are that and you are a physical manifestation and people were very physical and i think building a computer for your whole body and not just for your mind is very fitting with this world view that the actual essence of you if you want to be present with another person if you want to be fully engaged in experience is not just oka it is not just a idea conference call that looks at your face and where you can share ideas ism it is it is something that that you can engage your whole body ye on i think being physicals very important to me mines i that is it just it the that is a lot of the most f stuff that i get to do m it is a really important part of how i personally balance my energy levels and just get a diversity of experiences because ani could spend all my time running the company ism but i thing it is good for people to do some different things and compete different areas or learn different things and all of that ism is good if if people want a you do not do really intense work outs with ism with the work that we are doing with quest or with ism you'd eventually our glasses great but even if you do not want to do a really intense work out i think just having a computing environment and platform which in inherently physical captures more of the essence of what we are as people than any of the previous computing platforms that we have had to date i was even thing just of the am simple task of getting a better range of motion acute flexibility i coal imagine inside of the car experience your leaning into a scratching a standard kind of you lunch tripe scratched but actually seen a meter of are you get are you approaching new levels of flexibility in that moment i we acting measuring some some kinesthetic elements on the body in the joints and ism nits is trust whereas normally might veter you that in front of a camera which then would give you the date on a screen that you look at afterwards or higher an expensive coach but or looking at a form in resistance training store actually lifting physical weights but it is telling you whether not your breaking form i mean that there is much at could be done inside o there and then my mind bustards spiral into while this is very likely to transform what we think of as building exercise ye i think i thin there still a bunch of questions that need to get answered ism you do not i do not think most people gin a necessarily want to install in a lot of censors or cameras to track their whole bodies who were just overtime getting better from the censors that are on the headsets have been able to do very good hand tracking rights even we we have this research do were you now just with the hand tracking i from the heads that you can type it just projects a little keyboard onto your table and you can type an people telic a hundred words a minute with that with a racial keyboard yah we are starting to be able you i using some modern a i techniques be able to smulatean understand where your torsos position is i even though you cannot always see it you can see at a bunch of the time and if you fuse together what you do see i with the accelerometer and understanding how the thing is moving you can kind of understand what the body position is gin to be i but somethings your still can be hard rights o you mention boxing i that one works pretty well because in a understand your head position we understand your hands m and and now we are were kind of increasingly understanding your your body position i built you want to expand that to i movie or kick boxing e legs that is a different part attacking that is harder i cause that is out of the field of you more the time but there is also the element of resistance rights you can throw a punch and retract it and shadow boxing in o do that i without upsetting your count of physical balance that much but if you won to throw a round house kick i and there is no one there then in am the standard where they do in when your shadow boxing as you basely do a little three sixty but i knows that as that can feel great i mean i think there is a question about what the what that experience should be i and the if you want to go even further if you want to get grappling i tit to work i i ism not even sure how you would do that without having resistance of understanding what the forces applied to you would be and just then you get into came maybe er can have some kind of body suit that can apply your hayricks but ism not in sure that that even a pretty advanced tactic system is going o be i to be quite good enough to do jo simulate the actual forces that would be applied to you i in a grappling scenario this is part of what is fun about technology those you get you keep on getting new capabilities and then you need to figure what things you can do with them i think it is really neat that we can can a do boxing and we can do the supernatural thing and am there a bunch of all some cardie and dancing and things that am and then there is also still much more to do that that ism excited to to a a get to over time but i but it is ad it is a long journey and what about things painting and art an muse you imagine you do not of course you been different mediums the to to draw an pen and pencil but i could imagine then to learn how to paint in virtually and of course you could print out of physical the origin of that at the end this does not have to depart from the physical world hit could end in the physical sordid you see the demo the the piano dang where you am either you are there with a physical keyboard for could be a virtual keyboard but the basically highlight's what keys you need to press am in order to play the song it is basically you are looking at your piano and it is teaching you how to play a song that you choose an actual piano debut it is illuminating certain keys in in the virtual yes and it can either be a virtual piano if you or keyboard if you do not have a piano or keyboard or it could use your actual keyboard a ya am i think stuff that is going to be really fascinating for education an expression am and for broad excuse me but for and for broadening access to total expense of equipment i ma piano is is no small expense e claim it is and it takes up a lot of space and abbytuned year the thing of all these things the kid that has very little in hammer the family as realize income could learn to play a virtual piano at much lower to the en it get's back to the question i was asking before about this thought experiment of how many of the things that we physically have to day actually need to be physical the piano does not a maybe there is some premium where it is maybe it is a somewhat better more tactual tactual experience to have a physical one but for people who do not have the space for it or who who cannot afford to to buy a piano or just are not sure that they would not to make that investment to the beginning of learning out of play piano i think in the future you will have the option of justifying in an a or a hologram piano which will be in a lot more affordable i and i think it is can be that is can to be unlock unlock ton a creativity too because and instead of the market for piano makers being constrained to a relatively small set of experts who have perfected that craft your can have kids or developers all around the world designing crazy designs for an potential keyboards and pianos that look nothing what we have seen before but are maybe bring even more jocund or even more can find in the world where you have fewer these physical constraint i i fiats contain scamming on a wild stuff to explore this dealing o bead a while stuff to i for it just had this i this idea flesh a image in my mind of what you are going ut merge with our earlier conversation when pricillo is here of i could imagine a time not too flong from now where you using mixed reality to run experiments in the lap literally mixing virtual solutions getting potential outcomes and then piano the best one to then go actually do in the reailword which is very both a financially costly and and am time wise costly ye mean people are already using the are for surgery an education on it ism there is some study that was done that i basic we did it tragus controlled experiment of people who learned how to do a specific surgery ism through just a normal conatextbook and lecture method verses you show the knee and you have it indie a large blown up model and people can manipulated and and can a practice where they would make in the cots and and the people in that classed better am i think there is it is i its can be profound for a lot of different araks anilest a example at leaves to minor i think at social media and on line culture has been accused of creating a lot of a real world that's call physical world's social anxiety for people but i could imagine ism practicing a social interaction for a kid that has a lot of social anxiety or that needs advocated for themselves better learning how to do that progressively through a virtual interaction and then taking that to the real world because it is it my very recent experience to day it is blended now with with real experience that the kid that feels terrified of advocating for themselves or we are just talking another human bringer and adult there being in a new circumstance of a roomful of kids you could really experience that in insilico first get comfortable let this nervous system attenuate a bit and then take it into the coin quit physical world yet i think we will see experiences that and i also think that some of the social dynamics surround how people interact in this kind of blendeddigital world we will be more new ants in other ways ism sure that thrill be kind of new anxieties that people developed to just no teens to day need to navigate dynamics surround testing constantly that am that we just o have when we were kids a i think it will hope that somethings i thin it there will be new issues that hopefully we can help people work through too but abut over all i think i on i think it is can be really powerful and positive that's talk about the glasses sir this was wild ye put on a pair of ratans i the way they look they are clear they look any other glass ratan glasses am except that i could call out to the glasses i go to say hey met a i want to listen to the both variations the golfer variations of bach and met a responded and no one around me could hear but i could hear i with exquisite clarity my way ism not care not pay to say any this ism just still blown away by this ops i i want pair of these very badly i could hear oke ism selecting those now and were that that music now and then i could hear it in the background but then i could till have a conversation this was neither headphones in nor headphones out i and i could say weight pass the music and it would pass i and the best part was i did not have to leave the room mentally the attempt a mats neck out a phone yes it was all interface through this very local environment in and round the head and as a sure scientist ism fascinating by this because of course all of our perceptions auditory visual at hetero cursing in inside the casing of this of the thing we call a skull but i maybe could comment on you the the origin of that design for you e u know what the ideas behind that and where you think it could go because ism sure ism just scratching the surface the real product that we want to eventually get to is this can a full augmented reality product in a c stylish and comfortable normal glasses form factor not do any the or head set to speak no i en a that he our heads tat does feel could it will but things on the far there can be place for that to just you have your lap top and you your work station ism or maybe the better analogy as you have your phone in you your work station ism these a our glasses are going to be your phone and that and you have something on your face and you will i think be able to if you want wear it for a lot of a day in interact with with i with it very frequently i do not think that people can be our walking around the world wearing car head sets wat but yet that is it's certainly not the future that that i that ism can a hoping we get to but i do think ha there as a place where ism for having because it is a biggereform factor it has more compute power just your work station or your your kind of bigger computer can do more than your phone can do i there is a place for that when youwant to settle into an intense task react if you haven't doctor who is doing a surgery i would want them doing it through the head set not through that and have not through their phone equivalent or that there just kind of lower power end glasses but just phones are powerful enough to do a lot of things in the glasses well eventually get there too ism now that is that there is a bunch of really hard technology problems ism to address in order to bald to get to this point where you can put can a full holograms in the world you are basically miniaturizing a supercomputer and putting it into a pair of glasses ism that the pair of glasses still looks stylish and normal and ism that is a really hard techknowledge you problem making things small is really hard am a holographic display his m it is it is different from what our industry is optimized for for in a thirty or forty years now building screens there is a whole conofindustrial process around that that goes into phones arteries and computers and increasingly many things that that have different screens there is a whole pipe line that is gone very good to making that kind of screen and the holographic displays are just a completely different thing right cause it is not that is not a screen right it is a thing that you can shoot light into through in a later or some other kind of projector and it can place that as an object in the world that is going to my to be this whole other an industrial process that gets built up to doing that in an efficient way all that is that we are basically taking two different approaches towards building this at once one is we or try to keep in mind what is the the long turn thing that it is not superior off i think within few years i think we will have something that that sort of a first version of cold of this full vision them talking about and we have something that is working internally that we uses at that we use a delicate ism but that one that is that is cone of big challenge it is can be worexpensive am and it is harder to get a the pieces working the other reproach has been are right let us start with what we know we can put into a a pair of stylish son glasses to day and just make them as smart as we can you now for the first version and we we worked with a we i this celebration with layman like as that is well accepted these are well designed glasses their classic people of have used them for decades for the first version we got censer on the front you could capture moments without having to take your phone out of your pockets you got photos and videos a you have the speaker and the microphones you can listen to music am you could communicate with it ah but it was that was that was sort of the first version it we had a lot of basics there but we saw people used it and we tuned it we made the the camera is twice as good for for this new version that we made the kudu has a lot crisper for the use cases the we saw the people back she used which is some of us listening to music but a lot of it is people want to take calls on their glasses a an we listen to podcast it you a the biggest thing that i think its interesting is the ability get a eye running on it which it it does not just run on the on the glasses it also it can proxies through your phone but an with all the advances in fella lams we talked about this bit in the the first part of of the the conversation a having the ability to have your media a i assistant thatyou can just talk than basically ask any question throughout the day is i think it we really fascinating and you no you're saying about can of how we how we process the world as people a eventually i think you are going to want your a my assistant to bell to see what you see and hear what you hear we'd not all the time we you're going to wont to real to tell it to go into a mode where it can see what us y and hear what you hear and what is the kind of device design that best kind of positions ay i assistant to real to see what you see and hear what you hear contest help you all it is glasses right where were basely has a sensertebeal to see what you see and i a microphone that is close to your years that can hear what you hear i the other singles is you said to keep you present in the world rights i think one of the issues with phones is they cant o pull you away from from what is physically happening around you and i do not think that the next generation of computing will do that am i just chuckling myself because have a friend he is a very well known photographer and he was laughing about how people go to a concert and everyone is filming the concert on on our phone e they can be the person that post the thing but late their curly millions of other people propose of exact same thing but somehow our unique ex it feels important to post our unique experience with glasses that would essentially of smooth that am gap ism completely yet o lam e us worry about it later download there are issues i realize with with glasses because they are seamless with everyday experience even thoughyou man i are not wearing them now it is very common for people tho were glasses i a issues of recording in consent yet li going i going into a locker room at my him it is o i li mi suing tat the people with glasses are not filming where as one's right now because there is a a sharp transition when when there is a phone in an a room and some one's pointing it am people generally say know it phones in gelockrooms and recording am that is just one instant something their other and we have the whole privacy light i i can getyuas sue for the yes it is any time that it is active that the cameracenser is active i it is it is basically pulsing a white bright light goddess which is by way more than cameras do i i was i going a the i mans an i phones aren't are not count of showing a white a bright censor when when your technaphoto no people oftentimes will pretend their testing in their actual recording as she saw an instance of this in a barber shop once where some one was recording and they were pretending that they were testing and t in in interest here was a pretty intense interaction that ensued and it was wo its for pretty easy for people tho detain testing while actually recording yes i think when you are valuating a risk with a new technology the bar should not be is it possible to do anything bad it is does this new technology make it easier to do something bad than what people already had and i think because you have this privacy light that is just broadcasting to everyone around you ay this thing is recording now a have not that makes it actually less discreet to do it through the glasses than what you could do with a phone already a which i think as is basefhrough the bar that we wanted to get over from a designed perspective thank you for point out that it has the privacy light i did not get long enough in the experience to explore all the features but am again i can think of a lot of use as am being able to look at a restaurant from the outside and see the men you oh yam get states and how crowded it is a is much as i love i do twat to call out let you say a abased map a functions that allow you to navigate and the audio is o k it is nice to have a conversation am with somebody on the phone or in the vehicle and just be great if the road was traced where i should turn the absolute these kinds of things we it that is can be straightforward for for medaaninstant are a future version we will hae its but also have the holographic display work can show you the directions but give not there old basically just be indifferent price points that pack different amounts of technology the holographic display part i think is going to be more expensive than doing one that just has the a i but is a but it is primarily communicating you wit with you througadio simmer that the current armband mat a glasses i two ninety nine i you nit think when we have one that has a display in it it will prison some amount more than that but it will also be more powerful i think that their will people choose what they want o use based on what the capabilities are at they want and what they can afford but i but a lot of our goal and building things is i you know we try to make things that can be accessible to everyone i our game as a company is not to build things and then charge a premium price for it we try to build things that then every one can use m and then become more useful because a very large number of people are using them i it is just a very different approach i were not were not apple or a some of these companies that just try to make something n then sell it for as much i as as as they can which i mean their great company summing a for the that that model con obis is fine too but i but are our approaches can be we want stuff that can be a fordable that way every one in the world can use it long lines of health i think the glasses will also potentially sold a major problem in a in a real way which is the following a for both children and adults its very clear that viewing objects in particular screens up close for too many hours pray leads to myopia lily i literally change in the length in a length of the eyeball and near sightedness i and on the positive side we know based on some really large clinical trials i that kids who spend and adults who spend two hours a day or more out of doors i do not experience that and maybe even reverse the myopia it has something to do with exposure to sunlight but has a lot to do with long viewing going things at a distance greater than three or four feet away and with the glasses i realize one could actually do did vital work out of doors i it could measure and tell you how much time you have spent looking at things up close verses far away i mean it this just is another example it leaps to mine but in in accessing the visual system you are effectively accessing the whole brain because it is the only two bits of brain that are outside the cranial vault it just seems putting tachknolegy right at the level of the eyes seeing what the eyes see is just got to be the best way to go ye i think all multifoil red i think is you want the visual sensation but you also an count of text or language sir i think it is that all can be brought to the level of the eyes would you be well i mean i think we are describing here is a mentally taking the phone the computer i and bringing it all to the level of the eyes and of course one would musically a physically at your eyes right ye and one would more am anesthetic information as you we me for where the legs are maybe long function hah have you taken enough steps to day but yet that all can be if it can be figured out on the phone it can be by the phone it can be figured out b the glasses i but there is additional information there such as what a you focussing on in your world how much of your time is spent looking at things far away verses up close how much social time did you have today s it is really tricky to get that with a phone they give my phone wright in front of us as if we were at a standard lunch nowadays certainly i silicon value and then people were peering at our phones an been how much real direct attention and was in the conversation at hand verses something else me can get is shoes of where are you placing your attention i by virtue where you are placing your eyes and i think that information is not accessible with a phone in your pocket or in front of you my in that a little bit i but not nearly as rich a in complete information as one gets when you really pulling the data from the level of of vision and what what kids and adults are actually looking at an attending to ye ye yes that is extremely valuable i you get economic information size of the pupils s you get information about internal states mean that you goes there is internal censor and outside there is the censor on the armband met glasses is external ritard space allows you to see what you see then lives i the a i assistant to see what you are seeing there is a separate set of things with you are eye tracking i which a ore else very powerful i for enabling a lot of interfaces wherein is a you on it if you under just look at something and select it by looking at it with your eyes rather a haven't o and of drag a controller over or pick up a hologram or or anything that you can do that with eye tracking i that is a pretty profound and in cool experience too i is well is just could of understanding what you are looking at that we are not can a wasting compute power drawing pickles in high resolution a part of the kind of world that your to that is can be in your puerperal vision i see all o these things i they are interesting design in technology tried offs where if you want the external censer that is one thing if you also want the eye tracking know tit is a different set of censors each one of these i consumes compute which consumes battery i they take up more space or its its a were are the eye tracking censors can be it is what you want a make sure of the rim of the glasses is actually quite thin because am in it is and if there is a covariance of your how thick can glasses be before they look more goggles than glasses i thing that this is there's this whole space and i think people are an end of choosing what product make sense for them make they wants an that is more powerful that as more the censers i but it is but it is can be a little more expensive may be slightly thicker i or maybe want a more basic thing that just looks very similar to what armband glasses are that people been wearing for decades but con has a eye in it and you can capture moments i without him to take your phone out and send them to people in the latest version we got the ability in to lie live stream thing at that is pretty crazy that now you can be kind of you are going back your concert case or and whatever else you are doing you can be i an doing sports and and just a watching your kids play something and and just you can be watching and you be live streaming it your you are con family group ism some people can see it i ithimpatike that stuff is i it's that is precool that you past have a normal looking pair of glasses at this point that can count of live stream and n has an a i assistance si that the stuff is making a lot faster progress in a lot of ways than i would a thought m and a i think people can a this version but there is a lot more still to do i think it is superexciting and i see a lot ticnolodgies this one's particularly excite know me because of how smoothie interface is and for all the reasons tat you just mentioned i what is happening with and what can we expect around a i interfaces and maybe en avatars of people within social media are we ism not far off from a day where there are multiple versions of me and you on the earned where people for instance i gan ask a lot of questions i do not have the opportunity respond all those questions but ism wit things catch p t people are trying to generate answers to those questions on other my forms will i have the opportunity to soon have an a i version of myself where people can ask me questions about what i recommend for sleep in circadian rhythm fitness mental health et camera based on content have already generated that will be accurate say go just ask my avatar ye this is something that i think a lot of creators are gin a want that ism the we are trying to build ism and i think we will probably have aversion of next year but there is a bunch of constraints that i think we need to make sure that we get right for one think it is really important that it is not that there is a bunch of versions of you it is that if any one is creating the an a i assistant version of you it should be something you control right it is ism i think there is some platforms there out there to day that just let people a make no ta a i not o me or other figures in it is i do notknow and we we have platform policies for ism for decades i i since the beginingof the company at this point which is almost twenty years that i that basically do not allow impersonation ism you now real identity is one of the coraspects that that con of our company was was started on as you want o can authentically be yourself ism i i think if you are if yoke almost any creator being able to engage your community and there is just going o be more demand interact with you than you have hours in the day there both people who out there who would benefit from being able to talk to an a version of you i and i think you an other creators would benefit from bendable to keep your community engaged in in service that demand that people have to engage with you but you are gong to one to know that that a i con aversion of you or assistant ism is going to represent you the way t at you would want and ism there are lot outings that are some about cone of these modern aliens but having perfect predictability about how it is can to represent something is not one of the current strengths i know there is some work that needs to get done there i soft think it needs to be a hundred percent perfect all the time but you needs have very good confidence i would say that it is going to that is going to represent you the way that you would want for you to want ta turn it on i which again you should have control over whether you turn it on i we wont to start in a different place which i thing is a somewhat ism was your problem which is creating new characters that the for er a i person as o that way it is not i in a we we built you one of the a eyes is a chef and ism they can help you con come up with things that you should that you could cook and can help you cook them i there is a couple of people that a interest in different types of fitness that can help you can a plan out your work outs or on help with recovery your different things that am they are people there's an a eye that is focused on de icy crafts i there is someone yes a travel expert that can help you make travel plans or r give you idea but the anything out all these is they are not m they are not modelled off of existing people they do not have to have kind of a hundred per cent fidelity to making sure that they never say something that youknow a real person who there modeled after would never say because they are just made up characters and the that is i that a someone easier problem ism in we actually got the we got a bunch of different kind of well known people to play those characters because we though that would make it more fun there is snoop dog is the dungeon masters you can drop him into a thread in plight ten based games and it just i do this with my daughter when i when i am tuck her in at night and she just loves i story telling right in it is ilea the snoop dog is the dungeon master will come up with hears what is happening next and is can i turn into a mermaid and then i swim across the bay and i that go and find the the treasure chest and unlock it it is and thensnoop dog just always will have an next version of the the next generation on the story and it is it stuff as fun but on it is not act snoop dog he is just kind of the actors playing the dungeon master which makes it more fun i that is rather right place to start is you have you can count of build versions of these characters that that people can interact with doing different things but i think what you want to get over time is to the place where any creator or any small business can very easily just great in a i assistant that can represent them an interact with your kind of community or customers if you are business i in in basically just help you grow your you aren't surprise i think that is typical but i thins it is a long turn project i think we will have more progress sonnets report on next year but am but think that is coming ism super excited about because i you do not we hear a lot about the downsides of a i man i think people are now coming around to the et the reality that a i is neither good nor bad it can be use for good or bad and that there lot of life enhancing space is that it is get to show up and really really improve the way that we engage socially a what we learn and that mental health an physical health do not have to suffer an infant can be enhanced by the sorts of technologies we have been talking about i know you extremely

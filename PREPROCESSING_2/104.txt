donate trump leaps to a ten point lead over jobidon in t latest washington post pole general markmilly finally leaves and sewer bobmananda's wont come even if you find bars of gold under his bed i venturous this is the bench per show the benchmark show montero expressive the plan protect our on mine privacy today at if presupian i come flash men of the big e argument against dona trump as their publican hominy has historically been that he is unelectable that is been the argument against him because obviously he lost to jobidon into thousand twenty he did not when the popular vote against tiller client in twenty sixteen and squeaked out a win against her in that election cycle and thus going up against jobidon again he is going to hit the same ceiling that he in twenty sixteen and twenty twenty which is about forty six per cent of the vote but if the pole stark to show that donate trump actually does not having ceiling at forty six per cent instead his ceiling is fifty or fifty one the electability argument against dona trump goes completely away will now we have for the first time a pole showing dona trump breaking at glass ceiling according to the washington post over the weaken this pole shows dona trump over over jobidon by ten point that is an amazing pole infected such an amazing pole at the washington post as already labeled into own pole an outlier saying that hoe can take a pole this is true you can take a pole and sometimes the selection of the people who are in the pole is a little bit weird and seegetn outlier pole but the problem is this even if the pole is off by margin of error five six seven points that would demonstrate that trump is still running dead even with jobidon which again under cuts the delectability argument against donate trump according to the washington post widen and former president trump appear headed for rematch of their twenty twenty contest a thigh more than three and five democrats and democratic leading independence say would prefer hominy other than the president but bids an bikers have argued hes still the strongest democrat for twenty twenty four it seems to me that there is the possibility that all this bad polling for bison is leading up to an attempt to defend straight bison to get rid of him to toss hideout window to find somebody else who can replace him presumably that would not be one of the candidates were correctly talking about you could see a situation in which micelle bomb parissutes in from the rafters in order to sweep up the nomination by a claim one thing is for certain tjobidon running this weak against dona trump is horrible for the prospect of jobidon is the actual twenty twenty four now many according to the post a sea pole it chose bison trailing trump by ten per centare point but then the washing post policies that eave the sizeable marginal trumps leading the survey is significantly at jobs with other public poles that show the general election contest a virtual dead heat the difference between this poles and others as wells the unusual make up of trump and widens coalitions in the survey suggest it is probably an outlier against the washington post under mining tum pole nim not going to do the pole unskewin what i will point out is that this is the second presidential pole in the last three the chose dona trump with an actual sizable lead against jobidon the the last pole before this was an enbysenews pole that chowed them tied at forty six per cent the pope for that was a pole from the messenger hairisacts which showed trump up five in fact there is no pole with jobidon up more than one per cent in the last one and a half every pole has either trump up one or widen up one or their tide the messenger hairs expose has trump up five now this would suggest there's still a sizable undivided pot undecided population that is out there amour's on to read you the latest poles in this in this particular matchup be ones wash post trump plus ten and be sense tie the messenger herrisac trump plus five emersion phones morning consul tie tie tide hazard derris trump up one hazard eraspesan reports trump up for rasmeson reports widen plus one economist you go biding up one fox news trump up to to another words it is either larger of err or trump up that seems to be the the pulling then and that is different then it was just a few months a go a few months ago there is a suggestion that that actually biding had a pretty sizeable lead if you go all h way back to jury quinnipia ha biding up five ye had phones would biding up for if you go back a litlefor than that a who's had biting up seven but bottom line is this s a very competitive race and the reason is is competitive race is because mobile is a terrible president why your being in this pole is horrific numbers for jobidon jobidins job approval rating right now according to this post baby sense pol is thirty seven per cent fifty six per cent disapprove in that that is that is an amazing at thirty seven per cents approval rating for the sitting presidents of the united states as far as the state of the nations economy twenty five per cent believe that is excellent are good compared to seventy four per cent to believe that it is not good or poor thirty five per cent believe that the unemployment rate is excellent are good compared fifty seven per cent who believe it is not good or poor on food prices ninety one per cents of people believe it is not good or poor bison has terrible ratings on the economy and emigration as well on the economy thirty percents approval rating in emigration twenty three per cent approval rating now again there is some aspects of this pol that a i would we very dudes in terms of will that hold up for a general election just because they would be unprecedented again maybe the real but if they are not real that would not be a shock either because again a lot of these numbers are quite shocking for example this pole suggests the dona trump only loses my north voters by nine points now to be fair biding one the non white not in in two thousand twenty by forty five points you would have to assume eight thirty six points change in minority votes between two thousand twenty and two thousand and twenty for three years ago biding one voters between eighteen and twenty nine by fifteen points in this pole trump finds those voters by sixteen points that is a thirty one point swing means are massive huge enormous swings that pole shows unbelievable swings toward trump as pointed out by sac shore writing for medicine it shows unbelievable things toward trump among independents plus twenty six royal voters plus twenty six moderates plus twenty two urban voters plus fourteen but here is the thing even if this pole is a really bad outlier the pulling for provide right out is just terrible a cross the board it is terrible remember domaltrump is one of the single most unpopular politicians in your america history and he is running dead even with a dude the media chose and have counted as he next coming of friar that says something but how bad jobidon is as a president of the united states and democrats are getting ready two hit the panic button now they cannot say their hitting panic button this is the weird part the democratic party base does not want yobidon three in five democratic voters do not want robin but the democratic you lead understand that what comes places in all out war which is why you have the useless secretary of transportation people to judge who again when of paternity for two months nobody notice p budjedge is is now attempting to avoid the implications o the bull which the jobidon problem should step aside if hes competitive atonal truck the poll the vast majority of america people are not happy with president bill leadership on a range of topics and issue what do you say that the forty for per sent of america who say they are worst off now then they wore before bid took office woo we all know the economic pressure their america have felt the when the president took office the economy was flat on its back but were also getting extraordinary results more than thirteen million jobs created that is more than any presidential term in america history and yes it takes a while for people to feel to full benefits of those results just bet it is can to take a while to build all of the infrastructure there were now under way on with the president's generational infrastructure to but got the due don keep happy talk in that crapped it is not

that is pure talk dot cam slash of pro once more pure talk dot cam slash chipiro well one person is hitting the panic button on behalf o mobile and that of course is killer canton hillock clintonia according to the ucadaily mail actually man jobidon in a private meeting he needed to take the threat of ma third party challenge a seriously as you faces all time high disapproval ratings and sits behind former president one trump in some surveys an beseem who is reported money the clean gave the president the warning wile so as at the white house for a ceremony alongside first lady oil bison earlier this month canton of course feels that she lost because it oil stay was the spoiler well now bison is facing not just corneal west or the no label's candidate but he is facing down robin off penny junior who is not going to go away and probably runs as they third party candidate our of kajunor could easily win seven eight per cent of the vote and that could mean the different for jobidon for shore and this is all because jobidon is terrible at the job now we we have been assuming all long the twenty twenty four if it is between trump and bison is can be reared among one of the two and the safe assumption is that i was can be referee iron trump because trump obviously sucks up the headlines but maybe it is not maybe'sn't that is possible to in twenty sixteen wo is referee among killer client because people hated misery just that much my assumption i think the sumption of a lot of other people is that the rough serena in twenty twenty for would be on trump not on bison because bison is dead now again i may still be right on that it may be that as the indictments come in as the focus shifts back t trump is trump becomes the formal moline that all the democrats come home right now whit these polls are showing is market enthusiasm for jobidon may be that once trump is the actual moline everybody snaps back in a place in thy say we have to they say we have to stop trump that of course of what jobidon is betting on what is amazing to me though is that the democratic party is willing to bet on jobidon in this race against tonal trump and there bunch feather candidates for sitting on the solans the problem is that that same washington postbox shows that there is no consents is back up to jobidon if jobidon steps out got comely hers eight per cent get p body jet seven per cent there is no one out there who consolidates the base this we suggest that the can wild wild car deer is michelobomub coming in from the wings riding a unicorn something that that is what democrats probably are hoping for at this point but again jobidon he is a desperate cannon he should be a desperate candidate because he is he is got problems this is we his now pulling out all the stops at this point on things the economy jobidon is trying to shore up his union support he is get go to the picket lines apparently in wane county michigan according to manner you a w union president show fane will join president hoiden on the picket line tuesday and wane county michigan according to a source familiar at the situation the source provided no s specifics about these act location the w a w however is not involved the former president trumps plan visit on wednesday nor haven in contact with his team trump apparently is get a skip that second presidential primary debate and californium which is supposed to happen on wednesday and he is expected to also head to michigan toad dress those union workers now this is something that the trump team worked hard on in twenty sixteen they tried to make reach out to a lot of the rows belt workers in that men going and making overtures to many of the private sector unions now publicsector unions but private sector unions the u now to be completely fair to the automakers what do you a w is asking for in these negotiations is totally while mean asking for a thirty two hour work week and defined benefit plans which is what easily bankrupt to the car companies in the first place is a non starter but in terms of the pure politics of the sit action dona trump again this is what makes dona true of formidable candidate is that donate trump is willing to take advantage of any opening rat does not matter from which direction he will he will take you from the left he will take it from the right because he does not actually have a set of for principals tonal trump this means that president trumpet ill come et jobidon from the left he will try to edge him out of his union support with the u a this now has forced jobidon to go to the picket lines in michigan to trying shore up that you a u support that titshappening right here according to signed negotiations between the striking you a on fort remain very active over the week end and on money but they are still some distance on key issues meanwhile the a be you says is expanding it strike against go and to mantas but said progress an negotiation with ford means it will not expand the number of four workers on the picket lines now again the fact that bison is headed two the picket lines is pretty shocking for the setting president of the united states to actively take fight in take sizes in a labor dispute that he himself is effectively created through his electric vesical mandates which is what all these car companies are looking at n freaking out about because they make all the money off gas word engine and now the'rebeing told they end to go to significantly less economically efficient e vs an these companies are selling three percent of their total growths is eves right now there being told they neetsto shift completely over to es an next few years and mama got the u a u as pressuring them fora bigger share of the profits which origin a need nor to make that envy shift they are stupetin a rock in a hard place created by jobidon and now jobidon is taking sides withe u a u and the man is really a bad president he is a truly terrible president and the fact that he left the or open to donate trump to swoop in and around grass om you a support is pretty amazing now what is even more amazing is how jobidons economic policies have exacerbated all ready present spurious progeny in the america economy in stationary policy of jobidon has are y exacerbated a labor shorts that is been generated by the demographic collapse of the west in general get to that momentarily first well valet on our scents of how much we have to do everyday got sock or practice science fears prepping for the holidays cot pick up my kids all the restart the good news is you can take a big thing off your play by putting great meat on your plate with good ranchers you care about your family eats while genes to the folks over good rangers that is were they have spent years building relationships of local farms to force the best on hundred per cent america beef chicken pork and now wild caught seafloor as well the best of the land and we you can now get conveniently delivered to your door right now the offering two years of free ground beef to anybody who subscribes that is a four hundred eighty dollar value that is two years of free high quality ground beef in a locking price no other meat company guarantees you one hundred per cent america meat and a lock in prices cause no one ease's good ranchers he insane on your beef chicken and port locking n your price to day every single stake house quality cut is individually rapped in flash rosin to make meal time easy go to good rancher's dot come to day use cod ben for twenty my but off in free ground be for to years remember subscribe to any box to lock inter price on america best meat for two whole years as well that is good rancher's dot come today use macoben there were five hundred bus an taking subscribes to good rangers america meats delivered was the hoiden con comic policy is creating serious problems that there are already exacerbated demographic problem that undergirds the entire west economic stagnation and has for the last several years according tote waster vernal the use economy has been running in probably with an unemployment rate under forever sent for nearly two years this is not just to hold over from pandemic podlenicts when employers that millions o people go and then struggle to find workers to come back it is a storm that has been brewing for decades floating at most recently in the form of worker strikes at automakers and air lines labor shortages are turning into a long from labor prices that could push wages and turnover higher it turns you the when you inflate the currency in the middle of the situation demographically or running out of young workers well you to that disjoin to do it is in crate labor shortages work experts have warned for years the combination of baby boomeretirements low berth rates shifting emigration policies and changing worker preferences is leaving you us employers with two few workers to fill job openings while the labor market is softening none of those factors are expected to change aromatically in the coming years total employment has been grow about zeroing three per cent ta year until twenty thirty two according tote labor department tat is much slower than the one point two per cent ate over the pastecade that is largely because the population constraints and that is going to lead to slower growth in g t p productivity is probably going to drop ex gan you do not have enough young workers were coming into the work for because baby boomers did not have enough babies the just birth rat as been falling for decades to lining by about half since the nineteen sixties when you in oleate the currency in the middle of a work or shortage what you went uplyth is waged spirals which means price spirals which means wage spirals which means e economic stagnation it all of this has ben exacerbated by again the garbage policies of the widen administration everybody knows it everybody can feel the stagnation as it sensing for a while i do not think that inflation s actually the long from threats of theamerican economy stagnation is long from threat to the america economy this by the way has one of the reasons you wouldimagion wyjobidon is actually very lays fair about our borders because when you realize america has a demographic problem that we do not have enough young workers and when you realize that the solutions to that demographic problem would be two for example raise the retirement age that the solutions o that demographic problem to be to stop inflating t the currency that the the actual solution to all these demographic promises to increase productivity by allowing the innovative people in the united states to actually innovate and make money off of it as post to regulating them out of existence on behalf of government redistribution's when you realized that you wouldn't have to have an open border but if you are going to keep all those bad policies and place in need a fresh supply of workers were toucan get that fresh supply of workers while jobidoning company they nowhere and the answers south of the border which presumably is why the customs an border patrol has told fox news that here are proximately eleven cousin migrant in counters at the southwestern border in the last twenty four hours marking the single highest day in recent memory there now pictures emerging from the southern border of small children crawling trough barbed wire to get into the united states i do not see alexandero cosoprotes down ate order protesting the border policies meanwhile j johns the form er home land security secretary no right winger he is out there saying at the numbers are ginger et higher and higher the administration porter break and may every one was expecting large numbers after the end of title forty to but the emesis there was a my way in a long way to come to this country i have that is well in supply in a proper way these the a going to reason a process in enters and the migrants and the smugglers of now figured out that that that that those things do not are at not able t handle these numbers insole working around this system again and ism worried that these numbers going to get higher and higher march it pretend to be the leap months if were seeing these kinds of numbers in september october i think we are in for a real ness there is a reason why joined abuvlerating on that the border is in the twenties in the twenties which means a huge number of democrats do not how he is acting bout the border either and the media praetorian iron can will protect on us jimicosta hat on a republican congress person talking about the border and at is rape normal republican and a and here it is jimicosta trying to somehow defend jobidans open for policies and we you agree with it or not the doing it for power why are they given secure to what mean by that why why what is is a their intentionally intentionally doing what where is your evidence of this where's your proof of this just hows your tholowings a ne iris around there were no basis in fact a a you can have you been on the bore of course i have and you seen what's going on the rite the ya is i someone mad nobody can can deny that borders and a they got at this surprises where it'll ask the question sir and the wearer is not open that is that is some that that is a peddle as a talking point is not true the their offends their walls a a there are border potto aliens o an we o an border o can meanwhile we are having tens of thousands of encounters pretty much every week and when he says the work not open he does not mean there is no one actin paroling the borer the means it that even people at ports of entry are being given numbers and then release ins the interior of the united states as fast as humanly possible why will not wen rape normal says its for power that is kind of true is also becomes again the economic policies of the democratic party require cheap labor that cheap labor has to come from somewhere because it is not in to come from america labor because they keep driving up the inflation that keep driving up the wage price and then they fill in the galop intros the labor shortage with wait for it leg littlegrans ballet is the haw the entire state of californium runs if you ever spent anytime in californium what is that it is very rich people hiring i legal emigrants to raise the children and that that is half the lost hanshclus to their cleaning that tat that literally is what is happening we are one the few people hear allay who insisted on actually hiring people who have legal status in the united states but hollywood is entirely it is entirely peopled by extraordinarily wealthy people who hire i legal emigrant panties to watch their kids because that is the model society that the left is seeing to great shout redistribution's in the lightest in the end what t actually is is finding in new labor was to support their way of life to support the declining population of the united states the idea is the bring in cheap labor and that is the deal leave the boar open the for open and that that is how you support your policies sos on that to bringing all these people because they want them to vote eventually they hope for the old hope that eve et nope an amnesty get ends that in order to support their crap economic policies they have to have a cheap labor basher in the united states the easiest way to do that is to import cheap labor that is and people most which is why presumably jobiden's economic policies andismogration policies are wildly unpopular and just the second here get to the question of if if jobidon an on popular we is not dona trump beating him in all the poles an ma one this one out liver pole that chose trump up ten he really should be beating him by a lot in all the poles a bite his super popular

while my wife loves the tomb john product it is really really excellent stuff a graces this magnificent took us right this moment hat on over to mommy john dot tom at glassman get twenty per cents off everything for a limited amount of time o get meanwhile the question for tonal trump is going to be how you keep the focus union a that that really should e the question this what i ben asking for a while the two big questions for trump are you say the last lection stolen what exact measures are you going to take to prevent that from happening again that is question number one and yelling on truth soshlinkinto do it and question number too is how do you kep the foison bison because dona trump likes the focus to be undone trump bison likes the focus to be undone trump right now all the focus is on biding because frankly seen a few weeks since an investment can down for trump lust be real about this every time trump is in the news and the indictment is in the news he tends to drop in the poles and then every time en siren is not in the news people focus in on jobidon in an election cycle in which he is going to be in sort no less than four times on criminal charges how does he keep the focus on bison this is the big doubt for trump going for because again he does not have a strong pony is an incredibly weak of potent in join well the the answer to that question is going to be that he is gin to have to get off truth social i mean that that is one of the answers i remember i visited the white house some time in i thin is early twenty eighteen and a i was being shown around the white house by top official there and the top official call me in to his office hes and he you think we are doing and i said here is by o nest answer i think that on executive policy has get to minus on legislate politics you ain't passed very much stuff than we have pass a big budget ticket at items see plus and on generic a and he said what out i do as he should go ins the president's office right now he should ran himself when his smash with a leaping hammer that is w we should actualyet any left as everybody knows this is true donate trump policy with out the crazy it is still president of the united states and donate trump policy without the crazy could be president of the united states again because if you just look at how the country was running when donate trump was president for is how it is now running or not running under tobidon at as a pretty clear and convincing case for reelecting dona trump again donate trumps best election play is look at how things were twenty seventeen to twenty nineteen then we got hit with with pandemic but even wit the pandemic the economy was already say rocking out o the pandemic by the him i left office a that is his best case is best cases things ran grate until he got hit by an extraneous event an that and and jobidon has not had any of those you ben is had the benefit of basically local piece except for you cranewich we auto in a second her he is had the benefit of of a valine plan and roll out that i created he had the benefit of our recovering economy and he benefit of all these things and somehow he is run the economy directly into the ground and mans less safe locally vote for twenty seventeen to twenty nineteen right that tdatwoud be dona trumps case hat's pretty god case that the problem for trump a gain is going to be himself the only person who can rely if he trump his trump not bison it was trowing twenty twenty it is true and twenty twenty four as well the left is going to trot try to find reasons to folk centrum now i will say that there is one other benefit to for that trump has here and it is the same benefit he is hedonics twenty sixteen i said that in twenty sixteen there is no way for killer clinic to sully dona trumps skirt because he was made of mud one of the things about politics is the hat you try to do as you try to make your opponent look worse what the problem is that how that works if you are heller clintonia your trying to portray yourself as clean as the driven snow and donate trumps throng muddy you it is all on mistake an its can a show up really really strongly against the all white background the have painted for yourself but donate trump never had and all wite background dona trumps a mud monster he is made of mud and hen you hid him with mud is his more mud on the mud monster an he just thicker he is more mud and it is possible that all the stuff is baked into the cake it is also possible that it is not and that as much as re publicans ire not bothered by donate trumps outsides metric than moderate and penenvoters they may well be its over the we get donate trump went on true social and he posted this quote they are almost all disoniston corrupt but come cast with it is one sided and vicious coverage by en by we news and in particular mas envy s often and correctly referred to his eyes at in s should be investigated for it is country threatening treason they are enlist coverage of the now fully among scammed on his russia russia russia and much else is one big sampan contribution to the radical left democraparty i say upfront openly and proudly the when i win the presidency of the united states they and others of the lamest media will be thoroughly scrutinized for their knowing why disoniston corrupt coverage to people things in events why should an be see or any of the other corrupt and dishonest media companies be anti told to use the very valuable airwaves of the essay free there a truth retort democracy and are in fact the enemy of the people the fate mews media should pay a big price for what they have done for once great country now this is one of those aspect or i think this baked in to the cake i do not think that this sort of metric changes things for trump at all there certain things he can say that i think make it worse frommouting this is one of them i think that everybody understands courts in the united states are not going to allow dona trump to put come cast out of business or anything remotely that i also think the vast majority america do not trust the called legacy media further them they can throw them thereon trust them at all son the white house tries to is sort of school warm trump on this it does not work over the week en the white house put out a statement suggesting that the dona trump was threatening democracy n quote on the record from me president biting sworn oaths to ut pull their constitution protect america democracy freedom of the press a fundamental constitutional right abuse presidential power and violate the constitutional rights of reporters would be n outrageous o tacker democracy in the rule of law presents must always to fin america freedoms never trample on them for selfish small and dangerous political purposes now again this school warming a preach true anon a work this is not going to work the reason is not going to work is because there has ben no president of my lifetime who is ben less friendly to the press then jobidon you it knows hi that members the press do does not to press conferences vestal answer questions creenshon pier lives routinely then the notion that dona trump is somehow less friendly tho the press than gobies just not true he say the sentient the people stuff over and over and overwhelm is presided and then you tret press in terms of comment and and content much better than jobidon evert to that that is simply not going to work itself an not going to work this particular attack on trump because again when you look at how america feel about the first amendment the reality is that democrats heavy vain major problem with free speech if you are talking bout freed o the press an are speech its democrats who ark consistently attempting censorship it is democrats r are trying to get shows this one shut down it is people can fight for who again was and bomb staffer going on eyes and be s suggesting that shows this one should not get any listenership they are the ones who do that sort of stuff the people are truly threatening the press really art on the right than on the left if you look at this pull from real crepolitics brannuwpole it shows that nearly one third of democratic voters thirty four per cent more than one third see america have quote too much freedom compared only fifteen per cent of republicans meanwhile when read the statement i disapprove of what you say but i will defends of death to rights to say it only thirty one percents of democratic voters strongly agreed compare to fifty one per cent of republicans fully three quarters of democrats believe government has responsibility to women hate foolsocial media posts only fifty per cent of republicans feel the same democrats are significantly more likely than republicans to state it to favor stifling free speech rights of political extremists now this is this is not a shock again when when they try to schoolmarm trump on o my goodies a threats of the press and democracy and free speech in all this the truth is that it is it is the left that is constantly a threat to the sort of stuffs that that dog just ankle hunt will get to more on this in just second first are you a few years or decades out of school and wondering what the heat i even learn what was the point of all that school you might think yourself and of time to learn something well if that is you they are not alone it is not too late and a not even true since eighteen forty four thillsdale college has ben providing education in faith freedom an character they taken some of the sort class es they teach on campus and made them available on line for anyone wants to learn for free that is right for free there thirty nine free courses to choose from ranging from those constitution and the book of genesis to free market economics there easy to follow there self paste you can start when every want in fact in start right now it is everything you need a in one place no long try commandment let hillsdale college your guide learn when and where you wan but a hillsdale dot et you slashed to en roll there is no cost it is easy to get started again that is hillsdale dot et you slash men two in roll hillsdale dot et you slashed hilsdell college has long been one of us colleges in america they should teach you things that are worth knowing they have not fallen into the woke trap that virtually all other universities have fallen into there still teaching classics there still teaching real traditional knowledge wisdom values but a hillsdale dot et u slashed to enroll to day no cost easy o get started go check him out right now case an i do not thing to dustup maybe the strength of tonal trump an all of this is that it is not really possible in the end to to sully him more than he has sullied himselfigh again is is why only the criminal dightments i think can may be nock him down in general what palling day of thirteen in eternal poles have shown is that independent stare to swivel a wave from trust trump get to actually con evicted of fighting independentring n a swivel away from hi unmask that is the big danger for trump now as far as sort of no other attacks on trump on think thegn a work inside the republican party either for example i think the trumps language with regard to harder pills lately has just been awful he he went on national the the and he suggested that rondsance did something terrible horrible by finding a heart bill and floor to protect the lives of the unborn now that is ridiculous on the state level signing a hart be bill if you if you can do it and you can protect the unborn you do it hell what trump could have said is that on a federal level we do not have the necessary consensus to actually make that happen and all push for life as much the can that probably ins of the fifteen week mark on the federal level it we might penis said instead trump because again he will attack for any angle cause he has no for principles he says pro lifeforms had absolutely zero status on the subject of abortion until i came along which i is is not correct fess for fifty two years have on talk but got nothing done i got a done there be no talk of a six week bank or anything else without me rover's way to low the killing of a baby at any time

combatants to hammer a deal willy told tan audience in new york that both parties must recognize victory ay not be achievable through military means in compare t to world wore one the declaration was classic silly according to college an observers we have worked with him the general immersion military history alarm by the potential of escalation with russia the largest nuclear power in the world was publicly advocating a position the bide administration had issued as the president and other top advisers brought to project unqualified report few cranes of defense silly whose furor tender s chairman of the growing thieves ends with his retirement this month while extensor stage is on of most consequential an polarizing military chiefs in recent memory notherngn to pretend the ilititgratjrob millage onto great job he presided over a disastrous withdraw from afghanistan he openly suggested that after canary six shul called the chines two inform them that we were not going to fire newcleator weapons to them or some such nonsense he suggested that we are in the midst of a famous take over on junior six with which horses incredibly silly he he waited over and over into sort of hot button issues you will remember that done that silly is the guy who that to how we needed to look into white rage in the military good ridden to bad rubbish in terms of general mark billy's tenure at the at pentagon dona true pet out o statementing mark silly who led perhaps most embarrassing moments in america history with his glugrossly in compitan implementation of the withdraw from afghanistan costing many lives leaving behind hundreds of america citizens handing over billions of dollars of the finest military equipment ever made will be leaving the military next week here we had time for all citizens of the us at celebrate this guide turned out to be a woke train rack who if the fate news reporting his correct was actually dealing with china to give them a heads up on the thinking of the resident of the united states this an act told greeters that in times gone by the punishment would have been death a for betide china in the united states could a ben the result of this treason's act to be continued everybody of course went totally not on dona trump suggested how dare he suggested death pellet donaltrump was a lot of stuff as have been saying for literally almost to decade t this point donaltrumps a man who says a lot o leap and that is a lotostoff that that did he says and done and disinuin take seriously his that to put silly up on charges of treason no he literally gave him a presidential medal right before he left office he gave it along with anchovy touchy garlic same day canary nineteen twenty twenty one you will recall i with that sat is i good that silly is out absolutely and he was constantly straying into into political territory silly is an excellent example have something allowed my soldier friends talk about which i at the top levels of t pension brass or political actors now the america public seems them as predominantly soldiers cutest not true you become a political general very often by being a good politician that is how you rise through the ranks and pretty much any army because again any bureaucracy in sense bi particular behavior to get to the top of the bureaucracy and that is particularly true with regard to silly who very often did shift with which whatever way the winds were blowing and meanwhile the united takes sent just continues to be most wisely i i said before the initiations is mosizeley but apparently u an u senate also is mosisley man we really have just a stellar group of people over in the senate we have john fedtderman who is not functional we have don finstein who is dead at this point we have bobanende who apparently was taking bribery in the form of gold bars unit the is actually beyond parody at this point according to the associate press bobanendas of new jury was charged on fridge with secretly aiding the authoritarian government of egypt and trying to thwart the criminal prosecution of a friend and exchange for gold bars and cash under a an a corruption indictment the accuses him of using his foreign affairs influence for personal gain agendas was forced to relinquish his chairmanship of the sent form relations committee he said he is not going to resign from congress the indictment is the second in eight years against the sixty mineral enter and on alleges in legal commingling of agendas his obligations to savants priorities and his private interests and cultivating relationships with wealthy business men it also include us charges against his wife and three augers business men while authorities say showered the couple with money gold an luxury can exchanged for official favors well mean li imagine if the president of the united states had a son who is trafficking with u can china romania and other countries ping up acts of cash and his father was bice president of the united states presiding for policy in many of these matt would be truly bad am glatistus to senior a previous indictment of agendas sending from different allegations ended in twenty seventeen with the deadlock jury now gan this is the second attempt to to get bobanendas on similar charges according to this indictment from at least twenty eighteen to about twenty twenty two agendas an his wife acceptant hundreds of thousand of dollars and bribes ranging from dollars for decade's bens from three business men to protection in rich then and benefit the government of egypt the last time agendas was indenting twenty fifteen who as charged with receiving gifts and six hundred sixty thousand dollars in campaign contributions from author to doctor salmon mean at helped him get reelected to the senate in twenty twelve pandas was accused of using his office to promote mulligans business and personal intrusts with officials of president barocabom is administration agendas said that the money and the gifts luxury travel stem from their friendship rather tan criminal relationship that ended in a mistrial cures are in to have to decide whether agendas according you essay to day can separate the gifts and payment from any actions he took according to legal experts the the argument is con o be that he was just taking gifts from friends and had nothing to do with his actual policy however the timing of the gifts are pretty conspicuous in this case apparently they are going to have to there can have to prove that all these payments basically were in return for rings or promises to do things agendas for his part o saying he is not going to in and by the way we would he m what hell wan is the point of him resigning he he say his not users timeout wondering why anyone would think he is going to resign in pastimes in better times america prohibitions would resign when face with scandal that is not how it goes now nobody nobody leads office at this point why should they if you live long enough then everybody does forgets about all this here is manendais claiming the prosecutors get wrong in this is one of those cases the court of public opinion is no substitute for o revered justisystem we cannotset aside the presumption of innocence for political expediency when the harm is irrevocable to those who have rush to judgment you have done based on a limited set of facts framed by the prosecution to be a salacious as possible remember prosecutors get it wrong sometimes sadly i know that and i mean is not clear o the actually got wrong in twenty seventeen i will point out that in twenty seventeen the prosecution t at came down o agendas it started in twenty fifteen that was largely because a pressor brought by the woman administration against agendas to try to get him to sin not the rondo there was obvious political maneuvering with regard to manned as in twenty fifteen hanging that threat over his head in upcoming on the rondo by the way now many democratic sentry are calling for him to set down that includes betterment include senators shared brown of ohiosand or peter welch sermon the nobody's ever heard of nancy blows the actually said that she thought that agendas would should probably step aside at this point manendasis excused by the way for having golbarslik smash under is met is pretty amazing i will admit that this is this in hilariously out for thirty years i have withdrawn thousands of dollars in cash from my personal savings account which i have kept for emergencies and because of the history of my family facing confiscation and cuba now this may seem of faction but these were moneys drawing from my personal savings account base on the income that i have lawfully deride over those thirty years oh i by the way that does not speak as widely governments to new bursas ho would think it it would he is literally saying that he hid bars of gold in his house because he was afraid that the author ears ben combusting into his room in themiddle of the night to take away his money the would in cuba i ye sound honestly a lot cuba republicans actually at this point that that is why you would vote for a smaller unless in abusive government is not why you would be a new jersey democrat who allegedly took bribes this sort not by thewy has presignifigant ramifications for twenty twenty four because i remember two thousand sex and remember there is a a re republican a mark fly and mark fly was messing around with some the mail pages and an end up having significant ramifications for democrats electoral victory in the two thousand six congressional sections a generalized perception of corruption inside the democratic party ranging from the hunter began scandal too bomanendas he is can have severe ramification ans for democrats a cross the scale which is probably why democrats are tarting to say themanen as has to go also its to safe it is a safe place this murphy is the governor of new jersey he is a democrat if that a republican governor which almost was i assume many few er of them would be calling for him to go meanwhile a humiliating visit to canada by president vlodamer i kolinsky of u crane zolenski has been stepping on a lotion and because he thinks that he has the moral highground with regard to russia and i think that he does but because of that he thinks he apparently has unlimited ability to say pretty much to anything bout anybody remember a year ago hots ripping on the alkalies and suggesting their not doing their moral duty by not shipping iron dome to u crane as though it was israel duty to defend u crane and who is ripping on america for not providing enough support in the republican party because obviously it is america duty to defend u crane but here is the deal i agree that the world should mobilize on behalf of u crane in the initial term in order to protect the territory that they are t he had i do not understand why it is the duty of the world to continue to fund a world ward on stale mate that does not seem to have any solution and then to basically suggest that kolinsky can negotiate is on ticket here i do not understand that logic at all i been same the same thing for a year on this war ha thing thatiave been saying for well over yarns were like year and a half at this point on this war is that there is no reason why exactly zolenski should be the one making the negotiation here were the one signing the check there should be a back channel that is happening between the united states and russia and basically what it should be saying is you got get part the nonbasic gets keep crime the the eukranians are nocking t enternato but they are going to have security guarani's from the westing case of a future invasion and that is the deal and then kramadown onsolensky tells e lens the that is the deal and then he go back to is own people and he can say what he has to say which is i did not want that deal they made me take that deal it was not my responsibility i wanted to go all the way they would not let me go all the way he gets to retain his popularity wit his own people the war ends and everybody goes home i that that that is the only way this on o end anyway and yet zolenski is you know again i it my sympathy for zolenski on a personal level is starting to wane as he becomes more and more brazen about his willingness to simply manually call out countries as though they owe him something he got himself in all sort to hot water in poland recently kolinsky had offered a failed criticism of poland at the men general assembly saying that dispute with political theater between poland and e crane and some our friends in rope have are a thriller from the grand well why was this apparently it is because there is a band on eukranian crane those put in place by several nations to protect the livelihood of local farmers the r word about being under caught on the economy by the low price of u cranial grand the you announce plans to suspend the ban last wet the poland alongside hungry and slovakia that would stick wit the ban sparking protest from crane they file lawsuits against the three countries and then kolinsky spoke about it at do men poland immediately condemnsolenski's comments if men and it is form ministry summon the ukraine ambassador t convey it strong protest hours later the pops pry minister see n o been social media statement the country quote would no longer trains for weapons you crane because we are now arming poland then he for have walked that back hes ta we just mean when i con to give the brand new weapons you can will till give them our old weapons meanwhile hungary is warning that new sanctions against russia not needed he saying were causing more harm to rope then russia at this points there bunch of eastern european countries what deeply worried about the continuation of this war this been pride disastrous trip honestly west for hammer island he went to adwaonterio and during a speech at the house of commons in canada apparently the speaker of the house of commons i stood up and was reckon he stood up his name is the anchovy rota and he introduced i personated yaroslav hunk he is from the public gallery he introduced him as a canada new cranial war hero from his political district he said what we have here in the chamber today you cranial canada veteran from the second world for who fought for eucranian independence against the ruins and continues to support the troops today even at his age of at ninety eight his eucranian hero a canada here we thank him for his service thank you here is som video of that happening we hear here in the chamber to day you cranial canadians you cranial canada world veteran from the second world war who fought you cranial in dependence against the ruffians and continues to support the trips to day even at his i ninety eight u cranial hero a canada hero and we thank i for alias this thank you am a there is only one problem this guy was a member of the waffle access your history you now the people where fighting against the soviet invasion of a e crane in color to those we a been the jazz's is he not he is it occupied you crane that is awkward again apparently he was served in the fourteenth coffin grinds ere division which served under the command of the jazz's hoops oops that is that is not that is not ideals that is an embarrassing gas at the very very least here and of course ties in to allot of the russia talk about how the eucranians are dominated by names that of course ties in to a lot of assign propaganda about as the ruffians who are responsible for the end of world for too because they are ones who truly defeated hitter ignoring the fact that was the ruffians who tally allowed hitter to begin his invasion of poland in the first place bi essentially guaranteeing his eastern flank in any case the the support for the warning cranes fading and that is not a shack again ism in sang for long time the war in crane you wont into keep up the level interest or this level of funding indefinitely it was not going to happen because people get tired of it that can be exasterba by new report from sixty minutes showing that is not just military sparkling e crane we are funding petty much everything else as well america tape is a financing more than just weapons we discoid did you cavemen fine finds and fertilize a for you cranial famine and covering the faeries f you cranes fir responded old fifty seven thousand of them that includes the take the trained this rescue dog named joy to come through the wrecked torrussian strikes looking fishwives you do and the you sol sons the dives who we'll clearing on exploded ammunition from the country's rives to make them safe again to swimming and fishing russia invasion drank cranes the economy by about a third we were surprise to find the to keep it a lot the you es government is subsidizing small businesses gat again there is case be made that the middle of invasion you have to keep the economy running to want to go completely to fun i get all o that but the america publish we be made aware of that sort of sun baton politicians if the case for you gran is been to kep this war going in definitely even though we have no prospect of actual long term battlefield victory in don basso uremia then you have to wonder wirupanglo their bills it is one thing to say we have to pay for the re construction because wont to help prop them of against further mission invasion or or all the rest but in the absence of an en game here what exactly is the end game told is never spelled out the engage in fact his studiously avoided spelling out the en game he never talks about the end game and said he says went do it as long as it takes with as much as it takes that is not the sun end game what exactly is your goal is your is your goal to actually push russia out of crime and donnas of then say that that you are go and then provide the level support necessary do that including dessiatines but that is not your goal there got presulagus dragged this thing out no wonder even in dependence are turning against the america running because when you do not have an and goal america get real tired of it real fast alright time for some things i and then some things that i hate things that i to day i told little about you kept you keeper i moment for jewishbrac yon kip war is the holiest day of the year in nudism we celebrated on money ism over here in israel as you conceive from my backdrop for the high holidays and it is amazing here i will say that there is something to the idea of a religious backdrop to any country that i think is good this live suggested for a long time that everybody in america should go back to church cinegogmas li america ought to re re root itself in judo christian valleys particular christian valleys in america because there can be no country without a social fabric and the social fabric in israel and you kept is obvious the synagog that i went to actually the president of the country is a curing was that that particular synagog sher wits his security and then he stay literally all day plane an not colic a gripping grin these normally see by politicians in the united states were thechurk to church like seven minutes and then they say a couple person they leave he was there literally from eight thirty in the morning until twelve thirty n the afternoon and then he came back for mean elamariv which is the late afternoon services evening service he was there from four thirsting the afternoon till seven and the entire country basically shuts down including many of the secular areas in israel f your tell of you which i t very secular area israel everybody is still writing bicycles social fabric is really really important that is one thing to know thing numbered and in something we ought rebuild in the united state thing number to is that long minor is a reminder that repentance is a corps value yongkipor is the ay at which you repent of your sins before god god knows the innocent again but you rededicate yourself to him and his values and the idea is that you are saying to god that you are not going to do this thing any more left wing theology relies on the idea that you are not wrong god is wrong that you will not only sin god will forgive you your sins even if you have no intent of stopping the sin and not not only that if you ever repent of your sin and move away from your son this makes you a hypocrite because we can always sit something you did ten years ago is you suggest that you held something different ten years ago hypocrisy is the worst argument in politics perhaps you have just repented repentance is a good thing it is a valuable thing it is as necessary thing in fact repentance has the words suggests even in english repent it you are going back to a thing repeat in here it is tisshueva which means to return what a you returning to your returning to virtue the natural inclination of man is bad but man also has good aspects to him and the thing that man is seeking is what the state should be with regard to god which is allegiance to goddess when you return to that it is not that your embracing something fully new it that your embracing something fully old and when you make that repentance then you merit life that that is essential the argument of long minor it is it is quite a beautiful day it is hard a minutes it is it is a castrate in nudism the way we father's a twenty five hour fast and fasting in duties is no food no water it can get you relatively difficult in terms of yo sort of what for poetical older people in and very very young people yours if your buyers pes start fasten when our thirteen for girl as wealth and i can be pretty hard on people but it is in amazing experience and reminder that it is never too late to to do repentance of a time for a quick thing i hate now speaking of a a culture that is completely unrepentant of its sin good news ago via man now called man has a full frontal new dating show is going to be a thing now coring the hollowed reporter it is being on tinder but much horse one of the you case most infamous dating shows was quietly added to the man streaming service last week it is already causing quite a star the streamer has imported six seasons of naked attraction a game show that promises you start were a good date often ends naked in each episode a single choose or cretin an eliminates six potential dates standing on stage by scrutinizing the fully new bodies which are gradually revealed one part at a time faces reveal last when only to potential dates remain the shut r strips out of their own close too giving the remaining to contesting the opportunity critique them the final couple than god on a date wit their close on it includes full front nudity it can come across as draw droopingly brutal in the contestants graphic and alibis i do not her feet his member is too small at t he same time you hipster contains intersicials of informative sex education the show clearly tries to promote body confidence and positivity the the all the hot or not judgments the show also includes contestants a diverse sexual orientations how how delightful how delightful we are now supposed to you judge people not as fully fledged human beings we are not supposed to judge each other anis is the natural outcome of a hedonistic society in which the only thing the matters is is sex the sex instinct is the only thing the matters it turns out that the way we used to date it honestly amazement the way that we used to date is that you did not take your close off until you are married that is way we used to date in society some of to still date that way when that was the case you had to fully appreciate the persons sitting across the table from you as a fully fledged human beings with thoughts and values and ideas and then later you got to the sex now get to the sex first and everything else is minded by the wayside there beans big argument going on on lone is really heard argument that been going on including some sort of antipheminus on on the right suggesting marriage is bad because no fault divorce is led to most divorces being initiated by women which means s risky for men to get into a marriage my answer to that is not if you marry the right woman and the way that that you are marrying the right woman or least have prebook security is if you date in the right way not all marriages are created equal in terms of their quality and not all partners are created equal in terms their quality this is why is very important when you are dating do not do the naked attraction version the first date get in t sack see how it goes from that that is not howdating should go it should be precisely as it was in terms of actually appreciating the other human being as a potential life partner be cause guess what everything gin a drop and bag as you get older anyway s you may as well marry somebody who shares your values adonizes the rest of the chows continuing my now your

democrat's turned to the race card to distract from jobidon's looming corruption problems the view gets very upset of me for not licking baby and bronze names suffers a cardiac arrest i venture of the sis the vent ferry so to dashosponterback spree piansyou let our web history being seen and sold to advertisers now me neither at expressly plan right nowt expressly plans come flashes today hunter bison is expected to plead guilty to a couple of miss demeanor accounts of failing to pay his taxis at a federal court house in delftware that is according to end c news is the first time that the justice to parted has brought charges against the child of setting press i but of course the charges have been knocked way way way down he's wording to iris whistleblowers this do to hunter bison took in literally seventeen pointers million dollars on be half of the family over the course of two thousand fourteen two thousand nineteen and then the i arrest and the d o ja and the a be i all waited until a bunch of the tax evasion charges had basically fallen off the rat are they went beyond the statute of limitations and then of course they apparently according tote iris whistle lowers denied avid waste to was attorney in this case the ability to pursue the case as a special council which wave allowed him to do interviews in certain ways in charge in certain districts they did not pursue any lines inquiry about howexactly the money passed to hunter and then whether that money passed from hunter to the big guy jobidon the megaron a play this up as though d o jay and the be i really did their job hare but this is a sweetheart plea arrangement in everybody knows it according an by sinews bisons expected to follow the terms the pleaagreemen he reached last month with usattorny avid wise outlining the charge is wife's off hi see in a statement hunter bide receive taxable in come access of one point five million dollars the annually in two thousand seventeen to thousand eighteen despite owing access of a hundred thousand dollars in federal in come taxes every year he did not pay any in come tax do for either year layman put aside the irony or the fact that jobidon is constantly talking anyhow the rich are escaping their taxes now the rich do not pay the tersharan o go do and how mission is the rich or did not pay his fair share i promise you i paid a loft of phoney in taxes last pad anymore and my fair share this dud paid pretty much nothing twenty seven twenty eighteen the fact is that hunter bid is being let off to hook and because his father is the present ask for our usual arrangement bison was facing a separate gun charge for legally owning a colt cobra thirty eight special hand gun but the d o ja said h he reached a pretrial agreement tat allowed him to a mentally got drug re had instead of being charge before lying on federal forms again put aside the irony f the fact that cordon his basically said that youth awaiting gun burner should not have a gun and that hunter bison gets to go drug re had after apparently lying on federal forms upping an drug attics in order to obtain a gun which then ended up dumped in a dumpster near a high school put aside all of that the fact is that this is not once again a sweetheart plea arrangement now there is a for of let bricking story with regard to the sweetheart plea arrangement the your post reporting it yesterday first son hunter bison's legality a peers to pull a dirty trick on tuesday to block the release of damming evidence i had of his expected guilty pleat to federal charges of tax ovation and weapons crimes the from began in the morning when the house basin means come files an alibis brief to delftware yours district judge many elfin n aka arguing the fifty three yearly had benefited from quote political interference which calls into question the propriety of the investigation into his pledged crimes the falling included the testimony from the two press whistle blowers what happened next was outlined in a letter sent to the job on tuesday afternoon by the committees top lawyer theodor vanilla quote at approximately one thirty am we received word that our filing was being removed from the docket the house wagon means committee filed and abacas brief asking for the plea bargain to basically be thrown out for corruption and weirdly handoff they got a notice at one thirty yesterday that theufiling was removed from the docket we promptly contact of the clerks office as the lawyer and we are advise that some one contact of the court representing they work from my office and that they were asking the sort remove this from the docket we immediately advise this was inaccurate the clerk's office responded that weoudneed to refile we have done now manila included meal exchange s with quart officials and hunter biotin's attorneys in the fresh filing hide following up on our recent telephone conversation the woman who called that a just cup bangles can from quart official man the grimes she said she works with theodoro vanilla bandit was i portent the document was removed immediately or they could filemotion seal i do deeply apologies for the confusion on our part bangles is the director of litigation service is at laththem an waking a massive work baselawferm and of a hunter bid t turning cries clerk was t formerly a partner over there when cattily con fronted the first son's legal team huntersern hunters attorney tried to claim the filing contain confidential and identifying information even tough the whistle or testimony's been public from more than a most theme stamps from the meals indicated the re quest to take the document down was made aftericatila refused to request to file the testimony undersea this is what hunter bidet's torn rote quote as far as ism aware the managing a torn from lather an wakens called the clerk's office to note that personal tax in formation of the defended had been filed in a non redacted manner and to inquire regarding having the information seal as we told we would not as you said you understood as far as ism were the cork took the filing down on their own accord kcattilla then wore n e she politic a step back from your statements the clerk's office advised that i was representing our the re quest was being made by my firm we will been vising judge anorak of this and proper contacts lay them an waking saying nonego we just asked that it be taken downtick did not it contained identifying information but the housewares and means committee is saying no you called them up and you said that you were of and the you are requesting as at of that we should take down the filing pretty amazing we will see how this shakes out of course but one thing is perfectly clear if be person whose name were on the charges were anybody but hunter widen that is you we going to jail as the pastry journal editorial board points out i lean jam center waiting you would go to prison for what hunter bison did prison for tax crimes is real in the nineteen nineties your collie we on a helmsmen served at nearly two years in prison for de trading the government by having her business pay he personal expenses o claim taxoductions for them what is been call hunter began set her plea deal was not the subject of the use overbite committed join ineteentheering where the two tires whistleblowers testified instead wall makers intended to explore ways in which cessations said the justice apartment ad the ward air proven again ye thwarting of the probe is really the big issue here becausetheire way deeper questions to ask than hunter bdanstax crimes where did the money go who was the big guy why are their text on hunter bison's computer talking about how he paid his daddy's bills we are their text on hunter bison's computer what is as two foreign agent saying my daddy is sitting right here why is it that all of this was shut down now the hunter baton prosecutors avid wises he is the attorney for the district of delftware apparently he will be allowed to testify before the housed judiciary committee that apartment of justice sent a letter to the judiciary committee according to the daily wire white's testimony would come after the announcement of a plead deal where hunter would plead guilty the do ja appreciates the committee on the judiciaries acceptance of our offer four deices to testify at a public haring before thecommittee that apartment is ready to offer wises to testified shortly after congress returns from the august district o work period as described more fully below the potential dates for the testimony september twenty seventh or twenty eighth an october eighteenth or nineteen that is a long time in the future you may notice that the date tho date is jury twenty six s their time lot september october for wise to testify because he is apparently darn busy the dona added in his letter that there were misunderstandings about what exactly it is work was and why weirs was denied special council status or if he was according to letter quote were deeply concerned by any misrepresentations about our work whether deliberate or arising for is understandings that could unduly harm public confidence and the even handed administration of justice which we are dedicated well i mean ism concerned about the even handed administration of justice given the fact that apparently according to the iris whistle blowers avid weirs was barred from asking serious questions for the press agents about how money was flowing which is the exact topic of this investigation again one iris whistle lore josh bigger he is the gay democrat who pointed that out during his testimony to say miss at our and have logan is fight he is disputed several statements made wises saying that hunter should face more serious criminal charges now avid weirs has been very squirrel about what exactly he asked for him what exactly he received from the do jay apparently there is an open meeting where he told the tires whistleblowers that he had asked for special council staduson was denied then merit plan was well he never asked for it which ten oft e lives the question is to why you did not give it to him in the first place which is exactly at merit plan did do with regard to for example the special council going aftordonal trump there merit plans hands off you get special council status when came to hunter bison it was wall unless he asks for it than i suppose i will not give it to him and then we but have an argument over who asked for what wen when all of this is going to blabbing public new because the fact is that we now have too many pieces of in formations suggesting corruption involving jo we do beyond all the text from hunter again tithe most damming text remains the two thousand nineteen text from hunter bison to his daughter at which he says he pays dads bills that is a wildly damning text but now we have information that been put forward by no less than to of hunter bi is business finder's talking about job's invalvman inn the business at least to the except that job's being used as sort of the devoted mascara tat when something was happening and they needed to call job to demonstrate that they actually had some pull thy w call him on the phone divan archer who is john carry's son in law and and somebody who is busily partners with hunter bison he is supposed to last to my behind close doors this week about all of that and course we n tons twenty bobolink who is largely ignorant twenty twenty said exactly the same thing he said that hunter bison would call jobitin up on the phone he'd bring jobidin to meetings all the rest of this sort of stuff o coven my earthy for his part same than i preachment inquiry well probably get under way some time in the near future it is very doubtful that impeachment inquiry does not lead to impeachment have get to see in impeachment inquiry that does not lead to impeachment an again it is e i i find it incredibly difficult to believe i laid out the entire time line yesterday on the show that jobidon is pure is the driven snow knew nothing about hunter picking up bags of foreign cash all over the world using his name was on the phone with hunter and the form business partners was squiring hunter on air force to to places china and was passing policy in the countries where hunters picking up the cash all this is a big coinkininky o speaker my earthy said yesterday that i preachment inquiry could be something very likely in the ear future now you have the president thing one thing that we proves not true you have got ireswhistle blower thing something when it comes to government treating the biding efferent you have got an informant claiming that the bison family had been by should you ignore that or should investigate that the only way you can investigate that is to an impeachment inquiry the committee would have the power to get all the documents that they would be what i said last in and i continue is that it before when more the continues to unravel it rises to the level of the can inquiry where you would have the congress to have the power to get to all these ans i wen thank the widen family e want to answer these questions as well er bid the documents instead of holding em back what is amazing about this is the democrat's response to all of this because again the evidence is there that there was something tho marry is going on i mean hunter and job a we they are hand in glove for years on and while all this is going around and meanwhile he out people jimmy respond who again was one of the leaders of the impeachment into tonal trump who said that this is second hand years old allegations a what would first can constitute first and delegate amain it is not second hand twining bobolink was business partners with hunter bided taken archer was business punters was business partners with hunter baton hunter bidding extend things about jo that is all first and that is not second hand that is a t very very first and these are people where directly involved in the allegations at issue apparently according to jimmy gaskin the only thing the would count ass a first hand allegation is if jobidon raise his hand and literally said shindig money from y us on hunt or he got a punch bank records just pilled then public view which something he absolutely will never do meanwhile the white house is tweeting out quote their eagerness to go after bison regardless of the truth is seemingly bottomless at a brief in tuesday when hos pray secretary green show pear said we are not got to get in hypotheticals when asked about get the efforts to impeach bison now this was always going to happen of ken because jobidon has been crust for very very long time and en h judges a lot of houses for a guy who is on a hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand a year salary as a enter and yet he had these very very nice houses in delawame another is been talk about jo bison and the delftware credit card companies for a very long time this is not anything new or shocking solving its shocking is the expense which the media will go to not ask serious questions about this meanwhile other democrats of course are completely in interested in this inquiry here's representative madman define she is a democrat from pennsylvania just have no questions about this all my questions have been answer really i loves her o there answered and what questions you asked we are at a time of great contrast a democrats leading investing in america and republicans chaste in conspiracy theories on the subject of what could be a pending in peaches inquiry into into president bind what questions if any do you have about job bisons connection to hunter bisons business dealings i do not have any at this point that certainly there are questions that can be asked and and should be answered if there was any sanction but we do not see any evidence of that once ta when or ta they are making you a whole cloth there making it up everything is made up which is weird because it is not made up and again we let out the entire time line and we have can contembraneos documentation and we have whistleblor allegations and behave confidential human sources who explicitly say that the heads of bregma we are openly claiming to a bribed the hunter and jobidon and all this is worthy of questioning is it not and yet we are just told the hardware it away it is all old allegations who cares better but there there is nothing there is nothing to see here and here is the thing the smoke is going to lead you fire an the smoke is not there for no reason meanwhile and jobidon continues to wander around not knowing where he is yesterday he claim to a cured answer which is out which is interesting i i figure that that is that is breaking big if true there is job bison claiming that he has cured answer you doing at all your we we you do i she cure canto came we can can's none thinks we can that is why we can we made canters re now we ended cancer as we know it i have yell i i would have heard about that if that were if that were true where is dance dale an the fact checkers over its seen end the president claims that he is cure cants are perhaps next you will cured to geisha i i have i have have doubts and quibbles meanwhile in the funny's tat jobidon story of that it is funny because it its she little sad now as a new dog owner lemme tell you how your dog acts is largely reflection hay tranerdog if you're good in training your dog your dog will not by people and yet jobidon has had not one but two dogs wo apparently routinely bite people according to than your times one of preside went bison's dogs has now bitten several see ate service agents and even set one to the hospital pard of a series of at least ten incidents of aggressive behavior according to in eternal meals recently obtain by conservative wathstroll group the correspondence shows commander the nearly two year old german shepherd has struggled to a just ta life at the white house were ye arrived in twenty twenty on and delftware where the bisons own to hours early in nonmember twenty twenty to a facials on the white house medical team chose to send an officer whom commander had bitten own the arm and the my to the hospital just a week later commander bitten agents on the left thigh that same month another agent was left shaken whence felt the ne ta hoist up the chair he was sitting on to uses a shield when commander began barking at him from the top of a white house staircase six of the innocents were bite the result in some form of medical attention this a course is not the only bison dog who is been a bad bad dog in march twenty twenty one the bidintedship two of their other dogs champ and major to delftware for two weeks of training after major had a biting instant withe wite house staff member champ died later that year assassinated by misery canton apparently om yap he is he's a that get great great job jo bin meanwhile on the policy front a federal judge has now tossed jobidans ad ministration asylum rule for migrant according to the washington post a federal judging californium struck down the bide administrations temporary restrictions on migrant seeking asylum ruling the government's plans to reduce illegal crossings on the of medical borer actually violated federal law s they put in place system and imposed penalize penalties on migrant to crosstie border legally trying to funnier to ports of the entry where then they would be let into the country willie jolly and far that is ben the result then a lot fewer lines at the at the boarder there's been a topless chaos on theborder but a lot of those people tormenter the country will knoll a a the bigger problem when it came to i legal migration was never the can vast seines on the boarder the problem was what the problem remains which his people illegally entering the country by claiming asylum when they do not actually have a legal right to asylum but because the process works and is overloaded in this way that you come clemasylum and then we basically give you a belly ticket counter and we say show up in three months for an asylum clan and then toyshop in three months the we give you another tickets and who up for a court at the nervershop again statistically this is what happens people show for the first courtly ben to their syce corban this is why you have levin twelve fourteen million i legal emigrants in the united states will now a judge his argued that jobidon cannot even do that even the illegal emigration policy the jobiton design in order to get people to at least stands in line at the ports of entry now judge is said he cant even do that according to the washington post the judge sided with cavity groups that had argued the biding restrictions violated federal law by endangering migrants fleeing harm and preventing migrant from seeking asylum if they crossed the border illegally which congress never intended even jobidon's a time to regular ride his a bad legal emigration policy are failing on on every front well when democrats are failing when approval ratings are wo when it appears that the president of the united states is on weakened footing well it is i precisely that time that can expect the democrats a probably going to start playing the race card jobidon yesterday honor emptily and his mother with a new national monument which is all that that is fun amatol obviously was let he assassinated for the great crime of apparently having a legally wolf whistled a white lady in the in the are civil rights our a south and his mom made the brave move having an open casket in his funeral and and pointing out that these are the wages of racism and to now the federal government is going to establish the email and mandrill molly national monument which is going to be in a few different places it is not is not just one place the monument honors not only amative but also his mother who became a renowned civil rites advocate according to a white husoficial the new monument will protect place to the tell the story of emitills too short life and racially mode invited murder the unjust a quintal of his murderers in the activism of his mother who courageously brought the world's attention to the brutal injustices and racism of the time catalyzing e civil rites movement and it will include things the robbers temple church of god of in christy in chico that is where tills funeral service was held also the grab landing and mississippi where its believe the tills body was recovered from the talahatchee river that will be the second location in the third location will be at the calahatche county second distrecort house in mississippi where tills killers were acquitted e all of that roll it is worth remembering the evils of america history in order s that we can see how far we have come but that is not the real reason why jobidon is doing this the reason that jobidon is doing this as you conceive from the announcement the real reason that jobidon and comma arris are doing this is that they can pretend that there are bunch of republicans who are just the murderers fvemito that is the way they do this if really is gross again the should be something about which america are fairly united i would hope universally united camera america racism is evil racism is bad the murder of people the base of their skin evil right we holdall be on the same side of that why is it that this administration is now using this announcement of the monument in order to go after on to artists and florid and falsely claim that florid is replete with the same kind of racism it is really grows bind we it off yesterday he is talking about complicity in complicity in racism and as you will see this more morse very very quickly in to an attack on jobidon and comely arras's political opponents less i learn a coming to to i really is a this o i him out a to i who's ki convey to fend i to an is to say has something as good an ma noway he did e is hits an in the runs an give o lit oo in bad people come roar about an as tot all f us to do with that to all us stop a t all as the eosin it is o the try as tiny is not o a con ten is thinks ops a plies her silks is come publicity i all a so i all when we we si o nay again when he says things i guy does not go way it tides under rocs first fault racism in the united states has a b ate beyond any other western country by a slingshot they look the pollen wit the grace for example interracial marriage and went from virtually knowing the united states was in favor of interracial marriage to every one in the united states is fine with interracial marriage by the polling data eh but according t cobia never goes water goes to hides what does he mean by that what dis he met what the implication is the implication is that even though those evil republicans who oppose jobidon will not openly be races quietly there very races come all derris who you know is obviously camping up for the possibility the join just keels over any day because he looks he is going to keel over any day she really just sis the quiet part to loud she just goes right after onto cantos and florid again there is a reason why they are linking these two issues to day there are those in duration would prefer to race or even resist the ugly parts of our pass those who attempt to teach that enslaved people benefited from slaverytthose who insult us in an attempt to glide us who try to divide duration with unnecessary to bates let us not besides into the living that somehow we will be better if we forget ill gate number one no one's forgetting people get taught about meet till in florid schools what she is saying here which is that these are it is unnecessary have dobatestover america history release since you gites to the one to push the sixteen nineteen project you are the ones who suggest that america racial history means that today the only solution is quortinphat racial equity when it comes to government policy i e reverse racism in america government policy this is what they are doing this ate it is supergrass it is really grows honestly find me the america politician of either party today who is ya ism a big ism standing for ementill's murderers who are those people they do not exist what does it matter because commalharris believes and she wants you to believe that really lousy republicans are very much in favor of black people being murder for no reason at all she did this publish who saying all of this during the meet till announcement with is superdisgusting i man really is grows here is jobidon doing the same exact thing e time wen on those who see to ban was very is we are making clear crystal crystal clue is ana miles n con hi with they race nothing e get hi bat they race nothing we cannot just those a long wine no wet or we should i he is yo lofintion know about our bunch we should everything the goa gad the truth were nation there is such alighting liars there's such liars they are liars oo gay all this gets taught in florid schools nothing that ronisantis has passed in the stay of florid singing the nested of florid bars the teaching h m america has three on the contrary it press revs the teaching of america history y preventing the inculcation of lies into the curriculum lies if you are black your inherently victimized in the united states and if you are white you are inherently privileged in the united states of america and that all systems of power in the united states are created for the the solicit promotion of white people that is what critical race theory teachers that is what there attempting to man in the state of florid not teaching about the evils of america history or white to premise what it is a lie they are liars and it is disgusting it truly is gross hes again there is no disagreement in the united states about the evils of america history when it comes to racism and whites yo premise there is no disagreement about that the only disagreement is that you guise all say at the white supremely is still there lurking underneath america surface and that all america see institutions from capitalism to the meritocracy have been infused by that evil racism and thus if you oppose the democratic agent secretly you are a white to premises secret hear in league with email's murderers that is the case their trying to make some them are even more open a we uses very brace actually openly tried to connect rondissantis to the lynching of emitting now the presidents an bounce went the president who is roughanthing ane that table would have been it comes as mere seems this controversial and very polarizing debate in this country over the teaching of black history that move by the lord aboard of education to teach that some flames maybe benefitted from the skills they developed its parking a fire storm but rob in this white house says that monuments this to till well help to teach the complete story of our nations history robot yes he about renaissances and the evils meanwhile weasand to see host andriamatchal another objective journalism she common to quote this is also happening as somstates are being accused of chipping away at the teaching of black history the accurate teaching rondisances has been accused by the washington post editorial board just yesterday o friend to quote whitewash slavery it is it is disgusting it is clearly discussing and then there is the secondary disgusting is grew gotfelld he's on fox new is doing to show and he was talking about all of these false accusations with regard to rondissantis all the lies the coma garrison tor sidebar talking about about how america history will not be taught lack history will not be taughtinflors schools any more which s a lie i is not true it is a lie cay gotfelld was talking about the part of the curriculum that says that some slaves cultivated skills the could use for the personal benefit after slavery which is clearly true and he makes the pretty much unobjectionable points that even in the worst circumstances human beings could possibly be in they cultivate skills because this is how human beings adapt and survive and demonstrates their resiliency even the worst places human beings can be they cultivate skills that they can then use for the personal benefit afterward and he makes the comparison to victor frankly writing mans search for meeting after the holiest the notion that he was able to cultivate certain spiritual levels through suffering in the holiest and and naturally then the left jumps on that it is just it time here here is grew goofed do you think that she red the whole thing and the side to tariapick something i i do think that she red the whole thing and i think that it is ten incradicallan complex pet angel its a hinge ninety we passages you have hound good and and frankly ism just find mentally uncomfortable whin the tangent that black benefited at all from this and i in made ma tanka some one oi to ism not black but ism this what is someone say about the polices for instance that there wore some benefits for yes right while they were hang concentration camps yo learned a strong workafhec right made me yo learn in in a sale that you ever nah man starts for meaning this frank old talks about how you had to survive an a cops again camp by having skills you had to be useful utility you must halite cat to a a talking about meddle scars here o get again what god felts as there is absorb in objectionable as an orthodox true no and thank god my my immediate family our family line was in america since the early twentieth century but the entire extended family was in rope at the time a holicostor we lost a lot of in o distant relations and family relations in rope during the holicosin of course ism deeply in sconsenageros communities o on with everybody knows a police river what he is saying there which is that the durability and the adaptability of human beings the resilient of human beings in terrible circumstances leads them to cultivate skills that are useful to them in the rest of their lives even in the worst circumstances one o the glories of being a human being that is unobjectionable to what is the white house to they medially colmanantisemit and now he even bring it up right justkatarlov brought it up but wait for the wait for the the usual cast of characters to sounds off andrubates as what fox newton allowed to be set on the air yesterday is an obscenity and if any a horrid dangerous extreme lie that insults the memory of million of america to suffer from the mailman cavemen a fox not told another horrid dangerous an extreme lie that insults the memory of the millions people ho suffer from the evils of the holiest there was nothing good about slavery there is nothing god about the holicospels ut no one said there is anything good about slavery of the holiest they said the resilient human beings some times are capable of making the best of there their terrific situations which of course is true that of course is true that is the story of the heroism of the slaves makingthe best of one o the worlds worst situations in human history same thing of polices survivors by trying to trying to survive trying to cultivate is skill set well undergoing the work hours o human being can imagine but of course they've to lie they have to lie first wall i do not want her this wite house talk about antisemitism because this while house is replete with antisemitism this white house is perfectly willing to roast on a spit the state of israel in front of on the perfectly willing to do it an the they are perfectly wiling to bend over backwards for the likes of rhetor to leave an illhan oar is it them talking about antisemitism i ne it is you don't talk about ridiculous gaslihting that would be it anyway that the white house con play the race card because this is what they have to do meanwhile on the right side of the isle it appears that dona trump is cruising toward at the nomination talk more about that in just one second first were say very said statistic merge rates now hidden all time lo n the united states more people than ever believe than a mere certificate is some m weird piece of paper or to now they did patriarchal tradition others of lies them selves in they think they do not need a spots they they think they would rather be a dogma or something well here is the thing men and women are both con minced tray no their better offings single that is a lie it is not true despitewhat the left would have you believe marriage is a profound good professionally personally mentally physically that is just scratching the surface of the benefits of managing to learn all about it in tennis prayer's new episode of prefer you masters program streaming exclusively over a daily wire plus tat prefers used masters program tennis is sharing forty years worth of pardon wisdom exploring all kinds of topics the consequences of secularism whether human nature is basally good the difference is between the left an the right this episode will make couples think differently about marriage if you are single this hepper will absolutely open your eyes to go to daily were plumcot come become a member watch prefer you master's program to day o cam meanwhile the republican side of the isle dona trump continues to lead by leaps and bounds the rest of the republican field in in turns the national pulling one o things that is propping trump of a top the re publican field is the feeling by republicans and pulling get to shows this that he actually is the most bible candidates to go up against jobidon that that is to wat the fistic say this to sic suggest that ronasantus for example old run better then then trump wood against bison in swingstateslike wisconsin arizona gorge a but there is some national pulling that has trump up against join there is a latest messenger harried pole from jury twenty first or twenty fourth and shows trump up four on join there's more in consult pole that shows him within two of jobidon there's a hazard arris pol that chose m up five on jobidon there some plain get ti suggesting that trump is actually outrunning bison at this point and again in the race ford the republican nomination right now the republican nomination race has trump with a thirty four per cent lead on average the latest morning consul poles show him at fifty nine per cent sixteen per cent for to mantis eight per cent for romiswammi six per centropens and meanwhile there is a a hazard harrispole showing him with a forty point lead over on to mantis am on with pole showing him with again a thirty point lead thirty to point lead over on mantis fifty four to twenty two the big story the campaign thus far as that no one seems to have broken loose from the rest of the field frumpish is sticking around fifty per cent and everybody else is engaged in this con of scrum near the bottom now the the expectation early on in the race having for lot people into to me with that rondo antes get a brake loose in this race right now he is in themiddle of a campaign shake up he just had to fire about a third of his staffers you spending too much on staff in to now he is a tempting to recapitulate his campaign i would assume at some point that he is going to get aggressive with the media i though that he's good interview with take taper last week the the issue with the rest of the re publican fields that no one else is going to start jumping out from the rest of that republican field maybe that will happen in the future right now that is not happening to mantis in to have to recapitulating scan have to relaunch his campaign in fairly short order now that has happen before to be fair john macckan was abandon left for dead into thousand eight in mid two thousand seven mid to thousands haven goes semen charting in poles rudiguleon it was leading in all the poles in two thousand and seven it money in twenty twelve was basely the front runner all the way through but the a people job bush were running really well at this point the race in two thousand sixteens but still very early butt things are into have to change rather dramatically there is a reason why the trump campaign is is folksong all is fire on to cantus they the put you a bazar statement yesterday the trump campaign accusing on to mantis of colliding with the biding d o jay which is superweeard on you know what that supposed to mean they they they literally put out a letter s saying the mantis and his establishment handlers have resorted to directly parting the talking points of radical leftists when on to sanctimonious was most recently summon before donors to explain his falling campaign his top lictendints admit to lighting donor money on fire though even more telling a top to mantis sundries are confess their strategy relight on endless political prosecutions of president trump by radical left is prosecutes now their blaming that toe mantis is that somehow in league with the domain this is really week stuff here is the thing is that going to translate to a general election for trump this is the big question people should be asking themselves again i love to see the data supporting the idea that the strongest candidate not that he stronger than by maybe is maybe is not an i have doubts but the the data that he is the strongest candidate against bison is somewhat lacking and that is particularly going t be a problem for him given the fact that again a lot of the people who are around dona trump are now putting trumpet in comfortable position to day in a court filing rudigually on e just admitted that he made false allegations about georgia election workers and no longer confess the outcome of the georgia election nonmember was reguallyon who leading up a lot of the election narrative twenty twenty the dow trump actually one in georgia he was putting significant presshrum people in georgia now he is admitting that he was making stuff up in georgia a is any the of con matter and primary absolutely not is any of that stuff going to matter in terms of a general election a certainly not going o help president trump but right now trump is by farthermost oracle candidate in the field he is proved that he has the support of about forty five to fifty percent of the re publican base and unless some the republican changes there strtegium breaks loose it will be trump for the nomination that is at least how to pears right now now r publicans our facing some pretty up hill battles in the twenty twenty four situation over all according tote walls journal work's highest court is now set to wait in a n new set of congressional maps in the state a ruling analyst say could position democrats to pick up as many as five us house districts in the closely held chamber your republicans on tuesday appealed e most recent ruling in democratic lawsuit that seeks to throw out district lines that were in place for last years sections and help the go peep pick up threats in the empire state democrats said those maps r only mean to be in place for twenty twenty two the york stake court of a peals apparently is likely to rule along those lines and that means that if republican redistricting north caroling and oho happens new york will then re redistrict itself and a presumably had a bunch of houseboats back to democrats sun's can be a closely held house of these battles are going to be on going to country s split very close to fifty fifty on every available line o gan meanwhile the latest an the continuing fall out from not liking baby apparently the suggested endless national story and ism confused as to we except ism not confuse as i mentioned a couple of days gone the shop the reality is that i stepped upon the idle you are not supposed to step upon the idol your not post to mention the baby is a bad move our not post to mention the radical feminist radical feminism is complete failure hat's what to mention any of that because the idolatry of these movies of these cultural totems must be complete and you must be made to bow before them this presumably is why the great intellects over at the view we are a de crying my specific critique of the baby move as always ism perfectly willing to goon of you not only y perfectly willing ism perfectly eager to go on the view it has been several years since have suggested that i come on the view and i yet ism shot have never receives an invite now i know for a fact why that is in ism friendly with making cane who is on the show for years she retinal ask the producers if i could come on the showing they routinely said now i wonder why in any case we will be golfer leading light and i any person who believes that apparently hitter was not erases i in what will be golbrg had some views about panning the work baby move o be arise has no gene tail yea of can has no gan to e cannot be at a doll move and won the cants no it is colorful and it is baby they would have but live through what the dolts have live tho when the sends move that is no how they are looking that the cans o looking that is the baby move you dies i wave you all to tell your colters why you are not take em tom the see to barber ism a taken by an itemizes it wan man who have all they thoughts o macula at li somehow the baby moving can make them kill a emasculated no caring much about it if modestly ta most ta i i anything i cantina i was an y tinting learn you've put tit on ahead anyways they looks he be in the ban you oh i i in in what capacity willy that is that is that is a stranger i look i should be in the barber move because of my stunning trying gosling did looks i wo what we time by her o case just a few comments on this a few comments on this number one the insane gestating by people will be golbrig's amazing they made baby into a cultural moment it is a cultural moment and the move is staked with politics every single review left and right points out the move is sucked wo politics they poise dumb ask game it is a really ridiculous clown knows on clown nosoff game well it is political is important every one should see it has such important things to say bout the state of modern womanhood the we are ye out what it has to say is garbage and stupid and wrong and bad for girls and the the it is just to move about at doll it shut to move about at doll why sussed bout a moving about its all i know why you upset that outside about moving about its all because it is not just to moving about a dog yet idiot's obviously you are really li or som mean that is not a move about e doll only is a move about men and about women and about feminism an about the patriarchy we will telly that great derrick who made the dam thing you in we will tell you that every member of the media every including will be golfer but that this whole rent a well i do not even know why your upset about this hunt then know why you care g first all the movie's bad ism upside i wasted to on two two hours of my life on the move but what really is upsetting is the alighting is the laying you do not get to say look at the superimportant thing and hen i notice i ya i thin it is bad noil it is not even i portent at all why you've noticing it it is irritating kit is that number one number two a less a faragriffin it'll case i know a issue actresses to work in make penis office the first time i visited the white house bliss was in aid to my pence an shows a fan of the she a and o ism only making this personal solicit decided to make this personal let me points out here though we are talking about emasculation and all the rest it is kind of a emasculating moving from mike penis office over to the view were you get to be the designated conservative that all of your friends you are judo friends dump on every single day and were you in points of favor and they pat you on head n give you little school treats if you save the right thing as far as feeling emasculated on a personal level i just that my fourth kidnap i gimmabrag i i i my re productive success has ben assured at the point folks ism notum not particularly concerned about the emasculation charge from a miss of fair a griffin by the way again you guys i notice that you spent a lot of your air time on this a ye obviousness important enough for you to comment on here is the over all say the over ill take again is that for a group of wine moms who a daytime drunk watching the baby move by themselves crying an america former wining about being a woman and then they go on the view another they talk about it and the you mention he movie's back this is idolatry you must never ever ever speak ill of the gredigar wigs of the word you must never speak ill of a movie importance this and if you do then they will pretend that the real story is that why weave a note why it is it is a move about doll by the way america for as barber speech apparently to two days and thereat of fifty takes to film which s incredible course it sucks you's get a points out it is a bad it is a bad take it thirty to fifty takes filling citizen cane here thirty to fifty takes for america for her to gives winy speech apparently great earwig said that when she gave that speech every one on the sit was crying the men the women they were all crying yes only the most self absorb people in the world would cry over a speech as pathetic dull and and honestly shallow is as that particular speech and meanwhile in other news that made a lot o headlines yesterday brave chimes who labor chimes his sawn and is expected to be or was expect to be a first round pick in the envy draft tat somepoint of the very near future apparently suffered a cardiac arrest hes since been released from the ice to you in stable condition according to a statement from the u s gala center yesterday while practicing bran jam suffer a caracaras medical staff was able to treat beanie and take him to the hospital he is now instable condition a longer in the ice to you we ask for respect and privacy for the names family well up the media the there is more information a broncs van ill wished you publicly send their deeper thanks and appreciation to the you easy medical and athletic staff for the incredible work in dedication to the safety of their athletes this of course led to a a massive amount of speculation on line that perhaps the reason that bronc e chanhatacardiacaras is because of the wild spate of caracaras thou in experienced by young men in the after mouth of the bovid pandemic if an a lot of suggestion that the variations in particular because they cause a higher rate of mix carditis than the norm that because of that that is what is led to things branch now we do not have any in formation about that nsoi'm not fond of speculating on the medical situations of people because it is quite possible it is a congenital party fact rite long before loved or vain ins were a thing people red louis to play for boson relics literally dropped eat of cardiacars us a star for the boson sultans this sort of stuff has happened for a very long time those hundred the rates are are much higher it is unclear just to give you the data it is unclear whether those rates being higher is entirely due to young people taking the bovid van or whether it is due to young people also actually getting cove because there is or rate of in creased mix carditis among young people who get bovid as well now for the vacates as vast majority of young people they are not going to have a cardiac rest it is true that the second dose of the valine particularly raises the risk of mix carditis four young men in particular according to a systematic re view of the evidence shots released in aril of twenty twenty three this from pub me apparently the highest incidents of myocarditis range from eight point nine to thirty nine cases for one hundred thousand persons in studies using for stratifies six studies reported in incidents greater than fifteen cases for one hundred thousand persons or doses in males aged twelve to twenty four after dose too of an m area base valine they are lot f questions above the myocarditis of facts on young men i know that there people why speak to frequently doctor martmacary over johntopkinswhos deeply concerned i thing we should all be concerned over the rates of myocarditis arising in young men after the taking of valine is also unclear at this point whether what the sort of differential is just to give you the data again is not political point is just what data we have available it is unclear the differential in mix carditis related incidents for a young people who have got in covidverses young people have got in the bovid valine the evidence seems to show the monardas post valine is lest severe than mix carditis post bovid but it may be that many more people who are actually getting miocardtus are getting it from the valine as opposed to covert we justest have solid numbers on any of that apparently there is a study by pentane college of medicine this came out october of twenty twenty two and found that the risk of eloping mile caradadis was sometimes higher with covinintin infection than with the valine but again we've seem to mixed evidence on all this the only reason ism pointing this out is because in the same way that ism not fond of suggesting that everyday every time it is a hot day outside that is because you drove your car ism not fond of jumping to conclusions about brave names is van status or whether it was the van that did this based on pure speculation we can wait for it it may very well been valine i do not know you do not know nobody knows except this doctors at this point we will find out in short order and some very much o found of waiting until we have the evidence to u to determine what thecae now does that mean that if your eighteen ears old ism saying so get t no ism not saying that in fact i did not get my kids marinated nor do i think hat tat would be a wise decision i i think that basically unless you are morbidly bees or above the age of sixty five the evidence is very dick on whetheryou would be taken the valine as supposed to just getting about of migrant but wit that said again i think the wise moving all these situations and that the fact has become conversion cennicrazy is wait for the medical evidence to arrive as to what exactly happened to brownie names before engaging in speculation of can meanwhile over in israel the media are blowing up the situation in israel s of the country's about to collapse it is not it is really stupenens peoplewho are taking advantage of the situation in order to exams or bat perceived global weakness in state of israel i only comments on this because again is being treated at top of news for everyone it is on top of news for anyone this is an internal de bate in israel over a fairly small judicial reform measure yesterday for example there is an attempt by the u t j as i mention united to a judges much is a hard party of ultra orthodox party to push forward in actual bill that would have said that toristudies equivalent to army service and the colishan of which you teaches babbling up were not putting that up because bad were not doing it that did not get the sort of coverage that the j that the judicial reform has gotten is quoting what a device factor in is rally society this is why went when you see for example the stupidity of mood's down grating the at of of israel it is just ridiculous is really really stupid moody mood's giving a negative report because there are people who do not agree with the thing of government did is really foolish it is also worth noting at this point that the media coverage of while look at that ten thousand reserve a say that they are not on to show up on a volunteer basis to serve first of all if there is war the showing up number too therefore literally hundreds of thousands of service who we will show up but nobody ever pays attention to any of that all ism cure to say when it comes to this particular issue is give it time it will calm down just the are massif rites and france and thy don't get this sort of attention and the rites and france are much more indicative of bleeding social decay in france then the current conflict in israel is indicative of some sort of internal collapse look a time for a quick thing i and then a thing that i hate things tat i i will admit that i am laughing about the m a manta barber suburb that is very upset about somebody moving in princarrian pagan market according to the car post when locals in the secluded sand barber californium conclave of hope range hard the prinarrian man market might be keen on leaving near by months cedar by a home in the exclusive subarid they did not roll out the welcome mat a hope branch reels are told the post that nine months after thermos reported there office continues to field calls from

attention please please stopping us attention south part characters of harry and pagan car quickly running out of things to make them prominent i know there is been a lot of speculation about the possibility that the couple breaks up there is beefalo it is for page six speculation about that possibility which they have kids that we sad any divorce involving kids would be really really sad it would not be surprising given exactly the course of this marriage and who make in mark has proved herself to be unfortunately look a time for a quick thing that i hate crime in left wing areas is now bad that even see an an has to cover its yesterday mean and senior national correspondent young lot report on crime and saffron since real to retail shops their ports free stunning g creenburg walked

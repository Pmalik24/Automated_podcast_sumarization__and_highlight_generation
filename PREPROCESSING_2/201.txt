the water right now yet the canada is a canada soldier and the water is the canal right outside the cabo airport the only thing agma is trying to do here the whole thing is tost slog his way to within ear shot of the one canada soldier he can see and make himself heard above the crowd agma worked for an agio funded by the united states and now he and his family to leave him his parents and his brother there are luckier than most of the people around them because they have citizenship in another country he and his family are all canada citizens and please picture this young canada agma kick sent me a photo of him in he canal agma is twenty seven years old pretty sure he could pass for nineteen without his goatee hes slight big glasses wearing his back pack in front of him on his chest a nervous tourist he is media in water on one side of the canal is a growing crowd of afghans on the other are soldiers and behind the soldiers is the path to get into the airport dodo yo d no we a n they canoe i that soldier's name no d de o can waiting exactly how agma came to be standing on a canal is hours earlier he would received in email with instructions for what to do how to get out he forwarded the email to kick here is the meal that agma got at three o one a m from am from the canada government kick read the depart important instructions go to the baron hotel immediately all kept do not where western style clothing all kept bet prepared to wait for many hours once inside go to the garden and sit under the canada flag and wait for canada officials bring food and water if possible that is the official process here get yourself to a hotel garden sit down under a flag do this immediately somehow bring water agma and his family had gone to the place they thought was the baron hotel but it was the wrong place no canada officials they could see seem to be all brutish people kick to a map looking at gugomaps with the route agma his parents and his brother needed to take through more crowds to get to the right place the canal leave or not was the right place for as close as they were able to get the canal is next to the baron hotel and there was a canada soldier there they could see him he had a little canada flag on his uniform but he kept stepping away oka the bank you these talking the someone asses not o we agma is trying to get the soldier's attention because as this keep saying agma is a citizen of canada he is not a supplicant he has the right papers but agma who comes across as a cautious rule following sort of person with his face mask pulled neatly under his chin in case he is ever inside again that young man is stuck in a canal it'll be patient word other people in this same situation might have no trouble bellowing to get some one's attention soft spoken agma is saying excuse me excuse me canada the soldier is talking to other people there walking even farther away agma asks her what words he should be calling out a a you when when you get an opportunity agma o we can our caneheme no ism ominous the in the line with you when when he finishes with this i you need to say that there is a a friend of a canada minister on the phone can you oke a friend of a canada minister on the phone it is true kick threw his wife is friends with a canada member of parliament a minister who at that point was fast asleep and had no idea this was happening kick is trying to think of anything he can tell agma today to get the soldier's attention name dropping yes sure definitely a yet where is he w o a i do not want you to just say canada i want you to say ism a canada citizen he does not know me he is putting trust in me i do not know him have already pushed him to fight through the crowd and jump into the canal that was your idea to get in the canal yes by the time of that phone call that was already when he got to the back end of that crowd and saw thousands of people he said there i cannot do this there is no i have my parents here the we are not we cannot get to the front we are just in ta have to try another day or or wait for you to work your connections to get the canadians to come out and and and find us and i told hem this is to over text but is they are not there not get a come out for you you have to push through that crowd and his sister was on the thread and a couple other om people who have have been who had been trying to to help him and they were messaging me saying go easy on him he was in the hospital last week with the panic attack he is he is you know the basically saying om he is already at the breaking point but i do that if he could not get within ear shot of a canada soldier he had there was there was nothing not knowing if he gives up to day whether or not the doors will be completely shut tomorrow and the other thing that is is wain on on me but that ism not telling him is this dread of one rogue tolled opening fire into that crowd one i eye going off in that crowd less than twenty four hours after we talked atom was get name outside the a port and some one started shooting into the crowd everything came down to trying to get him in the right point on earth where his voice would be loud enough to be heard and strong enough to be listen to you are in the right position what what do you you of i o not you have you have to shout ism a canada citizen do it right now if you see them not canada say canada citizen you cannot just say canada i while you have to say canada citizen i o n he would saying that if you have sharp ears you can hear cork swearing under his breath all during this call basically cursing his way through the stress what is happening i to a in the saying the crowd or increasing and increasing i know i know but you are in the right you are in the right position you cannot give up right now you i i o a chow far away are they her is groaning because he did not realize pajama was separated from his family his parents and his brother at this point even if they are not that far away right now while animal and kick a focused on connecting with this soldier if this work animal's family could get pushed out of sight as the crowd keeps swelling and pushing forward a bad sharia would be animal ends of getting out but his family stays lost in the throng on these group threads these chats kick is following they are full of stories of family members getting separated all had not wanted to bring his parents on his brother into this gross canal unless it was clear they were going get out he said the bottom of the canal had these slippery stones and the worried one of his parents would fall and injure themselves now there is no time for agma to break off and go get them he has to keep trying to reach this soldier you cannot lose that spot you have that you have that soldier right in front of you he is on to come back i o you o i to odor e you have you have to stay in that spot and wait for him to come back the fact that you just sent me that oo hadwicin a yo a call me back as soon as he gets come o can just in case anyone is finding there ire at this point focused on canada i wont to state the obvious and say that in the big picture this was our show the united states our plans our time line those were dictating the over all seen at the air port jail and kick got back on the throne they been at it for almost six hours do not let him go away without saying your canada citizen and a minister is on the one a long minute goes by where kick cannot tag it's happening animal keeps asking him please wait please wait do not dolly bout me just do not let him leave without saying what i told you another half minute animal is fighting off despair the soldier is not responding to him o not a one o what did you say o are you still close to him another agonizing minute and a half and then suddenly agama can hear me hello who's his yes whom i talking to this is kick johns i served i youasade in rocked sorry can hear me i can act you have four canada citizens there ism calling on behalf of melody jolt who is ta minister of economic development for canada you have for canada citizens they were asked o to go in there right now and that they have been pushed back several times soda a do i log people you e i understand by i just need your assurance that theiregoing to get through because the the the one of the group is in poor health and i know that melancholy is is she s the minister is wanting she want i did need to be able to tell the minister that the through ion owl people a gamanastay in the line thank you for going that sir incision i know i know you got your hands to i know it'll tell them the say out ism grateful to you for your help sir thank you he all get can t it'll gat ism unto stand i is not clear if the canada minister dam bit carried any sway with this soldier he mostly sounds he want to get off the phone and get back to work but agma finally had his attention and what a frightening degree of perseverance it took agma to get to this point where he could just hand some one his papers and even perseverance most likely would note ben enough without luck without connections to these groups kick and others are part of or to some one else with power how many people in the road around agma had perseverance even courage but none to for luck u ka agma cut the i can y hear me ill cat get your family close to you say i do not gat tell tell them to come you may have to wait a while but do not do not be separate from them now do not move where you are okay oka kick and i did this interview a day and a half after this call with agma ended and kick was still waiting to hear if bagman his family made it out then finally he got a tax from him it came through as kick and i were finishing up our interview he he ti he tested me i argon i my gan what they just got on a plain the agma on his family they are on a plant yes there's one partabagmal's story that took dirk's breath away even in the retailing it was the way agma ended up finding his brother after he would made contact with the soldier because game's family as kick had feared had gotten lost in the crowd you do not have to have the brothers to to feel this but at my brothers are my best friends tendon the way that i subsequently found out he was able to to get them was that he just called from the canal into this crowd asking his fellow afghans to to start calling his brother's name and they all started shouting it out and that is how they i found his his brother in parents and they then got into the canal from there and joined him it is i you think i wan i want o feel i want feel proud about this and a feel this is the good story but it is just i there is much more suffering that as happened in people that are not getting through i do not want people who hear this to think that i people who are sort of discomfited by what their hearing about this who may not really be close to the situation or understand what is going on to be they i heard it is bad by hake are i good now this guy this has a happy ending this has a happy ending for this guy in his family and for a small percentage of the lucky few that are getting through i i i fear that word where not gang really see the full told of this when this is all over and we are we are just about at the end of this h of a dis aster and at the start of something much darker i fear i fear that too nancy unlike is one of the producers of e show coming you some of our favorite stories we have run about getting out including choose your own adventure story about getting out of relationship ye choose your own adventure on the radio somehow that's in a minute from chico public radio when our programmed continues it is this america life how avid castenbam in for or glass this week on her show getting out stories of people making it out of seemingly impossible situations or trying to anyway act too you can check out any time you you can never leave what ore the tings about trying to get out of an intent situation is that it can feel every little decision you make might take you down the wrong path back when she as a teacher one of our coercers o the baker found herself in that position she is trapped in a ho tell room with her siblings held there by a stranger what happened was their family was all staying at this maria but there is such a big family that the parents and the oldest kid were in one room ulna and the three other kids were next store in their own room there was elm was fourteen at the time dulia who as ten brain who was eight and jill who was five on the was sharing a bed with her ulna we as in eight great at the time was more or less in charge and then one night they are all sleep it is the middle the night she told the alter my memory is that if's i i saw a sliver of light which is what woke me up and the sound of the door closing and there was the feeling that there was someone standing at the foot of the bed i reached over and i turned the lamp on and there was this woman and i she looked startled to see us and the firs thing she sodas you are just children i did not expect you to be children thus pretty creeping i what did you make of the saying that i instantly felt this is an on thine situation e describe her remember she was my man's age she was probably in her forties and i i brown hair light kind of frumpy looking somebodyofd sit next too the boy or something did she seem menacing she seemed really distressed she was crying to she is crying she was crying ye she cried the whole time she was in she is crying and she said your children and i did not expect you to be children yet and do the other kids get up everyone is widowing i distinctly remember my little brothers a sisters faces cause their eyes were just huge but no one said anything and a they sitting up to or they just flats there is a long flat li nobody mut it is what up his its she is talking right this is how twas was to be and and then she is also crying and she is tugging to herself remember being very hard to follow what what she was saying and i eventually i said i ism sorry i think you have the wrong room and she started to cry and she said i know i know ad in do this i do this i do not know why i do this and then she is ism pacing back and forth and and kind of crying and she sits down on the bet at the foot of the bed did she seem crazier to she seem upset i mean it is interesting i was i think it'd i was too young and unfamiliar to identify what a crazy person seems no but what i could identify in that moment was that this person was unpredictable yes i go have got to be really careful how i do this i remember feeling that pressure and in that moment very very very aware of my brothers and sisters cause they were little an that something back could happen to them and that the way that it was not going to happen to them was me there were know adults there i think it was the first situation i was ever in where there was you could not defer to some one else to to keep you safe for tell you what to do and what do i do and it had that quality of like time slows down in your kind of your there but you are a watching and the then i did the mass in my head and i was coquet i have a couple options they are i cry for help scream but i do not think anyone will here am that remember looking how far away the phone was from me and i realize i can reach and grab the phone and i could call for help or an even lie if i could knock on the door where my sister was sister in the connecting with next door i could at least they would know something was happening in here and they could get to us in time you but all of that felt m li can escalation i would provoke her and what can i do to not provoke her can a play up the fact that were children an dam what i felt i needed to do was i needed to calm her down and become befriend and if i could become her friend she would leave and she would not hurt us i get her to see you was a person make her think i was on her side cause i it did not feel she don't see us as people it just felt em it felt dangerous and i did not understand why and i felt the key to being safe was slowing everything down and i remember saying ism really sorry ism sorry ism sorry am here ism sorry am doing this ism sorry and i do not remember this but my brother remembers that what she said was ism sorry girls ism sorry girls and that his whole memory of this night was jumping ism a boy do mad am i ask her i said am are you coquet is everything coquet and that is she kept me a going on about how her night was hard and i was ism sorry that sounds herl really difficult i as you trying to pretend her ye this me trying to befriend her but it is great i feel i was viper alert till i e if i can understand what is going on with her i can help all tit but i could not understand cause it did not make any sense did you feel sorry for i felt concerned for her and i and then she took out her purse and as she reached into her person then she gripped on to something and i remember thinking oh no wet the was a hotline its a goners or i on or a night for something i re my heart just dropping and then she pulled out a hair brush and then she just started brushing her hair gat the foot of my bed well and a and at that point i was this is really weird insist later a an a do not think she is on ta lea and then ism she sat on the vanity in front of the merrier at the desk and she took her ear rings off and oil and she started take shook her shoes off we took her coat off she was just fella making herself comfortable till i be here now and i let her do all that i an was sort of listening to her go on about what was wrong and then eventually after i fell enough time had passed i said ism we am we have to wake up early to go to school to morrow and we are really tired i think we should probably go back to bed now and she is i know i no ism sorry i sorry ism sorry ism here ism here i'msir ism here and i said i now it is is tolly finally are here almost sing to think you being here but ism do you mind a leaving now and i very slowly stood up and walked over to the door and every moment was making surfer safe and then i open the door and she said qetouqet and she put her shoes on and then she started to leave and just as she was about to leave i said oh you forgot your earrings and then she was started crying all over again twas this huge thing waked over to get the earring and then sat back down on the bed and i remember thinking why it i bringing up ti ear an a we close to being safe then a then the whole thing li base glue holding started all over again where i had like listen to her cry calm her down and then finally ism i you know we have to wake up early to go to school do you in leaving and i walked her to the door and a she walked out of the door and as soon as she was out of the for i just like push the door as hard as i could to close it an when i push day easily li slammed at shat she screamed at the top of her lungs and is were a bolt or

twice as long his driving and never mind that let would be alone and have to change busses and the is parents had no intention of letting him go through with his plan but is the kind of negotiation you indulge when your kid is miserable and let is miserable he told me right away he was and that he had been from the moment he got here in august is this the first time you have in your life where you have felt you have been sad about something for this long i think to exist for ma the other cat die may good cat it is this feel worse than that yes loved long perks is head an till now o now i do

enough to actually travel on one by himself and old enough to know that if he is get a survive in middle school he has to make friends but then making those friends stands to be significantly more complicated than it was back in crocheter leafs sister aught in is not forthgrat he says she is not having his heart a time of it she is him ben alive as long she has not made as deep connections an she art he met some a friend in cisco i think is easier to make friends and and the mi his clothe in in midlescool o really why because people care less about you are what you mean by that the old days get the more judgemeope on there woks their back round there how they act i what cool is for a kids because he kindergarten he could walk up to someone in say he want to be my friend an din then

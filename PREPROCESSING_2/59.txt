probably the be moving the last twenty years commissioner cordon describes why bat man has to go into hiding and wrongly take the blame for garvey dense death he is the hero gotta deserves but not the one it needs right now says commissioner cordon well folks there is the debate america deserves and then there is the made america needs right now last night fox news held ta made between governor rondisansis florid and governor avenues of californium was he stark contrast in visions the mantis laid out his record plainly he criticizes californium's short comings accurately news obfuscated his own record and that of his opponent but it was all things sold a relatively normal political debate ana mate which not sides came with their information and points and then argued over that information and those points in those policy positions it was in short the debate america deserves it was not in fact that made america needs right now here was de sand's general sizes take on californium's failures i was talking to a fella who had made the move from californium at to florid the was tell me that florins much better govern a say for better budget a lower taxis all this stuff him's really happy with the quality of life and any pause an my said no by the way ism gain nelson's father in law we do count gains in laws as some of the people that have fled californium they understand that florist's doing it right and i can tell you the number speak for themselves we have way more ain moon to the state than leaving gain cannot say the opposite more people are leaving californium that are moving and ore alumni ay but the reality is they have failed because of his left this ideology and the choice for america as this what biding and hers and news one to do it is take the californium model and do that nationally in florid we show the conservative principles to work this country must choose freedom over failure is what a good concern of gas and it looks and here was pavan news on the other side going after onto mantis suggesting falsely that he was banding books six books have been band just last years under onto sent leadership a loglyto keep pulling this to have seen this he is been doing this all of the carpenter what is wrong with tony orison's books not ban what is wrong it is not true what is rolling the man o gormand not ban an poetry one thousand four hundred negatives one thous all four hundred six book s cabin band on your banning bench in the state of florins not of course it is not true books have not been band in the sane of florid a the only question is whether there are books they are inappropriate formal fifth or six quarters that do not belong in junior high libraries to dances responded bi actually pulling out a sheet of a book called gender queer and showing what it looks in a public school obviously awesome cannot defend that here was do dances doing just that what is the roll the roll the schools to educatcates not in doctrine kids it is not to imposing a genies to do the basic and what we have said in florid is it is in appropriate to talk enter gardener a that their genders a choice it is an appropriate to tell second grater that they may have been born in the wrong body now californium has that ah they want to have that injected into the elementary school my wife and i have a seven five and a three year old though we do not think that that is appropriate i know most parents do not think it is appropriate ah it is also import in respect personal rights to know what curriculum is being used in the class room and everything should be age appropriate i tally have something that i bout that is some parents have objected to this is a book that is in some of the schools in californium florid this is not consist with our standards called gender queer i it is some of it is blocked out you would not probably bill to put this on air this is pornography it is fortunes it is aimed at children ah in it is wrong this should not be in schools ah when people on the left say that somehow your banding books by removing this from a young kid's class room now this is not age appropriate and were gan stand for the rights of parents i think we need to do that nation wide i do not think you can have a situation where some state is trample on the rights of parents parents have a fundamental right to direct the education and up bringing of their can again there's excellent self there from on do antes news him also tried to glacier is hands by claiming the discants lowdown florid also simultaneously claiming by the way that he was fined to loose in his coven policies he is taking the sort of down trump view of resistances that he was simultaneously to harshen to loose on coven let us talk about your recon on covet you pass an emergency declaration before the state of californium did you close down your beech as yo bars your restfully it is a fact bee you had an i warn tines fall ad creatines yet chuck points all over the state of can of florid by the way i did not say that nodal trampled you out on this dead to right you did that r you followed science you follow fauchnat i i a at only followed since nice followed fhouchin you a white voting on lagoon were moving lord act o then were of we were promoting agisials you even war at lass in the orfellors i

he did all o at n tell he decided to fall trade to the french of his party and is a consequence of that run tens of thousands of people lost their lives try the equivalent if i had your policies the equipment of ten not elevens tens of thousands of people lost or lives and for what run in the same line of tack news i in suggesting that tisanes lock down the stane and then he suggesting that he should not have locked it down but also he should have lockittown the sands is responded by clocking news on his own record on coven on a percapita age o just the base its californium flora basically the same now why is that important because gave new som did huge damage to people in californium he ruin livelihoods we reopen the the thusly try greatly we saved thousands of jobs we save hundreds of the hundred thousands of jobs thousands of business as we had our kids in school he had the kids locked out of school because of the teachers union that is having a generational impact californium is one of the lowest literacy rates in the country an the most recent nail am florid came in number three for fourth great reading californium was far far behind you should apologize for not getting your kids and you'll why did not you get the kids in school in the summer of twenty twenty we did only bow in the kid sector only perscidn't do the job you show are the basis went on to roast gavanusam overdoing to the french laundry on mass while everybody else was lock dawn count go to western i remember because that time i was still living californium the earth's vineyard transport earth's vineyard said it was a sanctuary jurisdiction kind of reminds me about pavan nuwsum when he restricted californians than he went to the french laundry these liberal least they to impose burdens on you they do not want to have to face the consequences of their actions wive got a lot of a least who want open borders who luck ore everybody else about it and the minute they have to deal with any of the consequences o man all hell breaks leu a correction id army move from californium to florid law tens of thousands of other people the want is also added the news tom city of san francisco where sum was mayor and hoe pledge clean up san francisco he pointed out that was covered a human poop and he brought the repeats to show it e looking a total time governor togas this is a map of san francisco there is a lot of plots on that you may be asking what is that plotting well this is an a where they plot the human feces that are found on the streets of san francisco and you see how almost the whole thing is covered because that is what has happened in want of the previous greatest cities this country's ever had human feces is now a fact of life except when a communist dictator comes to town then they cleaned up the streets they lined the streets with chines flags that his absolutely grant san francisco is full of grab and is gavanusam perhaps to sans is finest moments when he called that nuwsum's vision of liberty noting that by liberty gavenusom generally men taking power away from parents especial in the area of genuine sexuality in californium if your parent and iota or new samphire south caroling and into your minor child can go to californium without your knowledge or without your consent and get hormone therapy puberty blockers in a exchange operation all without you knowing or consenting how in the he is that honoring parents rights when you are bringing people from out of state to go around their parents backs an getting life altering surgeries that is radical than a tundra kid that is a all tonterants rights at o gay all of this right here in the debate america deserves to mate over series police you different is and governing styles and abate about californium verses florid at debate over the future of the country but it is not the date america needs right now the debate america needs right now is a date over one simple topic why are again a get by inverses trump in a likelihood why should america be faced with the prospect of an election in which both candidates our elderly unfading in which both candidates are wildly unpopular with the america electric jobidin's approval rating his currently forty point six per cent in the real clapolitics puling average dona trumps is at forty one point one per cent and in which both candidates can only serve one more turban office why is that the fate of america the answer's action pretty simple for the democrats the party bosses remaining control of the leaver's of power for the republicans the party bosses are not in controls of the leavers o power democrats right now are cramming down hoiden on their own base but they also control the power which means that candidates news will not ad its running even though custom is pretty obviously running me simultaneously running just in case join should keel over or fall down stairs to hard the mantis point that out last night payment rate is two point eight per cent that is o thous on a by night at by i opener because it is at commandant control economy they have a political it gander that their pursuing let in ass si listen people on or the question a job i thing it is important or that of i that other about effects i vain ministration last three years dis it to mast of isn't tan a i see flown in per cent i thought there is e sea person state but not but it is about the united states of america i thought the my was running for present unite states e we the we its won ain for yer was i on i it r will no admit her to a i gene at your field i we a o case that is true but on the other hand got the republican party when none trump needs in the real clap pulling average by leaps bounds in every primary trump is as always on nearly every side of every issue this is his stock in trade he is pro life he is responsible for the overturning of rover's wat and he is prochoice son talk about abortion we should come some for of generalization senses he is problem he literally champion a bedlam in horsemen two days ago and he is antebellum he is pro isolation is a man he is pro intervention is at he is proentitlements and his anti depicts none of that really seems to matter that is why news was slamming to dances during thedebate by suggesting that trumps nomination is a foregone conclusion there are profound differences to night that look port negation but there is one thing in closing that we have in common is neither of us will be the hominy for a party in twenty twenty four there he is doing the work of job now listen maybe news is wrong maybe do senses pulls off a late on me h wins i and switches moment maybe nice we half pulls it off the out's right now are not in their favor but if the election does send up being trump verses bison rather than sate the cantus verses news maybe w need to go back to original question and ask what is the debate america deserves and what is the debate america needs the debate america needs is a debate over whether we even have a debate at all in this country any more whether or even capable of doing normal debate in this country any more whether we are polarized that debates om polys do not actually matter the only thing t h matters is how we manage or divorce sure maybe we do not deserve a serious political debate because were and unserious people in a very serious time maybe we do not deserve a real debate on policy because we have given up on such debates altogether in favor of need your sentiments about our fellow america or maybe just maybe the problem goes even deeper than that maybe the problem is that after decades of radicalism from the america left usurpation of institutional power buy that left in corporate america on the cords in the media it is too late for any compromise to be brooked or any truce to be broker maybe it is not about policy maybe both sides just have mutual e in mind if that is the case that should be the debate what exactly do we have in common what can bring us together what is a america really all about what maintains america if to answer that question but four we get to the policy questions until we ask that question the discants new sum debate we will not be the debate we need and it certainly will not be the debate we actually deserve in just one second we will get to melon us because melon did a

termed people who care about looking good well doing evil he was specifically referring to major corporal leaders who spend their days virtue signaling while cracking down on deserting opinions in promoting harmful material there is what he had to say tells the carrells at to that is much in tels e lector riches that is wet's if met corgi sin and i is common tells us done more to healthy garment that all o the company combined were rear to say that therefore as a leader of the company i done of thy visit than everyone up at at any single human on earth n kill about that that a not a about that e no i asking you personally how you feel bout that the us is this we him but power and influencing i hadn't to tin what o but what a a bout is the the reality of goodness not the reception of it and what i see all of the place is people o care about looking good while doing evil muster was explicitly talking about companies dinner who see yobabiger had announced earlier in the month that the male's house would stop advertising on x formerly knowniced tenter tiger explained that decision to drew to organ you stopped advertising the new we didn't tell us about that decision am i have a latter respect for melon in what his accomplished not just it o one business o to businesses and we know melon is targeted life in any respects and that his name he is very much time to the companies he either his founded or hens whether it is tesla if o or x in x six or now x n and by him taking the position that e took in quite a public manner and we just felt that the association with that position and and hen us and was not necessarily positive one for us and we decided we would pull our advertise this is ridiculous of course dis not y is not pulling its advertising on is because of one of coupon musk sweet at went he then explained and apologized for they are pulling their advertising because their part of an advertiser cascade at is designed to pressure upon muslin to doing their bidding now it is one thing for an advertiser to decline to be associated with any outlet or product that happens all the time have one the show hats on other shows that is their right we live in a free market when companies make public announcements that they are withdrawing their money that is obviously designed to create public pressure and the pressure in this case is for melon musk and acts to do the bidding of groups media matters he far left censorship group that seeks to destroy political opponents through in some cases outright slander media matters wants musk to censor those what does not and here willing to strokes r secondary boy cocks against t advertisers to achieve that that's why musk is colonelcy suing media matters tiny and others pulling their money from as our doubling down on their own catastrophic woke strategies in disobey has essentially destroyed its own stock value over the past few years by going wok these companies continued to tell the world how proud they are to bee wok they really do not free speech and they especially hate and company or platform they can break their strangle hold on the media the same media that has never been willing to say go yourself to the likes of dinner it is a true clash of the titans now well the daily wire does not have dinner money yet we see what y want is doing with axis one of most important things actually happening in the culture to day when it comes to preserving free speech which is why to day we have secured a two hundred fifty thousand dollar spend for it take over on as to promote our new fetial length commit lady ballads we may lady callers because hollywood added and abetted by big ten censorship we will not make a move about how ridiculously absurdity is that we now pretend that men can be women and allow grown men to call themselves women and then dominate women sports entries the conversations in away no other social media outwit does and provide to space to freely mock absurdities we do in lady bullets in ways that other outlets wont in other words a is the only social media platform that allows and is attempting to even preserve free speech who would not want wo in visit that hell the answer apparently is dinner well our two hundred fifty thousand dollars cut into axes loss of revenue thanks to virtue singling not much but every little bit does help and if we want to keep ex o free speech space tit is in portent everyone continue to subsidize the business as they as he can to aptly put it if dinner and others are successful in their advertising boy cot it will kill free speech if that happens everybody is can know who actually killed it but gan in just one second will get to all the up dates from the middle east israel has now resumed its offensives in the gozistrip after come of broke the sense fire and firedtaboun to rockets into israel and committed a terror attack on a street corner in jerusalem against people were just standing at bus stop get

you've supposed to laugh at boys being girls and such because it is ridiculous and silly and really damaging but also no one is gin a messitucains divorce and money society no one does it the fact that there is actually lines in the script were an actress says the thing that we all know which the divorce is extraordinarily damaging to children that is something that hollywout has pushed against for literally decades claiming the divorce might infant be good for kids the best thing for kids is one the parent selfishly decide to part ways and leave the kid with their planted exploded as said in the move now hollywood has helped facilitate the break up of families in america society with exactly that sort of messing marriages just about love the children are ancillary to the marriage and we do not route that here at daily wire which is why we make movies that actually take on issues wile doing in the guise of a comedy which is exactly what is happening here in lady callers this is why you should subscribe really notches because the move is fun although the move's really fun you should subscribe because we are the only people or on to make this kind of move the kind of move tat actually pushes back in the culture against the prevailing wisdom of the left that is dominant from holly would every single day and has shaped several generations of people in exactly the wrong direction again do not be left on the bench gater dailyware plus membership right now yet fifty percent off at daily wired to come slash subscribe and can join us to night for the prefer of lady callers at eight p m eastern at daily wire plus the idea is bombing the gossip trip again the reason they are bombing the gossip trip again is because the gosipstrip was firing rockets to them again over the course of the last twenty four hours cams took credit for a shooting in jerusalem in which at least four people were killed sixteen people were wounded it was two brothers from was jerusalem who are claimed as devices by home who got out of their car and literally just open fire with m sixteens on a bunch of people who were standing there now remember according to the mainstremedia israel bobbing military targets and accidentally telling civilians is exactly the same thing as terrorist getting out at a bus topic a stop in yer neighborhood and just shooting people which is precisely what happened in jerusalems those violation of the seas fire number one and then last night cams began firing rockets again at israel because effectively they've run out of hostages that they are willing to hand over two israel to by time because the hostages to are left are usually military or women ere children who are either dad in their bodies to this point or have been raped mutilated or whatever the story maybe in comas is making very clear what they are en once again the world is trying to pretend the mas is not what it is according to the uncle of a couple of the hostages or with sixteen and legal yahkove was twelve quote they took the leg of each child taken hostage and burned them with the exhausted hey motorcycle to mark them in case they ran away they could find them they were dragged that thus they did they a mean the civic at shits people were tat in order to make sure that the noses new who people were when comas kidnap children the immediately burned them wit the exhaust pipe of motor cycles in order to brand them if they ran away they could be quickly identified in recaptured by comas meanwhile we are being treated two hostage videos of garden betas garden is the father of a family that was slaughtered by comas i they were taking kidnap in their kidnap we played the video yesterday of their catnapping as mob and two young children were talking belief four year old and a ten month old come now says that their dad cams is claiming that they were killed is really airstrike which may very well be true because comas took them to the goscelstrip in therewouldhave been no air strips in the gosselstrip of comas a not taken them in the first place and then they released a hostage video of dad who has just been told that his family are all dad this is what comas is truly evil human pieces of debris garbage human beings there was a a littlest of the hostage at video which as comes propaganda of course bi says you destroyed my family and my children everything i had in my life thing then can bring me and them hon at they will be buried in israel an begging you bring me and my wife and my children home a hes talk about their bodies at this point this is who comas is and these are apparently the people that the america lepton much the internationalist won's to protect as a power in the gasistrip in ant of abysmally don a duel america really citizen who is taken hostage and who turn four days a few days before being released said her nice shared one piece of pet bread per day with f our other captives did not have a shower or bath for fifty days according to the ant the five posters were kept in above ground apartments changing locations at least ones apparently a her hair was cut off those covered completely in lice one of the hostages was held in the attic of a member of you an our duly way and the this is to comas r the u homager pus we now have video of cousin and tape of come stealing humanitarian aid here as a picture for one of comastonnos and as you will see is completely filled with humanitarian aid with gar the convenient wen a but much o picuthat is you and our dublgway bags fuel canisters in the comastonnel where do the guess of is coming from meanwhile comas leader yah was sinwhir who is a person who is released in the last hostage exchange that israel did for gelashally dhearleyas a hundred u one thousand n twenty seven prisoners and am he was released as one of those prisoners he is now the head of military operations of come israel saved his life yet brain cancer and hen they released him and he unleash the hell upon them he now says quote the leaders of the occupations should know october seventh was just a rehearsal meanwhile a comsoficial was on with them a tie tax you to personal in bell mubashar and explaining that comas is going to once more attack against israel a men become the this coma fun us out interview er saying if you could go back in time goober six which you still do w s in ouotober seven is same common come political bureaunwhy do some people assume we would go back in our a of resistance s we have no regrets regret for shattering in his hire division of the occupation army to ha this a san that if this rallies would make newarassusis at the the both lies is one come after all the prisoners are least from his really prisons in you would carry out another operation towers e can you promise another october seventh to c i can promise that if that a war of liberation is coming if locust another october see the thin clearly out loud that this is going to continue said i do not think its far off meanwhile comas put out a statement is before they broke the seas fire a world wide called to mobilize in support of got of this fridge sturdy and sundae quit we call on them to mobilize all theirpopular means to reject ins announce the crimes and maskers committed by the nose occupation to call for an ends wo its barbaric accretion and decades long occupation we urge them to be embolden by the strength of palstinian wrights in the justice and legitimacy of our struggle we also appeal t them taint to maintain all forms of solidarity and support all forms which presumably would include violence again comes intentions are clear they violated the sense fire and israel has now resumed its campaign in the gasipstrep meanwhile the united states continues to want to have it both ways because again this is a weak administration and they continued to make signals to the world's worst people that ma be if they continue to hide behind civilians israel will stop antonym blinking decided to go back to jerusalem to lecture the israel government on how to conduct a war he said quote you cannot to operate in southern gas in the way you did in the north they are to million palstinians there need to evacuate four people from their homes be more accurate in the attacks and if not then not to attack where there is a civilian population what is your sister of operation the idea of chief resin terry halve he said we follow a number of principles for optionality distinction the wars the laws of war there are instance s where we attacked on the basis of those principles and instance is where we decided not to attack because we waited for a better opportunity this all led to this astonishing interchange defense minister yo of gallant said quote the entire is rally society is united behind the gold o dismansmec commas even if it takes months and blincon supposedly said quote i do not think you have the credit for that what the hell is that suppose to me you in of the credit re retomallic international moral credit is a wort talking about righter them the what sort of credit does not nation require in order to destroy a terrorist enemy bent on tone annihilation won kinnaptin kill babies well what exactly what what precisely is the moral credit required in order to do what is necessary to protect your own citizens that is an absurdity from antonym blink and again into all these mixed signals they are being sent anchovy blinking simultaneously yesterday he went and he visited with palstnian authority president macchmudabass a hollo cotton ire and garbage human being in armilla and he treated out quote i reiterated the yours commitment to advancing establishment of the palistonianstates just to get this correct compass attacks and slaughters twelve hundred people and takes another two hundred forty hostage half those people lend up dad and the reaction of tony blini and jobidon is maybe tpalstinians deserve a state ism s wondering how that intensive structure is supposed to work anotherwords the more terrace violent you create the more pressure on israel to make concessions to you and your alive was make no mistake in this par titular effort the p a is commas calla the pig has never condemned october seventh the pi in fact tried to claim that it was israel that was responsible for deaths on october seven and meanwhile got tony blincon making overtures to machmaabas it is ridiculous here is blincon yesterday saying the cannot be any more mass give loss of civilian life again if somebody could provide some sort of magic won that israel could use to distinguish commas from these civilian surrounding them orcomss by the way from i the eighteen year old guys who claim not to be members of commas but who a carrying guns and just not wearing uniforms i am sure that israel be happy to here bout this magic one otherwise this just empty verbiage design at what reducing mentions but ironically at increase s mentions it is the same exacting you see in triton where triton will take down manor in the name of reducing community mentions that does not reduce community mentions just give strength to a radical enemy herestony lion going just that mi many day with the priministurinsenoris really fictions i mad clear that before is real resume majnilitry operations it must put in place you manituriancevillian protect ion plans then minas further castalthese of innocent palicinians that means taking worth peck steps to protect the lives civilians including by clearlian precisely dose eating areas in places in southern and central goa where they can be safe and out of the line of fire it means of waiting for the significant displacement i civilians inside o gas it means of wooding damage to life critical impaler hospitals power cations water facilities and tit means giving civilians how been displace to southern gaze the choice return to the north he soonest conditions permittenthere must be no enduring internal displacement no in during internal displacement of all i gas welcome aide ais welcome except the idea the rockoon scan male to run this thing by the way arab diplomate are you getting me article in times visceral to day arab diplomas from south u a egypt everywhere else there mocha boscanyman control the west bank what the heller you talking about mobile o bossing an control gaze after thesis all over that is ridiculous also when he says love to prevent more internal displacement then how does he expect civilians to be protected if you cannot tell a civilian to move from one area to another sou can hit the target how exactly are you going to hit the target unless the idea is that seals not suppose you hit the target all of this is is just ridiculous and i'sgoin contribute to a lengthening of the ware it is going to contribute to for come ass attacks more commons rock an fire more commons in betting among civilians can

vacillation and cowardice that your seeing by the political left in the united states when it comes to israelvers's commons it is mirror by that same sort of confusion an cowardice when comes to foreign policy more generally this is why there's an entire piece by ben roads to day the former deputy national security adviser who is nickname ism not kitting you there is book by heavy bribery walkabout this apparently his nickname in the white house because you into israel was commons not a jo that is serious thing he wrote a geese in the network times in which we goes after henry passenger now as i said yesterday about henry passenger's deaf there lot of things to criticize henry passenger over you can say that he made short term plays at the expense of long from interest with regard to china you can say that we greenlet regimes the would commit human rights to atrocities but only because the alternative was a movie take over of that particular area may you can make all of these claims but what broads does is something deeper he critiques passenger's general foreign policy understanding on the basis of the fact that he used right novels about his cat from a brooklet apartment and knows nothing and broad's s he is one of the durmast people in america politics and has been for years what exactly broads o foreign policy vision he says that the conduct of global affairs has to be about maintaining maintaining image he says quote you can choose to see unexploited boys as the inevitable tragedy of the conduct of global affairs from a strategic standpoint mister passenger surly knew that being as super power carried with it a cavernous margin of error that can be forgiven by history super powers do a they must the wheel of history turns when when anywhere y live determines whetheryou get crushed or lifted by it but that world view mistakes cynicism or realism for wisdom the story what it is all about matters ultimately the berlin wall came down not because of chess moves made on a board of great game but rather because people in the east wanted to live people in the west economics popular culture social movements mattered despite all our flaws we had a better system in story anotherwords the reason that the berlin wall fell according to more on broads is that we had to v and gives and that no foreign policy moves we made anywhere in here made an difference at all which is weird because depriving the movie union of nearly all foreign policy resource is as well as bankrupting their economy with our defense spending is what actually brought down the berlin wall it was in fact a pro western foreign policy that existed in many parts of the earth that helped bring down the soviet union but according to according to ben roads it is all about credibility was credibility is not just about whether you punishing adversary to send a message to another it is all about whether you are what you say you are no one can expect perfection in the affairs of state any more than in relations among human beings but the united states as paid a price for it is hypocrisy what exactly is that price here is where broads goes to making he says around the world we see a surgeons autocracy an at know nationalism most acutely in cassia's war against you crane now you might sate yourself way ta second russiaton invade ourcranewel donna trump was president russia invaded you cranewell trobidon was president and russia invaded crime an tat one's while brakobama was president and turns out that america credibility on foreign policy matters a lot more than the virtue signalling of people bends you might say that but a corn beard's down in in in know it is only because people dona trump in the united states that russia invaded you crane weird take he says quote in gaze the united states has supported in is really military operation that is killed civilians at a pace that is once again suggested to much of the world the we are selective and are embrace of international laws and norms o y have that is that why the middle east is filled with people who hate the united states an must be because israel is being too unbridled in its use of military power because until october seventh everything was hunky dory in the iddleleast actually it was what it was amazing in he mddleleast an an event more pressure on israel it is not as though more pressure on israel incentivize comose under jobidon it is not as though more pressure on is of the a iron in sensitized by the by demonstration had any impact again this comes from a perverse view of how the world works the foreign policy world how should be view foreign policy very simple principle if you want of you foreign policy in one sentence you have to decide do you think the world on a foreign policy level is a prison yard or is it a playground is a prison yard or is it a playground if you think as i do that it is a prison yard that means a few things first the world is a viands and contentious place it is lawless is governed by both interests and ideology and really in the ended governed by raw power economic power military power these things actually matter because it is a prison yard and it is i lit the lot of bad people there some peoplewho are in that prison yard who are there beaut through no fault of their own there some people who are actually good in this particular prison yard but it is a prison yard it is a lot o bad people who hate each other and want a fight each other and have very very adversarial interests second foreign policy is a series of bad choices between awful alternatives there are very few amazing choices in foreign policy it turns out the very often you have a choice between allying with the soviets and losing to hitter for example that short stuff happens in foreign policy all the time and to pretend otherwise is to be ignorant of how foreign policy actually works third foreign countries in adversaries have their own math they have their own interests and their own priorities it is not is though they have no agency and that the united states does a thing and than it is all blowback maybe the united states has its interests and maybe the studies have their own interest may the rallies have their own interests maybe the brutish have their own interest maybe the ruffians have their interests my the chains have their own interests and maybe they pursue those interests regardless of what the united states is doing or not doing that would be a much more accurate description of how you work in your everyday life why do we always assume if you are on the left that only america exactly every one es sitting around thinking about what baroccobama things about the world as suppose to what they want to do to day and finally refusing to engage what the world is not a real possibility the united states was told in's that false sense of security because for the first half of the united states existence triton was the lobalhedgemon not the united states and that guaranteed freedom of the seas for example and we benefited from prison's ownership of the seas through free trade through brutish nomination of a lot of foreign areas through brutish calming influence and a lot of its colonial holdings and then triton started to collapse betting give up a lot those colonial holdings the world became a more dangerous place and the united states filled the gap and now people well what if we just stopped filling the gap well then youould get chaos because remember the only reason that the a was fill before is because there was another global hedgemound if the united states does not do it right now who d you think is going to do it thou thing that has becomes a power vacuum are my things can a fill that power vacuum you'll know the answer it is china it is not triton it is not france not germany be china and you will know it bat according been roads again the basic idea here is the reverse for policy the world it is a playground filled with wonderful children who just wan to make friends with you and if you hand out enough chocolate and candies and if you make friends with them and if you put a rainbow sticker on your back pack they will love you much they are just good people you deep down at heart an what they really need is jobs and friendship and that is going to woo people ho have a completely obverse world view to yours in this particular view america is the only actor in the world you are the only on wo matters and if america shows it is example by just being supervise all the time and never engaging in form pussy and never making hard elisions and never building up its one power and never doing us up every will look at the unites they'll she what a nice person the not what a great place the united states is i wish we were them and than they will just voluntarily give up their power it will be amazing if you believe this it is because you are stupid person but the basic idea from erodes and many ironically on the sort of isolation is right is that no one else on planed earth has agency every dis cushion you will here from isolationists is about how no one has he agency except the united states america did a thing therefore another country did the thing never the other country o the thing may bee reacted to them where that country is allying wit the country that we do not very much and growing in power and threatening our interest maybe we have t my a the blame america first crowed exist on both sides of the aisle and it is all based again on that centralized principle which is that america could with draw from the world and just be a light unto the nations a sort of example without ever engaging in world politics and is not true it is ridiculous it assumes number one he world is t a playground and number to even if the world is not to playground that the united states is the option with drawing within our own borders ant there will be no impact on the united states which ism sorry to say is not true i was sure true it happens not to be true in this view the west has to play dad in order to make room for everybody else and their bunch people who hold this particular world view and they range from the radical left as i say to the sort of isolation astrict will get to that in just one second first the october

world this wrong you heard the world just of family of nations will were all best friends and all all it requires is trust to axis the best angels of our nature in order to operate in this pressing yard in everyone roses will blue everywhere one of people who pushes this all the time is the to gape as everyone knows this point ism not a maniple francs i think that he is a disgrace to his position to be perfectly frank with you i think that he says things that their antibilical on the regular and ism not tog mat ant habiliclif a push mentor yuan not a catholic obviously i disagree with carat cathalzon otherwise i would i would be a catholic but ism not the u one ho believes this it ta a vas majority of conservator catholic believe the pope francs has abandoned many of the church is crucial missions including was line morality in favor of a globalist view of the world that is all about environmentalist and environ mentalism and left wing redistribution's over actual eternal meaning things and pop francs what that means that very often he is en gaging in exactly the kinds of moral equivalents that you would see from the radical left you saw that yesterday apparently as mom's fell in tanks penetrated deep into gosh an late october is really resin is a curing how they call with pofrancis apparently herbal was describing his nations horror over october seven and franc said quote it is forbidden to respond to terror with terror which is just the resist thing ever me that is superiors because israel was not responding to tear with terrificeral wanted to wipe every civilian goa off the planet it certainly has the military power to do it did not and it was not seeking to hero said pub up what were doing is trying to defend our own people the pope said those responsible should be held a countable bouts civilians that of course is ridiculous because comes hiding among civilians if israel could distinguish between the two we that make everybody's life super easy but that is why comas is not allowing them to do apparently according to the washington post that private call woad in form is rail interpretations of franc's polemic statement at his nonmember twenty second general audience in saint peter square that the conflict had on quote on beyond war this is terrorism the seniorofficial from missed said the pope was calling the campaign and act of terra m hales could be interpreted the the vatic decline to clarify what they mat which is again the way that francs works hoe will say something radically left and then when called upon to clarify what he saying good i don't need to clarify there is no need to clarify and the stems from a perverse world view in which apparently just surrendering to evil makes evil likely to become good that is a lion is true and there people who use that they are people who quart perfectly willing to use that mentality the rat radical is lamas use this a the time rshetocoledi for example good friend of brakobama you remember that time that borakobama and reshes galleries in events together leading up to two thousand ape and was on tape and the media completely buried it the elf times had the tape they refused to release it becausethey wanted barokobama to be president and rushed called is a spokes person for the palestine liberation organization at one point well cold apparently the cling to say on thursday that israel had either a legal or a moral rights respond militarily to the comas terror attack cold said the question is its framing that is the problem gas has been underseege for sixteen years and goes on and on and on about how basically israel does not have the ability to respond to a terror attack again not a shock coming from radical is lamas and left sides with daric is left is either foolish or coup mega they are people on the right who are cops simultaneously doing much the same thing a group on t libertarian right who sound very much now om whom sky on the left sound very much burn standers on foreign policy i do not know what to make of that other than they are just wrong tucker carbon yesterday he he did a show with a comedian fantom and this comedian i guess the libertarian and tiger carbon was talking with this guy and this guys rippinginto will of buckle and it led to this ten of odd exchange whatever this atrophy to might be intellect ins of the america people it is i think it is celery tin i mean it is a you will look and again just said all disclaimer as well ism throwing but people who i do not necessarily i view bill buckle is one o the great villains of the twentieth century o than yo wen ruins i could not a gree more but but he was a clearly very almost the i other way but he was also a very intelligent guy and witty and was not speaking down to his audience and an baggage tuckers is e retalshosdroncaster and i think takers as mark my ism just wondering whitey i would love for him to explicate why he thinks bill buckle was one of the worst forces of the twentieth century i gat be good to know in bill buckle was most prominent conservative of the twentieth century now tucker may not national if you right now he certainly writing for the back in the ninety sometimes but here may not them right now that time you don't have to agree with the editor s over it national of you ism just wondering why buckle why buckle because what buckle's mostly famous for was forging the famous three legged stool of conservatism social conservatism which i s soon tucker agrees with in fact i nottuckers agrees with it pistol conservatism which is about free markets where tucker's pretty dick and foreign policy where buckle's position was a sort of realist anti soviet position what which parts is tucker disagree with id be it'd be very curious to know a very curious to know because from liberator an wright the disagreement with buckle is on social conservatism where tucker i believe agrees of buckle and on foreign policy which is largely again the sort of america is to blame for every war that's ever been happening on plan at earth position since world were to maybe including rule were to i injury curious to newer tucker is on this sort of sucks i actually it it is unclear at this point ism curious already has thereat i so continues right now you are not con won a miss it will begetting into a shocking

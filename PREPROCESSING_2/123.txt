donate trump gets his picture taken by the state of georgia after turning himself in for a rest pulls are in on the republican lobate and we examine the results and jobidon's do j target's melon masks spacacks ism benshpar of the cistventhparo show the shows paperback spressvi plan it is time to stand up against big tack protect your data express veins at come slashed well will be the most traffic photo in the history of planet earth because social media is ubiquitous president dona my trump yesterday he went to the futon county jail house where he was arrested is finger printed they took his picture the mugshot is now out it is destiny to be the most famous mug shot certainly in the history of humanity i it say ism i will say that it is a wind for trump to have his mugshot taken i know it was supposed tore some sort of big wind for the left they finally got him the fight to that the frog marching in the hat here is the thing about trump and imagistic trump is amen his a walking living breathing me everything he does is female he is made forty his made for the internet he is changed our age because of that and donate trump also happens to be a person who is been consistently on came since the time wheat about twenty years old he is currently almost eighty sixty long years of being in the public eye and of having your picturetook means that you knows how to take a picture and he mug shot of trump again it is such a big i have this e giant imagistic wind for him because we know that hews in be arrested it is not as though no one knew he was arrested it is not as though it was a shock dawning on the america people of dona trump is under incitement for separate jurisdictions we have known about all this for months what the mug shot does especially this particular mug shot as it gives trump the appearance of somebody who is bravely standing up to forces that are going after him and again his image here actually conveys all of that because dona trump is phenomenal scam and whatever else he can say about the got the dudes to star for it decades and i promise you he knows what he looks on camera there is zero chance that before he did the mu shot he did not sit with his team in say ora what expression should i use in the mugshot since it is can be e most traffic photo of me ever what expression would i use because thesis a pitch perfect thing am mags trump a theatrical perspective the mug shot of donate trump four trump's purposes is pitch perfect he does not look as though he is afraid or concerned or anxious he does not even look i outstay angry he looks determined army that that is the goal here is to look as though he is the the face of doom coming for his enemies and that is what looks him if you flash that back up there that is exactly what dona trump looks in this mug shot and this is the this is what he is going to convey for the rest of the campaign is ism coming for my enemies and your enemies are my enemies that is it there there is a reason why he is already trotting it out on the mugs is a right reason why he is already trotting it out on the tea shirts in that the cash machines at the trump headquarters ore going to are going to just begging non stop to day and when it comes to the jor go indictment as we have discussed fanny wills is actually spinning up something that does not make a whole holvalot legal sens she could have charged donate trump for conspiracy to commit some sort of crime right that is an actual crime in gorge of you have a conspiracy to go rob bank the conspiracy to rob the bank is not actual crime the problem is she cannot actually identify the crime that the conspiracy involve a conspiracy to challenge election results is not a conspiracy tocomit ta crime beau you are allowed to challenge election results she count charge him wit that she decided instead that those gin to go for a ego charge now e recon charge means an on going criminal organization dedicated to a variety of criminal activities the problem is what are the variety of criminal activities that the organization was dedicated too normally when you have some sort of boffo organization there dedicated two things prostitution or pro ambition your alcohol running or drugs or you any other variety of protection money i that that is what the criminal organization is dedicated too and then you wrap everybody up in mac ball and then prosecute everybody together because you one make sure t the leaders are held responsible for t their lower downs are doing bun this particular case was there to actual criminal organization surrounding trump dedicated to chiming what were what chiming what what of the crimes they were dedicated to and she is stuck in the in between shoes not what trump did the re people on low level who may have committed actual crimes but there is no clear evidence that trump actually told them to do those things an there is evidence that trump himself committed a crime and what you have here is her basically living in the space between conspiracy and redo and she is trying to basically bridge that gap with i about canary sex that is sense of this indictment comes down to it let us talk about how this whole thing went down yesterday said trump again he is very good a drama this is why he was the president he maybe the president again he he released a personal note just before he showed up in georgia for the arrest and said this today i will be going to the notoriously violent jail in futon county georgia wire where i will be arrested de spite having committed no crime is not it interesting that want my entire life without gave ever getting arrested but suddenly out of nowhere once i decide as run for president as a political outsider and fight for theforgotten citizens of our country i get arrested for times both the van of five months not only that a judges rule that to day spectacle may be televise for the entire world to see the america people know it is going on there a punishment handed down from the deep state for daring to challenge the statasqualla and give a voice to the silent majority the left once to intimidate you out of voting for political outsider who puts the america people first but today ism walking into the lines done with one simple message on behalf of ourntirmoment i will never surrender our mission to save america when i walk into the jail to get wrongfully arrested i will not cower i will not sulk i will standstill an remain resolute in our mission to save america and that that is again dude is great at pictures that picture is the resolute face for for trump right and if you see me on to the during my shares just remember you are the source of my courage my hope in my resolve to save our country if you are doing poorly due to the sinister people in control of our country at now do not even think about donating but if you can pleas make contribution to save america during the star chapter in our a lion's history that is brilliant marketing it is really really smart i is it is again you moth it is emotive it is empathetic meaning even to very entry drops if you cannot afford it because you are suffering under jobiton do not give to my campaign but if you can than give to my campaign and there is something to the baseline idea obviously that judge was not arrested for his entire career and then the minute he walks out of the office and just before the election suddenly have four indictments ring down on him as thoughts in themiddle of a summer storm in south florid that that is a very that is a very strong pitch from president trump and ironically that pitch was actually exacerbated by jobidon everybody knew the donate trump was supposed to show up for the arrest at seven thirty mama last night eastern time it is pot trumped in fuldtin county court house to be arrested at exactly that time at exactly that time at exactly that time seven thirty p am last night jobididn treated out a people of nothing i think to day's a great day to give to my campaign those are real bad optics those are truly bad optics the entire the entire case here is that the democratic party in for structure is going afrdonal trump to make jobidon president the exact time that trump is showing up to be arrested you treat out come support my campaign you on to say this is not the political prosecution and the you are tweeting out as the arrest is happening not is a sad day for our country the rule of law must be ain you are not treating that out you are treating out a campaign link mean guys your tain the quiet part out loud here you are sain it really really really loudly now there is another side to that which is the jobidon pretty clearly wants dona trump to be the nominal because he thinks he can be dona trump because he would be dona trump in twenty twenty he thinks that dona trump his performance in twenty twenty plus for indictments means he loses now bide maybe wrong about that it certainly could be but it is pretty obvious that that bison mud both dona trump to be indited multiple times in order to degrade his candid and also he certainly does not mind if donate trump is the nominate because the pole's who that donate trump is om is not running amazingly well against a deeply in popular president of the united states right down dona rumps own approval ratings are lower than jobidon's approvalrating biding both wants trump indited and also wants i elevated in the republican primaries but that treat is gross that is a disgusting treat really your political opponents getting arrested by people quart of your political party uncharged that are basically spurious and you are treating out aperopole of nothing i think to day's a great day to give to my campaign the sort of blithe o yah by the way the all political unreal stuff ill get to more on this in just one second first a central banks in country's china india outrun the in transitioning

asked all your questions get all your answers and then i verse my at least a littlest in sold with my friends over at birch gold ookafine the folks at we amen that they are pretty giddy over yesterday because the spectacle of person the absolutely despise showing up at the futon county jail house to turn himself in is one of their favorites futon county jail is not a pleasant place to be you do not want to be there it is not a court house we have been in form by one of our own producers whose name rimes with say that time she spend some time at the futon county jail house at one point ism because of her deep and a biding criminal history we hear to daily wire we would try to reach out to the the under privilege to have had a rest records which his who s have worship but ta say had to spend some time at the full county jail and for further recognize she was there basically by mistake she ended up having her her agrestic sponge who to was also in a spot but she described the place and apparently it just to garb she seannand described the place also they also say that it is a garbage but they are real excited because that means to dona trump has to walk into a garb shape mister trump will be bout tat the fault county jail it is a jail known for rather deplorable conditions including in a debts and excessive force and a prison population that is more than double the amount it was design to hold four people have lost their lines there in just the past few weeks anybody connected to the criminal justice system in the upland area knows that if you are ever told you got to go down to rice street brace yourself because it is on to be horrible i we can give you some details on this place now futon county jails the formal name it is known as rice street because of this a grass it opened in nineteen eighty nine but almost immediately after open it was over crowded had deploy had commissions and with just the to just a horrible place to be just last month the just i person someone excited t out intthiplace terrible it'll get jail houses safe unsanitary living conditions excessive force and vile someone y get that you to paper bag cause he is really really excited he is easily many people died at futon county jail house and true strung up there may you teach now the medial real gan i do not think that this is going to go for them exactly as they wish it you go rather mat it'll also covered the arrest and again tried to the more more in sorry than an angerootine but it did not it did not succeed officially as a now doll chop is under arrest and the state of charm i we had confirmation earlier that he had entered the jail and as o right now former present chop is in custody he has teen rest landmark moment bandit as a set before a for all the worse tridents h it is just i do not believe you rather i just do not you you seem very upset you seem supersupersuper upset he is booked on thirteen counts stemming from the efforts to reverse the georgia twenty twenty election at certification he was wearing a dark blue suit and a red tot he arrived at the foot county jail round seven thirty p m and tot jail records listed him this part their actual betting markets on what ho as can be listed afford his weight but that was assuming his eating om be weighed a here is one thing that is not true he was listed at bigfoot three inch stall and wing two hundred and fifteen pounds i dona trump is not two hundred fifteen pounds donate trump during his last physical an office clocked in it two forty his significantly heavier than he was when he when he left office six three two fifteen hush be playing tight end for the baltimor ravens i that is not that that that but bottom line is he was released on two hundred thousand dollars bail and then he a stroll out to the cameras and did what he does best the date is great in camera he really is and he knows how to play it here we go fly i the very say the o e the i ti ever happen you challenge tin election to take challenge elect of elect e o re selector town elect and i a every re too a o a any i the o ti lector berth a o the i ti e e the a e ta et any a the when you have that great freedom to challenge a to we one we we ti a telectolec i to e t to have es to we e a thing wrong i ti a thing wrong at everybody at i tee had set fort and tom and he went on along these lines from of twenty seconds than he walked away again for fore donate trump this this may be the best day of his campaign ones got yesterday today these urinal the best days of his campaign because it is obviously political in georgia and is obviously political mugshot kin first place again georgia state wads is not require a mu shot if you are a well known figure who has taken a recent photo gorge state lawrequises i rigged mu shot unless we have a recent photo of you well i may i feel we have some recent photos of donate shay true i feel that is the case they were being vindictive in going after him with the mugshot and he completely reversed on them wit what is going to be an iconic photo of him imminiis is an iconic photo on that they are few icon sort of mug shots in america history i got the very famous franks an trot mug shot y in in sort of pop political try of them martin lit the king mug shot in in hollywood terms roof multiplies you hand mugshots and and then you have obviously dona trumsmug sh and as i say just on a a pure theatrical level that mug shot is great for him it is a great image for him ain just one second we are going to get to what this means for the republican

eight four three refund to get started orcas what is all of this mean for the election will first of all it means that don from his can be spending the next year and a half in various courthouses right now his proposed to trial on georgia election interference is supposed to be an october twenty third they want to start it forthwith one ifs other to defendants as are been charge and will tart his trial october twenty third presume my trample try to push that into the middle of next year at the very least when it comes to the marloggo classified documents case that is already slated to start may twentieth of next year just before the conventions at the tail and o the primaries his manhattan d a case the one about stormy angels that one is slated to gin march twenty fifth which is literally the day before super tuesday all this is pretty obviously ut when he does election interference i mean yah it it pretty clearly is any one comes to the canary sixth case that was fix in washington d s we are still awaiting some is more in formation as to when that case's actually going to begin as large the thirteen charges that dona trump is facing he is facing one charge violation of borg to recon three charges of solicitation o violation of both by a public officer whit should presumably be him asking people to put there names on some sort of alternative elector slate which ism not sure why that is illegal actually he has one charge of conspiracy to impersonate a public officer which is a very weird charge two charges of conspiracy commit forgery in the first degree two charges of conspiracy commit falsestatements an writings one charge of conspiracy commit filing docket filing false to documents and a couple of charge on false statements and writings and filing false documents that that that is where the georgia case stand a what is this mean for the election well obviously republicans me included anybody who his conservative who looks at this and looks at what is happening in georgeow or looks what is happening on the senior sixth case in do see wit who it's happening in manhattan roll but lost on the case in florid where it is pretty obvious the dona true violated the law the best case that you can make right there is that too tillrto canton and this a political prosecution because of t double standard which again sort of agree with it is pretty obvious to every one that there is a lot of sympathy for trump on this and there should be a lot of sympathy for trump on this that he is being politically target it now he could not made it a lot harder for his political opponents you target him in the class i documents case particularly but that wouldn't have stop the other three cases which are all find up he that being the case there is am your lot of sympathy for the idea that if you nominate him there has to be a grounds well because you feel it right i feel it everybody who watches this on the right side of the my feels the sympathy for trump they yeulik well this cannot stand somebody has to be punish right as trump himself says this is entire sampan you i am your vengeance right i am your revenge this is going to be my vengeance campaign against the deep state ism n to take them out the is what true himself is saying in his statement the problem is that because we live in variasilos an echo chambers it is easy to forget t there are other voting populations that do not agree with you and do not feel the same things that you do democrat's get caught up in this regularly there is why democrats run down weird rabbit holds with regard to tracing of the children that they will take things well where i live everybody feels the same way how could anyone else feel differently an a turns out a vast majority the country feels differently then they do well it is this lives important to look at the actual data on how america feel about trump and how they feel about the indictments and how they feel to voting for trump because i understand the people want it overtime there's a pule confirmation bice is a very strung drug whenever there is a pule that confirms your suspicions your likely to cite it whenever this a pull it does not confirm your suspicions you're unlikely to city one thins i try to do here on the show is give you poles that both confirm my suspicions and also do not confirm my suspicions i me one you all the data i do not think that zero data is a substitute for some data even if that some data is not perfect at causer's no such thing as perfect at son a second ism to get into what the pules actually say about weather additional trump indictments wether mog shots with u any of this actually is going to need trump to victory in general lection against jobidon which is the thing that i care about i can use you things at once sympathize with dona trumps legal plight promote the legal funds of his of of people are being charged to to conspears with get a ell's which have done on the show and ism line wen do all that and also recognize that is he the best guy to be jobiton come next fall i well get to that momentarily first we have a dog his his name is happy and happy is a very cute haven here dog very sweet to make heads also turns out he is a protector of the virtuous the other the other day happy working up six twenty in who is barking what hell miss tog wigging up it six twenty embarking and it turns out if the is staring out are back wend out and he saw an entire road game of rack horns in the back yard there all cadet ut where mother jackets re to go and happy as i will take all of them it'll take all four of these giant floor acorns well that that is our happy and happy must be protected which is why we use rough greens for him rough greens loose happy food

life that is are you f f teens dot comslash ben to day or call eight they three my dog thirty the that is at they three my dog thirty the of case let us look at the actual data with regard to present in trump's favorability unfavorability ratings according to the latest your go polling available which you three for dago his current favorable ratings a stop he is under water by seventeen points a according to the dipsos pole bout the same time be see is dipsos in favorable ratings twenty four points under water thirty one per cent favorable rating in fact there are zero poles that i can identify that have donate true and you are clothes to even parody with regard to his favorability or in favorability rating now you compare that two jobidon who is person he'd be rung against and cordon also has terrible favorable in favorable ratings for sore they are very similar actually a jobidons favorability ratings are in the forty two to forty four per cent range some times he may reach forty five per cent trumps average right now it right now the five thirty eight average for favorabilit ratings on biding he is about twelve point three points under water donate trumps favorability ratings are about seventeen points under water he he is more in popular just on average then jobidon is be what is more important is who is on o come home right one the big questions in the selection that there really two questions turn out for your sit palfrey turn out for your side turn ut for the other side and what is people middle do jobidon believes that turn out for hoiden is driven almost entirely by the presence of donate trump on the ticket read that that deal cats do not car but you by that jo biding they fin thing e they think he stinks at best he is a mediocrity hes he is at he is a person who just can a standing there if he can even stand but they really hate donate trump now in or understand thou have to have lived in both a blue area and right area during the twenty sixteen and twenty twenty lesions i lived in californium and let me explain to people who have never lived in a blue area the level of hatred for donate trump in places californium is deeper than the level of hatred that people in aliform a have for sis it is it is it is deep and it is visceral the despises dona trump despise him which means the dey will walk across broken glass to voteagains donate trump in that that really is the reality and that is particularly true after twenty sixteen when he was definitely notes post to win s they will not willing to walk across broken glass to not against oral trump in twenty sixteen cause how's can in unknown they know quite what e was and there is a widespread assumption that hill rifling was gin a win man's heir li cannot maybe meal guy really have to get to about him and killers clan on o win and then trump one and there level of panic went high that every single one of them voted the change the voting rules obviously with the man an balls in everything else jobidon's presupposition and this has ben shown by the way by pretty much every subsequent election twenty eighteen twenty twenty then twenty one twenty twenty two had all the subsequent elections show that when trump is perceived even to be on the ballet every single person who is a democrat shows up to vote against him not was they love the democrat because they hate donate trump hate him with the fiery passion of a thousand burning sons and meanwhile in the republican areas people really really love trump and they show up and they vote for trump in really high numbers however there is a quart of people iron the ten to be ignored but the never trump folks who say they will not vote for trump under any circumstances is not a minor it is not a tiny position it is not a use position butts not a tiny position either the number of people in the democratic cat who say they one hundred cent will not show up for jobidon is a mentally non existed there's no never biting crew among the jobidons soil your looking it who is ain't come home in the democratic party the likely answer is virtually everybody in the re publican party the answer is likely ninety two per cents that eight per cent makes a difference in a very very tightelection and then you look at and and beyond that there can be some re publicans quire just not enthused with the idea of a trump bid an election again and the me you hell i i like trump and i wont be president but it is raining to day and jobidon is mad a job does not get into one animated trump gets people on the right animated and he gets people on the left animated on on trump turns outvote for his side and he turns outpost for the other side but the third factor's the people the middle the people in the middle by pulling data they break for bison there broke don in twenty twenty there is very little evidence the in a s switch back to trump now the case for trump is very easy actually the case for trump is it was better when trump was president than when bison is president the problem is that if all your in to get next year is not trump prosecuting case against jobidon and his economy and his competence and how bad a present he is the case your gin to get is it is really in just that ism being jailed by fanny will is or by the man want a plan brag or by jack smith that is a bank shot because you basically have to say that all of these people are working for jobidon and therefore it is unfair that jobidon is musing all of the people go after me and it is not is not quite the easiest argument actually fort for trump to make which presumably is why what the poles show according to the most recent pulling dad to asking the question there is a pull trump a p annual c this is circa bat a week ago we can savage more than half of america say there is zero chance of them voting for donate donate trumpeter turns the white house and twenty twenty four fifty three per cent of america told the a p anarchy cents for survey they would definitely not support him next nonmember another another eleven per cent thy they would probably not pull the lever for the fortify of president which means only thirty six per cents say they would probably or definitely support trump n his third consecutive bid for the white house it is this this connect between republican voters who think that other every thing's them and the rest of the country that is leading two trumps increase in the poles now do i think that the sign to were well for trump at overtime it tends not to at overtime what tends to have there is an opening here here is an opening for another candidate in the republican party to make the very simple in convincing case dona trump should have all of our sympathy for the legal travails he is undergoing and also he is very unlikely to be turbine that is actually the case that is the only case that you can make if your republican at this point and hope to win primaries against doll trump which raises the question of have that is to bate go we now have some data of the debate fall out is i gave you my take yesterday and my take as i suggested it is different for the take of some of the lanes inside the republican party and it is also counter for wat is worth which is one persons opinion ism to give you the data that we now have from some the poles first of all important to note a wat of people watch the debate not twenty sixteen numbers but twelve point eight million total viewers watched the debates according to the nelson ratings the first abates on twenty fifteen did twice that because trump was on the stage but thirteen million people is not bad there another one point seven million people are who watched on fox business at she look fourteen million people probably who watch the debates that is leaving aside everybody who watched on rumble or watched it another places an that that that is a fairly solid number and that's going to be a large percentage and not an insignificant per sending tor people who actually vote in the republican primaries turns out that that to bate may indeed have mattered a little bit ow ism people say well yen trumps interview it tucker carbon did two hundred and thirty million video views and and all the rest of it that again the metrics for a video view on twitter are not the same as the metric for a video view on nelson not even remotely the same nelson ratings require to watch several minutes of a thing an or if you be counted a viewer a twitter view counts as the post is in your screen more than fifty per cent in your screen for more than two seconds for two seconds or more you can be squalling andyou just art looking at the street below it and it is playing above and that counts is o view also if you reload because your connection one away which i did right is is watching the trump tucker thing i had to reload that sucker sous on a plane it'd o reload that sucker probably fifteen twenty times hand's that each one of those is a view the actual percentage of people who actually watched a significant portion of the trump tucker interview is not even remotely two hundred thirty million it is by some metrics as lot as a couple of million because again is it was not broad cast anywhere it was not it was not particularly illuminating that interview you really it's a really love trump an order really find that that stud illuminating i talked about yesterday on the so bit the trump tucker interview who is asked no serious questions an ye gave no serious answers and this entertaining but it really don't illuminate anything gay that means that maybe thedebate mattered a little bit we now have some poling data with regard to who one and and who lost the debates the washington post five thirty agent dipsos all conducted a pile before and after last night's debate according to the washington post with potential re publican primary cocks voters including those who watch the debate according to those voters not a going to ma corn the voters the twenty nine per cent who watched said that the mantis have the bestnihte the take rumasuammy came in to twenty six per cent now again my generalize takes that everybody basically accomplish what they wanted to accomplish in the debate the mantis wanted to escape fire and look percententhal vagrumasuammy wanted a mention which he got instates nickel valley outta walk down that traditional get pee can get to momentum there pens wane to sharp as legacy christy want to throw couple o punches an ship the ever trump vote it is pretty much everybody got what they wanted from thedebate but what the says actually show is that the mantis according to this pole twenty nine per cent say that he perform best which is a far cry from a lot ofthepeople who are big trump fan saying that here was terrible is awful is all that is really not with people who watched the debate said twenty six per cent said that take performed the best what is more important actually is what per centare of people say they are considering voting for each of the candidates s again this is just for get pe debate watchers for that for the people actually watched the get pee debate which you now again is twelve fourteen million people it is not the forty or fifty million people who presume lull vote in re publican primary his among the debate watchers sixty seven per cent of people say they are considering rondo cantus for president of the united states that is an up tick of about four five per centare points from where it was that actually is the number one in the field number to in the feel is trump sixty one per cent say they are considering voting for him nickel hale had by fare the biggest bump shown from twenty nine percents of people in the lethe gooey debate watchers saying they were considering voting for her to forty six per cent saying they are voting for her or would consider voting for her weak move from forty to forty six per cents we picked up some ground but not a ton he is now tied with nickel hayleans from of people who would consider voting for him in a primary that is followed by them shot at forty three percent my pence at twenty three chis crispy at twenty two and the inimitable and electric dug bertha at twelve per cent nowt when you tike a look at got primary voters just over all go pe primary voters notches people who watched the debates what you fine is that fifty one per cent say they are considering dosantus sixty four per cent say they are considering thrum and nobody else is even within remote spitting distance nickel whale's at twenty four makes at twenty three since gotta at twenty five twenty six are at pence fourteen pesty four per cent the inimitable and electric dug bertha what is that mean well means that actually the mantis got a little bit of a bump from this actually what is actually even more in testing is how the favorable and in favorable when for everybody in the field the the favor be rating for to cantus basically increase slightly and is in favorable went down slightly seventy two percent favorable twenty five per cent in favorable which makes him the highest in the re publican field donate trump is among the hope to bate watchers among job o bate watchers fifty nine per cent said that there favorable to true thirty five per cent in favorable she is plus twenty four the cantus his my mouth is corrector y mental father he is some his currently plus forty seven that those are big numbers nick valleys favorable went out pretty dramatically she is up to sixty five per can favorable twenty seven per cent unfavorable weirdly the vague because nobody had heard of him up until last few weeks actually we vacs favorable ratings went from fifty to sixty but is an his unfavorable ratings when from thirteen to thirty two he actually on net lost favorability ratings over the course of debate there is more people said they loved him be they're color people who said they did not him after watching that to bay which again make cents very polarizing performance they say for one crowd it ton ay and for one crowd was see the cantus at least gave himself a little bit of a boot from this which is again in of surprising and he maintained he maintained the biggest mover was valley it what is what is that mean for the primaries i mean you may mean very little for the primaries depending on whether any one can capitalize off the back of that and and move forward but the the notion that the resithat that

school warm who is trying to educate you on what duck is all the time it is bazar shes just big she she just starts speaking in bazar hi coolish poetry about electric busses and even diagrams i what is happening and then the bit bel wait wait wait robin's week who we should give a look at wait for at is waiver c we should give a look at comely arris this is take number eighty seven here quote i cannot get into people's heads comely arris tries to reshape her public image ahead of twenty twenty four and a political interview the vice president to dress how she views the growing scrutinies under as republicans use her as a bogy man in twenty twenty to all she is a victim again all is she sucks in er job she is up victim again that is all this crap works hasn't pretend that she is the air apparent to a to a a m an old man who e i stages joins s in such fragile health the some of the stuff that we do here at daily wire involves me cutting videos a couple o weeks in advance s that we can admit them properly and we actively con sided things if i make this video what is the turn around time on it if the turn round time is several months hand's about jordan ism not sure we can do it it might not be relevant he is her active considerations that people make in the political world based on jo bison's frailty and ailing health that of course they are trying to prop up come harridan back stage if she prepares for a not intimate fireside chad about unsafely in from of hundreds people hundreds of people the vice rent hundreds of people alleged lame explain something i can draw hundreds of people shes the vice president she be a anyway comely arris is unscripted and seemingly at ease no notes or tell a prompter insightwall slow clap for the to who does not need a teleprompter for talking toraborter back stage wow no notes even o och the i points just flow out of her water from mores's rock she is comfortable offering can knowence as in councils to those who've lost love ones to gun violence we streamed wearing redshifts and blazing with moms demandactur student tomandaction she holds their hands and looks into their eyes we speak their names she whispers to one woman that one roll looks round what she why she whispering what t she gently reassures a man clearly anxious about where to stand in the hotline all eyes are on her but that is been true of hires for a while now and the view has not often been kind yes yes she is a victim she is a victim of the fact that she as such a dramatic failure thought her and tire political career that she keeps failing up if she keeps being his bad at her job now a she has benthrogout her career eventually she will become empress she is every time she fails toxic what give we give her a higher slip it she will be better eve she is the michael moles of politics sake the worse she does at her job the morrow what we we just promoter more her ten years jobitons number two has not been known for relaxed in worse moments those in chico instead derris is turn has largely been marked by still to performance is a public events at odds with the uninhibited in trot interrogator she was known as in the senate they field lispers abut whether she will be a drag on the reeled ticket as twenty twenty four heats up now her political future and quite possibly the success of the democratic ticket hinges on a simple question is it possible for come hairs to make a second impression do you it by by second o you mean two thousand impression for arris is to question that fundamentally misunderstands the point in her mind she is the same person she was when the prevailing narrative her was that of star prosecutor a send in political twenty even the future of the democratic parties you could have followed me around an i had of twenty twenty heir said youwould have seen the same thing for years ago it is always so have been i cannot get into be other peoples had about why they characterized things as being one were another it is not as thoughi've just found myself have always been here i never went away and then the encircle s about how that is not true anyhow really she is beet it it is others around her who have failed the great leader but but really she is actually umpempathetic an sympathetic and one dress guys if this is the best you got you better pray the republicans jog democratic turn out because comely arris is a disaster area and when i say that jobiton is being a bad president i mean he is really a quite terrible president the migrant crises continues to mounts and i know that we all forget about it interment light by ta it it is still a problem according two seems news officials in new york are selling tent cities for this who cannot by place in a shelter system of more than two hundred hotels and other facilities already housing sixty thousand migrant and more than fifty thousand home as presidents in chico housing over seven thousand migrant police stations and parks have been converted into makeshift shelters planstouse asylum seekers and vacant schools have generated fervent local backlash in city sacrament and denser migrant have found themselves on the brink of homelessness in boson the arrival of thousands of families and pregnant women seeking asylum prompted the states governor to t e car in emergency a perfect storm they gan the decides news reporting has brought the historic migration crises a long is magical borer to some of america largest cities the city strugglesthouse tens of thousands of destitute migrants and they are growing calls for federal action have also placed mounting pressure the bid ad ministration to intervene local leaders have implored the ad ministration for fun and to low migrants to work legally s of they can be self sufficient cities have spent hundreds millions but serving migrants housing hemin hotels church o schools park's police stations even a national guard was the mine administration as set aside seven hundred seventy million bucks from new york chico don for bottom another cities the administration recent my ask congress for another six hundred million dollars but the administration has refrained from taking other actions re quested by local leaders such as granting migrants temporary legal status thy can apply for work ferments more quickly now what is count hilarious that nobody at these cities we will say we might do as most closed the border we could do that they will not do that obviously they'd be the would be superb cannot cannot do that instead there is stuck in the unenviable position of allowing board remain wide open and migrant s reship y the tens of thousands their cities and and then complaining they don't havenough money to deal with it here is catchy local the failing governor of new york but new york has shoulder this tired for far too long since the first migrants began arriving at the port authority bus terminal last year city an state of for tremendous sons billions to dollars and energy into helping them the city is help band helping by the state to manages and partnership with our state legislature and in our budget replicated over one billion dollars now upwards of one point five million dollars for providing shelter national hard public health transit case management and legal service as to film seekers especially of the housing that is an addition to the over one two hundred shelters at hotels that are stood up by the city of we york with the financial support from the state y they are darn the making job but now they have to now they have to beg the federal government for more money or they could actively talk about the fact that their stupid policies have generated this comment in the first place of can meanwhile seeing of jobidons failures hisdyogeis such e massed it is such a massimien to try between thanks cut sweet hartdeals with hunter bison and then getting exposed for it and that blowing up in their face and going after donate true on non chiming but to between those two things now they have added to that that they are filing a lawsuit against space acts the only truly successful space company in america the lawsuit leges there from at least september twenty eighteen to make twenty twenty two space ex routinely discouraged asileese and refuge from a line and refuse to hire a consider them because of their citizens citizenshipstatus in violation of the emigration nationality acts space ex apparently wrongly claimed that under federal regulations known as export control laws space ex could only hire out citizens and lawful prominent residents greensand holders but easily in refuse shes permission to live in work in the united states does not expire they stand on equal footing with you citizens and lawful profit residents under export control laws they're now going they are now going space acts for the great crime of discouraging people who have claimed asylum and refuse e from applying for open position because they haven't action been given a green card do not work is there they are not encouraging people to falsely claim asylum and refuge by suing companies spaces which billy has national security contracts what the federal govermenies now doing is they want people who have claimed asylum or refuge and whose cases our it sounds you the pending or being a dedicated they want those people hired by companies that do national security business this is a nutty nutty lawsuit but its designed for purpose it is they you must you must hire more refugees if you are spacacts apparently they this is that that is wild that that is a wild wasn't and of course the real reason their doing that is because he land musket of political enemy and you are not allowed to be you us get's bad you snowman you known companies are going you of their way to higher people who do not have green cards because you notes really hard to check whether somebody has leet refuge or asylum stay lot hard check he green card or a citizenship status are not but apparently you know they are lot o companies ism sure that do this spaces as the one of course that comes up musk said i think people are very confused about this during it two thousand sixteen speech s in fortunately there is not up to us if you are working on rockets acknowledge that is consider an advanced weapon sinology even a normal work fees is not sufficient unless y get special permission from the secretary defense this is not out of some desire of spaces to just hirer peoplewith green cards because we are not allowed to do anything else i think this is not a wise policy for thou us there is many towns o people all around the world we love they've work at the company unless they can some out get a green car were legally prevented from hiring some one musk added the export lost do not apply to tesla and that about twenty five to thirty person of the engineering staff of tesla was from outside the country ism jonithan go ton migration a turn he says that spaces is not bard from hiring for nationals at all but companies do have to seek certain verses for foreign nationals or obtain government approval when a comes to i c a our restrictions spasms is within its its to not pursue that path but he said the refugees should not be affected by it i t a our restrictions what if they just got it wrong i mean what at what if they just got it wrong but they have a business intensive to avoid in accidental i t or violation and be conservative but apparently now they have now bits been dissent i if they make a mistake then you are move their government contracts on and destroy their security clearance and if they and if they do not hire enough of the migrants the you want them t higher than you sue them in federal court amazing stuff from the bid do jape of can meanwhile we should comments on the fact that there are am many grave mistakes made with regard to russia first on

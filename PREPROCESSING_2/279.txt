the time he was a bread manner she was the home maker on raised two kids eventually became as school teacher and then many years later when joule wan sixty six paschal died of cancer after his death she got moral the on her work she been doing at the local anal you chapter chance to prison mail and start corresponding with several images to find out about conditions in the texts prison system which is how she first met nickel he was fifty two nearly thirty years into his prison sentence and he sent a letter that found its way to on side dear friends i am a prisoner on the east had unit of the texts prison system i came to prison with the death penalty in nineteen seventy i state on there was nothing special about michael's letter she was asking about getting involved within ti death penny work his own death sentence had been communed to life in nineteen very three and he become something of an activist in prison heavily involved in prison reformists john read his letter and dutifully wrote back then michael wrote back then john wrote and on michael an on wrote to each other almost every single day for ten years michael was self taught but his letter showed how much head read including must of john steinbok and his intellect in pressman she was constantly communicating with prisoners five to ten at a time but michael's letters stood out he was a good writer take this letter he wrote to john after he potentially injured himself cut his own a billy's tenant to protest worked to to conditions i had grown to old my body without norsisism almost as a are in a faithful companion it was after all my only refuge from the full in the stand in the scorn as i sit there contemplating the harsh last at hand i don't it crater as though i were committing the highest treason it was losing you booze looked to me he was he looked names can it just was perfect names again except that he did not have very good teeth a he had just a few teeth on the bottom i saw him an he was names cagey an mice to love names cagey in his movies but again it was not a it it was not love at first sight or anything that cause ism not that sort of person i go for the mind first and and he had a wonderful bite and we just had lots to talk about he was not all intellectual and his letters michael started using red names for jane he called her sweet baby join and other things too dear noble little squall sweet baby dearest finger looking good sweet baby dear honey but and her letters power send up his we i think it'll fix the a big scotch and go sit in the back yard and smoke a cigarette and try to get me into prospecting at i wish you were here to spank in his i every sundae after solemn drive ha few hours to visit michael in prison a book on tape playing on the car stria she saved the same fancy bet an breakfast near the prison became friends of the people who ran the place and then the rest of the week she got to go back to her own life and did what she wanted to do e was romance but on her terms something she would never experience michael and one man hog and kiss discreetly on their contact visits this was all in a public visiting room there was nothing conjugal but what was going on the limits of their time together were clear and one was happy with the arrangement i kind of to being alone it is very comfortable for a woman too no that somebody loved hair and yet she has all trays freedom to live her own life michael and one knew that no matter how close they became they would never really be together rarely if ever does a former death row in may et crawled in texts really what they had was her letters here is another one from on a song that his always torn my heart is the september son you remember in these few precious days it'll spend with you a there demand especially in our case the days are few and we may never spend them really together we must get use to this reality and not real my hers we may i love you precious mike speedy sweet baby jane so may to someonand two thus and five they got married but that was mainly that they would not use a visitation rights the prisoner had denied them visits before and they lived this way happily for five years then in tune twenty ten michael was summoned by prison authorities he walked into a room and an official came to speak to him he said a are you feel last yet he would here i got at present for you and he handed me a sheet of paper and i started reading it and i hid may e pool michael was confused just o month or before he gone before the pawl board and been denied just as he had been many times before my banjo stopped breathing for about two or three minutes i i did not really i was in at my first reaction was thus has got to be a fuck can mistake it was unheard of it somethael that happens once every ten years in prison to somebody michael has no real idea why he was proud he thinks o might have had something to do with a loss but he find against the prison system saying that it was under staffed and unsafe releasing michael made the was suit go away i think it was a surprise to both of us when he suddenly was put on the street he was scared it the thought to coming you he was not prepared for it neither one of us was really i wanted him home and i knew it was going to be hard i knew it was going to be difficult and i knew that the chances of the relationship lasting we very bad but i i had agreed to try it an do you think that you would have got into the relationship as you did into the degree that you did if you knew that he was actually gan ta get out one day i cannot answer that really do not know now with michael about to be released the contract we talked about the beginning of this story the one that laid out all the shared household in relationship duties should michael a convicted murderer ever get proud that contract was about to be put into effect the contract stipulated a two year trial period for the marriage if it turning to a real marriage fine if it did not they would be other separate ways one could fire michael or he could quit those were their words at any time nobody keeps the tactics on how long prison marriages lost on the outside but lost of prison people would tell you most end before in years o on august twenty first twenty ten after forty years in prison and ten years would on michael was a free man one was waiting for him in a part cart the prison gates wearing an ear ring michael had made for one was nervous and excited that she had not slept the night before she had a whole romantic vision for the day she made a reservation at a five star hotel michael walked out wearing his prison as shed jump so nervous and overwhelmed to be out and he did not kiss me or anything he just got into the carat said let us go it was a very unromantic meeting and that was cannot hurt me i was he lated but i was kind of bewildered i do not think you can describe it i thought he would be as warm to see me as he was in the visiting rooms were hug me and you know try to steal and extra kiss or something on no he was very business it was not wet they show in the move he sit o as comprehandsim as the contract was it did not cover everything i did not occurred to them include abying about acts a quick warning anyone listening with kids this next bit of the stories about that michael had never had sex with some one loft and forty years in prison left him pretty must up on that subject i did not expect him to be afraid to cuddle i you knot we have our clothes on and he he hugs me all day long but but get naked with somebody it makes him very uncomfortable especially the last few years i she had taken in more in more of a mother figure to me and when i actually when we got in hotel room together than i started pace in the floor i did not a and with et this red if what i mean i think what he means is their relationship ad shifted over the years and she was now seventy nine remember sixteen years older than michael whence they were in a hotel room they realized tot the nature of their feelings toward each other were really complicated over the years they would known each other one had gone from initially feeling she wanted to adopt michael to one his sleep with him to now that he was out a kind of wish mash of all this feelings he is still in adopted child and he still my best companion an i love him anis my best friend it is altogether in i ism comfortable it then o no michael moved into ones suburban ranch house and dawn's and got to know her family in france their lots of academics all sorts of people one settings he never encounter before she was surprised how well he did socially but they had their rocky moments john took michael to a wine last thing party and he got fall down drunk one had to hell him outside to avoid making a scene this happened two or three times he never really drank socially before usually just to get hammer and at parties with on he would go too far hardly to calm his nerves one of son's friends someone what been close to one's first husband pascal was appalled by her choice of a second husband and ended their friendship s a been four years since michael got out they made it way past the trial very in their contract michael still leaves the stove on and the front door open thinks he never had to think about when he was in prison he leaves this stuff lying around everywhere one says it is having a too nature in the house again but they have learned to deal with all this their lives are inter twined on somehow it is an equality of people in this marriage dead he did not have before i was still dependent upon my husband and his reputation but with mi this visits i figure i become free in some strange way the neighbors have to accept us the way we are now an know they got a criminal in their neighbor love to have out there with all his did slow and you non now that one is in her early ladies she started to wonder what is going to happen to michael when she is gone that was not in the contract on figures maybe they have got another seven years together we will have to find you another old lady to take you prospects are gone o be few and far between i find other in to garden teacher wo well really shape you up well we all pen say that we should die together know i w maybe will drive in to a freight train or get he it by an eighteen wheeler o macrashtun to like that i do i no not no id rather drowned o i within until that day whether they go out to gather r non they to watch down to baby together they go to places

get into all of that illness fear of depth they joke about it their serious about it they navigate it and it is some point in the trip john and big pull over at a roadside store that sells fireworks and tombstones may be two different people on a different road trip would not have stopped or would not have stayed if they stopped but as friends who are also comics they both head into the field of tombstone and start improvising neither of them knowing where this is going a lead and whether it is going to be funny or may be a terrible idea yes a yet do not yet hemin headstone ting explains to

definitely are a car is a classic place to realize all right ism lost the sometimes you realize that you lost you personally lost and then you get into the car and you drive as far as you can to solve that problem came spring is this story is barely about that there is this my that have known for ever his names even he is about forty a father now with two kids back in the summer of nineteen eighty nine when even had just turned sixteen his dad let him drive from sanding to central america with his older brother even was super excited it was the adventure of a lifetime he would saved up nearly a thousand dollars working after school at a roger chuck demon's brother who was twenty one at the time you parts of mexico pretty well after he would dropped out a college it seemed that he was down in a all the time he was a hard charger live with a bunch of tach who guides who look fellows you drove this kick asked red seem with no doors little wild but you'd always looked out for eve since they were little kids even was not worried could go travel with watch out for me well woren'cspanish drink beer and smoke cigarettes but there were other interesting facts about seven's brother too some of which would soon become concerns that thing that the brother was doing in bah not legal the tat too guys who looked fellows were in fact fellows and actually van's brother himself had recently been released from a short stint and county jail the older brother had anger issues he was a control free the trip mean it soft it ended badly and it ended early there was a blow out fight two drove down one flew back i was happy to get our plainingto home i can enough of the driving it had enough for my household brother and now it'd become a fight and even though we had fought before really this was the worst one there is one more important thing to know about even and his brother when they were kids they would been everything to each other superclasses warbudies because they grew up with a step father who was a real bastard violent and they moved around a lot every year a new school no friends really just each other this trip that fight it decimated their relationship the two never really spoke about the trip again did not speak much at all it is been more than twenty years i wanted to talk to even about this and how we feels about it now isn't ready know how his brother feels about this cause ism his brother o a we are we are recording you good's r i get sot me think talk about the long trip when i first suggested that we talk even was ambivalent i think you wondered my what good could come of it which is fair cause i have not been an easy guy to talk to but i had some things i wanted to say and look in this story ism not going to come off well i was a real prick and the late aides i was the first person in my family to get into college i dropped out after six months some friends let me crash with them one night i threw a party that went off the rails and three shots rang out from a see i automatic handgun the idiot that fired the gun that was me my on he evicted end i started hanging with some truly bad people we were running t e federal and coat from bah into sandbag one night there was a drug rata our house everything got flushed down the toilets before the cops got throw the door but i still got a rest of throw all of is though a still somehow had this great girl friend ere a sweep wonderful than i slept with some other drill it that got me monarda is what it got me and no girl friend i ruined much much but i could run away from almost all of it and take penacyllan for the rest i was twenty one years old a colossal mess and it'd just wanted to get my leap and drive to mexico and beyond see the temples of the affects the moon ruins i prepared to drive all the way to central america for the summer and i would take with me the one person who i was sure did not think i was such a bad guy i was dunking that bad guy anyway shallow selfish me that people hated i was ready to throw myself into something reel on this trip something important something smart before we left i removed the back seat from the leap and replaced it with a welded lock box with maybe two suit cases worth a storage space then i loaded it with the lot of books it'd always been a reader a studier and i planned for the summer was sure hang out with my brother but also to learn the language of the lock and don lions and i was going to learn to read the mental america hirogliffs i even made flash cards for myself this trip would be an opportunity for me to figure out once and for all why the moon animation disappeared he argeologis had been on the job for more than a century and still nobody knew why all these cities were abandonedbut i was pretty sure that this summer i was going to get it nailed down all answers lay somewhere in those lost cities deep in the jungle an lucky kain he was about to see every one of them plane teaching eats a too to con rush milk temple faso i can nan these things but i cannot remember them they all spleen to gather for me ans rocks crumbling and the idea of seen the ruins wasn't that was your idea why you weren't going to mexico sixteen just turn sixteen i knew there was going to be beer i knew there was gain be telexes at the tourisponse and a hopefully serf good warm wanted have no recollection of serf being on the item i i mean i do not know off we went with our high hopes such wildly different high hopes into mexico to get us to the important places where i wanted to be most days i need to drive us for stretches of six or eight hours look times ravenous wanted to stop in a village and restuff but there could be no stopping when we did pull into little towns people were curious about the two gringos who showed up in their pueblo they would asked questions and it'd tell them to mind their own business i was not some free show oddity what i was was a pretentious deuchbag who could not be bothered to interact with the common man even though was energized by being around other people and the more the married he loved it when we were in the beech towns full of america tourists and in the small villages he would fumbled through the few punish words that he knew and start these inane conversations with everybody it grated on me i was not much better on the road driving on mountain highways was freeing unnerving especially at night and lot of the time the map just to not seems to reflect the reality on the ground my punish was not great but the little phrases that i used to navigate around papa won't working for me here the dialects were different i could not understand a lot of the responses and i did not handle it well which i could not hide from cabin e was sitting right next to me as we pull away from the too you often i feel i remember that you i can't or gig's as suitable question you known just the a count of this continually watching yew the navigator asked i judo not donnas ta see dog the and and i just be like gone just asked that question two turns to go i knew we did not understand what the guy said much in my head i would just p count a foin in i can understand what he said we drove south through masablan down to port of into it was all green and jungly and full of tourists having fun i knew that i was better than them i was not here for the parasailing and the tikeila poppers i had a mission this is from my journal entry about the ruins at ashcan tillrio jury twenty second three o on p m this temple is the highest of the fifteen puff structures found here the floor of the temple structure is four feet off the ground an his reach by six narrows deep steps there is a perimeter wall that runs the circumference save for four entrance ways not equidistant the wall reaches to ten feet above the ground and has in its design symmetrical crosses as bores allay round on of the ana the e journal one hundred and ninety pages long and late in every night i wrote down all of the important memo america anthropology stuff from the trip which includes virtually note people at least no living people if you were forced to read this entire journal and then tried to de duce the importance of the even character in my life you might guess that he was maybe boy and tacostand or boy at beach number for he just did not figure into my narrative and one other thing about this journal and not sure how to say this except to just say it along the way i met some girls and if things went well with those girls then they would earn a little note at the top of the journal page for the day right about the ground break archaeological path and the note would say for example remember blank and i totally do remember blank there is that for me it was all ruins all the time we drove to the ancient molten city of tuna and visited after temples at tan aka and suntesesalia and the ruins of tale to on and bi visited i mean that we spent hours and hours at each sight while i mapped and logged every important detail while even must have been doing something in general he was a pretty good sport about it it clearly it was not his thing but what was he gong tor do how we down it this point how we getting long at this point in your recollection fine i think there would be times the we time we i was just not talk or something pretty civilly getting through any frustrations i would not have gone yet d called you names i do not think not yet every night ended the exact same way with me studying and compulsively writing notes in my journal laid into the night with the light on while even tried to sleep he complained about it constantly as if turning out the lights was more important than what i was writing i just kept writing i felt the answers that i needed could be parsed later from the details that i wrote and not an a new any way i mean in a real anther oological way i kept writing and i drew a tin too these really intricate field sketches of after and moon designs and then i mapped out all these ancient cities there was no reason for this all of the cities had already been mapped by actual archaeologists also i had at camera i took hundreds of pictures even appears in three of them it this point if you were going to write a letter your best friend a postcard your best friend about your brother what would it have said the postcard ism sure would say haven't fine travelling through mexico but my brother's pretty much in a ism getgettin kid ill probably would as time getting find of sick of him but ism sure we can get through this no the next fine place ahead one day haven met a girl about his age she was medical all i remember about hers that she spoke some english and she had a small head even introduced me and i was probably just my now himself she told even your brother as really son girl which i learned later that night means arrogant even revelled in a great many retelling of that he loved letting me know that everybody thought i was prick for some reason this particular jab from the small headed girl really hit me hard as i normally had to work a little to make people dislike me but i had not done that with her she could tell that i was an arrogant jerkin my normal resting state longeron became van's new favorite word when we argued it drove me crazy but even when even was happy he was driving me crazy now his whole cheerful surfer stoked to be around people thing it is funny though as i remember as a little kid i was the same way and second grate the teacher wrote a comment in my reportcard that said i was a bubbly student that night when our stepfather got home from the machine shop and read at i got beat he said he knew what the teacher meant that i was a loud mouth i changed we spent a few days in mexico city and worked our way such to kanaka on little coolant roads and muddy trails even suggested that maybe we should skip some of the more remote ruins and had straight for the beach and i told him no way we crossed the isthmus and over to the ruins and compact and caftan just on it seeing that even was ready to mute me we were saved by our next stop on the map and coon drinking a night life and beautiful beaches and i scuba and snoring and beautiful water cannon was amazing in those days just that corban paradise and lots of ruins but it was okay i was certain we could see and do it all i got the days in cannon might have been the best of the entire trip we were both excited to get out to the islands there was that ilia just off shore called eastlom heads which sounds great to me then you more ad i spent women we got on some sort of i just we did not bring the car we just went out there ourselves no car a fairy out there i think and then on you we got there pretty wait i want to say long day we found kind of a real quiet bar and her drinking putting down some drinks and then it was time to go up to our hotel which as a fairly meager hotel nothing fancy and i start turning in for the night and you have making notations in your journal and i it got to an argument in that hotel that night where i pretty much let my mouth fly and i said all the things i felt n with included you think you are cool you think you are much better than every one around here ism and ism sure included and that was your a fucking idiot you are fucking idiot you are fucking not as cool as you think you are and i went to the peoples on your face i went to the chicks you had chosen i went to how you treat everybody shit and you still did not get up out of that bed or stop writing in your book and it was a volcano erupting out of my mouthtime i walk not stop i would not stop and i got you grinding your teeth and standing up and you said ism going to fucking hit you if you say another word i think it was that and i course just said probably one of the slowest fuck house and that pretty much when i got a slug it to the win ad say good fat win fly backwards all talk fell when i flew back and i stood up tall but i did not hit mack i just let that mouth go someone that did not hurt do it again do it again fuck you fucking does not hurt does not hurt every sorted thing that he said in that room i knew he was right i agreed with him i punished him bad threw him into a night stand shattered a lamp up ended a bed there was blood the door was locked with the mattress we escaped out the window ran down to the courtyard outside the hotel next door was a jungle him the way i remember it my recollection you were yelling for me to get away from you you were running around the jungle him on the opposite side cause you thought i was coming back for you more and i was trying to say no o know you do not understand ism i should not a done that i i ism sorry over and over i apologized to kelvin swore it would never happened again but it was too late even was done i was one hundred present down to weave because i did have the control at that moment that was the one thing i could control i could control same i want to weave i just did not want to be with on that trip any more i just did not want to be with you any more it was not the environment we were in it was you i had told you when we got in a fight i know you remember that i says never going to be the same between us that is it it is over never going to respect you never going to be the same again you call me up i want even you don't profit that time ow say would not talked to you but i i the next day i remember your face and i knew your emotions well you were sorry and you were sad that things were not going to be the same you knew it you said i know they will not the next morning we got back on the ferry and then drove without a word to the cannon airport where we bought even a one way ticket to san dingo i continued on alone to believe and guatomalland then turned back up to mexico where i stayed for the next four years my mailing address was least od at gores just general delivery i did not have a phone was not on purpose almost nobody in the town had phones but also i did not want a phone kep myself off almost entirely from my family not just during the years in mexico but even after i returned even had been the very last person left standing in my corner and this trip at is in hindsight and like e a bridge to fix things back home to show that i was not such a bad guy instead it only proved what it'd always feared i was a bad guy what i did not know through all this time was that even actually did get over this stuff quickly pretty much as soon as he got back to sanding he had said things would never be the same but never means something different to a sixteen year old kid and i guess ism not surprised kelvin's over it he is not one of those pricks who hold to grudge ism the one who could not let it go any of it that trip in mexico for me to hit him to beat him the way that i did after the childhood we had i felt ashamed even and i had severally sat down and talked about this but i know i let him down not just in mexico long before that all through our childhood there were beatings just this violence every other day when i was nine i saw my stepfather throw kelvin face first into the sharp corner of a wall it opened up his forehead much blood even was four years old even now almost forty years later sitting in front of him i can barely stand to tell him what happen when we took him to the emergency from right off the bat stepfather saying i tripped in fell he is bleeding me to get that fixed and they asked long and she gave the company line and then they asked me and i say at i tripped in fell and it was the old brother e i had a responsibility i mean regardless of what was beaten out of me i had this responsibility i mean it it ids me now we i look at your face that you got that ism that scar is that scar's a part you that it is a part that i wish i could forget i bad and and we would go visit dad every other week and and he would ask and i would not say anything i just i would not do it and then our dad did not know what our stepfather was doing to us you until one weekend when heaven was nine heaven had been beaten badly and he must have said something to dad i do not i d i do not know i was not there i don't what you said well you were there you were there we are going to dad an cats on cove die dit and catchy was not there he took a little bit different way we are on a more sonic rout from wake side i the six i remember the sunset in the mountain road and i i remember i had just told him that oh ye i got beat for leaving the pain you and then after getting beat an told to come back out in the living room i spent about forty seconds feeling sorry and train to a normal that that forty seconds past pigs did not pick up the paint again and i got beat again for not picking up the paint and it just was i was this electric lick the electrical cord mid fit that time it was back on the knees to the middle of the back the only thing that it took to get us out of that bad situation was for somebody to speak up for me to tell my dad mi real dad the truth about our life at home but i was too afraid to say anything i said nothing and this fact more than most any other makes me hate myself as i was the big brother it was my responsibility to speak up to protect heaven instead he is the one who stood up he is the one who told her dad and heat called see play he called the police they took polaroyds in a room of my bear ass and back and and we sat around at table and said the police meant asked as i want you would a name every time you have been beat that was the table there on cove drive that dinner table and we looked a each otherwise oh do you have a while and for years after that conversation for years may be package i thought of what i had forgot to tell that kind oh i never mention that time and i know right away that i had not mention that just it would hoping to mango i did not mention that telling kelvin that i was sorry about the fight in mexico that was one thing talking about the stuff that happened when we were little but i did not do apologizing for not protecting him as a kid that is what i really needed to say to him but the past twenty years it'd lived half an hour from heaven he invites me to stuff all the time i do not go and ism not much of an invited i do not see him much or the rest of the family either our past is always held me back have got a lot of regret i kind of sad to hear that you have much remorse her it i do not blame you for it and i do not blame you for being older and should have known better that is something out long time ago and id do not want you to a be tortured by you re passed i hope i have not done anything to continue the torture your loved ism a different person the all than i wasn't twenty one mostly it took a long time to get my caress state but ism still not a guide s con to start a conversation with you on an elevator and it'd rather you did not either also i waited a long time but ism married now i have a daughter who is nine and a son who seven they have a very different life than h one even

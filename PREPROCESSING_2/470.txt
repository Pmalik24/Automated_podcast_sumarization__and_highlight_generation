welcome to the supermen latmoncens of science science tace to ace i menderhubermen and om a professor of neurobiology and of theology at stamforend school of medicine to day we continue our discussion of the senses and the senses we are going to discuss or pain and pleasure pain and pleasure reflect two opposite ends of a continuum a continuum that involves detection of things in our skin and the perception the understanding of what those events are our skin is our largest sensory organ and our largest organ indeed it is much larger than any of the other organs in our body and it is an odd organ if you think about it it has many functions it acts as a barrier between our organs in the outside world it harbors neuron's nerve cells that allow us to detect things light touch or temperature or pressure of various kinds and it is an organ that we hang ornaments on people put earrings in their ears people decorate their skin with tattoos and inks and other things and it is an organ that allows us to experience either great pain or great pleasure it is a must defected organ and it is one that our brain needs to make sense of in a mufti faceted way to day organ a discuss all that and most importantly how you can experience more pleasure and less pain by understanding these pathways we will also discuss things you can do and if you wish things you can take that will allow you to experience more pleasure and less pain in response to a variety of different experiences before i go any further when a highlight a particularly exciting area of science that relates to the skin and to sensing of pleasure an pain but has everything to do with motivation motivation is something that many people struggle with not everybody but most people experience dips and piques in their motivation even if they really want something how shall we think about these changes in motivation what do they reflect well at a very basic level they reflect fluctuations changes in the levels of a chemical called dopamine most of us have heard of dopamine dopamine is a negro modulator meaning it modulates or changes the way that neuron's nerve cells work most of us have heard that dopamine is the molecule of pleasure however that is incorrect dopamine is a molecule of motivation and anticipation to illustrate how dopamine works i won a highlight some very important work largely carried out by the laboratory of a guy name wolfram shots the shot laboratory has done dozens of excellent experiments on the dopamine system and have identified something called reward prediction error although in some sense you can think about it as reward prediction variance changes in the levels of dopamine depending on weather or not you expect a reward and whether not you get the reward someone make this very simple roaming is released into the brain and body and generally makes us feel activated and motivated and as if we have energy to pursue a goal and it is released into the brain in body anticipation of re reward measurements of dopamine have e made in animals and humans andwhat you find is that when we anticipate a reward dopamine is released we will put in the work to achieve that reward that work could be mental work or physical work but when the reward arrives dopamine levels drop back down to be line that is right when we receive a reward dopamine levels go back down to base line the way to invasion this as you can just imagine a sort of increase in dopamine as we anticipate something reworking towards it were working towards a goal were excited about seeing somebody or meeting somebody ere receiving some award reward and then the reward comes and dopamine goes down now that is all fine and good but there is a way to get much more dopamine out of that process and therefore a way to have much more motivation energy and focus because those are the consequences of elevated dopamine the way to do that is to not deliver the reward on an expected schedule experiments have been done where there is an anticipation of reward there is work and then the reward only arrives every other or every third bout of work case this would be getting a pat on the head ah if you're a dog or a perhaps a child or an adult or getting a monetary reward only for every third project or every third race that you win pick any kind of goal it does not matter these molecules do not care about what your pursuing they are a common currency of different types of activities that is a regular reward schedule and it will not alter the pattern of dopamine release than i describe before however if the reward arrives intermittently almost randomly you anticipate a reward as a maybe it might come it might come then you work workworkwork work no reward you receive the work work work work work work and then you get a reward some trials you do some trials you do not and it is completely random under those conditions the amplitude the amount of dopamine that is released into your system and the motivation to continue working hard or playing whatever kind of game your playing doubles or triples and this is the basis of things slop machines and gambling and this is why many people will give much of their money up to casinos and the casinos always win sometimes people walk away with more money than they came to the casino with but the that is majority of the time the house wins as they say and it is because they understand intermittent reward schedule and you can apply this to stay motivated in your own pursuits rather than thinking about the pleasure of a reward understand that dopamine is released in response to anticipation of a reward and that is the fuel for work and every once in a while at random remove the reward that is the way to continue to stay motivated not to reward every action or every goal and this is also true if your trying to train up children or train up players on a teem you should not celebrate every win i know that the little counter intuitive were gong to go more into the biology of dopamine and how it relates to the pleasure system later on in the podcast but for now understand intermittent reward schedule harness the biology of dopamine in ways that can allow you essentially infinite motivation over time before i go any further i want to acknowledge that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i the thank

element you can go to element element e calm slash superman let us talk about pleasure and pain i think we all intuitively understand what pleasure and pain are pleasure generally is a sensation in the body and in the mind that leads us to pursue more of whatever is bringing about that sensation and pain is also a sensation in the body and in the mind that in general leads us to want to withdraw or move away from some activity or interaction let us not always the case some people actively seek out pain some people somehow cannot seem to engage with or experience pleasure but most people operate on this basis of pleasure and pain scientists would call this appetitive behaviors meaning behaviors that lead us to create an appetite for more of those behaviors and aversive behaviors behaviors that make us want to move away from something the simplest example that would be putting your hand near hot flame at some point there would be a reflex or a deep desire to withdraw your and tasting something delicious in general makes us want to eat more of that thing interactions with other people that we find delicious also make us want to interact with those people more none of this is complicated or sophisticated this is simply to illustrate the fact that pleasure and pain tend to evoke opposite responses opposite behavioral responses and opposite emotional responses how does that come about well it really comes about by an interaction that starts at one end of our body meaning our skin and the other and of the organs of our body which is deep within the brain let us consider these two ends of the spectrum of pleasure and pain and what they contribute to those experiences of pleasure and pain the organ that we call the skin as i mentioned earlier is the largest organ in our body and throughout that organ we have neuron is little nerve cells now to be really technical about it and the way i you to understand it is that the called cell body meaning the location of a cell in which the liana and other goodies the kind of central factory of the cell that actually sits right outside your spinal cord all up and down your spinal cord on either side are these little blobs of anurans lo collections of anurans they have a name you to know for you if ta sonatas or those who are curious they are called d arms dorsal root ganglia a gangland is just a collection or clump of cells and those d arms are really interesting because they send one branch that we call an axon a lo wire out to our skin also to our muscles an to our organs but here were talking out the skin they send a wire out to our skin and that wire literally reaches up into the skin it is actually in our skin and they have another wire from that same cell body that goes in the opposite direction which is up to our brain and creates connections within our brain in the called brain skim what this means is that the neuron in your body that we call the diary that sends a wire an ax on to sends what is going on in your big tow and then sends another acts on in the opposite direction into the base of your brain that is the largest cell in your entire body of any kind catcall muscle cell nerve cell et camera the extremely long cells thing an be a meter or more depending on how tall you happen to be we have these cells that have wires that go off in to different directions and the wire that is within our skin will respond to any number of different categories of stimuli ora these wires are position within the skin to respond to mechanical forces may be light touch some will only send electrical activity up toward the brain in response to light touch meaning if you press on the skin really hard they do not respond you stroke the skin lightly with your finger tipper a feather and they respond very robustly others respond to course pressure to hard pressure but they will not respond to a light feather for instance others respond to temperature they will respond to the presence of heat or the presence of cold or changes in heat and cold and still others respond to other types of stimuli certain chemicals on our skin many of you probably experience the sensation of eating a hot pepper well i do not recommend doing this but were you to take will slice of holopanio or other hot pepper hub narrow pepper or something that and rub it on your skin you would actually feel something at that location and that is because that pepper does not just create a sensation within your mouth it will create a similar sensation on your skin these neurons are amazing their collecting information of particular kinds from the skin throughout the entire body and sending that information up toward the brain and what is really incredible just want you to ponder this for a second what's really incredible is that the language that those neurons use is exactly the same the neuron that response to light touch sends electrical signals up toward the brain the neurons that respond to cold or to heat or to habanera pepper they only respond to the particular thing that evokes the electrical response i should say that they only respond to the particular stimulus the pepper the cold the heat et camera that will evoke an electrical signal but the electrical signals are a common language that all turns use and yet if something cold is presented to your skin an ice cube even if you do not see that ice cube if your eyes are closed or so one comes up behind you and puts an ice cube begins your bear skinned back that that sensation that thing is cold you do not misperceive it as heat or as a habanera pepper toque that is amazing what that means is that there must be another element in the equation of what creates pleasure or pain and that element is your brain your brain takes these electrical signals and interprets them partially based on experience but also there are some innate meaning some hard wired aspects of pain and pleasure sensing that require no experience whatsoever a child does not have to fall down but once to know on that first fall that hurt they do not have to touch a flame but once and the very first time they will withdraw their hand from the plain no prior experience is required other things prior experience is required for instance if you are somebody that has a intense attends aversion to spicy foods that is probably because you have tasted spicy foods before likewise if you really sweet foods it is probably because you have tasted them before you can start to make predictions based on prior experience but the pain and pleasure system do not need prior experience what they need is a brain that can interpret these electrical signals that can take these electrical signals and somehow create what we call pleasure and pain out of them what parts of the brain well mainly it is the called sematisensery quarter the portion of our neoquartex which is on the outside of our brain the kin of bumpy part not kind of if you have a normally form brain it will be bumpy if you have a smooth brain that is not good some animals just have a smooth brain hutments have a bumpy brain which means i has a very large surface are in those bumps are cause you squeezed it a pitzaand clump and you bunch it all up and put inside the skull that is good heme you've a lot of neurons and in your somatisansry cortex you have a map of your entire body surface that map is called a homunculus and if we were to titular quarter and lay it out on a table a vocally done this with the cortices of various animals and humans included what you would find is that there is literally a map of your entire body surface but it would not look exactly you this map would be very distorted why would it be distorted well certain areas of your body have a much denser innervation as we call it or put simply many more of these sensory wires from these dearies within your skin this map of you that exists in your brain and you do have one of these on each side of your brain see if two these maps to homunculus that is you it is your representation of touch in clouding pleasure and pain and in that map your lips are enormous and your back is very very small and the area round your eyes and the area representing your face is absolutely enormous you would look some sort of odd weird clay doll from some sort of bazaar late night animation thing and just imagine the psychedelic experience of that character of you and that is what it would look but it is not randomly organized to the contrary it is highly organized in a very particular way which is that the areas of your skin that have the highest density of these sensory receptors are magnified in your brain it is sort of having more pisses in a certain part of a camera than others and in doing that allowing higher resolution in this case of touch not a vision but of touch sensation in certain parts of your body what are the areas that are magnified well the lips the face the tips of the fingers the feet and the genitals and this map of you has very large lips face tips of fingers bottoms of feet and genitals and that is because the innervation the number of wires that go into those regions of your body far exceeds the number of wires for sensation of touch that go to other areas of your body you can actually experience this in real time right now by doing a simple experiment that we call two point discrimination two point discrimination is your ability to know whether or not two points of pressure or far apart near each other or you actually could perceive incorrectly as one point of pressure you might want a second person to do this experiment here is how you would do it you close your eyes that person would take two fine points do not make them two sharp please it could be two pencils or pens or the backs uppers two pends of holding in my hands if your justlisteing to this unjust holding two pens y favorite pends these pilot we fives or vest sevens which i love if you were to close your eyes and i were to take these two pens and put their points c out together about a centimeter apart and present them to the top your hand moan do that now to myself you even though your eyes were closed you would be able to perceive that that was two points of pressure presented simultaneously to the top of your hand however if i were to do this to the middle of your back you would not experience them as two points of pressure you would experience them as one single point of pressure in other words your two point discrimination is better is higher on areas of your body which have many many more sensory receptors you are more sensitive at those locations now this makes perfect sense once you experience it or you hereabout it however most of us do not really appreciate how important in what in profound influence this changing density of receptors across our body surface has and we can go a step further and describe another feature of the way that your built and the way that you experience pleasure and pain which is called the dermatome the dermatome is literally the way in which your body surface is carved up into different territories much a map of the united states is carved up into different territories of states and counties et camera the dermatome is the way in which neurons connect to different parts of your body now you have actually experience the dermatome before the dermatome is when you have a neuron the connects to particular area of the body and that neuron does not just send one little wire out one little line and go up into the skin to detect mechanical or thermal or chemical stimulus it actually sends many branches out a tree but remember those branches of the tree come from one single neuron now occasionally what will happen is you will experience something cold or heat or cain or tingling on a patch of your body and occasionally that patch of body will actually have a very cleanly demarcated boundary of very stark boundary with the areas around it a good example this would be the hurry simplex one virus which if one has this virus and i should mention that somewhere between eighty and ninety percent of people have this virus this is not a sexually transmitted virus this is virus that transmitted very easily between people ah through various forms of contact nonsexual contact its present in children its present and adults and most people get it some get symptoms and some do not some get recurring symptoms some do not when you talk about that at the end if you but this virus lives on what is call the fifth cranial nerve also call the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve sends branches out to the lips to the eyes and to certain portions of the face for those you a e listening if is kind of put my right hand across my face and is or simulate the three branches the try seminal aspect of this nerves of try three now when the hurries virus flayers up as they say in response to stress or other factors the virus flames that nerve and people experience tingling and pain on the nerve sometimes they will get a cold sore or a blister on their lip or near their mouth sometimes he'll get a collection of those and that is because that dermatome is actually inclined now other people will experience something shingles right it is a fairly common viral infection and what they will notices they will get a rash that has a boundary it is they'll get a bunch of bump sometimes blisters and will have a sharp boundary that boundary exists because the virus exists on the nerve and it actually is boundaries with the neighboring area a the body that is receiving in put from another nerve and that one does not have the virus living on it any time you see a rash or a pattern on the body surface on the skin that has a pretty stark boundary chances are that is an event that is impacting the dermatome have experience this before and not through herpisimplex but through the experience of having a lot of blood sort of aggregating and a kind of a segment across the front of my face who as really bazaar looked in the marinithat what is going on here was having an allergic reaction to something i had eaten and that large it reaction clearly was effecting one of the nerves and therefore the dermatome and what it shut up as was almost one had drawn lines on my face that said okay this rash or this reaction rather can happen here but not in the air region right next to it whenever you see that chances are it is a reaction of the nerves of the dermatome you will tart to see these things more and more when you start to look for them ah you do not always have to have a viral infection to experience the sometimes you will just experience tingling or even a pleasant sensation and it will be restricted in kind of a strict boundary on one location of your body surface and not another not corresponding to an organ o ka this arm or ah just your feet or something that but just a segment it is almost some one outlined a particular prefer body's surface that is the dermatome orcas you have got censors in the skin and you have got a brain that is going to interpret what is going on with those censors in fact we can take an example of a sudden rash or inflammation at one location the dermatome and we can ask what would make it hurt what would make it worse what would make it go away and believe it or not your subjective interpretation of what is happening has a profound influence on your experience of pleasure or pain there's several things that can impact these experiences but the main categories are expectation for weather not you thought or could expect that this thing was going to happen right if some one tells you this is gin a hurt ism going give you an injection right here it might hurt for a second that is very different in your experience of that pain will be very different than if it happens suddenly out of the blue there is also hangs sixty how anxious or how high or low your level of a arousal autonomic arousal that is con impact your experience of pleasure or pain how well you slept and where you are in the called circadian or twenty four hour cycle our ability to tolerate pain changes dramatically across the twenty four hour cycle and as you can imagine is during the daylight waking hours that we are better able to tolerate we are more resilient to pain and we are better able to experience pleasure at night are threshold for pain is much lower in other words the a mount of mechanical or chemical or thermal meaning temperature stimuli that can evoke a pain response and how we rate that response is much lower at night and in particular in the hours between two a m and five a m if your on a count of standard circadian schedule and then the last one is our genes pain threshold and how long a pain response lass is in part dictated by our genes and later i am going to discuss this myth or whether not its really myth as to whether not certain people in particular redheads people who have regimented heir and a fair skin whether not their pain thresholds differ and to just give you sneak pick into that indeed they do and it is because of a genetic difference in a particular gene and a particular pattern of receptors in the skin that are related to the pigmentation of heron skin we have expectation anxiety how well wee slept where we are in the called twenty four hours circadian time and our genes let us talk about expectation and anxiety because those two factors can powerfully modulate our experience of both pleasure in pain in ways that will allow us to dial up pleasure if we and to dial down pain if indeed that is what we want to do let us talk about expectation and anxiety because those two things are somewhat tethered ore now a number of solid experiments both in animal models and in humans the point to the fact that if we know a painful stimulus is coming that we can better prepare for it mentally and therefore buffer or reduce the pain response however the timing in which that anticipation occurs is vital for this to happen and if that timing is not quite right it actually can make the experience of pain far worse here i am summarizing a large amount of literature but essentially if subjects are warned that a painful stimulus is coming there subjective experience of that pain is vastly reduced however if they are warned just two seconds before r that pain arrives it does not help it actually makes it worse and the reason is that they cannot do anything mentally to prepare for it in that brief to second window similarly if they are warned about pain that is coming two minutes before a painful stimulus is coming electric shock or a poke or cold stimulus or heat stimulus that is pretty extreme that also makes it worse because there expectation ramps up the autonomic arousal the level of alertness is all unfold toward that negative experience that is coming how soon before a painful stimulus should we know about it if the goal is to reduce our level of pain and the answer is somewhere between twenty seconds and forty seconds is about right now ism averaging across a number of different studies but if you have about twenty seconds or forty seconds advance warning that something bad is coming you can prepare yourself for that but the preparation itself and the arousal that comes with it the kind of leaning in o we on either going to relax myself or ism going to really kind of dig my heels in and can of meat the pain head on that seems to be the optimal window this can coming useful in a variety of contacts but i think it is important because what it illustrates is that it absolutely cannot be just the pattern of signals that are driving from the skin through from these degrees these morons that connect o skin the dictates our experience of pain or pleasure there has to be a subjective interpretation component and indeed that is the case let us talk about the range of pain experiences and from that we will understand better what the range of pleasure experiences are that different people have because we are all different in terms of our pain threshold first of all what is pain threshold pain threshold has two dimensions the first dimension is the amount of mechanical or chemical or thermal stimulation that it takes for you or me or somebody else to say i cannot take that any more ism done but there is another element as well which is how long the pain persists it'll just describe myself for example i do not consider myself somebody who has a particularly high pain threshold it do not think it is particularly low either but i would not consider myself somebody that has a particularly high pain threshold when i stub my tow against the corner of the bed it absolutely hurts but one thing that have noticed is that i have very sharp in flections very high inflections in my perception of pain and then they go away quickly i do not know if that is adaptive or not its probably not but my experience of pain is very intense but very brief other people experience pain in a much kind of slowerrising but longer lasting manner end to just really point out how varied we all are in terms of our experience of pain let us look to an experiment there been experiments done at stamford school of medicine and elsewhere which involved having subjects put their hand into a very cold that of water and measuring the amount of time that they kept their hand in that water and then they would tell the experimenter very quietly how painful that particular stimulus was on a scale of one to ten can likest scale for youficionatos that simple experiment revealed that people experience the same thermal in this case cold stimulus vastly different some people would rate it as a ten out of ten extreme pain other people would rate it as barely painful at all a one other people a three other people five et camera now what is interesting is that the same thing is true for experience of a hot painful stimulus under and twenty degree hot plate we have to put your hand on it and then at some point you remove your hand some people are able to keep their hand on there the whole time but people rate that experience as very painful a bilobate painful or moderately painful depending on who they are now that is interesting probably not that surprising however but what is very interesting is that when the same experiment was done on medical doctors or medical doctors in training they too of course experienced pain through a range of subjective experiences some of them just any other person off the street said a particular stimulus of a particular temperature was very painful other said it was an painful at all and some said it was moderately painful and that turns out to be vitally important for the treatment of pain because pain is not an event in the skin pain is a subjective emotional experience you may have heard that we have a particular category of these dearies that enervate the skin which are called no susceptors music sector comes from the word nose nose i believe it is which means to harm however no susceptors do not carry information about pain they carry information about particular types of stimuli impacting the skin and then the brain assigns a value a valance to it a label and says that is painful and where people draw the line between not painful and painful varies now because physicians are people and because physicians treat pain what we know from a lot of data now is that if some one comes into the clinic and says their experiencing chronic pain or whole body pain or acute pain after an injury or one location does not really matter what the cause is or even if there is a cause at all how the doctor reacts to that report of the patient's pain will dictate in many cases the course of treatment and of course doctors their goal is to treat the patient according to the patience needs not their own and that is what good doctors due however it is been found and i think now there is work being done to try in change this but if a doctor has a a very high threshold for pain there interpretation of somebody ease's report of pain is going to be different they might not discount the nation right this does not leisurely mean that they think oh this person their pain is irrelevant probably not in fact from having a high threshold for pain if some one comes in and says ism in extreme pain that doctor probably thinks wile this has to be really really extern but they can be talking about two different experiences similarly if a physician has a very low threshold for pain and some one comes in and says ism yet experience on and pain in my back have got the static a thing but t it is yards o obit uncomfortable it is a aunt a four out of ten well that physician might interpret that four out of ten as a pretty extreme sense of pain or a pretty extreme experience of pain and you can start to see how the subjective nature of pain can start to have real impact on the treatment of pain because treatment of pain is carried out by physicians in fact there is no objective measure of pain we can ask how long somebody can keep their hand on a hot plate bring a cold bath you can do serious experiments of they even have some extreme experiments where they will am shave a portion of the leg and they will put on a a very painful chemical compound and see how long people can tolerate that these are very uncomfortable experiments as you can imagine but in general we do not have a way of measuring somebody ease's subjective experience of pain there is no blood pressure measure there is no a tartrate beats terminate measure of pains one of the great efforts of our science and of medicine is to try and come up with more objective measures of pain similarly pleasure is somethingtha we all talk about that feels good or i love that or more of that please or less of that but we have no way of gaging what other people are experiencing except what they report through language and this is really just to illustrate that this whole thing around pain is not a black box we do have an understanding of the elements their elements in the skin there is elements in the brain there is expectation anxiety sleep and genes but that it is very complicated and yet there are certain principles that fall out of that complicated picture that can allow us to better understand and navigate this acts that we call the pleasure pain acts rather than focus on just the subjective nature of pain let us talk about the absolute qualities of pain and the absolute qualities of pleasure that we can learn how to navigate those two experiences in ways that serve us each better first of all i want to talk about heat and cold we do indeed have censors in our skin that respond to heat and cold and for any of you that have entered a cold shower or a cold body of water of any kind or ice bath et camera you will realize that getting into cold is much harder if y you do it slowly now despite that people tend to do it very slowly i have noticed an enormous variation with which people can embrace the experience of cold i noticed it because i do some work with at leads an i do some work with military and i do some work with the general public and one of the best tests of how somebody can handle pan is to ask them to just get into an ice path it is not a very sophisticated experience but it really gets into the core of the kind of circuitry that were talking about both in the skin and in the brain some people regardless of sects regardless of age and regardless of physical ability can just get into the cold that somehow able to do it now i do not know at their experience of the cold is and neither do you you only know your experience but they are able to do that some do it quickly some do it slowly others find the experience of cold to be aversive that they somehow cannot get themselves in they start quaking they start complaining and many of them just simply get out they cannot do it some do not even get in pass their knees this is not necessarily about pain threshold but it is related to that i think it can be helpful to everyone to know that even though it feels better at a mental level to get into the cold slowly and people ask awful when i get in slowly an when to take my time it is actually much worse from a neurobiological perspective the neurons that sens cold respond to wat are called relative drops in temperature it is not about the absolute temperature of the water it is about the relative change in temperature as you move from a particular temperature whether nods in the air next to an ice bath or cold shower or from a body of water that is warm to a body of water that is colder or sometimes in the ocean you will notice it is warm and then as you swim out further you will get into a pocket of waterworks much colder that is when the cold receptors in your skin start firing and sending signals up to your brain therefore you can buy path these signals going up to the brain for with each relative change one degree change two degrees change et camera by simply getting in all at once in fact it is true and maybe you have been told this before and it is true that if you get into cold water up to your neck it is actually much more comfortable than if you are half way in and half way out and that is because of the difference in the signals that are being sent from the cold receptors on your upper torso which is out of the water in your lower torso now i would not want any one to take this to mean that they should jump into an unknown body of water there all sorts of factors currents and if it is very very cold yes indeed you can stop the hart people can have heard attacks from getting into extremely cold water a a melted mountain tree ah that is been frozen all winter or been very very cold or as a snow pay going into it if very cold you can indeed have a hartattact please be smart about how cold and what bodies of cold water you happen to put yourself into but t is absolutely true that provided it safe getting into a cold water is always going to be easier to do quickly and is going to be easier to do up to your back infant you each you want to get your shoulders submerge there number of other things you can do if you really want and it is safe to do you can put your face under and activate the called dive reflects which also makes the tolerance of cold easier believe it or not its very counter in fugitive it is getting into cold water faster and more completely you will experience as less uncomfortable less cold and indeed that is the case and that is because these cold receptors are measuring every relative drop in temperature every single one is grated as we say impolicy it is not absolute as an additional point if you are sitting in a body of cold water and it is not circulating you will notice that you start to warm up a little bit or even if you feel your freezing cold if you move and that water around you moves of course then you will notice it is got even colder and that is because there is a thermal layer you are actually heating up the water that surrounds your body a a halo around every aspect of your body a sort of silhouette of you of heat where your heating that water when you move you disrupt that thermal layer now heat is the opposite heat and the heat receptors in your skin respond to absolute changes in temperature and this is probably because our body and our brain can tolerate drops in temperature much better than it can tolerate increases in temperature safely when you move from say a standard outdoor environment ism in here in the states we measure in terms of ferenheight maybe it is a seventy five or an eighty degree even ninety degree day and you get into a hundred degree sand or if you are in a cool air condition building in you go outside in it is very warm outside you for feel the heat hits you all at once boom hits you all at once come a a slap in the face but then it will just stay at that level your body will acclimate to that particular temperature however if that temperature is very very high you will notice that your experience of that heat and your experience of kind of pain and discomfort and your desire to get out of that heat we will tend to persist you do not really adapt in the same way and certain people who are really good at handling very hosanna get better at this you learn to calm your breathing et camera lower your autonomic arousal obviously do not want to let your body temperature go too high because dean's cook they die if neronstigh they do not come back that is bad many people unfortunately harm themselves with heigperthermia every one has a different threshold for this but ah in general you do not want your body temperature to go up too high that is why a fever of a under and three starts to become worry some under and for you really get concerned if an it goes up into that range or higher that is when you need to really cool down the body or get o hospital they can cull you down heat is measured in absolute terms by the nu runs gradually moving into heat make sense in finding that threshold which is safe and comfortable for you or if its uncomfortable at least resides within that realm of safety that is heat and cold and those are sort of non negotiable you can try and lower your level of arousal in fact many people who get into a cold shower on ice bath i think the recommendation that i always give is that you have two possible approaches to that you can either chine relax yourself kind of justest calm within the cold or you can lean into it you can actually take mental steps ah to generate more adrenaline kind of meat the demands of that cold and at some point will do a whole episode on how to use cold and heat ah to certain advantages we have done a little but o this in past episodes ah using the cold to supercharge human performance and things of that sort but in general cold is measured in relative terms and therefore getting in all at once is a good idea provided you can do it safely and heat is measured in absolute levels by your brain and body and therefore you want to actually move into it gradually its the kind of the inverse of what you might think one of the most important things to understand about the experience of pain and to really illustrate just how subjective pain really is is that our experience of pain and the degree of damage to our body are not always correlated and in fact sometimes can be in opposite directions a good example this would be ex was we all occasionally get ex rays at least in the you ask we get ex rays when we go to the dentist from time to time and the occasional early might be safe depending on who you are provide you re not pregnant et camera have gone to the dentists you know thy put you in the chair that cover youth the lead blanket and than they run behind the you the screen to protect themselves and they beaming with the ex rays to get a picture of your teeth in your jaws in your skull et camera well if you were to get too many ex rays you could severely damage the tissues of your body but you do not experience any pain during the ex ray et self in contrast you can think that your body is damaged and experience extreme pain and yet your body can have no damage a classic example this was published in the brutish journal of medicine in which a construction worker fell from i think it was a second story which he was working and a nail went up and through his boot and he look down and he saw the nail going through his boot and he was in absolute excruciating pain they took him to the hospital and because the nail was long and because of where it had entered and exited the boot they had to cut away the boot in order to get to the nail and when they did that they reveal that the nail had passed between two of his toes it had actually fail to impale his body in any way and yet the view the perception of that nail entering is boot at one end and exiting the boot at the other was sufficient to create the experience of a nail that had gone through his foot and the moment he realized that that nail had not gone through his foot the pain completely evaporated and this has been demonstrated numerous times people that work in emergency rooms actually see variations on this not always that extreme but many times what we see and how we perceive that wound or that of vent has a profound influence on how we experience pain and i mention this not just because it is a kind of sensational and fantastic example of this extreme subjective nature of pain but also because it brings us back to this element which is we do not know how other people feel not just about pain but about pleasure we we think we do we have some general sense of whether not an event ought to be painful or pleasurable but actually we barely understand how we feel let alone how other people feel and we can be badly wrong about how we feel meaning we can misinterpret our own sense of pain or our own sense of pleasure depending on what we see with our eyes and what we hear with our ears we hear a scream a shrill scream and we think it must be pain and if we look at something that is happening as somebody in it fits a prior category or prior representation of what we would consider painful stimulus well then we think that there an extreme pain but actually they might not be in pain at all now this highly subjective nature of pain and the way in which we use our visual system to interpret other people's pain and our own pain has actually been leveraged to treat a very extreme form of chronic pain and it is an absolutely fascinating area of biology in nor science and it is one that we can actually all leverage toward reducing our own levels of pain whenever we are injured or believe it are not even in chronic pain to describe this area of science requires a kind of extreme example it want to be clear that even if you do not suffer from this extreme example there is relevance and a tool to extract for you extreme example is that of an amputated digit meaning one of your fingers or your toes or of an amputated limb people that have digs or limbs that are gone missing from an injury or surgical removal will often have the experience that it still there the called phantom limb phenomenon now why would that be well when you remove a particular finger or limb obviously that finger in limb is gone and the dorsoroot ganglia neon that would normally send a wire out to that particular region of the body that wire is no longer there because that portion of the body is no longer there and in some was see those neuron die almost always but not always however the map your called homunculus their representation of yourself in the brain is still there and this map the called homunculus map that you have in that i have is very plastic it can change and as a consequence areas of the map that are adjacent to one another can actually start to invade other areas of the map for instance there are negro imaging studies that have documented that somebody that has ay a complete removal of their left arm the representation of their left arm still exists in the quarter and experimentally if one is to stimulate that area of the quarter that person and if that person were you would experience having that arm that it were being stimulated even though it is not there now some one who has an amputated arm does not need to have their brain stimulated in order to have the experience of that phantom limb being present in fact many people who have limbs that were amputated feel as if that limb is still present even though obviously it is not an no matter how many times they look to the stump and just see a stump somehow it does not reorganize that homunculus called central brain map now that would be fine you might even think that would be better better to think you have the arm there than to feel as if it is missing and yet many people who have amputated limbs report phantom limb pain they do not feel that the arm is just casually drape next to them they feel as if it is bunched up and it is an extreme pain an fact this cant of contorted a a stance that i am taking right here my chair is not unlike the way that these patients described this they feels if its can of cramped up its very uncomfortable for them now an absolutely creative and you could even say genius a scientist by the name of ramachondron that is actually his last name a his complete name is a obit more complicated you all almost always a heromachandron referred to as romachondron or v s rmachandron because his full name is villa your subromanian romachandron lot of letters in their lot of awe's but romachondron is a negro scientist a trachea colliguemine when my lab was formerly at the university of californium sanding s done a lot of work on this phantom limb phenomenon and romachandron actually started off as a vision scientist and he understood the power of the visual system indicating our experience of things pain and pleasure and what he developed was a very low technology yet negro scientifically sophisticated treatment for phantom limb it consisted of a box literally a box that had mirrors inside of it and the patient would put the intact hand or limb into one side and obviously they could not put the impute limb into the other side but because of the configuration of the mirrors it appeared as though they had to symmetric limbs inside the box and then he would have them look at that limb and move it around and as they would do this they would report real time movement or i should say real time perception of movement in the phantom limb this is absolutely incredible but makes total sense when you think about the call top down or contextual modulation of our sensory experience remember its anticipation its anxiety its interpretation of what is happening that drives are perception of what is happening and as he would have these patients move their intact limb to a more relaxed position the patience would feel as if the phantom limb were relaxing and this was used successfully to treat phantom limpkin in a number of different people it didn't always work and you can imagine sometimes it might be a little tricker for a lag although there have been leg boxes that have been of developed and arrange for this purpose and what was remarkable is that they could finish these experiments and have the patient the person enter a state of relaxation reduce the pain in the phantom limb and it would stay there even though of course as they exited the mirror box they would go about their life and use their intact limb for its various purposes i love this experiment because it really speaks to the subjective nature of pin and pleasure it speaks to the power of the visual system what we see just the nail through the dude experiment what we see profoundly impacts or experience of pleasure and pain in this case pain now there's another aspect to the phantom limb experience and of these maps the called homunculus maps in the quarter that romachondron worked on which has very interesting and reveals the degree to which these maps are plastic or canchange in response to experience turns out that because of the locations of different body part representations within these maps certain parts of our body that normally we do not think of as related can start to create merged experiences what do i mean by that well romachondron described a patient who had a somewhat odd experience of having lost their foot they actually had their their foot amputated about midway up the chiles lower lower portion of the calf and foot i do not recall what the reason was for having it removed and fortunately for this patient they did not experience pan in that portion of their body but rather they confided in him that whenever they would have sex they would experience their orgasm in their phantom foot in admit ion to in their genitals of course and romachondrin understood the homunculus map and he understood that this was because the representation of the foot within the homunculus actually lies adjacent to and is somewhat interdigitate with it actually kind of merges with the representation of the genitalia now that is a weird situation and yet you now know that the density of enervation of the feet and the genitalia as well as the lips in the face are actually the highest sensory enervation that you have in your entire body and this speaks to i think a more important general principle for all people of the experience of pleasure or pain which is that an aspect of our pain or pleasure can be highly localized right it can be because of a caught to a particular location on the body or can because it can be because souse me of a fall injury or a a kind of bruise on one side of our body and yet our experience of pleasure and pain can also be an almost a body wide experience and yet it is always most rich it is always most heightened in these regions of our body that have dense sensory enervation we experience pain and pleasure according to local phenomenon receptors in the skin and this homunculus map that has all these different territories but because of the way that those territories are related this kind of wild example of somebody experiencing orgasm in their phantom foot speaks to the larger experience the more typical rather experience that i should say that all people have which is that pleasure can be body wide or we can experience it in our face are the bottoms of our feet and other areas of the body that we experience pleasure and similarly with pain and that brings us to the topic of whole body pain not just localized pain as well as whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure there are a number of examples of whole body pain that people suffer from and one common one is called fiber myalgia i want to just first share with you a little bit of medical insight a few months back i didn't instregram live with doctor than hackie who is an eddy medical doctor and a pity at stamford school o medicine that was recorded and placed on my instergram if you on a check it out we can provide a link to that in the shoots doctor hackie is the chief of the division of pain at stamford school of medicine he is a scientists to studies pain and he treats patience dealing with various forms of pain whole body pain fibromialga acute pain et camera and he shared with me something very interesting which is that any time you here or see the word syndrome that means that the medical establishment does not understand what is going on a syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that point in a particular direction or some general set of directions about what could be going on but it does not reveal a true underlying disease necessarily it could be a aggregative diseases or it could be something else entirely and i want to make sure that i emphasize the called psychosomatic phenomenon i think sometimes we hear psychosomatic and we interpret that is meaning all in one's head but i think it is important to remember that everything is normal whether not pain in your body cause you have a a gaping wound and you are emerging out of that wound or whether or not its pain for which you cannot explain it on the basis of any kind of injury it is all normal saying body brain or psychosomatic its it is kind of irrelevant and i hope some day we move pass that language psychosomatic is interesting there was a paper that was publish in twenty fifteen and then again in twenty twenty a different paper focused on these called psychogenic fevers or psychosomatic effects i just briefly one a mention this because it relates back to pain these studies have shown that therefore areas of the called palmists which integrates and filter sensory information of different kinds and within the brain stem an are called the d m h and i can also provide a link to this study if you that shows that there is a true neological basis there are brainareas in circuits that are related to what is called psychogenic fever when we are stressed and in particular if we think that we were injured or that we were infected by something we can actually generate a true fever it is not an imagined fever it is our thinking generating and increase in body temperature and this has been called psychosomatic its been called psychogenic but it has a neural basis c when we hear condom and a nation comes in to a clinic and a says that they suffer for instance from something which is very controversial frankly chronic fatigue centrum some physicians believe that it reflects a real underlying medical condition others do not however centrum means we do not understand and that does not mean something does not exist fire myalgia or whole body pain for a long time was written off or kind of explained away by physicians end scientist frankly my community as one of these centrums it could not be explain however now there is what i would consider and i think others would in should consider firm understanding of at least one of the basis for this whole body pain and that is activation of a particular cell type called plea and there is a receptor on these plea for those of you that wont to know called the to for receptor and activation of the to for receptor is related to certain forms of whole body pain and fire miasma now what treatments exist for fire miasma and even if you do not suffer from fire miasma even if you do not know any one who does this is important information because what am about to tell you relates to howl you and your body which is you of course can deal with pain of any kind and there are actually things that one can do and take that can encourage nerve health in general in other conditions diabetic neuropathy but in all individuals there are clinical data using a prescription drug this is work that actually was done by doctor machine colleagues the drug is called nail treason now freestone is actually used for the treatment of various a opioid addictions and things of that sort but it turns out that a very loose i believe it was a one tenth the size of the typical dose of now treason has been shown to have some success in in dealing with an treating certain forms of fire male and it has that success because of its ability to bind to and block these to for receptors on plea miso this called condom or the thing that previously was called a centrum fire amalgam actually has a biological basis it was not just in patient's heads and i really tip my hat to the medical establishment including doctor machinothers who explored the potential underlying apologies of things fire miasma and are starting to arrive at treatments now ism not a physician of a professors om not prescribing anything you should tact o your doctor of course if you have fiberalgia or other forms of chronic or whole body pain to explore whether or not these logos now recon treatments are right for you but i think it is a beautiful case study if you will not a case study of an individual patient but a case in study of linking up the patient self report of these experiences and using science to trying to establish clinical treatments there is another treatment or i should say there is another approach that one could take and again ism not recommending people do this necessarily you have to determine what is rite and safe for you cannot do that there is no way your situations very far too much and it would be outside of my wheel house to prescribe anything but there is a particular compound which in the united states is sold over the counter and in rope is prescription it is one that have talked about on this podcast before for other purposes and that compound is a seal el carnations sealed carnations as i mention is by prescription in most countries in rope and the guess you can buy this over the counter there is evidence that acedalel carnations can reduce the symptoms of chronic who body pain and other certain forms of acute pain at dosage is of somewhere between one to three and sometimes four grams per day now sealed carnations can be taken only its found in five hundred telegram capsule as well as by injection by injection in the states in the united states that is also requires a prescription or requires a prescription i should say the over the calender forms are generally capsule or powders those apparently do not require a prescription there are several studies exploring a seal carnations in this contact as well as for diabetic neuropathy and what is interesting about a sedately carnations is its one of the few compounds that is intuit used for the treatment of pain but has also been shown in certain contacts to improve parietal nerve health generally and for that reason its an interesting compound have also talked about a seal carnations on here previously because it has roast effects on things sperm motility and health including the speeds at which sperm swim how straight they swim turns out that swimming a for sperm a is more efficient if they swim straight as opposed to those a those kids an on the swimming there banging up against the lane lines and zexagging all over the place it does turn out to be the case that the a quickest rout between any two places as a straight line and the the good sperm know that and the less good sperm i do not seem to know that and a sealed carnation seems to facilitate straight swimming trajectories as well as speed of swimming and over all sperm health and there is evidence from quality were reviewed studies showing that elsedael carnations supplementation can also be beneficial for woman's fertility in ways that it affects perhaps we do not really know the mechanism health and status of the egg or egg in plantation there are large number of studies on a sedate carnations you can look those up on pulled if you or on examined to cam there are some studies that i do not think ore included there which are particularly interesting one that i just would to reference om the last a the last name of the first author is ma ma davit m a h d a v i the title of the paper is effects of l carnations supplementation on drum inflammatory markers and metrics metal predates enzyme in females with n onto are tortious this is a randomize double blind placebo control pilot study that showed really interesting effects of short term supplementation of a seal carnations longer term the effects were less impressive it is pretty interesting that this compound has many different effects how could it have these effects well it appears that its having the effects through its impact on the called inflammatory coda kinds if inflammatory cidakinds for those of you the do not know are secreted by the immune system in response to different stresses physical stresses mental stresses to food that you eat that is not good for you ha the called hit sugars yes will increase in inflammation am if there invested too often er in amounts that are too sighing quantity things interlunar one data things s reactive proline things interlunar six intern can six as kind of the generic in inflammatory marker that all studies refer to and yet there are other interlucans please note that there are other interlucans interlucrn ten that are anti in inflammatory ceremony system can secrete inflammatory molecules to deal with wounds and stress an things and in the short turn that is good and in the long turn that is bad and it can secrete anti in inflammatory side o kinds i fallen and these matrix metalliprodiases at kind of a mouthful but these matrix metalliprodiases are very interesting any time you see a s e ace that is generally in enzyme which means that these compounds in this case these matrix metalliprodiuseis are used to break down certain elements around wounds and scoring which might tell a bad thing but in some cases is good because it allows certain cells gleam cells call microgly to come in low ambulances little paramedics and clean up wounds scoring an inflammation is a kind of a doubled sort it can be good but too much scoring if it contains a wound too much does not allow the inflammation of cell types to move in and take care of that wound in heal it up it appears that ell carnations is impacting a number of different processes both to impact pain and perhaps and i want to underscore perhaps but there are good studies happening now perhaps celery wound healing as well as long as we are talking about acute pain and chronic pain and supplementation and non prescription drugs at least in the united states that people can take to deal with pain of various kinds i be remiss if i did not mention the two that i get asked most often about which are amative and s adanosal methionine which is sometimes called say e both of those have been shown to have some impact categorized on examine as notable impact on various forms of pain due to osteothoridus or due to injury of various kinds indifferent subject population men women people of different ages et camera say e in particular as been interesting because it is been shown head to head with drugs naproxin and other drugs of that sort which are well established and sold over the counter in the us to work at least as well as some of those compounds at certain dosages but it is also been shown that same and some of those things take more time in order to have those effects in fact head to head with things naproxin have been shown that they can take up to a month in order to have the pain relieving effect now whether not that makes them a better choice or a worse choice really depends on your circumstances i am certainly not recommending that anybody take anything but i do think its interesting and important to point out that things amative things say e have been shown under certain circumstances to be beneficial for pain and they are outside the realm of prescription drugs d i think this is a growing area of some people call them supplements some per ill call them neutrasuticles boat the end of the day these are compounds that effect cellar processes in the more that we understand how they effect those cellar processes as we now do for things steal alcarnatine i think the more trusts that we can put into them or the more to which we might want to avoid them because of some of the sideeffects are contraindications that those compounds could have if you are interested in those other compounds i do invite you as i always do to check out examine dot come but also to do you research on those compounds by simply putting them into guggle or putting them into robbed which would be even better and if you argon a going to pulled if your gan start playing scientist with i do encourage you to do i would encourage you to focus read abstracts but if you can if the studies are freely available i realize not all of them a freely available to try and read those studies at least to the extent that you can there is a particularly nice study that you might look at that was publish in to any ten in pain medicine which is knew at all k e why an a n which looked at the safety and efficacy of dilatory augmenting sulfate on lumbar disk associated radio rediculopathy not laughing at the condition its a painful condition a that describes a it is a kind of a range of symptoms that relate to pinching of nerves the spinal columns i was laughing at my pronunciation of it that particular study is quite good and the conclusion of that study that they drew was that there were limited side effects and that dietary augmenting sulfate is safe and efficacious for treating an alleviating pain in inland improving quality of life in lumbar disassociated pain however there were very specific dosage wretch regimens souse me that were describe there and duration of treatment and you should not take anything that i say or that study to men that you can just take the stuff willing neliarit any concentration of course a or dose you always want to pay attention to what the science says a that paper fortunately is freely available on line and we will also provide a link to that study for those of you that are interested in say e and its usage for the treatment of various types of pain and perhaps other benefits a number of companies have stop making say e in stead what they're now focussing on is what they think is a better better or more big available alternative which is five methyl tetrohydrophulate or five dash m t h f this molecules it necessary for converting homosistine to methionine which is then converted to say e rather than taking say e directly the ideas to take something that is upstream of say e and make more say e endogenously available this is a different strategy have talked about the strategy before for increasing other things growth hormone et camera there is always this question of whether not in trying to increase the amount of a particular molecule in the body whether or not taking that specific molecules the best thing or working a further upstream as its referred to a working on the precise or increasing the levels of the precursor is the better way to go a it appears that this five m t h f a is the strati that people are now taking in place of taking say e directly anotherwords of taking this in order to get elevated levels of say e now i to turn our attention to a completely non drug non supplement related approach to dealing with pain and it is one that has existed for thousands of years and that only recently has the western scientific community started to pay serious attention to but they have started to pay serious attention to it and there is terrific mechanistic science to now explain how and why acupuncture can work very well for the treatment of certain forms of pain now first off i want to tell you what was told to me by are director or chief of the pain division at afford school medicine doctor chon magic which was that some people respond very well to acupuncture and others do not and the challenge is identifying who'll respond well and who will not respond well now when i say will not respond well that does not necessarily mean that they responded in a negative way that it was bad for them but it does appear that a fraction of people experience tremendous pain relief from acupuncture and others experience not at all or very little to the point where they have to seek out other forms of treatment the science on this is still on going here is actually an excellent paper published on this in the journal of he america medical association one of the prefer medical clinical journals and it basically reinforce the idea that you have responders and non responders a number of laboratories have started to explore how acupuncture works and one of the prefer laboratories for this is chufas lab at hazard medical school huh is spent many years studying the pain system and a system that is related o the pain system which is the system that controls our sensation of itch just as a brief aside about itch itch and pain are often associated with one another i was recently in texts and i will tell you they have some mean mosquitos their small but whatever there injecting into your skin well here i am talking now about my subjective experience to paint whatever they injected into my skin felt to me my the most extreme mosquito bites have ever had not while they were biting me not while they are injecting the venom but boy do those than mosquitos make me itch how do they do it well their venom creates little packets of called history that travel around those pacts are called master sells little pay kits of his coming that go to that location and make me and presume leu want a scratch those mosquitobites i scratch in you scratch yours but we both scratch are mosquitobites and when we do that the histamines a release that gets red and inflamed and they itch even worse it is they get the inflammation is actually caused by the history well that experience of inflammation and pain and itch is what we call a pure genic experience ora we have pain which is no subreption essentially i know that the pain if hi sonatas always gall upset cause they say oh there is no such thing as a pain receptor it is no susceptive receptors and pain is subjective experience yes i acknowledge all that but for fluency let us just think about pain is a certain experience an itch as a separate experience but they often exists together because those mosquitobites were what i would call painful or at least not pleasant they j din just itch they were also painful eats because itch brings with it inflammation and inflammation often brings with it pain relief but it can also bring with it the sensation of pain itch in pain are two separate phenomenon it was actually discovered through a really interesting phenomenon that relates to something that is actually consumed in supplement form which is this tropical begum its actually a been called mount burins that is m u c u and a that is one word p r u i e and ass mcunapurins is a bean it is is begum that this been is ninety nine percent el dopa it is dopamine or rather it is the precursor to dopamine and people by the stuff and take it over the counters ways to increase their levels of dopamine it does make you feel really dopamine out mean it makes you feel lute high and really motivated and really energetic a lot other drugs that will do that i do not necessarily recommend taking micunopurians i personally do not taking it does not make me feel good i crash really hard when i take it but on the outside of this been is a compound that makes people itch of they remove this when you take it in supplement form in fact its usually in capsid form but the outside of this bean is a hairy ben i and those little hairs contain a compound which was actually used to study and identify these itch receptors in the skin we do not have me to go into all the details of itch but it is pretty interesting that you have these compounds out in nature that can make us itch inside them they have dopamine and this is really weird but plant compounds are really powerful do not let any one tell you that because somethings from a plant or in herb that it is not powerful there are very powerful plant in her compounds mcunapurience being one of them with dopamine on the inside an itchy stuff on the outside now what is this all have to do with acupuncture well chufumaslab has not just identified the itch pathway this peridogin says their called which cause itch and the pyrogenic phenomenon of itch being separate from pain his lab is also studied how acupuncture cause is relief of but also can exacerbate pain now the form of acupuncture that they explored was one that is commonly in use called electroacupuncture this is not just putting little needles into different parts of the body these needles are able to pass an electrical current not magically but because they have wire going back to a device cops electrical current here's what they found is a public as as a study excuses me publish in the journal neuron sell presstornal excellent journal very astringency what chufuma's lab found was that if electracupuncture is provided to the abdomen to the stomach area it creates activation of what are called the sympathetic ganglia these have nothing to do with sympathy in the emotional sense has to do with the stress response simply just means together it activated a bunch on neurons along the spinal cord and the activation of these neurons involves nor a adrenaline and something called en p i her appetite we the long and short of it is that stimulating the abdomen with electracupuncture was either anti inflammatory or could cause inflammation i could actually exacerbate inflammation depending on whether or not it was of low or his intensity now that makes it up very precarious technique and this may speak to some of the reason why some people report relief from acupuncture and others do not however they went a step further and stimulated other airs of the body using elector acupuncture and what they found is that stimulation of the legs of the hind limbs as its called in animals and the legs in humans caused a circuit a normal circuit to be activated that goes from the legs up to an area of the base of the brain called the d m v not the much which i mentioned earlier but the d in v you go the d no which is a miserable experience for most people forgive me t no employs but lets be honest most people do not enjoy going the d no as a patrons but we have to we go the d m v and low intensity stimulation this electroacupuncture of the hind limbs activated the d n v and activated the adrenal glands which citatopurcidnes and cause the release of what are called catacolamenes and those were strongly anti and lavatory in other words electroacupuncture of the legs and feet can if done correctly be anti an lavatory and reduce symptoms of pain and can we think accelerate wound healing because activations of these catacomb mantric pathways can celery wound healing as well the take away from this is that while there are thousands of years and millions of subjects involved in explorations of elector acupuncture and acupuncture western medicine is starting to come in to this and start to explore underlying mechanism now for those of you that love acupuncture a and a real proponents of it it is worked for you you might say what why does western medicine never need to come into this why should thy even be exploring this but we should all be relieved that they are because what starting to happen now is that as the mechanistic basis for this is starting to come to light insurance coverage of things acupuncture is starting to emerge is well and this is in contrast to other therapies for which there is a lot of anecdotal evidence but very little mechanistic understanding one example of that would be later photonic modulation the use of layers of different o different types really to treat pain and to accelerate wound healing a lot of people claim that this can really help them however most places at least in the states will not cover this with insurance or do not perform this in standard clinic and the reason is the underlying mechanism is not known ism not going to get into the arguments about whether not mechanistic understanding should or should not be required in order to have insurance coverage of things hat work that is not what this is about and that act would be a boring discussion because a ism shouting in a tunnel through you and i would not be able to hear you shout back no matter what your stands on that is but just trust me when i say that i am both relieved and delighted to hear that excellent medical institutions stamford or starting to think about a electuracupuncture and how it can work that places hazard medical school are starting to explore this at a mechanistic level and i do believe that there is an open mindedness that starting to emerge for instance there national institutes of health not only has a institute for mental health and canceresearce and and i institute but now complementary health the called and i en c c i natural institutes of complementary health that is exploring things cellectyour acupuncture meditation very supplements and things of those sort i do think that were entering a new realm in which things pain and pain management will be met with more openness by all physicians at least that is my hope please take that into consideration right now the mechanistic evidence for later photobiomodulation is not strong one of the major issues or the barriers to that is that most of the studies that are out there were actually paid for by companies that o build devices for lay is a later photobiomodulation and we really need independent studies funded by federal institutions that have no biased or financial relationship in order to gain trust in whatever data happen to emerge there is a technique that at one time was considered alternative but now has a lot of mechanistic science to explain how it works and it does indeed work for the treatment of chronic and also for acute pain and that treatment is hypnosis in particular self hypnosis my cold get stamford in fact my collaborator doctor avid speak are associate chair of psychiatry has devoted his professional life to developing hypnosis tools that people can use to help them sleep better focus better stay motive ate et camera while most people here hypnosis and they think o this is stage hypnosis people walking around chickens or being forced to laugh or fallasleep on command et camera this is completely different in all that this is self hypnosis and there are now dozens if not more quality were reviewed studies publishing excellent journals done by doctor special and others at other universities it really all has to do with how self hypnosis can modulate activity of the prefrontal quarter and related structures the insula the preverbal quarter is involved in our executive function as it is called are planning or decision making but also how we interpret context what the meaning of a given sensation is and that is extremely powerful son a remind everybody that the currency of the brain and body has not changed in hundreds of thousands of years it is always been dopomean creatine an glutamate gala tostostronestrogen what is change are the contingencies the events in the world that drive whether r not we get an increase or decrease in testosterone or estrogen the events in the world that dictate whether or not we get an increase or a decrease in dopamine believe me the events that drove those increases and decreases were very different even a hundred years ago than they are now and as we create new things and societies change et camera they will continue to exchange information in the same currency whishes dopamine ceratonan and all these other normodulators and chemicals hypnosis takes advantage of this by allowing an individual you if you to change the way that you interpret particular events and to actually experience what would be painful as less painful or not painful and that is just the example of pain hypnosis is powerful for other reasons to it actually can help rewire neral circuits that you do not experience as much pain that you can sleep faster focus faster this is all sounding very fantastical well it is supported by data the data are that when people do self hypnosis even brief self hypnosis of ten or fifteen minutes a few times a week maybe even return to that hypnosis by just using a one minute a day hypnosis they can achieve significant and often very impressive degrees of pain relief in chronic pain whether not that chronic pain arises through things farbormaalgia or through other sources if you want a check this out there is a wonderful zero cost resource that is grounded in this work it is the a revery doc calm are e we e or i dot cam there you can download a zero cost a for applephones or for enjoyed phones and there are variety of different hypnosiscripts these are actually self hypnosis scripts and you will actually here doctor avid feel talking to you he can teach you about hypnosis and how it works there links the scientific studies at that web address that i gave you before reverie not come you can see the various studies in the various right ups related to those studies and how this all works and their simple protocols you just click on a tab and you listen to the self hypnosis and it will take you into hypnosis and several of those hypnosiscripts have been shown clinically to relieve certain patterns of chronic pain it is a powerful tool and i encourage you not to right off the non drug non supplement tools as less than powerful because indeed many people experience tremendous relief from them and of course they also can be combined with drug treatments if that is right for you or with supplements and things of that sort to treat pain if that is right for you again elector act puncture now often supported by insurance not always but often great mechanistic data starting to emerge hypnosis terrific tool there is even the self hypnosis tool that one can access through the zero cost a reverie and lots of great clinical data and scientific mechanistic data their her imaging studies showing the different brainier is are activated in hypnosis called default network cain wear your brains is and of idols and the different circuits that are active at rest shift with hypnosis and shift long term in ways that positively conserve you and then these things lays or photobiomodulation still more or less in that experimental medical community shows a western medical communal not certain but hopefully there will be data soon and hopefully those data will point to mechanisms that allow the insurance companies and other a sort of medical bodies to a to support them if indeed they have a mechanistic basis i just want of briefly touch on a common method of pain relief that speaks to a more general principle of how things electroactu puncture and also some of these new emerging techniques of and of active tissue relieve and this principle that you here lot about in sports medicine now that when you have pain or injury at one sight that you should provide pressure above and below that sight you may have seen this a in the olympics which is on going now a where people will put tape on their body at certain locations oftentimes that the logic or what their saying is that this is design to create relief in a joint or in a limb that is below the tape not necessarily under the tape but above below fer icing if there's pain in ones shoulder sometimes it will put it on the the trapezius mussier of things that sort turns out that there is a basis for this because of the way that these different nerves run in from the skin and from the muscles up in to the spinal cord and into the brainstorm providing pressure on one nerve pathway can often impact another pathway and the simplest and most common example of this is one that we all do instinctual or intuitively even animals do this ah this is something that in the text books is all is called the gait theory of pain levelled by mesa and wall con of classic theory basically we have receptors in our skin the called sea fires there as just a name for these a little wires that come from a particular class of dares that is very thin that brings about certain kinds of nocisceptor information i want us a pain information but then that the pain people be are not their pain people sometimes there pain because what they tell me is there are not pain receptors o tho canosisceptors that information comes in through the sea fires and what happens when we injure something well provided that we will not damage it worse by touching it oftentimes what we will do is we will rub the source of pain or the location in which we were experiencing pain and it turns out that is not a a and useful thing to do when we rub our skin or our ariorinarea or we provide pressure near by it we activate the called a fibers the bigger a wires and neurons the enervate meaning they jut into that area of skin and those a fibers the ones that respond to mechanical pressure actually are able to inhibit those sea fires the ones that are carrying that called pain information rubbing an area a providing pressure above or below an injury actually provides real pain relief support for the location of that injury or that pain because of the way that these different patterns or these different times of turns interact with one another when i say it inhibits it i do not mean that it shouts at it what it does it releases its literally on that vomits up a little bit of a narrow transmitter called gala and galas a narrow transmitter that inhibits it quiets the activity of other neurons and its acting as kind of an analgesic if you will its acting as town form of drug that you make with your body to quiet the activity of these pain or on rubbing a wound provided it does not damage the wound worse or providing pressure above or below typically its above a particular injury can have a real effect in relieving some of the pain of that injury and some people speculate this is through fascia or this is through other a bodily organs and tissues and it might be organ to do a whole episode on cassias extremely interesting tissue but right now it seems that the main source of that pain relief is through this a fiber inhibition of these sea fibers called mesa and ballgame theory of pain if you to look it up and learn about that further now let us talk about a phenomenon that has long intrigued and perplexed people for probably thousand of years and that is red heads you may have heard before that red heads have a higher pain threshold than other individuals and indeed that is true there is now a study that looked at this mechanistically there is a gene called the m c one a gene and this m c one argent incomes for a number of different propenes some of those propenes of course are related to the production of melanin this is why red heads often not always but often are very fair skin sometimes have freckles not always and of course have red hair some people are really intense gingers not psychologically or emotionally tents that perhaps that too but meaning their hair is very very red others it is a lighter reds of course there is variation here but this gene this m c one argent is a social with a pathway that relates to something that have talked about on this podcast before during the episode on hunger in feeding and this is p o m c to m c stands for pro olio mañana cortex and p o m c is cut up its cleaved into different hormones including one that enhances pain perception this is malanacite stimulating hormone and another one that blocks pain data in orphan now if you listen to the episodes on testosterone and estrogen and the episodes on hunger in feeding some of these molecules will start to ring a bell things mañana stimulating hormone relate to pigmentation the skin relate to sexual arousal et camera but turns out that in red heads the because of the fact that they have this gene this m c one argent the p o p o m c proopio milanicorton that is cut into different hormones malanacite stimulating hormone and another one bad in orphan data an dolphin should guys to the fact that this is in the pain pathway that orphans are in endogenously made mean made within our body opioid they actually make us feel numb in response to certain kinds of pain now not completely numb but they numb or reduce our perception of pain because of they the ways in which they are released from certain brain cents will talk about those brain centers in a moment it is really interesting is that this study showed that the presence of these hormones is in everybody we all have mana corban for we all have bad an orphans we all have to m c et camera but red heads make more of these indogenists in orphans and that is interesting it allows them to buffer against the pain response i have a personal anecdote to share with you about this red head and heighten levels of pain tolerance phenomenon obviously ism not a red head i do not die my hair but a my partner for many ears was a red head and still is a red head should bright r end hair and had that since since childhood well we had the fortunate experience of becoming friends with wimholf and family they actually came out to visit us and did a series of seminars in the area this was in twenty sixteen as i recall and my partner she had never done an ice bath she had never done any kind of real cold water exposure experience before but is one particular gathering as is often the case when comes around there was an nice bath and a number people were getting into this thing this is actually before a dinner event and i for most people who have never done an ice bath getting in for thirty seconds or a minute is tolerable but take some effort take some will power and take some overcoming that that pain barrier cause it is a little bit painful not a lot some people can stay in longer three minutes five minutes without much discomfort what was incredible is that without any desire to compete with anybody else my partner red head got in to the ice bath and just sat there for ten minutes in fact tit will not pent she has con turn to me and said i do not really feel pain ism not really in pain and women loved this whim that i was grey thought is the most terrific thing in the world than he got back in the ice bath and they became fast friends and i think they are probably still fast friends in any event that is an and of one what we call an anew data example a anecdota is not really a term that we should use too much cause it is a and of one anecdotes are just that they are just anecdotes but it is been described many times in various clinics that were by anesthesiologist by a observation of coaches et camera that redheads a men and women who are redheads seem to have this higher pain threshold and it does seem to be because their body naturally produces ways to counter the pain response they produce their own indigenous spirits now this of course should not be taken to mean that redheads can tolerate more pain and therefore should be subjected to more pain all it means is that their threshold for pain on average not all of them but on average is shifted higher than that of other individuals and it remains to be determined whether r not other light skin light haired individuals also have a heighten level of pain threshold and i should mention because i mention the ice bath that of course pain threshold is something that can be built up and provide you do that safely n ways that are not damaging your tissues because of course pain is a signal that is design to help you to keep from harming yourself but provided the you can do that in a way that safe and does not damage your tissues increasing your pain threshold through the use of things ice baths is something that really can be done it has a lot to do with these contextual or top down modulations of the experience you can tell yourself that this is good for me or ism doing this by choice or whatever it is you could distract yourself therefore a huge number of different ways that one could do that one of the more a interesting ways for which there are actually really good scientific data come from my college show mac's lab and that actually looked at how love and in particular the experience of obsessive love could actually counter the pain response not just in redheads but in everybody that study it'll just briefly describe it involved having people come into the laboratory and experience any one or number of different painful stimuli but they it selectively recruited subjects that were in new relationships for which there was a high degree of infatuation much that the people could not stop thinking about or communicating with that new partner ah up to eighty percent of their waking time which is a lot that constant obsessing about that partner was correlated with it was not causal necessarily but was correlated with the ability to sustain higher levels of pain than people who were in more typical non obsessive a forms of love longstanding relationships where there was not long a obsessive love rather and of course in this study there were lot of good control groups they included a distract they included people obsessing about other things their pet et camera they included other forms of love and attachment but it does seem that certain patterns of thinking can allow us to buffer ourselves against the pain response and that should not be surprising certain forms of thinking are associate with the release of particular normodulators in particular dopamine and dopamine it may seem is of the thing that underlies everything but its not dopamine is a molecule that is associated with novelty expectation motivation and reward we talked about this at the beginning of the episode that it is really the molecule of expectation and motivation and hope and excitement more than its associate with the received of the reward well dopamine is coursing throughout the brain at heightened levels and coursing throughout the body at heighten levels when we fall in love this probably some has some adapt of mechanism that insured pardoning between people or who knows may be it insured not bonding tumultiale people nobody really knows a how dopamine functions a in terms of perbonding but it is known that when people fall in love new relationships create very high levels of dopamine and that probably the mechanistic basis by which these people were able to buffer the pain response by thinking about their partner or this new relationship that therein almost obsessively or obsessively now that raises a deeper question we should always be asking abut how how well the dopamine system can have powerful effects on the inflammation system and it does not do this through mysterious ways it does this by interacting through the brainstorm and some of the neurons the enervate the spleen and other areas of the body that deploy cells to go combat infection inflammation and pain and the ways in which dopamine can modulate pain and in this case this particular study transform our experience of pain maybeven to something that is pleasureful is not mysterious its really through the activation of brainstemnerons that communicate with areas of our body that deploy things immunecells for instance we have neurons in our brainstorm that can be modulated by the release of dopamine and those neurons in the brainstorm control the release of a munecells from tissues the spleen or organs the spleen and those a muncells can then go combat infection we have heard before that when were happy were better able to combat infection deal with pain deal with all sorts of things the essentially makes us more resilience and that is not because dopamine of some magic molecules because dopamine affects particular circuits and tells in a very nerbiological way in a bile chemical way tells those cells and circuits that conditions are good despite the fact that theirs pain in the body conditions are good you're in love or conditions are good you want to be in this experience or conditions are good this is for a greater cause that your fighting or suffering for some larger purpose all f that has existed largely in the realm of psychology and even motivational literature in this kind of thing but there is a real mechanistic basis for it dopamine is a molecule that can mind to receptor cites on these brainareas those brain areas can then modulate the organs and tissues of the body that can allow us to lean into challenge and those challenges can be infection it can be physical pain it can be a long doubts of effort that are required of us and i think a many people have described the feeling of being newly in love as a heighten level of energy a capacity do anything i mean that conte whole concept of a muse is one in which some individual or some thing either imagined or real enters our life and we can use that as fuel and that fuel is chemical fuel and that chemical fuel is dopamine and it really does allow for more resilience and can even transform the experience of pain or what would otherwise be pain into an experience of pleasure long those lines lets talk about pleasure with all the cells and tissues and machinery related to pain you might think that our entire touch system is design to allow us to detect pain and to avoid tissue damage and while a good percentage of it is devoted to that a good percentage of it is also devoted to this thing that we call pleasure and that should come as no surprise pleasure is in just there for our pleasure it serves an adaptive roll and that adaptive roll relates to the fact that every species has a primary goal which is to make more of itself otherwise it would go extinct that process of making more of itself sexual reproduction is closely associated with the sensation and the perception of pleasure and it is no surprise that not only is the highest density of sensory recaptures in and on and around the genitalia but the process of reproduction evokes sensations and molecules and perceptions associate with pleasure and the currency of pleasure exists in multiple chemical systems but the primary ones are the dopamine system which is the anticipation of pleasure and the work required to a cave the ability to experience that pleasure and the ceretonan system which is more closely related to the immediate experience of that pleasure and from dopamine and ceretonan seamount other hormones and molecules things oxytocin which are associated with pardoning oxytocin is more closely associate with the ceretonan system by a chemically and at the circuit level meaning the areas of the brain and body that manufatural lot of ceratonan usually not always but usually contain darns that also manufacture and make use of the molecule oxytocin those chemicals together create sensations of warmth of a well being of safety the dopamine molecules more closely associated with hormones testosterone and other molecules involved with pursuit and further effort in order to get more of whatever could potentially cause more release of dopamine this is a very broad strokes noponintended description of the pleasure system there are course other molecules as well one in particular that is very interesting is something called p e a p e a stands for final methylamine sometimes also referred to as final ethelomine depending on who you are and where you live how you pronounce it does not really matter p a is a molecule which is incredibly potent at augmenting or increasing the activity of certain cells and normal circuits that relate to the pleasure system a p a has purportedly a been thought to be released in response to ingestion of things certain forms of dark chocolate some people take it in supplement form its a bit of a stimulant a but it alsoseems to heightened the perception of pleasure in response to a particular amount of dopamine and norceratonan gopher instance in a can of a arbitrary experiment and units type example if a given experience evokes of particular amount of cretonne and dopamine and gives rise to a subjective experience of pleasure of say level the out of tend the ingestion of p a prior to that experience can increase the rating of the experience as more pleasureful may be a four or a five or even a six and p a is known to be a present in or i should say its releases mutated by a number of different compounds such as day chocolate a certain things aspartame and certain people can actually increase the amount of p a released some of these glutamate relate o related molecules ascertain or things are in the glutamate pathway can increase p a release and then some people lathi take p a and supplement form for it is mild stimulant properties a as well as for increasing the perception of or the ability to experience pleasure it is not a sledge hammer it is not a a dopamine itself people that take things macunopurian ell dopa or drugs of abuse which i certainly do not recommend things a cocaine or impedemine experience tremendous increases in dopamine not much increases in ceratonan some people w take ceratonan in precursor form five t p or ceratonan itself or they'll take the monoacid precursor tryptophan ism not saying these things as recommendations for increasing one sense of pleasure ism describing them because of what they do generally falls into two categories the first category is to raise the foundation what we call the tonic level of dopamine and ceratonan if levels of ceratonan an dopamine are two low it becomes almost impossible to experience pleasure there is the called a hedonic this is also described as depression although it need not be long termed depression certain drugs anti depressions well outran propriron as its commonly called or the called excess purees the ceratonan selective re the uptake inhibitors use me prosaic loft and similar will increase dooming and ceratonan respectively there not increasing the peaks in those molecules the what we have called the ace release of those molecules whet the doing is there raising the overall levels of those molecules are raising the her foundation or the tide if you will thing about as your mood or your pleasure rather is a boat and if it is on the shore and it cannot get out to we unless that tide is high enough that is kind of way to think about these tonic levels of dopamine and rational now most of us fortunately do not have problems with are base line or atonic levels of dopamine and ceratonan release things p a in that case will cause a slight increase in that tide and make the ability of certain experiences to increase dopamine further more available what we call this in neurosciences called gain control it can kind of turn up the volume bring us closer to the threshold to activate certain circuits and this is really what we mean when we say a negro modulator of this is why when you are very happy about something let say your out with your friends your really excited maybe ah depending on where you live and what is going on in your are the world right now ah you i have a iceland she has been locked up in quarantine for long time recently because it was deemsafe she got to go to summer camp i have never seen that kids happy to spend souse mes went dine with her friends ah she was excited and it was really amazing to see how excited show us her baseline levels of dopamine were clearly up much that when she saw her friends she literally started squealing a they were squealing she was squealing everyone was squealing i was not squealing i would admit if i was queen i was not squealing but it was such a delight to see and ism sure that made my opening levels go up which was she was just excited such that anything in everything felt an exciting stimulus this is pleasure right and i do not want to write off the experience from an nerbiological reduction of standpoint quit the opposite it is really beautiful to see again this principle that different experiences and the experience of pleasure from different things seeing your friends for the first time summer camp for a kid whatever it might happen to be use the same currency dope use the same currency ceratonan and this is a principle that i hope in listening this podcast and even some of its re putative features from one episode to the next ism hoping that those will start to imbed in your mind that the brain and body used these common currencies for different experiences yes if you are dopamine in seratoneand or or i should say if your dopamine and or serotonin levels are too low it will be very hard to achieve pleasure to experience physical pleasure or emotional pleasure of any kine that is why treatments of the sort that i described to men an go a might be right for you obviously cannot determine if the right for you it is also why they have site effects if you artificially increase these molecules there associate with pleasure often times you get a laccomotivation to go seek things food people do not get much interest in food cause why should they if their carton levels are already up again there is the ton of individual variation i do not want to say that these anti depressing are always bad sometimes they have saved lives they have saved millions of lives sometimes people have side effects that make them not the right choice it has to be determined for the individual things p a are a more subtle effect i should mention p a supplementation is something that a number of people use but it is very short lived at because of the half life of this molecule is very brief it the effect only lasts about twenty minutes or things el el dopa mac cunipurians lead to longer base line increases in dopamine but remember anytime you raise a base line you reduce the called signal to noise what it means as if you are riding around at really high dopamine at first everything will start to seem exciting my niece in seeing her friends for the first on everything's exciting but then what will happen is when your dopamine levels return to more normal levels it will taken much greater dopamine increase of much bigger event more novel more exciting in order to achieve the sense that what your experiencing is pleasureful and this is because of the relationship between pleasure and pain now in a future episode we are going to go deep into this relationship between pleasure and pain but just briefly as a precursor to that and because it is relevant to the conversation that we have been having you might want to be wary of any experience any experience no matter how it drives chemical physical emotional or some commination you might want to be wary of letting your dopamine go too high and certainly you want to be wary of it going too low because of the way that these circuits a just basically every time that the pleasure system is kicked in in high gear an absorb spectacular event you cannot be more ecstatic there is a mere symmetric activation of the pain system and this might seem an evil curse of biology but it is not this is actually away to protect this whole system of reward and motivation that i e talked about at the beginning of the episode i might sound great to just nest substances or engage in behaviors where it is just dopamine dopamine dopamine and just constantly be motivated but the system will eventually crash and it happens is when you have a big increase in dopamine you also will get a big increase in the circuits that underlie our sense of disappointment and really adjusting the balance and with repeated exposure to high levels of doom not naturally occurring wonderful event but really high chemically induced a pipes in dopamine high magnitude chemically induce piss in dopamine what happens is those peaks and dopamine start to go down and down and down in response to the same what ought to be incredible experience we start to what is called habituate or attenuate and yet the pain increases in size and this has a preservative function in keeping us safe believe it or not but what i just described is safely the basis of most if not all forms of a diction something that we will deal with in a future episode in depth how what shall you think about all is how so you think about pleasure and how she think about pain what is too much pleasure well that is going to differ from person o person but to the extent that one can access pleasure repeatedly over time ideally without chemical augmentation certainly not excessive chemical augmentation that means that this pleasure system is tuned up well and can continue to experience pleasure however if you find yourself engaging in the same behavior over and over again but achieving less and less pleasure from it chances are you want to adjust down how often you engage in that behavior and or a just down your expectation of reward every time you engage in that behavior what do i mean by that well at the beginning of the episode i talked about how dopamine will allow us to get into doubts of hard work we will work very hard to pursue a reward and that is really what dopamine does and then when the reward comes that does not increase our dopamine in fact our dopamine levels go down one of the key things that we can all do to adjust our ability to experience pleasure is to engage in that intermittent reward sexual you can either adjust down the pique an dopamean meaning not let yourself ever get too happy but that is no fun right life is about occasionally achieving or experiencing ecstasy but every once in a while remove the reward o crseomi ecstasy the drug that is a separate matter the emdiama trials are a separate matter very interesting i wont clear i meant psychological and physical ecstasy of the natural sort i it means interest in what is going on in the em the ma trials but just for clarity purposes that is a separatopic that we will cover in an episode episodexcuse me very soon how do you adjust this dopamine system well every once in a while at random not in a predictable way you remove the reward and that will keep you and your dopamine system tun up in the proper ways the gain of the dopamine system as we say will be adjusted that you con continue to experience dopamine and teratogen when you actually get the reward this can be translated into a huge number of different domains but i want to give some examples because i am sure that many of you are asking wait what does this actually mean of let us say your student or this could be a student in macadamia or this can be a student of a physical practice every once in a while when you do something really well maybe that is even your showing up to the practice rather than pat yourself on the back just tell yourself ya that is the minimum that is expected of me when every one's excited about something that your doing maybe you are excited about it try and adjust down your excitement a little bit i know this might seem counter intuitive but you are preserving the ability to experience excitement in a variety of context let us say you get get a big monetary award well that is great ism happy for you and that is wonderful however you should be a little bit wary if you care about your dopamine system and you care about your ability to get subsequent monetary reward rewards souse me awards rewards does not matter which through effort if you want to be able to maintain the ability to exert effort well then you probably would not want a run out and immediately by something with that monetary reward in other word you wouldn't want to layer on more dopamine release ski you might but you might not you might skip it what you will find then is that your motivation is essentially infinite this is what i described o the beginning of the episode and again it is because dopamine is this currency it is a in these days you hear a lot about bitching and thorium and doge coin and you s dollars and euros the stuff but the currency that you use in your body does not matter what external currency those are in fact as you watch the value of different currencies go up whether not script currency or standard currency the value is actually reflective of the dopamine that exists inside of people right all the excitement about a particular currency script or otherwise is really just dopamine that the currency that we all use and there is no negotiating that that is just the way that were built now to give yet other examples let us say your teaching other people how to do something and they do something exceptionally well if you reward them every single time and in particular if you reward them with something that is even greater than the experience of what they did let us a kids win a poker game there there ecstatic their jumping all over replace are superexcited and you reward them with an even bigger experience of celebration you are actually inhibiting there ability to perform the same set of activities that led them to the wind if and i really one to underscore if you reward them every time of course we should reward kids and each other and ourselves for our accomplishments but you do not want to do at every time and sure there will be some disappointment from suddenly removing the reward that you expect it but that is exactly the point that is what keeps these circuits tuned up properly now there is the other form of pleasure which is the more immediate visceral or century experience of pleasure this is distinct from goals and goal directed behavior ism talking about the immediate experience this is more of the ceratonurgic system there other systems involve to but this is also the system that draws out those in erogenous opioid from a particular structure we have a structure in the back of our brain called pay p a g it is the perry aqueduct gray area very interesting brainareia that is associate with pain but also with pleasure because under certain conditions it deploys indigenous opioid and give us gives us a kind of list out feeling can this is not the opioid of the opioid epidemic sort that people taken unfortunately have led to tremendous amounts of suffering and abuse these are endogenously released opioid these as a kind of opioid that come out from long distance doubts of physical exercise in running these are the opioid that are deployed in response to giving birth and overcoming the tremendous pain of child birth p a g is very contextual and their few types of stimuli or i should say events in life am really showing my nutty side there are few types of stimuli pat experiences that evoke indigenous opioid release from page y one is sexual activity sexual activity can increase pain threshold and here i i am not a suggesting or getting involved in any one's particular proclivities or personal experiences you re welcome to editorialize this however you however what ism talking about are animal data and yes human data as well that show that pain thresholds are increased any time p a g is activated because of the release of these indigenous spirits there is also the immediate experience of whether not a particular form of touch is pleasureful or not and there there some very interesting biology that relates to really how those little wires from those dears enervate our skin work studies i should say done by avid guineas lab at hazard medical school that the guilty lab has spent years working on the som aticensory system the touch system as identified a particular category of neurons that enervate the skin an than those around of corse than that information up to the brain too and they actually respond to direction of touch now some of you might be more sensitive to this than others but it turns out that certain hairs to be deflected one way verses another whether not you cats or not you can do this experiment you can pet a cat in the direction that their fur lies it lies down in a particular direction you'll knows that there suctulya get that dictates that the hairs lie down in a particular direction and if you pet them in a way that ut cooperating with that direction not pushing the hairs up or rather a stroking the hairs on the back of the cat we y'all notice as they often that not all cats some cats of pretty grouchy but if you if you stroke their hair they will often our the often push in to you if you were to stroke their hair in the opposite direction pushing the hairs up against the direction that they want to lie down cats do not that enters out people do not that either some people do to have their hair pushed in a direction against the direction in which it wants to lay down but there is more typically response of feeling its pleasureful for for instance when someone brushes or combs their air in the direction that it wants to lay down and that is because the way in which these neurons the innervate these hairs sends information up to the brain bifurcates actually its splits into brain centers that evoke a sense of pleasure or a sense of not pleasure it is not toserely pain you might find that certain people are very particular they to be touched in a certain way but not others you might be one of those people and areas of our skin that have high density of receptors are very very sensitive in a real way in a real sense of the word to patterns of touch and whether not a touch is to firm or to light and that will be modulated by overall levels o arousal and when i talk about arouse what ism talking about howler or how she my we are it is impossible to experience pain when we are deep in sleep i do not mean sleeping of the typical night sort i mean of the anesthesia sort that is the purpose of anesthesia to bring the brain and body into deep plain of rest very deep in fact and its very hard if not impossible to achieve or experience pleasure when we are in a very low state of arousal as well when we are in heightened states of arousal we can achieve pain we can experience pain and we can experience pleasure o and under those heightened states of arousal we are more sensitive literally the passage of electrical signals from those locations on the body that have heighten degrees or higher degrees i should say of receptors use your imagination they include the lips the face the feet in the generals and near by areas literally near by areas under conditions of high arousal two things happen the ability to achieve or experience pleasure at those locations goes up and our tolerant in our threshold for pain also goes up the principle here is that as our levels of arousal that foundation of arousal goes up or down too goes up and down our ability to achieve pleasure and pain and these two extremes of being deep within anaemia or another extreme is at you know a sleep ore in heighten levels of arousal our ability to achieve pleasure and pain are going to scale according to those and this is why and ism certainly not suggesting this but this is why some people will take stimulants or drugs of abuse that increase arousal in order to achieve pleasure of other kinds the problem is is that those drugs an particular things cocaine and methemphedoming and imphedoming be come their own form of reinforcement much that the person does not seek out any other form of excitement or arousal to day we were not talking about addiction we were not necessarily talking about motivation but we touched on those topics a sort of a precursor what is to come we talked about the pathways in the skin and in the brain and elsewhere in the body that control our sense of pleasure and pain we described a number different tools ranging from hypnosis to different supplements to a electoracupuncture and various other tools that one could use to modulate your sense of pleasure or pain and of course in think about pleasure we have to thing about the dopamine system in the ceremony and system in some of the related chemical systems i realize that to day's podcast had a lot of scientific details we have time stamped everything for u that you do not have to digest it all at once of course i do not expect that everyone would be able to understand all these detailsall at once what is more important really is to understand the general principles of how something pleasure and pain work how they interact and the very seldom systems within the brain end body that allow them to occur and that modulate or change their ability to to occur and of course your subjective experience of pleasure or pain i do hope that this was on whole more pleasureful than painful for you if your

toward stern provides ha case study and how to avoid the consequences of your own vile public behavior through left wing pandering jobidon heads to the men and mumbles in coherently and lodgers lens pushes for more aid and cooperation on climate change have been unless is ventfaro show teashop as sponsor by expressvepien you your wife his our being seen and sold to advertisers now mean either yet express we plan right out express vepiansi come freshmen the rule is in our media and in our international politics as it turns out that if you mirror the priorities of the left that you can e pretty much do whatever you want long as you are not caught on camera doing it any other thing you are pretty much o k the reason i say this is because you look at the desperate consequences for public figures ranging from s a mussels brand on the one hand to to somebody towards stern on the other the public consequences are quite hispid i muse mussels brand as an example here for just second have talked about resell brand at length this week mussels of course has been accused now by for separate women of actions ranging from sexual assault to race to sexual harassment and whether allegations were not i do not know one thing i do know is that at this moment they are just allegations there has been no actual criminal indictment brought against him he certainly not been convicted of anything but you too has now suspended mussels brand for making any money on the platform on tuesday days after that report broke from channel for and b b s and these are outlets that use to pay mussels brand while he is in the midst of his most flagrantly vile behavior and as i pointed out the other day there is some irony to the fact or something curious to the fact about that that mussels brand when he was at his most vile is being paid by all the same mediolets that are now investigating him when he is married has a couple kids and is preaching hederadox's political opinions when it comes to you to but bran's channel with six point six million subscribers going to dailywire has now been suspended from ionization following serious allegations against the creator according to you to again the a very strange standard the got is now praying if there serious allegations made against you of any sort i suppose now all of your vidiosos immediately get dooumonitivs fichus then be very bad news for half the rappers on the block as well as a significant number of actors mean seriously there are these allegations out there about an enormous number of public figures if if the new standard is and allegation is tantamount to a conviction in the doctor public opinion and an allegation alone is sufficient to have your ability tomonotize your videos remove from you by you to that a horrible standard you have now created a mass of incentive structure for people who make allegations against people true or falls in order to destroy their careers now again ism not saying the the women your coming on saying the stuff about bran are lying i do not know whether they are or not what what i do know at this point is the you to i i do not know how they could possibly uphold such a standard that a public allegation comes out that ugly about somebody and they immediately demonetize everything having to do with mussels bran not does that have something to do wit the fact that resell brand is a gan a hederadock's political thinker somebody who says things about for temple cove that you two does not it very much somebody who says stuff about joining that you two but might not very much these sorts of standards our certainly not going to be evenly applied obviously than i can t be evenly apple and and this is what brings me to toward sterns towards stern has been making headlines last couple of days by pushing very loudly to the left now toward stern spent pretty much might in tire life from the time i was eighteen agee on the one most famous people in america being in absolute devil's in a a a degraded person beyond all measure just remind you who toward stern is the kinds of behavior that towards tern has regularly engaged on in publicly throughout his career a disgusting in there disreputable they are vile toward women and all the rest just just remind you here was here is a compilation of toward sterns racily disgusting comments just female guests on his show you ere in pen whowyou we thong or do how you look about ho you or one a hat's i to take up i eaten wit your get a an no e n no a we you a r or i e a i morning who he er to tan lo i both ha this some en milder stuff that towards tern sow n his show for years and years and years and years and this a person who literally had women into his studio to sit on vibrators s that he could record their reactions and blasted out to millions of people in his audience he is boneless bile people in public life for decades on an but now awards stern is apparently one of our moral exemplars over the last couple of days for example he has ripped into lorn sober now lorn sober engaged in what i think is disgusting behavior and we we talked about it'd i made fun of her on the program because it is just insane to go with your boy friend to a showing of beetle juice and then get hands with your boyfriend while raping and then to yellow people who do who i am when you are when you are removed from the venom he is really gross behavior but you know doesn't love a leg to stand on talk about grow not public behavior is toward term hoars tern apparently has no he has no compunction about doing any of this now he love the same reaction the t was built plenty in the oval office receiving favors from moniclinsky i i remember but but here is that here is towards tern getting very upset about lorn sober suddenly he is a on my side of the of the isle when it comes to apparent prudery ran bomber is a disgrace to this country i not because of the the you are a hundred pes a right forget the gigs she is in actress if you saw the video he is in h toss he is with some do looks h es obviously eating it also looks she might be grab in is penis during you been news she was wearing a tie dress i have seen point stars ware more when i watch that taper dor she must be much unto my a she is a hot girl friend bat you now i we meet her in congress do not when you reach ain eater at a strip club and i me meat art de lack dances a me meter tat place is an that it that is towards stern right again now now we do not can r in congress she is a disgrace to congress says towards stern now hoar the house towards tern able get away with all the suffers again he mirrors he political priories to the left you means was is you to be long's you murder the political priorities to the left get's more on this en a moment first plainer pouted has called you us dollars trapan dominant objective and irreversible brazil russia india trinal an south africa have formally agreed to use local currencies in trade instead of the united states dollar is that the first so to fall i donor but one thing i do know is that it is smart to diversify investors and saviours are looking to harness the power of physical gold held in a taxi sheltered era i by gold from bercwall i trust them to help me diversify by science you can protect your era or for one say by diversifying with gold from birch gold as the stroller continues receive pressure from foreign countries signal currencies in central banks arm yourself with information how to protect your savings teen to ninetyeight ninety eight ninety eight roll send you e free info kit on gold with plus rating with the better business burro thousands of have be customers countless fives our views i trusburhgll to help you diversifying told if a central banktdigenal currency would become a reality will be and is have some gold to dependupon again ten ben to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight and i having all my asset subject to the whims of central bankers you probably should not either teens o ninety high ninety eight ninety eight ask all your questions my friend of biracial men get started in vesting in at precious metals are he an back to howardstern again towards tern has discovered the magic a liver that wipes away all of your pas an present sins and that is be far enough to the left towards try last coup o most he is getting more and more to the left here he was just a little while go couple months ago going after bedrock and trap is street claiming that they are transfobek for pointing out that for example dulia mulvany is a not a woman i wish i could cold kiddo am come on the showing to tell me what is it you why you p said about this how's it hurtful i really dumfounded by white some one would hare much that they would blow up a can ut bud likes the can is or good i do not get it now again remember that because hoards terns the conversion who bats image to our secular religious priesthood this means doing get away with pretty much anything me here he is committing sacrifices to the secular relive priest ad that the great sacrifice of all which is to suggest the youshould get as many booster shots as humanly possible here as towards tern literally yesterday talk how he is now wok that he he's awoke guy says howrdstern i get every baleen that good and and for those of mouthing i the governments trying to kill you or implant ships y way a shaping you idolize shipping you o for those conspires but i am wo mother and i love it i want to be a wake i want o reed legitimate new stores is here is i awoke i am i believe the election was not it a again he is saying all the nostrums that everybody on the left really wants to hear and that means that is find from to do all this why is this important why is the sort of stuff important because when you have an immunized class of people a class people were immunized by their association with certain left wind causes first of all an intensive is is bad behavior by those people but second of all the desecrate this massive double standard where if you are heterodox you can expect to be target but if you are orthodox in your practice of leftism well then you can expect that your can be given an enormous amount of brethingroom an everybody understands this that these secular left priesthood that now prevails in the media in holly wood when it when it comes to our government that secure left priest wood gets to decide who are the favored and where the disfavored to take this to the international level there something sort of fascinating happening with you crane war and ism not talking about the shall on the ground fighting ism talkingabout the perception of you crane in you crane war one of the things that started pretty early in the cranevers's russia war is this bizarre left wight split that did not seem to murder reality the beginning and the very beginning there is lot of talk on the right you russia was in a religious stater you crane was their religious whale by all available holding the opposite was true far more people in you wrangle to church on average than than people in russia they go to church far more frequently you grants a far more socially concertize country then russia in a lot of ways despite ladies pouters attempts to be more socially concerti from the lowdown it is a far more secular atheistic state is russia than you crane but the presumption on the part of america was the opposite for for lot of america you crane because it was immediately adopted by the democratic party and because joint decided to make it his sort of cause on the international stage immediately the assumption was on the left r you crane had to be some sort of san francisco on the vulgar which is absurd i mean that that that it is not true but very quickly you do not you crane learned what you crane learned is that they actually were were able to gat left wing support by pandering exactly to this it is a truly astonishing thing for example of lot of me slinky he goes to the you en and yen's trying make a pitch for further funding and makes the usual pitch you starts off by talking about how russia is going to crossroads borders in it sit is going to engaging mass destruction this exactly your expect to here from a country that is in themiddle of a war but then he moves beyond that yet hears penny's original pitch which is that it is really all about russia and t balancing russia you crane for territorial integrity and the rest terror have no right to hold new tor wipes no right but truly loving use o this carioca wile ops very man an face the mes destruction is gaining it is momentum the aggressor is recognizing many over thinks and old canst i use not only aghast our country but agist all of yours be well ioflget you snowed this casing disagree this gave but kolinsky then spent an enormous amounts of his speech not talking about the war that is killed hundreds of thousands of people in nu crane instead he spent enormous amounts of speech talking about climate change hat f a question you think people you crane give good leap about climate change of this point right now that bombs falling in their cities there in the midst of the biggest continental war in rope since world were to and ladder's lenskyis over thou talking about climatechange why is you doing that why is he doing then hes we talk about climate change then this gives this the golden ticket to left wing money it is what earns you support from the left if you talk about their favored topics wat same with hat hours turn buys a dispensation a left twin people dispensation by talking left wing talk ladder's lens has realized that he can do the exact same thing that the the bazar split between right and left over the assume politics of rushoverseas you crane if yes you please the into that he get you biding to sign on more fashion ton get the left win media to support him in a higher order this presumably his wins lens is talk about climate change here is kolinsky lecturing the world about climate change which again is superweird even you humanity is failing on his climate policy objectives this mans that extreme weather will still impact the normal globe alive and some people stay we will also demonize it is out cops what is that what in the world is he jabbering about why is even talk while the reason his talking about this is because this is the admission price you he pare of the club the mission prices you talk about the heredissues he did not more he took out you people can h use climate as a weapon thank god replevin learned use climate s weapons as loafers lens what how was this have to do with the price of a missile you ran out the fish in tellies could be train to combatwell before it would long do the humanity fan got people have an aliya lot to use climate as a weapon in presumably this is also the reason why you crane is now trotting out he spoke's person for the military who is a transgender woman am not getting you an now same sex marriage in you crane is not legal you crane is not a left wing country the simple fact o the matter is that it is he culturally right wings country in a twenty ten european study for example only twenty eight per cent eucranians pull believe that leg b t u individuals should live freely and however they that's lowest number of all european countries pulled except for russia rushes the only other one that has lower numbers the the notion that this a wildly left wing place is ridiculous it is not a wildly left wing place by by any stretch of the imagination but they understand that if they want by in from the left there can t have to pretend that there are left town place presumably this is why they are currently trotting out sera fashion morello a trains woman from neat who came to you crane and march twenty twenty two and has now be comma spokes person for the countries territorial defense force last week according to france at twenty four russia telivishn so n outolong special calling strong villa terrible disgrace to the cranial people and a monster nineteen months in she is a junior serge and host live you two shows as friends twenty four from her studio called you crane in the no and russia heats the truth ashen s roll does not even speak at you cranial hero includes monitoring international media by the way these are obviously french twenty first pronouns is he do in august she announced a boy out of mean and after they called foreign fighters in u crane mercenaries hits this wat you crane is doing you ran as a propagandaploy is playing to the left which is what they have to do bus the united states has now established a baseline standard which is mure the priories of the left or you will be excised or least you will be it at risk of being accused it is more on this momentarily first you don't i missing right now my helix see mattress it'll be anchor to and loan see ism here in amazing jerusalem during the perish holidays the thing that bring my family overheard means that i lose a bucket load of sleep and right now i am missing my hell's sleep mattress man i wish i had the helix fleet helices his harness years to extensive mattress pretties to bring their customers are truly elevated sleep experience that hell's rely collection in clues six different mattress models

out come flesh men use code relics partner twenty and get one of their best offers of the year twenty present off all stressor s plus two free pillows for my listeners o case why exactly is lenskeep mirroring the priories left because this is how you get the money the way get access to the cash is by mirroring the priorities of the left an jobidon spelled out those priorities of the men by the way and when he was not mumbling in coherently she spoke at the you n yesterday and ism as you would predict he sounded absolutely nonsensical here he was just babbling noble t got from his facehole learn peter dry pardon ne partner but be clear seen principal of a agree a sac sacrist the may be clear shares of corsages goa aero an is s a stove corral from bus almighty i what in the world the wrong i but when he isn't speaking incoherently an at least out physically and coherently he speaking in coherently about his values one of the values that america most champions according to jobidon those values are climate change in l g b t k i a minas divided by sign rights here was jobidon stumping for leg b tau i a plustifided by myna sign rights in a room with a bunch of countries that do not believe anything remotely what your biding believes after continue work an here the woman and girl it your equal right to recap participation of e society that digs i ricoetni relies forward people i desk go do not have her protector stiffer a static discrimination tag b k cut i plospeople are not prosecutor target vile because of who they are hes rights or part of our sere our man perhaps person anywhere lost to every ha you onrisolensk is a cling to jobidon's favorite priors that is the reason guides that is the reason and a a standard has been set up and fulfil the standard i access to the casino if you do not you do not your tapped on the shoulder by the angel of leftism and it gives you blanket immunity for pretty much anything culturally internationally that is just the way that it works these days by the way how radical is this administration when it comes to climate change compel heirs now merging most insane lessons of the climate change women she suggests that's reasonable to now one to have kids beat of climate change which is totally wild i heard young leaders talk with me about a a term they cline t call climate anxiety paint which her of of the future an the unknown of whether it make tenthly even think about having children wether make tensor you to think aba a firing to buy home to we what will this climate be this out crazy the people are and those of the priorities your expected to major if you wish to be welcomed into polite company in the international meetings it is a more on all of this momentarily first let us say they you are a captain of a small boat living in a small massachusetts town and at the couple shark attacks in the area and your called upon to go out there and you into go and stop the sharp hell before you head out on a boat that is too small with a sheriff and a guy who studies oceanography before you do those things you should get life insurance because about the time the giant charm is chomping on your torso you be thinking shuldlisonshpiro show got life insurance should i had on other policy genius calsgenus makes it easy to compare life entrance quote from top companies and fined your lowest surprise let we line for personal experience is very satisfying to check life insurance off your list policy genius can help you do that to day with poly genius on fine lifeintrans policy starting just two under ninety to buffer year for one million dollars in covering some options offer seems toy approval and avoid those unnecessary medical exams policy geniuses ligan stations works for you not the insurance companies which means they do not have an incentive to recommend one insure over another she can trust their guidance no edifies your personal information made private e lessons deserve that financial stateside and you deserve it smarter way to find by it ha not poly genius dot come lash of pearl or click link in the description see how much you could save it is policy genius i come slash chipiro again meanwhile just being of the the value system over at the u an one other piece of value sit we should ad is it if you do not mirror the left wing prescriptions they will censor you just as we mention with mussel bran this is part of the gar justinto adorn who had to leave for job as the prime minister of new zealand after easily turning it into a famous to island where everybody was forced into lock down and then nobody give vaccinated as it turns out which which turn out to be really really by policy and who pursued censorship with tremendous enthusiasm pul shows over it the you an bragging about how we need more censorship because free speech is a weapon of war how do you taka climate can if people do not believe it exists how do you insure the human rights of others a halt when they are tetitoto hateful and dangerthreter an ideology the weapons may be different but the galls of tars to copituat them is otenesine to coth cloth and reduce the ability of others to in themselves to desman community to code tear strength of country tho i tibia but we have an opportunity here to insure that these particular weapons of war do not become an estepepa owarfia i mean this is crazy talk which shes talking out but it is parted parcel of what many governments are now pushing for in part of the necessary platform for left is the censor all the voices they do not which presumably is why the u ka is now about to pass the call online at safety bill its ready to become war according to the government of the u a the online safety bill has now pass its final parliamentary debate it is now ready to become war what exactly this it do well take ta one what zero tolerate approach to protecting children and makes sure social me o platforms are held responsible for the content they host if they do not act rapidly to prevent and remove illegal content and stop children seem material that is harmful to them such as bullying they will they significant fines that could reach billions of pounds in some cases the bosses may even face prisons were not talking here about printing algorithms that get rid of just legal activity it goes much further than this this goes to things bullying which is pretty vaguely defined or inappropriate content pretty vaguely define and making social meed platforms rest possible for all that obviously puts them in danger of bankruptcy it is setting standards for p platforms face book you to but tie took take enology secretary machete donjon said the bill was are quit game changing piece of legislation said e you came will be the safest place in the world to be on line well why do i have a feeling that the government setting these standards is going to be very interested in what sort of material is now considered two dis information laden to be a loud to cross your screen now no one is in favor of corncob harmful social media content the question is what constitutes harmful platforms have to show they are committed to removing illegal content which again i her but apparently they also want to extend is into the realm of for example hatespeech which is really really dangerous stuff there's a reason why the why the monopoly an informational destination has to be maintained and that is again just another fatso create a barrier to entry for anyone who disagrees with the generalized to agenda we all this is going to crate back lash it is going crate back lash internationally andiron a create back lash right here in the united states monde dona trumpets cling well a lot of it is because if the agenda of the united states supposedly is a climate change in transgenderrights that and censorship on the back of those two things that is not something most america t are for if you want to make the crane war a proxy for cultural issues it will become a proxy for cultural issues is one of the reasons why republican enthusiasm for the cranial war and for back new crane in that war has waned a tremendously the men get became a partisan issue the enthusiasm began to decline markedly represent of baron dona's on flora he says listen on the houseleek we are not interest in providing more running for you craned at this point what is yer make to the let many come the happen on ten ta won to for money come cone he clan a any tee teriinportan stopping the waring you ran what net e e the tent many con ziti e of o for many c you i o the to you as no money in the house i no crane es i lo the oh you cinnamon o support for many ne and t below were running a two going about a guise anyone in to if to you crane were borrowing or our future es t was gotoshr n aby few you you want a feel about it under the toll trip it was see one he happens to be correct about the fact that we are spending a boatload money but more importantly it seems as though the leadership class in this in this country particularly on the left but thing over all just does not have any connection to the things that people actually care about the country at the same time that there driving the economy into a brick wall they are simultaneously pursuing mass illegal immigration for example on the one hand you e the economy that is driving into a brickwall according to the waster journal the fat is about to face one hundred dollar oil in almost uninterrupted rise and oil prices now push bench mark a brent crew close to a hunterabout to barrel posing a new challenge for central banks in their battle against inflation the rise of victory for say arabia which sought to bolster prices to fund a planned at transformation of its oil dependent c anomy russia is another winner the two country spark the valley early this sure this that theywould restrict supplies until the end of the year now what is exasperating that obviously the unfriendly attitude of this administration toward more drilling and refining that obviously has been a math problem meanwhile the administration continues two back unions the u a w as the u a w puts the car industry in america on very very tentative footing as the pastry journal points out the united auto worker strike is going on day five president confine has reject to the latest offer from sealant's of a twenty one per cent pay rays over four years he keeps suggesting that corporate greet is the issue yet it was telling this weekend when he refused to discuss the unions to impact on future job creation actins she testis face the nation how he would make the case to destroy automakers to invest in more expensive union shops rather than moving to right to work states tan dock he said that u a w worker patient be compared own pitiful testlopays their workers and other companies pay those workers he added most of these workers in those companies are scraping to get by who greet c of and greedy people yon most can build more rocketchips and shoot herself into outer space mister fane can criticized musically once is the waster journal but tesla is the chief competitor to the defrost automakers in the government mandated electric vesical race according to the as he see the median worker at tesla earned thirty four grand last year in total competition compared to eighty grand g m and seventy five granted board sylancis that it the average workers are in sixty eh grand the internal calculations include non ruction level workers as well as employs located in other countries yet the of a counts for a larger share if turtles work for than it does report or sealant's a large reason for the pa disparity detritus higher retirement costs s again the unions i negotiated incredibly lucrative contracts and it is killed a lot of jobs into trout what is the be administration doing about all this their backing the unions again randy wine garden who is another union had whist is a radically disgusting handing glove relationship the bin administration who is she who is standing four square behind school closers for two years for no reason she is been backing a w strike look at what is happening in to to a the intertanmen ministry and look what is laden an to industry looking what is happening in trendy i every in duster a revolution talisman such at every industry revolution that is happened not a in the country but the world the are winners an there lovers and the workers always same to me the losers in everyone in ti transition i would actually root for the people in america the papa better life the pest new in mutual pay what what has happen manufacturing is coming back america made in agaric in o la actually and bat and the workers who a truly made this companies more propibb o that they have not made these companies more profitable union contracts the company's less profitable the only i they made the comings more profitable her t e last couple of years was mass of supply chain defects and e which is why the prices are coming down and why in the end the biding push for electric vehicles is going to make these companies far less profitable how is the bid administration responding to all of us to at in ism going strike in one of america chief industries well they are sicking they're go gallon musk if they if they cannot make a deal between the u a u and big three instead they are going to go after tesla the competitors of the w at this point according the was for vernal federal prosecutors are scrutinizing personal benefits testlamaa provided melon muss since twenty seventeen has part of a criminal investigation examining issues including a prove posed house for the chief executive now if you think has nothing to do with the on masks politics and nothing to do wit the fact that thistle is the chief competitor to the destroy three you ha another thing coming of course it is political of course it is political the reason the do a s going after lonmusk on this treason they went after him on spasacts remember they they are right now the sclerite division is suing melon musk for not hiring enough for ref gs over its spasacts despite the fact that as musk says you have t have security requirements fulfilled in order to work at spasacts because the federal contractor with access to classified material the reason there coming after musk is eminently political he violates the rules cross then and this is what you face down meanwhile the same administration that is pressing forward with e with e stagnating economy with inflation that is priors has in climate change that is par sitting l g b t u plus mines divided by sign issues over the base line kitchen table issues every of everyday merits meanwhile there facilitating the legal immigration or record levels get's that momentarily first are you a few decades or years out o school and wondering but that git i even learn what what exactly was the point well you might think yourself mustn't have the time to learn at something new will that is not true you are not alone it is not too late since eighteen forty four hillsdale college has been providing education in faith freedom an character they've taken some of the port class of the than campus and made them available for free on line for anyone wast to learn that is correct absolutely free they're thirty nine free courses to choose from ranging from the us constitution and the book of genesis to free market economics there easy to follow there self pace you can start when every want in facts can start right now it is everything you need all in one place no long term commitment let hillsdale college be your guide learn when and where you want had

college has been a from mere educational institution in this country reliable voice for traditional viewpoints and classics for literally decades a may i remember subscribing to hillsdale's imprimis back when i was a than anger hillsdale hiding you slash t sharper to enrolls today also did you hold out on joining germ's razors well now is your chance to enter the woke free economy with the precision five trolley one way to handle one precision five razor with flip back trimmer one price there is never been better time to stop giving your cash to woke corporations that hate your got but to germ's razors shot come make that switch to day scam meanwhile as the elites in are country decide that the big issues you care about are things climachange there just allowing you legalimigrans to flow unimpeded into the country quern grief at mankind a national correspondent for fox news in the past four days fridge from one day total migrant encounters at the south western border exceeded thirty five thousand at an average nearly nine thousand per day according to the border patrol the exact count is thirty five thousand five hundred seventy three encounters nearly nine thousand daily average that does not include known roadways this are huge numbers obviously and as it turns out the illegalimigration problem is becoming a permanent feature of america life according to a fascinating report by spencer linguist over at the daily wire there is a community called colony ridge in texts and apparently it is become basically a giant settlement spot forty legal immigrants spencer t weed have you heard about america largest legal immigrant settlement that said to be a hub of cartelactivity i visited colony ridge for daily wire to learn about a development that is home to forty thousand to seventy five thousand people as in the midst of a rapid expansion here is what i found you can see this a giant grid houses being built and all the rest well according two spencer a texts land developer has a stablish a sprawling settlement north of fuss where thousands veleglimigrants are believed to as settled raising concerns among experts and elected officials that the development four hundred miles in the interior of the united states could computer techie said for the cartels apparently a sprawls across nearly sixty square miles about the size washington do see it is forty miles outside son much to of colony ridge is a third world shanty town where foreign flags out number america ones had we know that ta hoped for legal aliens and he was a let me show you and here is a driving through town at half built houses with people living in them poor believing intend and trailers location liberty county texts near the small town of plum grove the colony ridge development is a sprucing community the based on an analysis of publicly available information is growing it is estimated to be anywhere between fifty thousand to seven five thousand people why because of a plan targeted a ten his sespannic population the daily where surveyed the development by helicon tor to assess the true extent of its growth houses on the ground live the flags of foreign countries many homes display their dresses on spray painted pieces of ply wood many structures many of which are not hooked up to running water were under construction others recon finish but did not appear to be actively getting worked on at least one plot of land and have any structures at closest to tent in the corner nestle between the shrubs he spitewhat appear to be for living conditions through a much of redevelopment colony ridge is exploding the view from the sky revealed a sprawling labyrinth the round about and endless rods of sidewalkless streets with empty plots waiting to be developed apparently according to daily wire colony ridge owned and operated by developer named willing at try derris is rapidly expending at least in part of financing arrangement that makes the possible for a legal aliens to buy land at deep in the heart of texts while traditional financing methods require credit ratings and proof of income tod bondsman a national security fellow the enter for migration studies told the daily wire that buyers at colony ride are able to circumvent the usual requirements even dodging the need provided social scurvy number kinsman said because of the traditional banklonye you have to show the of a federating and proof of income he says than now loons are being created were all younger is a few hundred dollars down as down payment the on is

encourage potential beers to reach out vial what is to a the plots of land come with nothing on them at an adorable price the colonel offer is to adjacent plots o land for sixty five grand kinsman told the daily where collins rights in the miss to maybe is greatest a boom ever again we are just creating apparently massive city filled with t illegal immigrants thanks to mobile things are going tospicktackrly now all republicans have to do read here as pick up the ships right all the chips are on the table that is all publicans have to do avoid doing stupid stuff pretty much it unfortunately been talking bout lot lately the republicans haven unfortunate habit of jumping with both feet on to every real insight now apparently the gimp he is headed directly for a government shut down matches is saying openly he wants at some sort of government shut down we can can jo by e the demo cats for white republican con to has pe preventives has has ting so toxpendin built that for fault we have to deal with that we will let we have to endure som to gree a shut town it'll get or alternatively you have to deal with the reality on the ground which the democratic senate and a democrat as the president of the united states going to politico house grope hardliners block to bate on their own parties defense spending bell on tuesday making pending on funding latest casual to of a civil war between ma martian is conservative critics republican rebels blocked the annual defense appropriations bill in a procedural vote reliving a standing loss to a martian hawks who sought to break an impasse on federal spending that force leaders to yank the legislation last week banyan servant is with held their vote on the pension bill to force re publican leaders to take a harder line on a stop cap in order to keep the lights on ultimately the procedural vote failed on the eight hundred twenty six billion dollar defense spending bill known as a rule and if failed in a two twelve to two fourteen vote on tuesday five republicans defected on the procedural vote which almost always falls along party lines just phenomenal defend talks to cried conservatives led chiefly by the house of free cooks o block military hunting for the past week and get what is i do not even see what exactly is the ask at this point what exactly is it the you are asking for it it makes it makes very little sense at all when you are getting made hunter by john federal you are doing things wrong here is john fetdermen who i will say john federal he is been appearing on to view lately i with mustache to the beard is gone remember he had the lincoln beard now he looks in old time e western bard tender who is once kicked in the had by a horse here is with a cries have it with crisshas jabbering nonsensically that house to day looks gets falling a part you have already got seventeen no votes an that house republican casket sang war not pat h hate thing what what do you thinks happening here an only i true of of very crowd of my colleagues the o because the real o goerdencs that is what it is and on the o the the the house e the the water to call themselves to the a mere we were allisellagously a dolly bring your go an otherwise they need to go home e differently you humpederferent leg says john federal ye me that guy as not fully functional and were now or setting up astral sent rules to accommodate the fact that he wants to when him shorts even though ism not sure that he has ever worked out in his life but by by the look of him but then matter when john federal as making fun of you in succeeding that is not exactly a wind for republicans and meanwhile again there tons of things forepublicanst to talk about in the selection cycle ranging from joined in competence to his corruption all that stuff is on the table two talk about what a republicans talking about what whatever is the latest revelation in the dona trunk cases of course and again that is not to trump now because he seeded that ground when he took activities particular with regard to class documents that put him directly in the cross heres if you are a person who has the biggest target in human history on your back which is probably the case of dona trump in terms media hating you why would you put yourself squarely in the rot who up you make that target gigantic we are now learning according to particular sources that one of tonal trumps ads a a a woman name molly michael she apparently has told authorities then dona trump attempted to obstruct justice or suborn perjury according t ages he knew sources said michael told federal investigators the last year she grew increasingly concerned without trump handle recurring request from the national arrives from their turn of all government documents being kept in boxes in maralago she felt trumps claims about it at the time would be easy to disprove according to the sources force is said that after trump heard the one i wanted to interview michael last year he said quote you do not know anything about the boxes it is unclear what exactly he meant by that but this leading a lot of people to suggest that he knew that you knew about the boxes and therefore the his basely telling her to pig to the after gain none of the stuff is particularly good for dona trump in just is not on the other hand it is amazing how the d o j continues to show it is corrupt hand as many of you now there been a large controversy surrounding ray ups raps has been target by people including jocko carbon he was a participant in the canary six riots there is tape of him telling people to go into the capital building there is hip of him the night before telling people to had over and invade the capital building and all the rest of thus ad then he was never charged and because has never charge the suspicion was on para look people on the right d he must have been some sort o government plant hell now apparently the dog is charging him but they are charging him with one misdemeanor accounts of disorderly or destructive conduct on restricted grounds now old people on the argosy why does he get charge with pretymuch nothing when they are other people who did not all that much on generous finally wander around the building and spent months we years in jail why why is that he is goon claim laudforcemens con elements because he cooperated the when he saws at am on t v he call thus law in forcemeat apparently he is on ta plead guilty to the charge but slap on the discharges post fact o do not look much justice to the vastmontuary people who watch the stuff lay out meanwhile over in pennsylvania jo so per s the governor of pennsylvania is promoting pennsylvania's brand new program for automatic door motor registration it is pretty much californium's motor motor law their apparently half a dozen states or dozen statesthat are have this on the books they you're automatically register to vote hen get a drivers lie sincere josh pure champion this in pennsylvania i am proud to announce the for the first timer pennsylvania is an automatic motor registration state that is right from now on when you get or renew your drivers vicious or an i be card to the gamp you will be register to vote unless you chose not made a commitment but i was campaign for this office that we would bring automatic motor registration pennsylvania and break down the barriers for legal elitobl votthis is a c step to make our e sections for secure having important levels of verification to the motor registration proves and by expanding motor registration at our tammy will she taxpayers time and money reduce the number of costly paper registrations is i wondering how t actually adds voter security to have people simultaneously register vote automatically but o cat let us assume that is all the case this this makes pennsylvania the twenty fourth state to actually roll out this sort of automatic motor registration process now i understand why they lit people on the river exercise over this lot people think that now this paves the way for for example ballad harvesting and they are not wrong in the fact is that according to real clear pennsylvania do come then couldst rhombus writing america ballet harvesting capitals in suburban filly he says prices o pandemic pennsylvania had passed an election r form law enabling mainland voting unlike in person voting which requires no motor idea pennsylvania's land ballet process requires the applicant to provide id either are drivers license or social security number count yet boards elections are required to verify the information or phallic camp be cast pennsylvana's malar voting has more fail states than traditional in personnel voting for fraudwell car with land balloting at a pelican effect to state when election has to have an at two points harvesters legally obtaining list of drivers licenses or social security numbers to complete applications and then cast ballast without voter's knowledge or word of elections workers conspiring to invalidate applications is there a lot of ballad harvesting while gathers hons of ballad harvesting in pennsylvania's suburbs is that going to be exacter ma all sure i mean the more eligible voters there are the organ ay have people where basely paid by the parties to go pick up the votes but republicans have a couple of choices here one they can wine about it than complain about it two they could just go out and make sure that ever re publican's registry vote they could ball harvest themselves and one of the things i cannot stand is when republicans complain about the the playing rules with no plan to change them well simultaneously ignoring actually being able to win with these rules the reality is that in flora out of these rules already obtained and guess what florid is a big republican state in the fact is that if you look a list of the states they have automatic motor registration that list is not all leftsling states some f the takes that already have automatic motor registration those include for example west virgin michigan they they include the state of georgia the laudistates that do not have all those things but there is some of the states that already do is it the end of the world in those dates know shear's the answer when the answer is win you can make excuses or you can go out and you can win and it seems to me the republicans he didn't making excuses an go out and soever the can to do do in order when these sections by the way they are doing some of the right things in pennsylvania i am impressed with the fact that dugmasteriano who's apparently considering a a senatorial run against have my comic in pensylvania has decided not to do h is instead indorse my comic in his potential senate run my normal was an excellent candida who probably should a ben the hominy last time against john fedderman you probably would run stronger than memos him running again i think his a is a very good move o a time for a quick thing that i and then a thing that i hate things that i to day the drove credit were credit is due the ladies the view occasionally are correct and apparently there now saying that it is bomb for the senate to change is dress cod just because john fedderman likes tower gimshorts well good for them we know really congratulations on saying something occasionally right and when constituents came in then when ye ta drop do up thin the ti the tier campers that paper camlincan walked in john mac cane tat john at can e in an jo tan there is a hollow court of down to a event a times or cut representatives ten to the faith tat bit i to walk of those halls and i i walked an to the sucre court i can an at i walked an to federal court rooms all the time and you do not wear jane an you do not wear shootings an you do not wear which you pul wear coming out of the him ti comedy let that you can to is just rest appropriately well i mean good for them well and there is a shock i did not i will m i did not see that one coming o a time for a quick thing that i hate as you may notice i am here an scaly can see the back drop of jerusalem behind me there's a new pull out from e p and r see and it fines that while america generally view israel as a just partner or ally many question whether the two countries shore the same interest in values first of all no two countries shriedensical interest let show be real about this the u pay dis not share identical interest with the united states neither is france i neither is germany countries have the own interest the just the reality however the notion that there is no cross over between israel the united states ans from s values is obviously untrue israel is in fact a mullite religious democracy it is a jewfish state but it has a scribal arab minority muscle minority many christian live here it is a partisan breakdown question and the reasoning to partisan break down question has less to do with israel and more to do with the left view of what america values are according to this pole about four in ten america said israel a partner the just should cooperate with but does not show the just is interests in values those results reveal t a partisans split more than half of democrats said israel is a partner that does not chair america values and interest but should be cooperated with compared with thirty two per cent of america of of republicans who said the same because it turns out that republicans over all believe that israel usher values with the united states why cause israel values general include things patriotism and judo christian dolt in the judo part of judo christian ludic o values religious values some sort of communal value religion a the do things left forcibly dislikes and when they look at a country israel they do not that very much the do not that israel is a nationalistic country despite fact that america has historically been a very nationalistic an patriotic country the fact that is a partisan breakdown it is pretty clear its happening here and has less to do with the redefinition of israel and much more to do with the redefinition of america along hard left lines jobidon for his part here as is really help to facts or relations between the state of israel and the united states that is because he has been effectively intervening in is daily politics in domestic politics in a way that that is rather unprecedented mean israel as far as in her has never really sounded off on for example how the supreme court a indicates rover's wide that is beastly with jobidon has done with regard to judicialreform in the state o israel and that is because he believes i suppose that he can a get an ally on the left to be the prime minister of israel if he pushes hard enough but don again i set it'll say again it that tat is much more reflection this poll of how the left thanks about america and america values than it is reflection of of israel changing in any significant way ardogises the rest of the so continues right a con mist will jump into the mel beg it for not a member

yesterday the republicans voted incredibly narrowly to impeach secretary of homeland security alehandro cercus very narrow because a few republicans defected through republicans defected and republicans as will discussing just a little while have a shrinking house majority but they were able on a two fourteen to two thirteen party line vote impeach the homeland security secretary what exactly does that mean in first answer is in practical terms means nothing his not going to be actually convicted in the senate there is no shot that he is going to be convicted in the senate it was in optical impeachment in the same way that was optical impeachment both times dona trump was impeached by the house of representatives but that does not mean that t was worthless it was worth while for a couple of reasons one it is imperative that the republicans in the house continue to highlight job bisons administrations refusal to enforce america southern boarder signora pure policy matter the administration has kept the southern boarder wide open the have completely restructured america emigration loss was to facilitate the mass migration of people up through america southern border you're talking about anywhere from six to ten million people who have entered the country illegally since jobidon local office people who are claiming asylum waving their arms getting picked up by border patrol and then being released on parol into the country never to show up again that is a deliberate policy decision made by this administration effectuated by the secretary of homeland security to be totally fairdalajandr marcs he works for mobile here is the other side of the impeachment was this really two questions one is is the for policy terrific and should be highland yesaterrific resit should be highland then there is the second question whether that merits impeachment on the merits of impeachment this depends on what you think impeachment is for for nearly all of america history people thought that what impeachment was actually for was high crimes an misdemeanors which is why it was barely ever used it was used in cases of bribery a couple of times it was being threatened against richer ninon before he reside but the reality is that the impeachment cat was never taken out of the bag unless you actually had high crimes and is demeanor to allege and then democrats two times alleged no crime bifocal trump and the impeached him twice and i said in both of those cases that impeachment was not merited because even if i wildly disagreed with donaltrum's actions between the election i nonmember of twenty twenty and canary six wot twenty twenty one there was no actual crime that took place bad behavior is not impeachable crime is impeachable an when it came to his conversations with vladamer's alensky the suggestion was that he had a conversation lodgers lens back to housing in nineteen in which he essential threatened the suspension america age you crane in the lead up to the war in crane specifically because you wanted the aucranian government to go and investigate hunter bison and bregma and the suggestion was that this was him a set essentially militarizing america military aid in order to pursue a political goal on his own behalf and that was the impeachable offense but there is no actual crime that was alleged in the impeachment documents it was all again bad behavior into i said both times even if you do not dona drums behavior this not impeachable democrats is agreed the impeach twice why impeach alehjandro amorous without actual high crimes or misdemeanors the reason is because if these are the new rules they applied to every one evenly and we should all recognize that if we want to go back to status duo anti if one put the cap back in the bag then we cannot have a situation which democrats get to impeach republican officials for not high crimes and misdemeanors and then republicans will only impeach for high crimes and misdemeanors the impeachment serves purposes one is an obviously political and i think well merited purpose which is go after this administration on their cat border policy and two is to reestablish a mutually assure destruction with regard to impeachment s that if both parties wish to restore what impeachment was for before which is just high crimes and misdemeanors let us go back to that otherwise is just onto be every one can basically assume that if in opposing party takes control of congress a party that is not the same party running the presidency that somebody in the white house is going to get impeached that just the way this is going to work according to the wallstry journal with the two hundred fourteen a thunder thirteen vote marches became the first sitting cabinet official and history to be impeached the jump he has been pursuing the impeachment for more than a year alleging that marches has wilfully refused to en force the nations and migration laws pointing to the record number of illegal crossings at the southern border marches is called those allegations false and of course is not going anywhere in the senate of the united states now again this does not mean that clean draw marichason doing a horrifying job he is doing a truly horrifying job but it is also true that there are no crimes that are actually alleged in the impeachment documents and looking the impeachment documents right now again the political case for impeaching mayor's or hall impeaching jobidon is very strong if by that you just mean this person is doing a really bad job and betraying their public oath of office and should not be in that job for example the impeachment documents say that alehandro marches has demonstrated he will remain that to national and border security the safety of the u us people and the constitution if a lodge remain in office and as acted in manner grossly in compatible with his duties in the rule of love and i totally agree with all of that again is that a high crime is demeanor now me i think jobidon does tot pretty much every day and that doe the mean he his committed a high crime or misdemeanor but again this about two things one is reestablishing a level of deterrents with regard to what used to be a ucallearoption in america politics impeachments a even when billclinton was impeach by the house of representatives billclyn had committed a crime billclint committed obstruction of justice that was alleged in the impeachment charging documents that is what was there it was democrats who broke this glass and now it is democratic an to have to put him back together that is all get to more on this in just one second first for all my christian listeners lends the forty days leading up to master starts to day it is time of intense prayer fasting and giving hallo's annual pray forty challenge is one of the most popular last year over one million people joined this year their pray forty challenge focuses in surrender and includes meditation s on the powerful book he leader me this is he story bat a priest you became a prisoner an slave in the movie union during the cold war his story is one of ultimate surrender and how we are all called to off up our own worries anxieties problems and lives to god there will also be lent music lenses of the bible stories and other lets in prayers the seven last words of christy with him coves how it is truly transformed of the help you connects with your faith on a deeper levels what exactly a waiting for down that hallo a to day tat hallo dot come slash o pure for an ex elusive three month free trial of more than six thousand prayers and meditations that hallo dot come slash shipuro here is nothing more jordan in or life than reconnecting with the divine hallo will help you do it but a hallo dot come slash apperill gat that exclusive at three month free trial of more than six thousand prayers and meditations to day tell what are the consequences fronts while obviously it keeps front and center all of the border failures of this administration and those border failures are myriad and superproblematic democrats our claiming of course that this is all ridicules an there is it there nothing to it and ins the same people who are claiming that it was perfectly fine to impeach donna trump over not high crimes an is meaner now saying that its really bad to impeach mayarcus over not high crimes admit demeanor of for example represent of can bondman who actually led the impeachment afford against trump he says that going after mayor's us just about taking a scalp well i mean that is true what do you think going after trump was as well the president and secretary my orcas and months negotiating see by partisan feel to stress the situation at the border which goes further than any democrat has ever gone before and all of a subtle after claiming that the administration needs to actress the border the republicans and doll true decide not we do not really want to solve the problems we want the problems that we can prod against the problems and that is notcredibly medical a not what this is all about it is taking a scalp secretary by orcas for the mock a back and trying to lay the blame at his feet for situation at the border that needs to be addressed but can only be a tress by legislation not by executive action and of course that is a li right what what the impeachment is about is saying the merichus has every legal tool at his disposal to shut the border democrats are of course claiming that you need some for by parts in peace of enabling legislation in on close the border which is not true another you hear by the way some republicans buying in to this rhetoric by suggesting that there needs to be additional funding at theborder there actually does not again i was down at the port a talk to the head of the borpatral union ion can watch that documentary that we made about at the first apostle of divided states voiding can check that out over a daily wire we discuss all this in adapt this is not a resource problem this is resource allocation problem and that is in fact about aljandromaorchus which is i for political purposes it is necessary to remind every one that this is solely on the biding administration that this really is about the biding administration and let us be real about this democrats have taken the open boarder's posit on taken jeffreys who is the minority leader of the democratic party those he says that grew abbot the governor of texts is the real problem because grew abbot is taking e legal emigrants and telling them that they n get on a bust to new york or chico he suggest that he is responsible for human trafficking for telling people that they can go to major america sanctuary cities but hoiden is not responsible for human trafficking for literally facilitating the entry of maybe ten million people intone country do you not see that the move by governor abbot of tacos a to boy migrants to democraticallyaning city such is new york or chico or danger that while you might think it is cruel it has been a active an demonstrating how this inflict inflexed migrant has same social service resources and demonstrated that this is a real crisis i do you d you agree with that governor abbot iran abaratmen an a human trafficker they want to keep the border open when you suggest that abbot is the embarrassment in the human trafficker it is pretty obvious what you want at all of this obviously plays in to broader concerns about jobidon's presidency the reason the democrats are very upset about the impeachment of mayor's is because obviously suggests the america people that jobidon is truly a bad president because jobidon is truly a bad president and all of the factors that are militating against his reelection are now coming into play according t bright bat a come president jobidonat maintained a plausible deniability while his family business raked in millions from several for entities including c e f s china energy company which compromise the president according to former bison family business partner toning bobolink he was talking to the house i preachment inquiry there is impeachment inquiry into jobidon himself his testimony is significant because of course you will remember that he actually did meet jobidon in the lobby f the every piston hotel and made twenty seventeen to discuss business with c e f s and he is also the whistle blower who mention bybolinski is that the infamous email about a stake of ten per cent held for by ah for the big guide the big guy was jobidon there is a carrot for jobidon according to bomolinsky he said the only reason any of the international business transactions took place with tens of millions of dollars slung directly to the bison family was because jobidon was a high office the bison family business was jobidon period other players have made this point very clear as well under bison himself is abdimently stated it in a variety of communications as did another bison family business associate divan archer in his testimony last year the perception of jobidon as some clean politician who is never been involved in eruption is obviously not true see and together his political in competent his accusations of eruption theatre still swirling around him those sort of taken a basic to the biggest issue surrounding him right now which is his obvious senility when he is obviously losing it ornamental level eighty six present of america by the late playing toy to think he is too old to be presidents of the united states and meanwhile democrats have no alternatives they are just we there's no way out but through for them and their defenses are we ting more and more strain creenjon pierce yesterday white house press secretary in competent terrible bitter jo she suggested that remember that horrible press conference the hoiden did on thursday night it was the worst press conference have ever seen from a presidents of the united state who specifically design to a swage america concerns about his mental state and he went out there and started spewing cream of wheat and then jabbering nonsensically about how the presidents of crypt was the president of mexico and such she set whose idea was that ti said of the time it was clearly jobidon's idea was no political consultant in their right mind would put apple sauce for brains out there in the middle of the controversy about whether he had applesauce for brains it had to be jobidon being a stubborn old dude and he was a i saga do jo and joke i jo ans a go it ad then he went out there and sounded that we here is current john were con firming the bodies who as jobidon's idea to get out there in front of the cameras and demonstrates that his brain has turned to mush for er were the c are to i you c er the present he one was is ti o corse for or i i t you it i t you saw the president out do this make a statement take queens from all of you because he wanted to do it re ism not going to get into private conversations at the present as the president is the president of the give fate if he says he wants to speak to direct to the america people he is going to to that yet well he decided that and then he did it and did not go amazing we it is more on this in just one second first you know it is

jobidon section make his transcripts of his con versions with the special council public because one of the cases the democratsman making as we will we in a moment is at the special council who totally sank jobiton's boat here he's the problem the special council had on his plate a real issue which was the jo biding clearly m scandal class my documents knowingly obviously he was on tape git is amazing how many of our politicians do the crime on tape it is it is first rule of chiming as have had a thousand times do not do crime n tape folks they watch the wire do not yo crime on tape but apparently all of our politicians break that rule jobidon was on tape with his ghost writer saying just a mini all the classify materials or of i just found the classify material which means he knew they were classified in that they were at his house which they violation of the ruin any case the way that the special council got out of that it was was by saying ye i mean it is true that he set all that but also we all know that his brain is no longer functional that he is in the clutches have encroaching senility and then democrats how dare he say that and people mere ill ha well if you say that he is not see nice men maybe you should release the transcript creensohn peas asked are they can release the transcripsinat i cars ton letter the itrageeral ain for the release tho the transcripts a reporting related to ears investigation given yer insist a the special count cariteration of the presidents to met er oh were an accurate are eagerallys material to be made or wen ten for they rely won look and i just wont to be really clear as not just us that was also a by partisan voices in the legal illegal experts who have said it was raw flatly draw right it was it was gratuitous t was in appropriate how that was characterize in in in o the special councils report for any other specific on the the transcript or anything related to that the letter i would certainly preferyou to my colleagues say you wank a the of give it anything you are word is flout and wrong two it is cannot they wank an materially ma win a mar w know what i n satin there discussing it there looking at it there is a process that involve and the arouse council an iris they has taken these questions from all of you and they're looking into it i just no have anything further to say about that yes and then they they are not can release those transcripts us can demonstrate whateverybody already knows and by the way we do not need the transcripts we can see him this my favorite part of this whole controversy for the jobidon has a mental problem at this point we have eyes folks he is the president every time he talks it feels he is about to keel over physically ye our a i gin me surprise by anything the transcript it'll be surprised of he shocking my articulate that is what all surprise me meanwhile the democrats again that keep thing pushed through nancy ploy who is eighty three years old legitimately eighty three because the entire leadership class of our country has been dead for twenty years nancy policy they are trotting her out to say the jobidon is sharp which is an amazing after trot out the lady whose two years older than jobidin to explain why old age and sharpness are ire not a acting jobidon amazing stuff here do you think that is the avenue the president bin should go down on this sort of poking fun at at in his ages is age the is is age yet i ta this fell worked with the president for long time specially was lie speaker when he was president and ow since that and he knows a me he his always on the ball he knows the issues he knows the let teslationtly how bright homo that e campaigned on it he remembers that a any one who would a think that there a some advantage because of his age a a thinks that at the peril because he is very shock thin n censure's a clacking is this is our country now how gensaki the former press secretary for woman she says that may be wishactually investigate robot her the special council yes we we should we should not talk about the twenty of amendment for our fading president instead we should talk about whether the special council is a bad bad man for noting the thing that every one can see because again we all have bibles is reporting and who e talked to when outside of what would be normal even for a special council do you think that should be invest the janitor looked into because in n the judicial system the judiciaries conofator not not a positive view necessarily by the america public at the flit well in the full that i have all i can do his pointed out which is you had and investigation that ran for fifteen months which could have been concluded in just a few months there was never any question the president had not engaged colonel wrong going he was the self reporting partyesere he had turned the documents over upon discovery cooperated in every respect and yet somehow in this report of the special council felt compelled to engage in this irrelevant unfounded and often projurative commentary and i think it is clear that of that commentary's in consistent with department normal a instil investigate the special council that is the taking you gesurdan grate chucksumer also an old man he is out there defending woman i am amused by the fact that legitimately every person in these conversations is is an elderly person chuckshumer is seventy three years old rs suction or he is the spring chicken of the group talking about how with it joins i talk to president lion regularly or sometimes several times in a week in usually several times in a week his mental acuity is great fine it is as good as it is been over the years have been speaking to him for thirty years since we owed on the brandy bill in the salt weapons man when i was at young congressmen and de he he is he is fine all this right wing propaganda that he is mental acuity is declined is wrong oh it ids it is tell wrong is it that is more on this invest one second first if there is one thing keeping me slivering now it is black rifle coffee last night we are back in from bad stage as really really late and then my three your old daughter came on in at five thirty this morning and do yow i was not your organ recover in time for the show and that is why a serin guzzling black rifle coffee

because even has bibles even john steward who is now return to comedy central to take over his old slot on the daily show he is now doing that i suppose every money he open with a bit about how not with it jobidon is and again this is a formant that all was suited john surbase non ever said he was on talented i said he is bad for the country now never said he was on tensed here is john steward opening up his guns on joint's mental acuity these you candidates they are both similarly challenge and it is not crazy to think that the oldest people and the history of the country to ever run for president might have some of these challenges now democrats we will say that any criticism likeness especially if bid is unfair because you just do not know biding they know biding if your telling has got the since is sharperfol energy at out tot of it really control and leading you should fill that that would be good to show to people instead of the into where he goes one thing we know for certain is this we have too candidates who are chronologically outside the norm of anyone who is run a for the presidency in this country and the history of this country they're the oldest people ever to run for president breaking by only four years the record that the thanks of this election do not make dona trumps opponent bless subject to scrutiny it actually makes him more subject to scrutiny if the barbarians are at the gate you want coin standing on the ramparts not suffice to say jobiton has a blunge of promising his realizes afford including the back by the way that in elation continues to truck along the consumer price index came out yesterday and what if owns that can summer prices rose three point one per cent in canary twenty twenty four from a year before remember they are hooting for two per cents this fifty per cent off prices rose the fastest for wide ride of groups for frozen non carbonate juices and drinks twenty nine per cent up they are bunch of products the are significantly more expensive now than they were before over the course plaster years hive s the everything is more expensive than it was before which is by the stock market took ha dump yesterday drop five hundred points because the market is realizing that it is not time for loose monetary policy again mean be see steveleesman he says lessen was aloin on for inflation while dasheen a lousy ten yer by jobidon friend elation as it turns out is is sure take about it that the giving i e you pic creases i is something i get is ta you i in flacon this time around a lot of a begin creases in medical coss ye had i mete cars our point seven i modern the going you o a to point for hospitals u is well you didedid not get mu sir you gat a little relief from the used a work yo at food prices o it was a just a busy on what a can you pick port real is also the cline i in the to a wort pointing out a yes things are bad for bite now does that mean that jobidon is going to when lose in in twenty twenty four we have some early indicators and they are not amazing for republicans last night there was an election in the house seat to succeed gorge cantos you are member tor cantos he is the weirdo who is fitting about his name and his sexuality and pretty much everything else gorge sand remember this lined chartist huckster maybe bible for criminal traits anyway h got tossed out of his seat by the congress and that left to see vacant that seat was a democrat district it had been rated to toss up by cook political report is a pretty hotly fought race between a democrats name tom sudsy tom sudsy had had that seat for a couple of terms before cantos took it in twenty twenty two and he was running against republican a massy pillow who is really s for of fascinating character thespian new who was pro trump but did not run her campaign on the basis of trump because issue had it would been bad that that is not exactly a a trump rich neighborhood jobidon won that district in any case that he pillow lost last night she lost because again there is a lot o money those tossed in tom quasi as a very strong ground game is very snowy outside and and all the rest but special elections in this elections like have not been going well for republicans over all that does not mean that that they are not always bell leather does not mean that is neserlian go amazing for democrats an twenty twenty four with that said these special sections if they are going for republicans would probably be an indicator that twenty twenty four could theoretically be a republican wave year in the face of democratic failures the problem is democrat's right now our only losing the house by a couple of votes with the loss of this seat the republican house majority is down to three or four total votes an some of those seats our curtly being occupied by people learn showing up for congress that means that in the upcoming twenty twenty four elections there is a very not insignificant likelihood the democrats and of taking the house and fall the talk about republicans taking the senate those then are races are very close one of things republicans should keep in mind is that there running against a dead person eighty six per center theamerican public thinks the jobidon is dead they hate him on every issue and republicans are aging dead even in pretty much every poll down rums bring dead even with jobidon one of the ways that you can militate against that the can fight against that is to use every voting tool at your disposal one of the big problems in new york is the republicans did not vote early they did not use mail and ballast who did the democrats the democrats use the man and ballast now who could in the republican party who would have suggested the mail and balls are stupid show use them who would've proposed such a foolish proposition they you should never that it is its somehow morally bad devote early if your republican thus losing two centeteats in georgia and may be his own presidential election downs rum better flip on that right fasts because use every method at your disposal to win it is legal why would you not encourage republicans to vote early according to the wolstry journal sari will succeed gorge cantos he cutting when already narrowed cup majority in the chamber the partybreak town is currently two nineteen to two twelve sari be back criticism from pill up over the by administrations stewardship of the southern for as well as the handling of epic dams of the migrant crisis in new york city sari said the race was center an emigration and the economy much the issues all across our country we you on this race because we addressed the issues an found away to bind or division sushi is a more of a moderates democrat in sum respects in fact as soon as his election was announce a bunch of procomasprotester show up instar yelling at i that is of this look with that did this was a pretty solid victory by sushi was not artist close election handed up when about four fifty four to forty six in the election if again if democrats had lost this seat it would ben red blinking light right in their face but they did not the republican mouth is still rough emigration is not can be enough s o can be the only issue for republicans in the twenty twenty four election this now makes the second major congressional election in which republicans have tried to make emigration center piece and it did not quite work don true tried to do it in twenty eighteen and it really did not renounce for the republican benefit de moral had pretty high turn out because they wanted to show up and take back the district and once again that main voting problem is a problem republicans disappointing grope turn out on the day of could cripple trump and this is now pattern for re publicans across the country then too this in just one second first let us say that you need top grate your employment base let let us say that you had a producer and he is

points out that there is also a special election yesterday in bucks county pensylvania to determine control of the state house of representidates ire's a biding plus ten district s solidly biding district the race was called four the democrats over the republicans with only forty three percent the vote counted why well because the democrat won the mail an vote eighty six to fourteen eighty six to fourteen why because republicans keeps saying stupid things do not vote by mail due due due do not do that the other thing the you should not do is probably you should not run every congressional or senate race on the basis of does donate trump love the candidate personally the candidate in that race again massy pillow was on anti true candidate just got in a person who made trump the centerpiece for campaign and do trump is a very bad habit which is crap on candidates some of whom he indorses by the way who then go on to lose by suggesting that if they tied themselves more closely to him they would have once he put out a statements and quote i have not almost ninety nine per cent indorsement successorate in primaries and a very god number in the general elections as well but just watch this very foolish woman massy pillow running in traces where she did not indoors me and tried to quit on quit startle the fence when she couldhave easily won if she understood anything about modern say politics in america mage which is most of the republican party stayed home and it always will unless it is treated with the respect that it deserves i stayed out of the race i want to be loved give us a real candidate in the district for nonmember say i know well can be easily beaten a i mean no me no it turns out that running races in congress specifically about trump is not a recipe for electoral victory is just not they area lot o purple districts or people do not particularly love trump there is some districts red districts where you can love trump as much as you want then's be good for you during that heavy red district those districts tend love dona trump this district when for jobidon in the twenty twenty election running on the basis of i love trump in a bison plus eight or biding plus ten district would not exactly be smart politics if republicans continued to follow that road in elections that is not going to end particularly well for them it just is not s again the factors against jobidon's reelect are very solid but can republicans snatch defeat from the jaws victory you that you are ass they and tee really good at it there is ben the last few years doing it mobile was a week candidate in twenty twenty too and somehow he won again republicans better yet smart about all of us o can meanwhile the congress continues to debate this massive foreign policy aid bill it is now move to the house in ninety five billion dollar aid package but sixty billion dollars in military aids u crane antis wen we should be clear that the sixty billion dollars in military as u crane a large part of that is to re stock the america military build up that is already gaunt cranes we sent weapons to u crane that was military aid and now we have to restock all that for own purpose is and that is considered military aid to u crane and t we we have to it is study not a bad thing for america military base to be built up that is study quite a good thing now the question as have said is is all sixty billion dollars of that necessary in order o prevent russia from taking the country laid all of the tout yesterday that what is amazing about our form policed battles no one is willing to clearly state what their en gull is on virtually any of this and because republicans are not being clear but what there uncles are that blows democrats not to be clear about their uncles if republicans to citizen we would to provide the amount of money to you crane necessary to prevent russia from overrunning its current positions that's the amount money we are willing to send and meanwhile wants to aggressively have the president and a department ne negotiate in end to this conflict that looks what everybody knows the end of the conflict is can look likeuhage is a solidification of the care border situation plus america security guarantees in european security guarantees to u crane that is effectively the outline of the if republicans said that word be very hard for jo bison to come back with something different cause everybody knows that is the logical solution it but instead republicans seem to be implying some republicans seem to be implying for example that it would be totally fine not just if gotten word to continue the war but if puttingwere to overrun leave and that allows jobidon to then go out there and suggest that this foreign aid bill it is all about preventing reeve from being overrun which it is done clear to me that that is what it is about there is much other garbage in the bill is well another wars there many good principled grounds to oppose the foreign aid package an say that it is too large you could even suggest i thing a little bit less careful credibly that it is a is prioritization because we need to spend that money on the borders have said before the promise record is not a money problem plus let s be real about this the amount of money that we have currently granted in to to foreignaight evening places crane amounts to approximately a fraction a small tiny little fraction of what the america budget typically is if your talking about the amount that has ben provided to you crane over the course of this war which would be mounted maybe a hundred billing dolicestook one point four per cents of the america annual budget you're not talking about the kinds of money the bankrupt the economy the see the bankrupts the economy by the ways all the entitlement programs that no one is willing to touch and that is why a we find at ironic there some people who are real spending how i ran pulse spendinghawk there certain people for definitely not spending hawks and now they are bucking at the spending i lay ay feel that is now what this is really about in any case jobidon is using republican lack of clarity on what they wants in order to push the idea that re publicans want patent to win which again have talk to many of the senators were voting against the foreignade bill they do not want putting to win they just think the forehead bill is too large but this is why behaves you to be cleaner about your positions on these particular issues well get to that in just one second folks i have good news in give badness the badness is most of the products in your bathroom they are wok yen look at them look at the commercials for the produce bought ataman wok the good news is germs once help you wash the work away with fifteen per cent off all of your essentials along with germy skin products the facial lens er in moisturizer are made with natural ingredients alive am charcoal and hileronic acid and germ's leaves out toxic chemicals carabin supplies and fliteevill how can you wash off toxic values if you are using toxic chemicals you now that that one that ism talking about it is fell p h t h a l t s that is why found jobidon taking right there haw drover to germs razors tot tom to get germ's skin care for fifteen per cents off to day along with all of your other essentials or can meanwhile jobidon is now attempting to play republican hastens to pass this giant foreign aid package which again has bunch bad elements maybe to much aid for you crane depending on what exactly is the annual here certainly to much aid for quoting what the palstinians in gosh which again unspecified how that money even gets into the outstrip who takes it the america tamper sports are petty much all of comes weapon re tunnel building and all the rest over the course the past twenty years seems to be the america taxpayer should stop subsidizing actual terret groups this areal good reasons opposed the forignade bill when in fact i think it should be passed by the house in pieces i think that if you are mi johns the best pathford is put up a clean israel aid bill separately put by clean you crane a bill of the size that you think is necessary to prevent glance patent from overrunning reeve put that up separately for but clean titan aid bill and force democrats devote on each one of those things and force joining to veto each one of those things how did be the s mar politics here because the truth is that there is a majority proposition four foreign aid on each of these things just as e political matter is an eighty twenty matter that most america believe that the amount of support that america has provided to israel is either right or needs to be increased when i comes to the amount of foreign aid that has been provided to you crane they are still is a broad majority that believes that enough for an age would be provided to you cranes that russia doesn't take it over if that is the proposition and then the question is how much aid that actually is away it is pends ut of course i knawel these polls on his you asked the question were say should you crane get more aid many america will say no if you say if bladmerpooten will take over you crane if they do not get more aid should you crank get more aid most america will hen to yes when it comes to ti want that is a broad majority proposition most america believe that ti wan shod be armed enough to repel a chines invasion or chines blocked and you pass all those independently bowed we pat ford fort my johns force the democrats to the floor on this one a but because no one's been clear bout their position that allows tolidine to get out there and store his words about all that into yesterday jobidin does a press conference it was literally if vein a press conference took no questions he is doddering he is not solid here he was yesterday the way work is we supply loran with no o from our stockpile now we stand our money replenish o stockpile i notary has access stockily in a mad right here in america by america workers a i do not an know it what he means by let in he does not take english any more but again he isn't tire stick is he believes that if he yells it republicans about mouton that is con to have the same impact as republicans yelling at him but emigration i really do not think that the case here he was yesterday suggesting the republicans have turned propouten i and house maker house publicans the got i si around stand a for freedom iguana did wit cabin corny e stand wit you canso sand pouted we son wit america or chum be an democrat in sin can tone the sand asinine the world start o house o public do want in pas i to immediately stand pernicious et what state democracy sand up o calmly to help an a welkin america security ay we lea these sorts of truisms where e says teniforfor i say tin do not that sort of stuff when ye talk florin policy form policies about hard headed america interests that does not mean that we shouldn't back country's that at our more pro america over countries that are more anti america we should generally speaking it does nomen we should not back liberty when we have the ability to do that is try also but let us be real about this the reason that we are backing you crane in the fight against pouted its for very strong get political reasons you want a throw china off the ball with regard to invading ti wan you a weekend the russia militaries that provided less of an ally to the chines you want to make sure that russia cannot spread it is tentacles into africa in the middle east you want to make sure that russia does not have it is eyes on plans or on lithuania or latvia or a estonia and these are all good get political reasons very few of them have to do what this kin of be ad ogres and that sort of stuff because again there is our arguments that as we sustain local prove too much they're many democracies that are under three in the world doesn't mean that necessarily united states has a role and all of that there lots of place were bad stuff its happening does mean the united states has a role and all of that either this happens to be a place where the united states can sign a reasonable check and not safety billion is the size that reasonable check but in any case republican lack of clarity opens the door to biding being able to do the sort of propagandizing and you can see that i chuck summer was out there yesterday promoting the idea that sis one on most consequential bills in america history which i i have some questions long night along week end and a long few months but a new days here and our efforts have been more then worth it to day we witnessed one of the most historic and consequential bills have effort has the senate it certainly been years perhaps decades since the senate has the bill that is greatly in pats not just our national security not just the security of our allies but the security of western democracy a gas si again the the the sort of game that he is playing here write that this bill or nothing that this ort o binary stupidity has always been particularly done now what is going t happen in the house o mike johns has said that he has no intention of bringing the bills currently stands up far for a vote on the floor and as i say i think that he is just carve id up and provide piece meal bills for each one of these priorities first pall ten the that anyway don't ism nabs packages that imonabus packages ten o be crapsandwiches s i be much happier with single issue bills that people the devote up or down on you soft want ad for israel fine vote on it you don't want are for you crane fine vote on it might just do it that way but there is another way that the house could the critically go round mike johns is something worth considering as just a possibility and that is a discharged petition get ready the is i think democrats actionable nobly try to pray this a discharge pit petition would require about two hundred eighteen members of the house majority to force consideration of a piece of legislation on the floor essentially you get a piece paper everybody finds it yet two hundred democrats and take twenty republicans the house to sign the he's paper and then it moves forward through this arduous process and he majority effectively loses control of the floor unlikely it moves forward that way because again i do not think democrats account want this thing pass i think democrats would prefer to use it as something to run on democrats are accusing republicans of that with regard to an emigration bill there is i think a grain of of some truth to that i think it tell for true for democrats i think democrats right now would prefer to see re publicans kill the thing in the house s they can then run on the idea that america are week national security which is why it behaves republicans to be clear about what they want and what they do not want and right now you have a fractured narrative from republicans over the foreignade are they doing it because it actual do not mind putting running over you crane are they doing it because they do not want is real big to feninsof against comose or are they thing were spending to much money and there spending has a tombs masses or a ran pal or are they saying that they want a grant for any that you do not want a the train bill they been totally in clear about which of these pass their choosing that is a lowing democrats to spin this thing for can meanwhile speaking of republicans not handling politics competently we mentioned yesterday that donate trump would to see lava trump become chair of the trance and as i mentioned yesterday i do not really know lar trump it alglti've never met her i soft believe in of anything gens lar trump ism not a big fan of dynastic politics i just think it is wrong an bad i do not it when its canton i don't one is bush and i do not it when its trump either i particularly do not it when entire republican apparatus's are mobilized in favor of one man at the expense of conservative victory across the country the grandee is not just supposed to be about the presidential race that is why the president has done super packs my the president has own campaign fundraising apparatus the arise is supposed to be about congressional races it is congress matters and senate races because the senate matters bel lava trump she is out there if if's therepublican party is basically just pledge pet pledge fealty an allegiance to donate trump that is not a party any more it is not and it is certainly to a vehicle for victory because dona trip is not popular enough to do that democrat's by who tried the same thing with brokabama and it failed parties do not succeed when they are not coalitional parties must be coalitional they must include people what lukuarmon trump or even cold on trump but we will vote with trump eighty five to ninety per cent of the time taking all of your campaign resources and directing them toward a presidential and forgetting about the legislative body we are all legislation commences that is a mistake but that's what tear r trump was saying choose literally out the yesterday as the possible to chair of the grandee suggesting that every time raised by the araks she should go into the presidential race which is wild that is not how the durance is supposed to working by the way it is does work that way republican to get their assiskicked up and down the ballet here is what i can tell you the ran see needs to be the leanest most legal political fighting machine we have ever seen an america history that is the goal over the next nine an a half month if i am elected to this position i can assure you there will not be any wore seventy thousand dollars or whatever exorbitant a not o money it was spent on flowers every single penny well go to the number one and the only job of the ran seethe that is electing donate jay trump as president of the united states and saving this country gay ism that is not what the brandy is for the arise is not just for getting trump eat the president it is about other candidates as well and the problem with this mentality is that what it means having seen how donate trump responded to the loss of massy pillow in the new york three race if it turns into the only people that donate trump indorses are the people the aransea backs and the only people who pledge total fealty to donate trump are the people that the aransey backs that is not recipe for success again that i would to see just politically twenty twenty five canary twenty twenty five i want see down trump its president with a solid house majority and a republican and republican majority in rented as well that is my top priority i just politically speaking i want to see republican unified electoral command of the legislative branches of government as well as the executor branch or government anything that is an obstacle to that up to an including declarations of fealty directly to down trump is stupid if the areinsee is on a run itself this way this is not the way to win as proof of this proposition i have twenty eighteen twenty twenty twenty twenty one twenty twenty two and now twenty twenty three ism not your humming morelections we have to run in order to understand that done trump is not in fact and should not be the center of every congressional race every centare race that is not a good strategy for victory in an incredibly diverse country with a lot of congressional distracts and senenseeds that that do not share all the same priorities it'll get a your its if i do not comment on a clip that has been making the rounds to day it is a clip a a tucker carleson ism not sure when this is from a mussels brand start of putting this out as i mussels have had mussels on the show mulbletons have many conversations it rustle an encase a tucker i once again went after me rather personally here here here he was we have a right to be mad at least an limits against speak for america middle aged america a which is what i am have got fordraftae children if you are playing recklessly fast and loose with their lives that i have a right to despise you and i do if you are nick hales tweeting for prisoner kinship peer or half the people i see on television casually mentioning the possibility of nuclear war or sending america to fight in the middle least or in any way involving us in a war that has nothing to do with prosperity and peace at home nothing other is to do with us america then i have a right to call you out and be really a fennicas it is my family they live here it is not a joke to me its knows nothing abstract about it and that is the difference between what is happening in the mddleast from what is happening in e crane by which i had very strong feelings but i don't ink there was a realistic possibility that my kids could be emashedin it now there is and the only people who claim uts decisive to pull people's attention back to their own families their own communities or the people profiting from your attention being five thousand miles away that is just true and and its true because they do not even debate you they name call your pro tear your whatever o shut up let us be clear about this one tucker is just lying about my positions here have never called for bouts on the ground n you cranulisten to the show that is the case have never fall called for america boots on the ground in israel by the way do i thing it is good for america that he are bunch of pro comas people running around tearing down posters of kidnap people including america now i do not the that is very good for america and i actually do see a fairly significant problem in the west if you do have hundreds of thousands o pe pole marching in support of a terrorist group that seems a fairly pool america position to me but tucker has been spending months is characterizing my positions lying about my positions as from messing with a show have offered many times to sit down with tucker he has said he is willing his team has said that he is busy for months because of form travel that offer remains open already folks the rest of the show continues

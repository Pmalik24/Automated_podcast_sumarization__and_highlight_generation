well folks last night was the new samphire primary and as expected dona trump blew away the field this of course was not a giant shock the polling just before this particular primary atonal trump up twenty plus points in many of the poison true actually went and visited a bunch of the sites big crowds there and he was very grumpy here is what a sounded bi crowd yer e teeth er a b i e i i we to r we stop e a li ti we i e a a a we ma stop e i for a ad nobody do we i o e ti i see ma i i li an in e e i other the re er no no the at i don e i was a let e o t e e to a to ti a at i a i a ta i the e et a wo e like i make e we e grate i n the i the li i e i i top her li we at e three for e o we ma be a i ti a e we a like i an ti i si e he wins the primer is a over they are over after up ism not sure what else there is to say about that it does raise the question of just why nickel hale failed to resinate as sort of the anti trump candidate now part of it is that there just is not in anti trump wing of the republican party sufficient to actually overtrump overcome the the protium wing of the republican payments on trump became the hominy in twenty sixteen everybody came home and then are became he again an twenty twenty and eave he's coming hoe again an twenty twenty four that is not a giant shock that is in fact away politics works and people who are looking and his results in say new hampshure in twenty sixteen and saying he is on a replicate his thirty five per cent and new samphire in twenty twenty four are ignoring the fact that in the intervening period he became the president of the united states and then ran and entire other election cycle and now is running yet a third election cycle but the outsize the animus for nickel valley that you see on some parts of the ranaduthing its outsizes part of that is because if you oppose trump there's a part of the bushtit just is angry at you for having a post trump and alcove it has to do wit that i in nick hale again was his can ambassador she was some worked for him she summon whose praised his presidency and the idea that she smirch a wild anti trump force i think is wrong but what nickel hale does have is an affect problem that is out of i would say pattern with the modern re publican party the republican part at this point is in fact a party that is angry and i think justifiably angry on a number of squares one of the things the the republican party is angrabout the base particularly they're very angry about hearing about racial divisions they been lectured since two thousand eight since brakeman round for president thousand seven they been lectured that america was coming close to racial unity only to have that ripped away from them and and watch as everybody sort of retreated back into tribalistic corners and this is haw you went up with critical race theory and d my an equity throat the by administrations en the hear from members of the re publican party about how america is a place that was replete with discrimination even twenty years ago or thirty years ago they attend think i not sure that the person who saying that is the person that i want fighting this fight today nothing people are lying about their experiences of twenty oar thirty years ago but to point out that your experience of twenty or thirty years ago is does that make you the person who is best suited to fight against the d e i culture to day the reason that is coming up is because there is a clip of nickihalyw the one viral just before the primaries in which she was talking about her childhood and again whet she says here i do not think is actually wildly controversial except that it is very much at odds with the attitude of many members the republican bays which is to say are you going to stand up against the predations of the d i c a t culture are you to stand up against the idea that america a place of racial decision with sufficient alacrity or are you going to try to play a little a identity politics for gain here is the clippinickihlo in totally viral we were the only in one family and our small southern town i was teth every day for being brown any one that wants to question it can go back an look at what have said on how hard it was to grow up in the deep south as a brown girl what i will tell you is than that i had blate friend as a there of pride thing that i had white friends o thorn of pride don't you wan i know what it was white growing up i was this qualifihte from a bandy patched because i was at white or bad because the did not know where to put me the look i know the hardships the pain that come with rah of it is the rather that i fight polite everyday when it comes the racon antithemitasm or hate and i always well at the reason that clip won final on the right is because again the question is is she saying that service off to manner to legacy media or is she doing what time goes word did during the campaign a says look how far we have come have suffered from races i know what that is but america is a place of opportunity and to pretend that america to day is when america was yesterday is foolish or is to say am a diverse candidate both for me kind of play i think lot re publicans took away the latter message from eclipse that one and a obviously did not help meckahaly now again i think that is combined with the lot of people who are very protrude and very angry that anybody would deign run against trump whatever the result it did not end of well for nickehaly in new samphire over all that she says that she is not going to drop out of the race just yet she said yesterday that she was not going to talk to political bit varies i did not get i ai o on o a a o ti i to a o ta o t e ta iweitai o to i ta i we a o i i for a i o o o i a in now it is couple weeks until south caolinean do i think the nickel halers can a stay in all the way until south caroling ism not sure exactly whys you would make you us to rack up some delegates in case there is an act of god an something happens to trump an they go to the convention she says imam the person with the second most delegates and make her case there maybe she was to trade her delegates for some for slot into administration that is that is quite possible to whatever it is the primaries are over they have universe than tidal everything else is merely a a sort of wast of of time and effort i think spending more time on it now with all that set give your a democrat you sort of feel trap make just snap closes on youroponents for a long time democrats protecting the legs media been saying that all of dona trumps opponents their terrible there awful they are no good their very bad except for like hale who is kind of out and the resins tenuous kind of woke is because again of that sort of softer affects that sh has but do not worry if nickel hale had actually become the re publican nominasuemen just the bat of trump worse than true because she is more seductive in terms of her politics and interns of her mean than than trump is and that that that would a ben the play but now that trump is the nominee yourstaring see poles that are emerging in the swing states to pull from pennsylvania with trump down at to jobidon the the attempt to move from donate trump is the carious person in the world you can nominate him plus all donate trumps opponents are even worse than dona trump rip on to san is rip on hale rip on everybody else in the media by the media and then trump gets the nomination all the sudden sike all look at that he is losing in the wins watch for that move from the legal media and of course it is way to early to tell whose on when the selection who is got lose this election end keep your my on that polling data just second on talk about a fascinating list cushion slash abate that i did with a liberal streamer who calls himself destiny actual name steepen benzol billet's that n just one second first you have to use o van whenever you connect to tenet we exactly would you not do that i know that adding extra step to anything you do it sounds giant hassle but if you knew how easy it is to protect your connection with express van well you be doing it already express v in is the easiest way to browse the intern at safely an securely express v in get's rid of all the things he hate about vans other reins slower

enjoy instant protection across all your devices once you connect to express van you do not even realize yo have an on it your connection is in fact security data is in fact in ripped it express van has been called the best van by business inside her integrated obviously i agree i use express van myself right now en get extra three month of express you in for free just go to express a van dot come slashed that is e x p r is us van o come slashed to get three extra months of express van for free can express in dot come slash ben it is the worlds at best t van give used it for years you should use it as well protect your data because it is your data today express a van dot come slash ben one at week ago we can have a go i sat down with a liberal streamer named stepped below he calls himself destiny amine gut a big following among and frankly really had not heard much about him or viewed his videos much until i agree to debate him on less freedman's so and can listen to the entire debate over at lewis cutup mental and is really i thin worth the listening couple hours long the reason ant sort of fascinating is because we covered a lot of ground and one of because pieces of ground re covered is the debate between bison and trump and tonal play a little bit of that for you rite here because i think that this is going to be the debate obviously going into the twenty twenty four election his the debate between bison and trump the the debate did not cents ore particularly much on jobidon's record because the truth is that robin's record he's deeply food and gang to get to more of that in just one second instead it centered on hes central contention that inbeing made by people who are voting for bison which is the dona trump ought to be ruled out just right away just right off the bat dona trump is cannot be president of the united states because he is just to scary he is too device he is too tyrannical what destiny said was that dona trump is the most device political figure in america history and when i pointed out to stepped is that jobidon is in many ways more device of why because when dona trump came into office dona trump was expected to bedeviciv he were any secrets about dona trump being a device of character he came into office he did not have a positive approval rating for but maybe two days is entire presidency job was expected to be a person he united the country and then he completely failed here her's what i had to said cans for our head of state our chief executive should rhetoric be arguably one of the most important things that he does mean the answer would be s and now ben given a choice between a person if i think uncalibrated ways says things that are device in a person who an uncalibrated ways says things that are decisive and the evidence that jobidonis decisive is every pol taken since essentially august give of twentytwenty one he he is by all available metrics incredibly decisive a huge percent of america are deeply unhappy not only with his performance but do not believe his united ad this is one of the things that i think that democrats ought kep in mine is that democrats are our thinking just right off the bat that dona trump is device because it is rhetoric and all the things he says but our people disappointed with trump or he's trump kind of what he always was because one of feelings i get is that people are deeply disappointed in job n that is a very difficult feeling to shake if you are disappointed in a political candidate he attend to turn away from that political candidate that was acute the story the went to election between two thousinate two thousand twelve brokamama act lost votes he is the first in commend president to lose votes and somehow retain the presidency now why did that happen how count he retain the residence in the answer is he got people who were largely unenthusiastic about voting to vote and that's particularly true for black voters an twingstakes a per romance that is not et ben replicated by any democrat help clan or hoiden when it comes to presidents we are expected to unite and then divide the america people do not that the in would rather know what they are getting than be disappointed in a promise that is unfulfilled there is no promise the trump is made that is unfulfilled good and bad but jobidon came into office on the wings of eagles jobidon came into offices pledging tat he was going to unite tho country is on t bring honor and the adults back to the white house and instead he is provided terrible leadership and dive sofrederic and speeches in which he bibles half the country terrible and awful and threats democracy we also talks about the idea of tyranny stepped focus a lot on canary six he focus a lot on the idea the trump would if he could be a tyrant and the point i made is that donate trump yo would he would he exercise power if he could exercise power in ways that i would not sure he is said that he would he recently went on as wittersprig or a truth social spring in which he claim that the president has what he called absolute immunity for any crime ever do i think that he would effectuate that if he could sure is he going to do any of that no he is not here he here is hi explained it to stepped when we are talking about o which character is more tyrannical jobidon has used executive power in ways that far out start anydingthat as that it has been stretching a stretching a stretching executive power o jo bite is going jobidon has gone well beyond anything trump even remotely attempted to maintain to i just pure executive power jobidon literally used the occupational safety and hazard administration hour try to cram down bad man can eighty million america that is insane surely right tat i an not relief student wonder and then try to relieve the hundreds of billions of dollars and yet but what to that they got struck i its from and then they still did it they still did it bison brags about it hes again i think that a lot of the points that are being used against trump are not actually diapositive and and i think that really is the name of the game for democrats if they cannot kill trump right off the bat if they cannot kill as canary right off the bat they got a probes what exactly is the fuel they are going to add to the fire between now and nonmember what exactly is the information that is going to come out about trump this going to change anything i do not really see i another biggest prom of all for jobidon is not just that he is bad on policy which in will get to in a moment the biggest prom for gobies that here is a conflict of visions between jobidon's view of the world and what the america people think he is guided by in upper cross liberal let a coders that does not think the rest of the united states thinks and that refuses to to kind of engage in the kind versions that the rest of america are engaged in there's a appall that on to get to in just one second that explains were a lot of the democratic party ten is coming from it and is not coming from the same place that most america are coming from wllgeto that momentarily first in a world filled with uncertainty you need to be prepared for any possibility what you actually need is my patriot supply my picture supplies your trusted partner for emergency prepared then the country's

food storage you put in the lousy forget about it and then god forbiddenemergency happens your area ready but prepare with bend come are your three month emergency supply again go to prepare with bend come right now that is prepare with ben dot tom ay the conflict of visions may be the story of not only this election but the election of twenty sixteen between dome trump and celery canton there is a a person name you'll noaharari you have all no harass is in author and a professor in the primal of history toe brew university of jerusalem but do not let that title fool you he is sort of a a pop sociologist just certain a pop anthropologist and he happens to be a militant atheist and here is his view on life an the reason bring this oasis i think this is actually the view of a huge number of liberal minded elects in the united states and it is completely at odds with the way that most people i think think here is oval nova noharari he is giving a ted tog here is what a sounded many may be most legal sisters of bate on this idea is belief in you in arts but you in arts of just heaven and god it is just the frictionless store the thieve invented and spuderod states and nations o also youanrits and god and heaven the too of o o jest stories sire o you not it takes the just stories very awful stories stories we might not to believe very much but still felt just stories you contain we the not it takes you cannot content you cannot smelling there realities once you create this fact dale disconnect whence you get rid of that divine or any rational basis at all or faith basis for fundamental first principles then you all very quickly into moral relatives and once your moral relatives mat is very hard to escape it and that is why there is a really fascinating pull that came out recently from rasmuson and it looked at the people who are sort of the we describe as the lets here is out the skies an pulling group describes it they we the people who run america or least think they do live in a bumble of their own construction there isolated themselves from everyday amebic in realities to such degree their views about what is and what should be happening in this country differ widely from the average america and analysis of their thinking conducted for the committed to else prosperity finds that on a variety of economic social and political actions there exists a wide gap between how the top one per cent the elevates think things should be and hove the rest america looks to them how do they to find the alerts these ere be to fined as people having at least one post grad degree case of the are people than scraduay college they have a j d an m b n m d earning at least a hundred fifty grand annually living in a high population dens to to area sad be lake a new york lawyer who graduated from an joy you or something and then in compares what these elites think to what the rest of america things what they find is this vast disconnect serious and vast disconnect for example in in time when most america have suffered a loss of real take company seventy four per cents ivy let's say hey are financially better off to day than i the past for so twenty per cent of all america and that this connect make sense love these people sat home during coven and they did just find and they do not really understand why other people do not feel that way i got that have lot of friends who who made money over the last several years but that is not the experience most america that is really not these parents and if you do not understand that than y u have a disconnect the enough to experiencewhen other people experience to understand that what they're saying is correct when most america say the economy is not wood for me they are right the economy is not good for them nearly six in ten of these let's say there is too much individual freedom in america double the rate of all america how do they get to that these are people who are experiencing the highest levels of freedom of any subgroup in the united states they more monetary freedom many of them they have more educational freedom they have more freedom to move about they have more choices in life presumably but they say there is too much individual freedom in america why because you'll know party they do not believe that freedom is not inherit right because rights are social constructions there t their stories that we make up to tell ourselves to night and these are the sophisticates and these sophisticates are interested in building a system of their own making for you more than two thirds of these people favor rationing a vital energy and food sources to combat the threat of climate change again that is because they can avoid all of this they do not believe that they would go back to living in a nature or preserve or log cabin they may say they do be they are actually have to live that right now and that seems very far away from them easy for them to say but they say that sort of stuff again why because to them property rights ore kind of relevant cause they already own the things in fact the people w need property writes the most typically are not t people army own but he people who are going to need to own in order to get out of the situation in which they currently live any to more this palling in just one second first a struggling with back taxes or have

conditioning not e mental air travel to protective environment about six of these ten of leaves have a favorable opinion of the called talking professions be lawyers lobbies politicians an journalists now again i think norms in america look at that the lawyers those are people meetings more complicating costly money lobbyists those are people who work for industry and then engage in regular for capture politicians those are people who stand in the way of my prosperity journalists are people who lid to me have thin its how many america feel bout er institutions right now but the eludes because these are the circles in which they walk have a lot of faith in institutions that the rest of america has been disabused about well here is the the key stature present and bison hasn't eighty for per cent job approval rating from this group there is roughly twice as high as the general public that is that is a massive gap a massive gap again when it says does the unitedstates provide too much individual freedom too much government control or the bounds about right fifty seven percent to america say about too much control ivy my graduates fifty five per cents a to much freedom a that gap finds the by administration the by ministration is defend by this gap now again i think that normal people are not thinking this o don't think normal people think that things country and borders are artificial abstractions created out of thin air they're stories that we just tell ourselves arbitrary stories that we can change at any time and in fact i think that the stories that that replace those stories even if you buy udo nohorares frame workers the stories that are place those tries are much worse then the stories that if historically been accepted by human beings the the replacement for stories about church for example has not been a better story that we olostovs has been a much worse story this is why it is fascinating during that debt with destiny the liberal streamer the the question of low birth rates came up and you vow to horary might ha we least because of a story that we tell ourselves about human freedom in contraceptive freedom o gat fine but the answer to that story is the better story in that that story could be answered now with puzzlement and bewilderment but with the simple with the simple three word answer her's what that sounded the one kind of weird thing that we are coming up against that we havebeen coming up against a now for firs o number of degatesble continue to is a society's progress sames people are having last children and i actually do not know what hun set what the answer is to that question a an you at i mean an implementable answer that works that we know we can get everybody on word with by the answer ma m answer was good church frilegon yes actually yes now there is two ways for people who are liberal to get out of that one is to say let us a story you tell yourself to false story and were just not king o do it the other way is to say shall maybe if the thing has worked over time it is worth actually examining whether it is a true story maybe there is some truth to that story but that is the thing that they leads cannot abide because if there is truth to many of the narratives the are exists them then they got a problem is these hare the intellectuals these of the postgrabs these of people heard these successful lead in our society they want to restructure society according to their own story but what if the story that preexists them was not in arbitrary story maybe that story was there for a reason ashallyov all people deem chilies the the democratic minister to congress person i think and stumbled upon this he was jousting with the media he is run against jobidon in quixotic campaign in new hampsure against the coin president but he went off on the mediacies there asking much questions and he said listen you are not even asking the questions america care about and that makes perfect sense his journalists many of them are part of this select cover who have a different value sister from the rest of america says eighteen thousand times ism only doing us to the feet tom from nobody seems to want to do that in the demon critic are you right now other than we because u bit cant is might proposition because the at is as he cant no one in the country in out perks an tact most of people the country going to the trout rally right now us he is listening to them no one's asking about this to just frustrated out we understand why ism getting tired of it you are doing your jobs but you are not asking the questions that america you about he happens to be correct he happens to be correct democrats are not giving answers to the questions the america care about and journalist are not even asking the questions the america give a crap tat in fact there definition of freedom is wildly different from the definition that most america hold that is on to get them in an awful lout of trouble for example enter tammy duckworth was asked whet twenty twenty for was about and she said freedom ans the question is what would he man by freedom listener answer why think that its ago freedom right its bout protecting a out to but protecting freedoms and one about greetings is the right to control our bodies and con to or win product tor cycles also talking about the right to the freedom from rodent loans the freedom to walk on the streets and and not have to worry about being to grit oh racial as ha those are all freedoms than we concerning talk about and i do think at free on forcing on policy and and describing freedom in those arms would be helpful decimating how does show described freedom she names three things freedom to do abortion which again i think there a lot of america who are not on board with the idea that freedom is abortion most shocking lye she says freedom is freedom from student ones it's an amazing statement freedom is other people pay your bills and that is true freedom and that is the alee version of freedom if that is the society the hon structure freedoms from responsibility say theorems that is almost america are talking about if that is the democratic proposition for twenty twenty four i think that that is a vast gap from a most america feel remember a few months back there was this song that when absolutely viral and and that that song who is liver anchovy and the the songs called rich men north of richmond you will recall and the hurts of richmend north richmond absolutely puzzled many members of left the literally did not know what he was talking about because in the song he talked about people basely taxing to much and also spending to much money and he talks about the abuse of welfare for example and people who are in the silly court what is he wining about he is he is a blue collared i shouldn't he be in favor of that should not he want are restructured way of life an when he is talking about is the things that most america actually hereabout the things that are the stories that have always work the sores about family and freedom and the ability to use your merit to rise to the top one of the things that that he sang about was he he he said if you are five foot three and your three hundred pounds taxes ought not to pay for you bags of fudge rounds theyoung men are put in themselves six feet in the ground his all the down country does to keep kicking them down and people this he while he doing the welfare queen re well it turns out that most america actually are not in favor of the basic proposition that freedom means freedom from student ones for example and this is jobiton's for problem join is not speaking a language the america people recognize and that going come back to by in that along with his policy failures which we will get to momentarily first let us talk about sang healthy on the road we are on the road we are in plan you just wen to bushtits with with melon mosque spent ha day filming

plus that free bottle of fiber and spice away speaking of jobidon's policy you the most under covered story of this of this cycle this new cycle far is the fact that we have two dead navy seals the this annulate how is this not the biggest story in america these two navy seals actually died they ware lost it sea during an operation attempting to seize eonian made missile parts they are bound for who the rebels in common all this by the way an outgrowth of the gigantically weak form policy of this administration with regard thoron sent come sadness statement the military had declared the two deal seals dead it was now conducting recovery operations following a ten day exhausted search the search cover twenty one thousand square miles apparently the seals were reported the lost earlier this monthwhen they took part i an nighttime operation to boarteboat in the international waters of the arabia sea according to the us military that is an attempt to insure freedom of shipping which has been completely obstructed under jobidon through the red sea a jobidans attempts to fire missiles that hit camels in the ask has far had very little a fact on the actual prevention of who the terror attacks unship in which continue in abated meanwhile we have two america dead in n attempt to stop the who the we have other america have ben severely wounded including one with apparently brain injuries thanks to baronial attacks on america bases in a rock and jobidnes is trying to walk through this thing there is jobidon literally just trying to stumble across grass and avoiding questionsabout these two dead navy seals erylafdon true likes to say looking hes at trying to walk on toothpicks and again its notches these two dead navy seals according to the waster journal arena back malicious launched another missile and rocket brain you just forces in a rock on sturdy several america may have ben injured will on pay any price for this latest assault set come sexiness statement most of the missiles were intercepted by the all aside a base are defend systems while others impacted the base damagercessmens are on going and added a number of lose personal are under going a valuation for aromatic brain injury at least one rocky service member was wounded this is one of the largest of the one hundred and fortyerso attack by eonian back malicious since octobersem against the united states in a rock and serial and all that is designs but pressure on the united states to put pressure on israel to stop and leave comas in place in the godship after the worst terror attack onus since world or too now while all that happening the reason iron is doing this is because iron believes that in an election her gabion is all fired frighten of getting into a warthoron that they can push the united states around to the harts content that can shutdown shipping in the red see they continue o have his all off fire missiles into learn israel and kill news they can continue to fire directly at america basis they nave their proxy forces fire directly in america air basis in a rock and jobidon well run away in fact that is not a bad analysis by the oronians because that is how we jobidon is peter baker the our times reports as much he says another day another broch of rockets and another spark that america officials sure could set off a wild fire of violence across the middle east the assault on america troops base at all aside air base in western rock watery night was by one measure the most successful believe to be carried out by a malicious sponsor bi on since the mamas terrace attack on israel intoner seventh two out of the estimated seventeen rockets an short rangepallistic missiles fire to the base made it through err defend systems america forces have the times at mount retaliations but in limited fashion to avoid instigating a full fledge conflict by administration officials have regularly debated the proper strategy they do not want let such a talk go without response but on the other hand they not wanton go far the conflict would isolate into a full fledge war particularly by striking iron directly they privately say they may not have no choice if america troops are killed that is a red line that is not ben cross but i faronun back militias ever have a day of better aim or better luck it easily could be what he calling have two dead navy seals and an attempt to stop the who the from shipping a munch of missiles into their territory again the fear of iron is dictating this administrations florin policy and i dictating iron digression now the reality is that iron really really dis not want its rest ward the united states but they do wanted do is humiliate the united states and pressure the united states in pressuring israel to living their proxy force in compass in place that is their goal but there is an entire article n the her times by rule market ferret and rate take talking about exactly what iron wants now what they say correctly is while iron is clearly assorting its military strength amid the widening regional towel that does not means leaders want be drawn into a wider war they have said as much publicly perhaps more important the meticulously avoid taking direct military action against either israel or the united states the regime appears to be content for now to leaninsto its long time strategy proxy warfare the groups they back are fighting morons lose far neither israel nor the united states has signaled any interest in retaliating directly why but because they're afraid that if they go to war if they can a direct firing war with the united states or israel they're afraid their theirisume is over the elderly supreme leader atoll olicamani is seeking to secure his legacy that means not getting dragged into a wider war the busily round ding up protestors an executing them right now now iron does not want to war certainly more than than the west let we want toe work but job is making clear just barocoboma did in twenty twelve to the ruffians the if you has one to get aggressive now would probably be a best because if you please please please do not make me get aggressive with you because i want to get reelected and robin's basely saying that of aronians in the areas whale that gives us a window of opportunity now their could be amid calculation near iron could go to fir in the united states might be force even under jobidon to do something but the best way to do this would be to be predictably unpredictable the rest no thy never did this under trump is that they didn't note the whole trump was going to do trumpet fire to missile and taken out the atoms he might have done that nobody believes that bridoon is going to do that instead tobidon continues to signal to the agrarians and their proxies that he will in fact do their work that he will in fact attempt to leverage down a bad deal on israel after the compass attack according tote waster journal a proposals submitted to salvia the united states suggest a postwar gaze the crate a pathway toward politician state in exchange for south recognition of israel now the reason that totally insane is because if israel grans pathway to a palistinian state on the heels of the worst terror attacking is daily history you are simply saying to people that if they attack you in kilosoper citizens you will give them stuff that is what you are doing by the way comose for its part doesn't end want a seas fire according the associate o press commons was offered a two month full seas fire in exchange for the release of his daily hostages and some palcinian security prisoners being released as well and blowing comes leaders to relocate to other countries to get out compass rejected bat to for all the we municsees fire in out crowd commons rejected ta seas fire again and bid's weakness on foreign policy is radically increasing the risk of the actual serious war in the middaleast moving beyond what is already going on over there and it is not just obviously the azaleas is also continued case on our southern wall get that momentarily first lady callers is the hilarious story of how group of man losers o count winnagain souther men decide to identifies women enjoin a woman's basketball yes it is absurd it is ridiculous and laughable and also it is kind out happening light right now there is a quick look an what is being called the most triggering moving of the debate we ssriandinrr a i we tho lady callers woke needs to be far finger t lot is sotoleven etrirstreaming exclusively on daily wire plus do not wait watch lady balers the move hollywoud did not make we did exclusively at dailywire plus right now meanwhile again democrats are now connecting with the america people and they are trying to walk their way pass to the issues the latest example comes courtesy of the hearties this is not ininthing the nearatimes printed a piece in which they claim that there is by partisan pulverization round immigration there times runs this headland things fall apart how the middle ground on emigration collapse and what they show is put research center polling with regard to feelings about illegal migration and open borders and for those who cannot actually see the graphic that wereshrowing right now is why i should subscribes we conceptually see it because it is hysterically funny basically what it shows is that the america wright has had perfectly consistent feelings and emigration since nineteen ninety fort but with very little plan the joined than when when asked whether they support broader and looser emigration onlyabout thirty per cent republicans said yes back in nineteen net four and that number is thirty eight per cent to day and it is always been between those to numbers is just a straight line between nineteen ninety four and two thousand nineteen for democrats the number when from thirty two per cent pro more open borders to eighty three per cent to day but what the her times dit is they drew fight then lines suggesting that there was a radical de creese fort republican support for borders ever for open boarders an radical in crease for democrats that is not true republicans have been perfectly consistent for thirty years on this question democrats have been utterly inconsistent they have move from thirty two per cent support frozen boarders to eighty three percent support for more open borders what is the her times trying to do there trying to per tend that there is been by part is in polarization when in fact there has not when in fact the the reality is that democrats it ones who got erratically contrive whistlingyor pat way past this graver but man it is a stupid political move in fact fascinating piece over at baby wives free press to day by a reporter oblivion ringed talking about black democrats suing chico over migrant according to the free press black residence said that chico which calls itself welcoming city has been very welcoming just not to them since october twenty twenty two chico is greeted nearly thirty five thousand new arrivals with resources lanky services mental health screenings and fifteen thousand dollars in rental support per person all fun that could have gone a long way in monsoon park in chicanes busting district we are merely twenty eight per cent of recent live below the poverty line lack docktober a day before the field house was send to come a migrant shelter a black democrat rush to local court house along with three of her neighbors plus the had of local and lacy p chapter for moral support and then drafted a lawsuit in a nonbook ripped out the pages in hand them do clear now black democrats are suing over this and we say there is a disconnect between the elects that run the democratic party and the rest of the the country woman the rest of the country that this connect extends through out america policy and things are only any worse by the way because again weakness on forge policy level is likely to make things really bad economically speaking alright now for example china could effectively quarantine or blockade titan is a pole from axis a an expert opinion pol and whether basion could effectively quarantine blockade or invade titan according to these cuonqua experts a law enforcement led quarantine of titan almost almost ninety per cent of america experts strongly agree or somewhat agree that there could be lawenforcement led quarantine of titan how it up have at a chines army led blockade of titan well her eighty per cents of you us experts believe there could be effective chines led blockade of titan how an am finest invasion of titan we that that is less likely because that would involve masdeath but they do not need to do that a blockade would do it a blockade of titan in which the time on states are effectively clothed to all trade in which microchips just stop being ships all over the world because china looks at what is going on in the red sea an the say hell the munch ragtag pirates can do that the red sea why cannot we with a very very large gray water and navy and a huge army why can't we do the same thing blockade titan until they cry uncle and give us more sophisticated military microchips why cannot we actually do this now gan that blockade would be involved both commercial and military activity that would be a disaster area for the world economy and it is becoming more and more likely betas and imagine this the chines government right now may be there holding out for began victory because they think have they get a full second term of jordan they can push him round as much as they want but what if towels from is leading an a couple months to they just say you nought forget it let us gulper broke at this point interesting article over it the pastry journal from a couple of years ago talking about what exactly a chines blockade of titan would mean for globe business and the answers a gigantic disaster tigon accounts for roughly seventy per cent of the worlds at microchip supply it is its next to pacific shipping lanes the channel trillions of dollars worth of trade flowing in and out of stasis chin a chines blocked of titan would result in ship shortages for personal ironic to drive up in stationary pressures as well pretty much every major industry would be radically changed by such a blockade and that becoming more likely everyday because jobidon is a weakling because he is a weakling and he is busy with the priorities of these elects whose value system is unlike yours and who are much more concerned about say global warming than they are about say global trade and meanwhile i know what you are waiting for and that is my analysis of the osier nominations i know you are waiting for that because after all who washes the scars any more but still i feel its worth while to go through some of these oscronominations because it is fun to sea where in all people who disagreewithrough culturally a r are sitting to day in easily the funniest story of the day baby which as i loved i though it was an amazing film by which i think it was absolute operated trash and the as unwashrable i think that people who say they like it are lying i think michaelmost i think that this move makes no sense it has plot holds it is badly written all of those things also this hilarious it was nominated for best picture which is oka i know what you gives were doing yes it we made a ton money and all the critics pretend that they love day because they had to beau thy d gone to their head but it was nominated for best picture ill gay find that stupid but the funniest thing by far the funniest thing is that the only the it is that the the acting nominee for baby a ran gosling who plays ken america federal is nominated in the best supporting actress category for her garbage speech about how women have it tough and all mi got it hard to be wonder s she is nominated but who was not nominated ken was nominated who is not nominated baby cargo rob not nominated well's not nominated the greatest director of all time great dornick who is the greatest we all boy all for work because she is the greatest director ever directed and because everything she says is wise and brilliant and shes wisent she was not nominate either ken was the only major part nominated from the baby film o the patriarchy the power of the patriarchy even overcoming baby itself and and the picturarchyou will rule supreme ex in to predictorato right now that open timer win's best picture the barman timer fight open heifer which is an all time great move is going to fee baby which is which is trash and it shut the best picture nominees a america fiction which is the patently a kind of weird weirdly anti woke piece is what i have heard i have not seen et anatomy of a fall which is about a relationship because ie'salways a relationship move the askers the whole overs which is i guess sideways in high school killers of the flower moon which is really over long but it is directed by martins corsage and we have to pretend the we all loved killers the flowermoon and gain ism not superman i scorsasi i some of his films but killers of the floor moon is drag bistro which is about leaned bursting being gag open heifer an will be called passives and will be call poor things and will be called the zone of interest no i will admit that ism interested to see this not interest mainly it has amazing reviews and also it covers ground that i little rely just walk demanded is it is about shut some kind of fascinated see that mob but those your must picture nominees in the best actor category this is where somebody actually got robbed and it is not cargo lobby and is not gredigerwig is glenhowerton from blackberry o kamseen blackberry yet it is actually a lot of fun it is terrific little film and glenhowerton is excellent in it he is best performance of the year excellent who got nominated million murphy from obanhimer and he is admittedly great jeffrey right in america fiction haven't seen america fiction at i wonted it ism but he is a he is a rellygood actor pollgamodi hos not in a wind for the hold lovers and i es got i got a put out that not a huge poly motion i feel he is the same in every single part dolman a bingo in a mum be called rustic which i have not seen and badly cooper playing tenner burnsteen in bistro and overplaying the part chewing some scenery for best actress you have a netbenning and and we be called ne odd which nobody has overseen and no one now what is about or what it is or the netbennin with live silly gladstone in killers of the flowermoon she is fine sender holler and anatomy of a fall carry mulligan a bistro and gemstone in poor things isn't a bet that it is gemstone in poor things was poor things apparently a feminine tracked about how repress victoria come then there is best supporting act robot done got a nod for killers of the flower moon which is a late career nod to robot to narrow playing a part that he is forty years old to play robot downing junior and openheimer he is excellent in openheimer ruin gosling i do think by thewy run jostling is can win here i thing ring gosling i think he is going be the honorary barbie ward because everybody loved him in baby even i thought that he was the most amusing thing in barber and again i think tho that that move's living death and i thought that trying gosling was still funny in that film and mark buffalo in poor things for i hope loses because he is a he is not a a prismatic person he is too busy standing for coss best supporting actress family blunt open heimerdaniel brooks the color purple america for era in baby for tat barbaric speech body foster in near again do not know what t is and divine joy randolph in the whole lovers best director gredergery got shut out i think this is no ones years i think no one asking to take how best picture and best rector this year those are those a thebigga wards what is the take away the take always that it was not an amazing year for film is the take away which seems to be or are usual take away like i do not see any films that i saw this year and it that man that thing should nominated for best picture that was not it openheimer i think it has the most nominations thirteen nominations it should have the most nominations it is truly great film baby again is going t be the story because it is the only move that aside from openheimer any one saw this year a bottoming low ratings but i am rooting very very hard for ring gosling to win for barber because it is the funny's possible welcome the funniest possible you come for the move barber is for ken to win the only award i just the ism ism there for it i wave that the academy accidentallyted this and a and more pet i want i want ken to win and i want ism just ken from the baby move to win those are my demands and a and i will i will hold some one hostage to make this demands happen i wanted to lose costume design i want et the i want t lose every other category but only the men win beat not even cause i care but because it is hilarious o be superholarious if the patriarchy and a winning an a move made abut hot terrible patriarchy supposedly is there is that are coming up we will jump into you wanted

america craticardett it is a stunning one trillion dollars has one o the bid on white houses favorite companies goes belly up berrylike once to run for sent again and ohiovotes blue on a big republican at proposal ism bencher this is the bench barrio so the day showsponsof express plans you a web history being seen and sold to advertisers now meaneither get ex freshly plan right out expressly giant come flesh men well folks bionomics is a giant fail and we are seeing the wages of by comics happening right now here is the thing bionomics which is basically the idea that if we sink extraordinary amounts of tax pair dollars into jobidon's favorite companies or if blow out cash spending on a wide variety of causes that help codons favored political friends the if we do all of that that somehow jogs economic growth and leads to economic our ability it is a my it is always been all but here is the ting it is very difficult to explain to people why it is all because capitalism is much more subtle and interesting conversation then is corporatism corporatism has always been in very easy sell corporatism is basically the idea is started by musullinian the early twentieth century that if you work handing glove government and business together and then you directs those business is in a particular way this will lead to economic prosperity because it cuts out all of the evils of competition and we all work together instead of working against one another in in fact the idea of the corporation as sort of a corporate body again goes back to early twentieth century philosophy particularly prominent in fashions circles fasioust economics looks very much what much of the west pursues in terms of a mixed economy right now meaning government subsidization of particular business got a government telling business what to do and business just going and doing it an an what that actually results in is certain levels of economic stagnation because it cuts out innovation when you are subsidizing certain businesses at the cost other business is then what you are actually doing is you're twisting the intensive structure in extraordinary ways when you hear people in the united states where varynestalgict for the nineteen fifties that whip cannot whip can we have an economy i nineteen fifties where the government was heavily subsidizing particular businesses where unions were really really strong the quick answer to that question as we cannot have the nineteen fifties unless you wish to destroy literally all of the western economies on plan and earth except for the united states the reason the nineteen fifties were boom time in the united states is because every single export market for the united states was completely destroyed destroyed the we had to spend billions of dollars giving those countries money that could buy our product that is what the marshal plan was if you do not wish to devastate the entire work the economy and then have the united states be the last one standings that we can you will pay the unions off for manufacturing product the could easily do elsewhere well then it is could not be kind of hard to square that circle but jobidons cuorn'tqut industrial policy his entire redistribution's policy it has real costs and were been living with these policies for quite a while now and they are not going particularly well we are looking at slowing rates of growth across the west as governments decide to move away from where free market oriented economics and more toward again in this corporator model the reason ism ranting about the corporations model right now is best i do not thing it is only aby comics problem ism also seeing it happen on the right i think there is a par t of the right it does not understand hawfree markets work and why they are good there are couple of reasons why fremarkets are particularly good one you as an individual human being have a right to your property this is the basis a basically all innovation in economic growth it also happens to be moral if you put work into property you own that property it does not belong to other people if you then wish to live in a community where you share that property that is your problem and you can do that and in fact that is what religious communities over time have done as have said before i give a lot of charity to my local sintegog my tincal synagog distributes that charity among a while variety of cause i hep out friends i give them jobs a the is all stuff that people traditionally have done but that does not make my property not my own property freely alienable and freely reelable my all of that is very good teston a moral level but the other thing that capitalism does that no other system does is i creates positive externalities capitalism ends with creating innovation now looks wasteful capitalism because look tall these people whoring competitionment why can there just be one type of chump on the sholfret this burned sanders is reaching why do we have all of these different shampoo companies making tons of different hopes i will mean what what of chump for the scrirgihaw what the reason is because the competition makes the price lower it makes a better for the consumer choice is good for the consumer competition is good for the consumer and the something is strewn the stock market when people look the stock market and they see it as a speculative enterprise the stock market is not about the speculation is notabout some died getting rich day trading the truth is you are not in to get rich day trading the number of people have gotten truly wealthy day trading is very very very low that is not how good investors ideas the way the god investors invest is they find what they believes in undervalued property and then they buy it and ten they hold it this s worn buffets entire strategy worn buffet is a student of benjamin graham and they've do and his basic strategy is i find an under value to asset where i the business and then that own share of the business and then the business grows that is why worn buffet is successful because very discipline investor he does not speculate in the stock market infect he does the reverse of speculation he investigates the business is that he is looking at in than he invests in those businesses when you see the stock market as a speculative gamble it becomes the speculative gamble for you but that is not what the stock market is meant to do in that is not actually what the stock market does what the stock market does is it creates giant pools of liquidity those giant pools of liquidity make it possible for new business is to get off the ground some of those businesses will fail but many of those business is we will succeed it allows innovation to happen and that innovation creates profit mark in that profit margin allows more innovation to happen this is why the sort of socialistic idea that profit is bad is really stupid profit is the incentive structure that actually blows people to create new and innovative products and wen you take money out of those markets out the stock market for example if yore the government he's just stuck money ins the government maw and hen you blow it out on your favored protects or if you are a a sort of right wing industrialist photo industrialist policy guy and you think what if i stuck money out of the markets and then we just blow it out on a manufacturing center in oho you are doing the same thing you are taking the money from where it is most efficient and where it is most likely to generate better products better innovation and more economic growth andyouare taking it putting in a place her tat is less likely to happen now can pretend that that is good for the economy as a whole it is not it is good for your friends your say as good fair friend's fine that is at least a fair argument ism taking money from bobcat giving it to stove be i seven i do not care about bob the least a fair argument butut but to pretend that leads to over all economic growth is alive an that sort of policy under girds bionomics and it is leading to terrible the facts for the america worker for the america consumer for every one because here is the thing when we talk lit the wages of the nineteen fifties we bout bringing back the nineteen fifty economically speaking you would not want to live in the nineteen fifties economically speaking you would not can you went have a sulphone we would not have a really nice car the career nineteen fifty were not nearly as nice from of the features and things they have as the cars to day your fridge word be broken half the time you probably would not have air conditioning by statistics an nineteen fifty no one wants to live in nineteen fifty wheneverybody have has economic and a stalag just remind them that right now you live in a magical somewhere you take your selfhood which they magical device the connects to a cloud in the sky y suppose a a magical cloud and then that magical clod blows you to buy any product on earth source from tend to from countries and arrives at your door to days cat anybody in all ofyoumen history look to that in they think there living in some sort of magical universe and you are sitting here big i wish to her the nineteen fifties again in industrial policy it is ridiculous hit we will get to why this is actually failing in one second because joint's economy is about to start sliding intercession i know the every happy talking this thing all we escaped processions wo first of all let me point out stagnation was always coming have ben trying for two years now than inflation was not the long from threat to the united states stagnation was long from threats of the united states join when you came into office was promising that for a testate we would not grow and above a two per center the pe clip that is not enough to keep up withe kind of debts that we have ben assuming as a nation stagnation is the problem an stagnation s created when you remove the innovate of sector of the economy and instead you toss it at your friends in steady toast o your political supporters it is the on every side of the lie three economics creates better products cheaper products it creates better jobs creating those cheaper and better products can you work abut our job than your grand to did your menistolger for the nineteen fifties remember or your grandpa was sitting on a line somewhere riveting for ten ours a day s that is on amazing your siting in an air conditioned office and wining about for your getting sciatica from typing which one of those jobs is better here there is no question about this all get to more on this in just one second first let us talk about the economy as we have been saying joint's economy not fantastic plus is economic policy also less than fantastic this is why ism diversified let little bit into precious metal since the turn of the century the world's dollars supply grew three hundred forty for per cent each dollars purchasing power has declined forty four per cents leaders around the world our questioning the value of owning an asset with in limited supply in a steadily toe lining value which is i many people are looking diversifying into gold that in clues by the ay the brick nations brazil russia india china and south africa they're looking into new international super currency fully back by golds or other commodities which drive the price of gold up this part of their long try plants supplant the united states and the dollar as a cornerstone of the lob of financial system one of the ways you can protect your great or for one can from the follow is by diversifying with gold from birch gold historically got is has been a safe haven in times of high and certainty that would be right now burst gold her the people i trust with my gold in vestments protect your savings the same way birch

currency becomes reality me very nice have some golds rely upon again ten ben to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight to get started o case o what is the fall out from this kind of policy this condom in industrial policy we spend rules in rules of money on in productive companies that could not survive in the private markets well the fall out is that places go bankrupt the fall out is in stationary policy in which you lollipop for money all over the place then your shocks when a the prices go up for example if you look at jobidons total in flatten rates in he became presidents of the united states the total in elation a lice when you when you actually add all that up consumer prices since jobidon took office are up sixteen per cent that is eight huge number that is a really really big number how about real wages real wages since jobidon took office are down three point five per cent is that means that your wages went down through on fie per cent and your prices went up fifteen per cent which means thaeyou love a delta off twenty per cent that that is a real problem for the fasten majority of america consumers why won because when you hellions for money all over the place it gives couple the impression they have more money then they going they spend the money and then they spend the money in the prices go up well right now the fall out from this is going to be eventually the party comes to an end and somebody is left without a chair and some of those places are going to be companies that should neverhave had money in the first place one of jobidon's favorite companies whys a a company called protect a protect is an electric vehicle parts supplier and you're betray spoke about protect and the magic of it in twenty twenty one here is jobidon in twenty when one talking bout the magic of protect right now on away behind china i you girl are going us in the a you gars are going the in the gan an make a lot of difference were ate up allefuiture i thank if you we we carny r de on when you start mankind a thousand busses year wanna n at e for room your customers a her our o the electric busses news we know comma hers love electric busses is one of the reasons why the government decided to get behind protect back in two thousands when one heres command hers yesterday praising the magic of the electric busses where they need i ism there is only one problem yesterday electric vesical parts of latter protect according it two rioters filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy then get the latest company to go belly up an an industry grappling with supply chanson strains slowing demand and a funding drought worth that huntingdrou coming from it turns out wen you get addicted to government cash eventually the heroine supply stops coming the move comes weeks after lordstown motors filled for bankruptcy protection put itself up for sale after failing for solve a dispute over a promised in dustmen from fox con protrras she's nearly have in valley after the bell elicit its assets and my abilities in the range of five hundred million to one billion dollars the entire market c a of the companies three hundred sixty two million dollars in canary twenty twenty one protect was valued at one point six billion dollars including debt in emerge or deal it a blank check from and it was jobidon who is touting this this firm now the difference between the government subsidizing a firm and you subclass it and you subsidizing a firm have made investments that gone bust and i lose the money when the government makes the investment and then goes bust you also lose the money that is the way that it works and that that is why the sort of industrial policies are i fail meanwhile the bison comic team they keep out going out there in proclaiming that everything is going swimmingly when we all know it is not here is columella derris line yesterday sing that wages are up an inflation is down well that all depends on your starting point if you start from last month then that is true if you tart from when jobidon became president it is wildly false again in elation is up almost sixteen per cent from one chorion took office if you precooking in to the price rate anvereling at wage rates there now four percent during that same period in real wages i love these sorts of talking points in elation has fallen twelve months in hero ill kat which it which us sort of saying that you are doing better than you did over the yesterday and you are doing better yesterday thanyou did the day before and that is because twelve months go you are hit by eight truck right ever since then you've be i proving right your missing the part git hit by the truck gay what would man amazing is if the inflationary had not been a alevin per cent that up n amazing and we brought it down month of by the way when you bring it down month over month that is still means that the inflation is continuing is just the rate is not changing in a positive direction that is you are filling the bathtub and the waters still going up is just filling a little bit more slowly than it was a minute ago but if they lied you often enough they figured that maybe the will get away with it he's again they can just point to it whenever you have a system ere can point at concentrated winners and dissiperat losers it is much easier to pitch this is the beauty of industrial policy and corporatism you can point at individual companiesyou to ow this i to winner and then you say what did you lose you lost a couple of bucks he he had a chance it winning amazing the prom is when you have this many desperate post they start to ad up we're seeing that in spades right now for the america wage earner we are seen this for america business is and that the future of america growth is very very precarious right now ill get to more on that just one second first it is time for our meet fit questions ponder by goodransers where we gets the meat of a hard hitting weekly question question is with all the recent investigations into both trump and bison which a medical political family do you think is the most corrupt well mean this a long list of of corrupt political family you would have to put up there the kennedies the penny family ad some serious serious corruption issues going all way back to josh also going a c to you no tentykennedy leaving a lady dead in in river you would have to look at therein family both bill and misery wildly corrupt selling pardons for cash anal the rest of it and of course the biding family is extraordinarily corrupt as we have ben talking about at length well while some political families may attempt to disguises their form business dealings as completely innocent foreign meet can disguise itself as a product of the united states yes grocery soreshelves are riddle with meat from other countries disguised in a product of the u s label if you prefer to know without a shadow of a doubt where your meet comes from instead of guessing you need good ranchers they force one hundred percent america meat they deliver our dor no disguise is no surprise is just america beef chicken and pork amazing meet conveniently deliveredwhen you need it what exaclary waiting for at this point enjoy that real met and real service stay with good ranchers that is a good ranchers dot come use my good bend for thirty bouts off any box that is prommocood ben at good ranchers dot come good ranchers dicot is america meets delivered o ka the america consumer is is going to start feeling it pretty quickly now because the money is running out and can see it it is starting actually forget about the consumer look in to businesses and i point it out that there is in fact a different measure of economic growth different then g d p and that measure of economic growth does not look just at consumer and product spending which is how keensians would look at it this is why they always believe that government spending is going to jug chewy pe because government spending goes into consumer growth if if the government spends lot of money on a product the this is called economic growth that is really not the way that it would work but there's a better measure called gross output that we have ben talking about gross output is how businesses are investing and how business is are spending and what you see is that gross output remains ready precarious right now it is not look in fantastic because businesses are pulling back your single in pretty much every area of america life right now for example according tote waster journal new lending by mortgage beats as now dried up if you're worried about commercial real estate taking give you should be worried blackstone mortgage trusting can cay our real state finance trust two of the biggest mortgage real state in vestment trust have now halted loans to any new borrowers hay that is a serious problem that means that liquidity is drying up when liquidity dries up it

mortgage beats which find to property owners instead of buying and developing real stay equity orient at reads typically originate average about ten billion and loans every quarter hardly any new loans are being made right not which means that you are going to s markets start the decline in real estate we stocks the cline petty significantly yesterday after the banks were down grated by goodies according to the waster journal week cheeses export dato which by the way is reflection of the america consumer market because worth one trarthry buying chines product week chines export data a dimmer financial outlook from it you p s and a credit down grate for ten smaller most banks send stock indices down on tuesday government bond price is climbed pushing yields down that means people are trying to invest in government bonds o this point and get away from the stock market which is a sine of economic weakness bonds are getting more tractive compared bitstocks lately given higher yields in the risk that recession hit is corporate or rings in the future financial shares we stung when mood's low crederatings for ten smaller you banks instead was reviewing ratings for six larger ones including bank of new york pellet and lose banker the move re need concerns over tiger lending and the banking systems ability t withstand sharply hire interstates again if the banks invested a lot in bonds two years to go their absolutely jacked is would have with pelican valley bank the invested a lot in bonds figuring in t government was a safe place to put the money and then the government had to raise those interstates radically on the new bonds making the old bonds essentially worthless that is what bankrupt did silicon valley bank there me other banks that have similar math we are looking right now at persistent high in elation in rope tight financial conditions in aria a slower cover and all of this is is negative stuff china is slipping into deflation right now according to the waster eternal tepid consumer demand in rising economic con ferns an t sect the world second largest economy and now tip china into a stationary territory for the first time in two years adding pressure on basing to act more aggressively to avoid deepening economic always instead of experiencing a serge on prices after lifting the covenineteen pandemic crumbly last year china now suffering an unusual about of falling prices for a range of goods from commodities steeling colds to daily essentials and consumer products vegetables in home appliances what happens to china well china is heavily get burdened well what happens to the unit the united takes is also heavily get burdened now we are still a better bet than china we are still can be able to sell our bonds but just remember when we sell bonds that have in interestrat of five and a half five point revive per cent all we are really doing is saying that the government in ten years gan have to pay off all of that interest which sign to eat up our entire government budget right now s we have in this country extraordinary levels government debt that is paid with extraordinary levels of personal debt all of this is a to nosy waiting to happen according to axis you us consumer credicard loans in other revolving plans as a there of g piernaw three point seven percent of all guy bee the us credicarset hid extrillian dollars for the first time toward the end of jury it this rise reflect in number of factors including rising consumer confident and spending power amid cooling in elation but ay and people are spending on that credicard which men a bunch people gan a bankrupt because not everybody pays off that creticard there is seventy million more credicardiccounts open now than prepandemic and twenty nineteen according to fed researchers s america are spending an enormous money on there creticards rising balances may present challenges for some borrowers the resumption of student loan payments this fall may add additional financial strand from any student loan borrowers according to fed researchers as well tit is all funding games until the caracal stops here is a good accounts on tour called the coast letter which is m in a commentary on gula capital markets the us currently has seventeen point one strolling dollars n household debt twelve thrilling dollars in mortgages one point six trilling dollars in auto lam loans one points trilling dollars in student loans one point zero trillion dollars in credit hardest total mortgage get is more than double the two thousand six peek and all of this is super risky there relies on the government to bail everybody out and when those ball out stop which eventually they will then people are going to be in really hard situation that is when the will get more calls for more government spending more government regulation this the beauty being of corporate has to when your policies failyou just call for more cowbell you've blame capitalism and suggest the it was capitalism fault that all the stuff happen when it was not capitalism's fault in the first place it will get to the i pact of all of this on the twenty twenty

ways thatyou can s that to the easy money is drying up is because very foolish corpora policies are also starting to dry up those are the preserve of the privilege in the same way the environmentalism is to preserve of the local privilege the only people who care about the environment are people who can afford o to to do there not people where living in africa who burning dung for fuel and trying make sure that the their one your old stays alive it it is much rich people living in the west were deeply worried about the polar bears and the arctic ice caps well the same thing happens with regard to the economy we have loose money policies bad companies get money and bad corporopolicies get promulgated hell not ye can see again this actually it is a good sign for the future of corpse a america but it is also sign of an economic down turn that all these corporate firms are now getting rid of the stain and d i s g and d e i a just drags on the profitability of these corporations and corporations were able to do that and the are able to virtue signal with their money and with the stock market they are able that they're able to do that long as the money was still flowing when money stops lung the first thing to go is alive the virtue signaling which is why the waster journal is reporting to day that conservative legal active s have successfully challenge the use of affirmative action by universities now there going after diversity initiatives widely deployed across america corporations some companies are already re considering their efforts in lawsuits shareholder to letters competitions to the e e o c active is are using some of the same tactics that progressive groups have us to advance diversity equity inclusion or d i programs there arguing companies are violating rules against race and sex discrimination including those drawn from legislation designed to secure of the rights of black america come cast ha settled the case accusing it of the legally favoring minority on small businesses amazon as ben suit in texts over a program offering special beef it's to black or litany owned delivery service contractors sawbucks is being sued as well and as you r seeing assent p is now dropping yet sores from get ratings which is exactly as it shouldhave been in the first place but when the money was free and loose you could be just as left as you wanted to be it when the money starts to get tight that everybody turns into a conservative again according to the the financial times lessen global has now stopped handing out scores to corpora barons on yet criteria the get writing agency has since twenty twenty one publish scores from one to five for company's exposure to each elements of environmental social and governance risks payment's company visa for example had received two for e and ss and a three for g first energy a this utility that has been charge with corruption received ta foreshore for g assent pes second lowest grade lay last week assent pe reverse course saying only tact none medical scores would comprise analysis of a companies vestry matters the rating agency said what we have determined the dedicated and political narrative paragraphs and our credit rating reports are most effective that providing detail and transparency on yestyou credit factors material tolerating analysis they are going to continue doing the gratin an alcaspout the not can given to number which means affectively speaking it is not on a matter any more noodles is still rating testy criteria in a one to five scale why is this happening hell supposedly its because of evil republican pressures oncofvevil republican pressure it is because corporations ore saying well you nought i do not need nor to be profitable you are yet garbage in a fact investors are looking an there going om i just want to in fast in the company that is going to make me money in the company that is profitable and run well and what i do not hereabout whether they are showing diversity h arvidios to their emploividio it is their employs i do not care about that that makes no difference to me does the company earn or does the company not earn does a provide a good proctor service or does it not lessen pe is walking the stuff back and yen that's the first indicator that we are about to go in to a fairly serious recession because again when you look at the stuff that just you in your household all your frivolous spending when it is an economic downwash n we lose a job the first thing to go is your right out a the movies and yourestauruntrips well when it comes to corporate america the first thing to go as is g and d e i when the cutt'scom corporate earnings are down that means the economy is going to drop he just get ready for it and well jobidon is happy talking this thing you'll be important to up to start protecting yourself but but with all of that said republicans would be poise to take advantage of this if they new haw to speak in are market terms o republicans have left that far behind anther's a serious problem in the effort to win over people in middle america the called russet the the suggestion has been made that those people are desperate for manufacturing policy the quench restores jobs and all that is is nice sounding stuff that effectively means subsidization for som at the expense of others that is not actually by the way why republicans are winning an oho an indaba the reason republicans are in oho indaba i of these midwestern russet states there is very little to do with manufacturing policy cans guess what most those jobs in come back they all e shift it over i pitsburg used to be a steel t own and now pitsburg is actually a health carryon job's change o does not mean people do not get lost in the shuffle which is horrible lift if and better ways to transition them to new careers butts find better opportunities for them but the idea the your bringing back the entire manufacturing base of the united states is something that both the republican party undemocratic party keep saying and is not going to happen in large loss the manufacturing economy in the same way that agriculture used to be a main stay of the america economy an now agriculture is worked by a tiny fraction of the work force in the united statesyou do not here people sang whole what all those farmers who lost jobs we need to find ways for them to go back to farming and that that is his not something people say any more and the reason for that is economies become more innovative they become more efficient the actual reason by thewy the republicans are winning in red states has much more to do with the bazar cultural policies practice by left cot left coast lets than has to do with industrial policy in the modest as the republican party embraces the idea that entitlement programs should never be mess with hat we should continue spending just democrats do only on different people it is a race to the bottom of that point it really is it be nice if somebody in america politics hat the actual balls to talk about the beauties of the free market which is what has made america most prosperous country worlds history bar non without a doubt instadwhirch s can a blow out our debt and weld continue ignoring all the systemic proms of the economy until wehitdecliff at which point we hittocliff and then because a america as perceived is capitalist but actually is corporatist at that point they blame the free markets and the calfomore government interventionism and it is spiral to the bottom if that sounds cold of darkest because it is again would be really nice if somebody in political power had the capacity to speak clearly and cogently about the economy but om that is likely now organ get instead it is going to be a race of personalities speaking of which apparently carry lake is now preparing another president another senate run sheer ran for governor she lost to a wet rag in city hobs in arizona everybody thought carrylake was going to win that race if thatchers in a win that race bisagain city hobs is a terrible candidate a truly awful candidate berrylike somehow found a way to lose the race by essentially saying to a bunch of people themiddle i do not want you to vote for mam an she actually said that pretty much now she has declared that she one and if this is the republican plan for victor got us it is really stupid declaring the you want a game that you lost does not make you the winner of that game bored should it make you the favorite for the next game there is no game of which i am aware that you blaming victory makes you the victor in the game if you just declare that you want a baseball game after you clearly lost a baseball game does that now make you a winner who moves on to the next round and yet this seems to be denial is notcusta river in egypt denial is apparently now a republican electoral strategy if you pretend that you did not lose an election andthenyou say bunch o stuff about it tat is unverifiable then we give you the benefit of the out because we hate the left much that we have decided that everything they say is a lie up to an including election results that is not a good way to win a reflect effort the arizona republican party is destroying itself right now and it is a disaster area for the republican party nationally because if republicans lose arizona which state to the make up in a presidential re member and told about five years ago arizona was entirely red if you go back two thousand and sixteen the senators from arizona were john mac cane and eff lake it was two republicans and dug duce was he the republican governor of arizona and now there is a democratic senator there two democratic senators and democracy governor in arizona is the prison republican party shifting back toward the sort of magic state statustatasho lass it to win in the state nope apparently carry lake is not only running in the senate race she's now the foreign away favorite in the primary race there which i got a say is just wild it is wild especially because this is a supervulnerable seat for democrats carton cinema the prince independent senator in arizona she is running against ruin garage rumingayego right now is drawing a morality of the vote senior is drawing some of the republican vote and well if you had a strong republican candidate who say did not alienate in dependence maybe fewer of those independence would go over to cretin minima right now cristentin mas when no like thirty seven and thirty right per centovote gazebo is it forty something and carry lake if sure in that race is in the twenties ay that are not on to do it and yet republicans in arizona seem obsessed wit the idea that if they just keep relitigatting twenty twenty and twenty twenty two and presumably twenty twenty four for he rest of time at this will be an electoral strategy that leads to egest not understand how the never work name a situation in your life where looking back on a thing and just knowing on it over and over and over has made your life better name name literally one situation in your own life or something is gone wrong for you and on it just sit there and yogin just obsess about it endlessly and this is now made your life better going forward and yet theirs what republican party seems to be doing not only over twenty twenty but over over twenty twenty two is well now according to acid sapiential freeway battle with crib with ckirston minima ruin as independent exposes deep divisions in both parties on whether to appeal to their basis or independence lake still is not concede gubernatorial lost in twenty twenty two the race offers a state public experiments on the implications f a possible freeway presidential contest to a cinema is playing these sort of no labels candidate right now if lake wins jo piece primary next august she will likely face down gazebo and cinema in the general election kinda has not officially announced whether she will see re election but she has a bunch of cash unhand again republicans cannot afford loose prison it is the simple maybe it feels good to sort of she in these issues but ism just wondering again whether it is better to stewing them or it is better to win yourepublicans could do the same thing in georgia i notice that for example bran keep one going away as governor of georgia one going away even as republicans stewed over twenty twenty in georgia brynkhamp one running away in georgia over stay arms who is the scourge of georgia in twenty twenty supposedly here your choices you neither it there and can now on the past or you can win those that there's no third choice here which is whyagan if do trump is the hominy he

donate true president be cause what carrylake is doing on a states on a state level is what donate trump is doing on a national level and the thing is donate true if he is the nominate he could read apply and go against bison he does have that capacity but he is gin a need the intense of structure to do that that sens of structure is on to come from the re publican bates not from the media who

when it comes to donate trumps race he can even run one of two races one of them he could win one of them he is almost sure to lose the one that he can win is the one where everyone just highlights jobidon's failures been talking about it in incessantly toxin is a failed president he is a terrible president there is not a thing that he has touch that is not turned to great well here's donate trump on that topic yesterday and this is totally fine stuff everyone can see to stupid contrast between our incredible success in jo by surreniris fail years than that is one reason why were leading some an the well that is really there mason i think it is my more enthusiasm now then twenty sixteen or twenty went because you have s eye how in competent these people a it is it is horrible i gates all that is fine if however dona trump runs on the basis of his legal cases it is not likely to go amazing s yesterday he said ism not nipa there is reason o not i what scars my legal cases how can my corrupt political upon true cut jo bin put me on trial doing an election campaign that ism winning by a lot but forcing me nevertheless spend time and money away from the campaign to e ode to i to is made up accusdationson this o to to i'psar i will not be able to go to i wen o day i will not be able to got hamputo day because ism sitting in a court room on both because cha get again i agree with him on a lot of the stuff but is that con a went to presidential election with independents is that can be the line if line is joint's terrible president he can win if the line is i cannot campaign today because ism in court that is not a winning line and no matter how much republicans can have to get out o theironheads they really are and this is turn nearly every issue republicans our inside or it be again i get the lack of creditability of the left i also think they lie frequently near incessantly i also thing that they say things that are not true that they twist the narrative that they do things that are truly bad i agree with all of that it also does not mean that if we are constantly looking in the mirror and just seeing what we want o see the were gan come away with an accurate reflection of what politics in america looks it'll give another examples last night there is a special election in oho tit was a special election on it what they called issue one on the oho ballet this election wasabi whether to change the ohiostate constitution to make it s that amendments basically required a super majority in order to be passed soil you want change the ohoustat constitution right ninety just the shut majority but instead of that they wan to make it a super majority this is what was up for debate however this debate actually was not about the constitutional amendment it was about the oho re publican party doing that and the left saying what they actionably our tempting to do it is are vent you from enshrining rovers is weighed in the ohiostate constitution but they really want to to hi ban abortion in state law and they make it impossible trust to overturn becusethe have change the rules of the constitutional amendment s that what was on the ballet last night and here is how the associated press described the result first of all the oho resolution to essentially it is stabilized the oho state construction at went down to flaming to feet fifty seven to forty three here is how the eh p described to quote oho voters on tuesday resounding the rejected republican backmeasure that ouldhav made it more difficult to change the states constitution seeing up a fall campaign that ill become the nations latest rough run ham on abortion rites since the us supreme quart overturned at national my protections last year that a feet of issue one keeps in place a simple majority threshold for passing future constitutional amendment rather than the sixty percent super majority that was proposed it is supporters said the hirerbar would protect the states foundational document from outside interest groups foster opposition to the proposal was widespread even spreading intetraditionally republican territory in fact and early returns support for the measure fell far short of done trumps per romance during the twenty twenty election in nearly every county sass shaw points out over at hot air the were ta portion feared nowhere in the test of issue one tore a proposal to raise the bar from mending the state constitution to sixty per cent support rather than simple majority that is rarity in place in a lot of other states however however it was red by the voters as an attempt to basic we protect pro life positions he says even a quick glands of the national poles will tell the same story about state playing america politic to day youbidn is among the least popular president in modern america history reasons investigations have made it increasingly clear his almost certainly among the most corrupt nobody approves of him but yesterday's results in ohioor all the roof you need such results is not going to happen a giant romp over jobidon and the bine could sit hold on tote white house that is be us if we allow democrats to make nextyurs election all about abortion there voters that a number of moderates an intopedens will i more massive failures than the deplorable state of their country hold their noses and votes keep the get pout power any cost there is no more proline person in america than i am am fully pro life all the way back to point of conception no exceptions for rape or incest ow ism is pro life as it is possible to be also politics exists republicans sang over and over to themselves theft we take to hardest proline position hat every state in union that will lead to electoral victory is dumb it is not correct you are going to have to gradually convinced the america people of the rawness of your positions because if you do not the back lashes going o come strong from the other side your being this s in state election afford sate elections whish happening canvas for example where in overwhelmingly republican population voted two actually enshrine of portion in canvas constitutional law if republicans feel they are the only voters in the room if they feel they vote on the basis of carry lake's race in twenty twenty why they vote on the basis of don from being victimized by law enforcement or they vote for their nominee on the basis of who takes the most proline position and promises there in a gamic down in law even without any political support for that position they are going to lose a gravity does exist the left has been assuming wat the economy gravity does not exist and left for a long time with regard to things crime assumed the gravity did not exist gravity continues to exist in the political realm reality continues to exist in the political realm now it'll be honest of run it'll tell you where people are straying from their central principles it is one hundred present true that if you got for a ten we abortion band that is not i full abortion ban nor t is remotely sufficient to protect human life it is also true if that is the best yuan get that maybe be toucan get the they are lot of people who make a great living telling you that you do not go for broke all the time every time they are neverganaget anywhere anti's precisely the opposite if you go for broke every time all the time you are going to lose from here till the end of time he is going for broke every often may result the victory but the other ninety eight per cent of the time it results in laws and that of the nine get present time at matters in awful lot more your really does victories are one in incrementally the pro life movement defeated reverses weight over the course of fifty years o building up an entire legal movement specifically dedicated to interpreting the constitution as originally i intended they took fifty years of incremental movement do you think that to morrow if we just scholar broke that mutually the country is c in a snap in to a place of virtue i do not i thing it is a long hard slog having to long hard process of convincing people and working with people and yes taking in elemental gains and recognizing the gains for what they are while also recognizing what they are not that is what political honesty would look but very few people on either side of the political lie actually do political honesty these days instead their business is telling you about how pure they are on every form and and they do not worry about winning instead what they worry about is can they long foot the other guy and make it look as though he is actually pucilanimis on an issue when what he is really saying is the only way to i grieve the on misdone the only way to get to the point where you win is by pursuing these very practical steps ore alternatively can shout at the win and any can loose that its it maybe it feels goodish out the win feeling good is not politics feeling good is not victory victory is victory and there's no substitute for it i meanwhile speaking of left going liars the advance placement board they that the college board there just liars they lie on on the regular they lie routinely they lied about their a p african america history course in florins suggesting that it was just it could not even be taught in flowed becauseyou cannot such black history for its just crap it is not true at all will now the college board has announced that is going to pull its a p psychology class from flora schools is not flora banning the a p psychology class a lord did not do that it is the college board saying we cannot teach are a p psychology class in florid schools they say quit florid department of education has effectually band a p psychology in the state by instructing flora superintendents that teaching foundational content on sexual orientation and gender identity is e legal under state law of that is a lie there that the florid department f educations has quote just one week before school starts the college board is attempting to four school districts to prevent students from taking the a p psychic course the other advance corse providers including the international bacaloria program hat no issue providing the college credit psychology course suit is the a p that is removing the course not florid flora did not a cannot teach a p a p said you cannot teach a p in florid why well a cording to the a p standards on psychology one of these standards is describe how sex and gender influence socialization and other aspects of development and also articulate the impact of social an cultural categories on self concept and relations with others now there is nothing there that says that you have to teach bunch of weird gender theory garbage you could not why you could just teach that see of course impacts socialization because girls are girls and boys are boys and gender is deeply connected with bayou could totally teach that in the contacts of the a p psych course but what a p is saying is that we do not want you to teach that what we actually want t you to teach is this gender oriented nonsense and thus if you will not teach it will pull it as a columnist for the federals points out the college for is squatting the woman's placed on teaching these two skills with removing a cornerstone of the course this saying that neglecting to explain all the unconventional ways punctuation is used for historical purposes somehow makes the whole class illegitimate and the r real reason for this is because the a p a theamerican psychological association which has always been is a deeply deeply partisan political organization groups that are arguing that a p my should actually inly more contents about gender and sexuality the a p a c o rather evens has but an advance placement course that ignore the decades of science studying sexual orientation in generitenentity but deprive students of knowledge they will meet to succeed in their studies in fiscal aeons o first of all i given to you h what their teaching a a p psych does not actually reflect a the best science i promise you because the best science same with regard to for example sexual orientation that there is no genetic marker for sexual orientation that is what the actual science has right now there is no clear and convincing genetic marker for sexual orientation that is what a study of hundreds of thousands of human genus by the humangeuno project mount will that appear in the a p my course give serious that is that will appear because it conflicts with their entire narrative howabout gender identity there is no none convincing science that there's the there is something pul a female brain in male body that is a myth that is a gnostic myth it does not exist in science because no one can actually label what a female brain looks in male body because the brain is part of the body it is nonsense will they teach it anyway that is what they wantitege flora's just tang the we cannot actually teach that stuff and the a p sang where you must teach that stuffs is that flora's falters that the a pecefault again florid did hatband the a p course a p band the a p course the stop blaming florid for actually making sure that it is kids are not in doctrine instead blame the a p for attempting to indoctrinate the kids of a time for some thing s i and then some things that i hate things that i to day there is a a book that was enormous in the nineteen seventies stolen and the art of motor psyche maintenance it is written by a m a guy who used to be sort ain english composition professor and then got very into psychology whencsyounverseive chico this book sold just millions and millions of copies than in the art of motor cycle maintenance it is one my dads of favorite books i first read to when i was in teens i re i reread it this week because he kept talking bout out i a out early remember it that well the book by robot parsec receives a hundred and twenty rejections before it was actually published it initial sells ore least five million copies world wide at this point probably sold twice that it is the be which makes it by thewy the single by selling psychology book probably in human history you have not hard of it because you don't group in seventies the book in the seventies was perceived as an attack on conservatism it is not is a deeply conserve a book basically what the book is than in the art of motor cycle maintenance is it is a story about the author and his son taking a motor psych trip across the country and it is interspersed with his flash backs to his days in psychology because it turns out hat he hadn't actual psychological brag and whose hospitalize in giving electrotherapy and all of this and it is it is a it is a travel log interspersed with philosophical musing is an investigations into what it was that made him go crazy about psychoabout philosophy in the first place well the book says lot of the same sort fluff it that born person says now a lot of the book is about the magic of fixing his motor cycle is it your love to be by the way a motor cycle enthusiast actually enjoy the sort of stuff ism not and again what i what i actually you enjoy is what he calls in the book qualities the central idea of the book is that there's the sing called quality what is i know hat it is anti's undefinable when you try to to find quality in any particular situation an of a very hard time categorizing quality but what it is right down in the cockles of your own heart that baton is higher quality than cardie everyone knows that and and attempt you say that that is not true everyone knows is crap everybody knows that is bull crap it is post modernist nonsense and he says is that this quality has been lost wise have been lost and he he breaks it down into reeks into green philosophy and he basically says and there is an attempt to separate off the true from the good and that was because if there is no we to find the good then presumably truth could get lost b what pears such says is we should stop running away from the undefined term stop pretending thatyou can define its from they cantifine quality or the good because that is the thing that show drives human beings and you can pretend the you can categorize at that can nail it down a butterfly on a piece paper but hoe cant actually do that what it is in your heart because that is the way that we interacts with the universe is through the prism of that good of that quality and it is not entirely quatquled subjective it is between you and the world that is why there is widespread agreement on what a mounts to quality in a wide variety of areas a cross human life now what he does not he can hints at be what he does not actually say is that that good that quality is god right that that that system of values is in fact the divine and that is how we interact of the world is through that prism that is what religion fills the gap i comes very close to basically saying that the book we does not quite say that but the book is really i a much early aversion of make abed there is such a thing is a higher value and the higher value is the thing that orients you that science is not that higher value to science has no value is because the empirical cannot actually separate cannot bridge what they call the is ought gap from things around you in the universe in the physical universe to what you ought to do and what he says is that is an artificial gap in the first place because the way that you actually address the world is always going to be oriented through a particular perspective of quality a you is a human being again appoint that my friend born person makes a the time you is a human being when you take in your sense perceptions around the world you are discriminating among sense perceptions you are not taking in every thing around you and n equal rat if you did you go crazy very very quickly which means there's automatically in orientation process that his happening between you and the universe and that orientation process says peers is quality and that bridge it puts back together the true and the good because it turns out that they are in fact in mashed with one another because you cannot actually see the true unless you acknowledge the good the the book is well work the read it is really can of riveting reading cycholo it philosophically speaking i highly recommend it robot persons can and the art of motorcycle maintenance of a time for a thing that i hate i do not what a asexual is or how first from a bisexual apparently a asexual means that we ought a hi everybody hide the cookery apparently want a stop a pan or a pot or something that and i grab that sexual and go at it wane brandy has now come out as pansecual here is what that means says the washington post when you have to explain this than that means that it is nonsense term but apparently being a asexual is now in identity i just bang and everything insight is now and is now an identity the host of the gameshow let us make a deal said he had suppress his sexuality and felt worried about people finding out will also feeling shame about not being honest about himself in an exclusive interview with people always by the way it demonstrates how much privacy you seek when you do an interview about who you want a bang with people it is always an astonishing thing to me pubic i want my privacy give me my privacy my private life is my own i want a bang that one is ay at o what that the first part that argument was a complete gap with the second part of that argument i oi notice you do not actually want your privacy what you actually want is all us to cheer and celebrate who you want to bang which is a weird thing for you to want us to cheer an celebrate considering it has no positive societal impact see here is the tantric thing about marriage for example there is between a man and a woman has positive societal externalities the reason society celebrates a marriage between a man and woman is because it is made man a non aggressive creature whose a threats to others and domesticated him and it is taken woman and is put her together with man and now they will great a family and a home and sholdrin and future generations all society should celebrate that but now because we have completely separated sex from family every just won't people stand around a clap with the i to bang that furry ah amazing that is terrific for you ah and it is private it is also private i i noticed it is not you did me interview with people magazine which means that we get to mock you for using the term asexual pan sexual here is what you need you know about brandy fit you wanted parsec firs li did not meet know anything about at washington post it's perfectly happy not knowing anything about it what you really mean is what wane brandy needs us to know about who he wants to nail i am asexual brandy said bisexual with an open mine what is a bisexual with a clothes mine what is thatlok sure members both sexes and theory two of them all that bought him also open minded brandy added that pan means being able to be attracted to any one why identifies as gay straight by transsexual earn binary being able o be attracted across what leman that does make his pool extremely large every human who walks the plan it s i guess congratulation to him on really expanding his dating possibilities brandy spoke bout how he as felt to tracked to certain men but push that aside because of how i was raised and means i live in to day's world and it scary as leap bray said he was taught from young age caisson when gay was a way to hurter amount us of this on be all about how evil society is of course i only ism gay y but what if i feel something for another man that is still gay he said well i mean technically it is if you are a duded you wish to nail other dudes i feel it got pretty gay that is not stereo typical that is definitional i was already bully rout a bunch rather bleep bi don't on to add a toad on top of that suit the single entertainer said that during his path of self discovery he realized you'd always loved his daughter and his family but heeded to work harder on loving himself oh thesis always the basis of it love yourself love yours n younursel the bible says love thy neighbor as thyself right love thyself is a predicate to doing good in the world that is what it use to be now love thyself is in order to love every single thing about you requires no change no restriction on your activity embrace of everything you are or ever could be what does asexual mean and here is the washington post effnishion ready people to find pan sexual in varying ways lug is were done here it could be anything in varying ways brandy took pan to mean that not only can by i be attracted to any of these people are types physically i could be attracted to the person that is there i do not even know what that means that is a meaningless phrase not only could you be attracted to the type of person but any one you could bet or i c just els of a bisexual man glad to find some one who is asexual as a person who as the capacity to form enduring physical romantic and or emotional attractions to any person regardless of genera identity psychologist carol queen which is a held the job tells teen vogue the greatest of our publication there is no exact definition for panseuality people who i identify his asexual might want to be ready to clarify their own specific take on this identity to people who are confused about its implication i love this i do not know how to to find it people who say the asexual should b able to defend it what if you do not have any definition of this at all what what what how did brad's family reacts him coming outs as the washington post the first person brain came out to as his ex wife many i just said great as i knew coming out would help him be happier she told people there twenty your old daughter mailed brad you respond with a shrug an an oka during

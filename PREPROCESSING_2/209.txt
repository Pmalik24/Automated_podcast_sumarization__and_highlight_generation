if i did had married is and in three wise men made the right call to day an i had your program this christian holiday week and the stories of parents and others trying to make the holiday incredible for the people that they love going too great and ridiculous wants in moving live animals a deer a slid ancient reindeer bones which lead only sometimes to the most magical christmases o do you be easy chico it is this america life stay with us anon christian in three d we all learn at some point that her parents make mistakes and that cant even and i know this would be a shock make them when they are trying their hardest at christian my a grants tells the story a quick warning for people listening with young children this is he story about one family sent a cause traditions which may not be the same as yours also a i should say to day show us a rerun from a fears backs everybody hear your hearing and the story is just a bit older now and mi here is my my friend calling muffler is thirty six and to this day he talks about his christmases as a kid that is because his parents were determined to make the magic of christian come alive for their three kits calling tam and rica but they went further than any parents i know they wanted to be real really real this was in the nearbrush tohoho christian but a darker readier one that one year when calling was seven and his dad sent him to the garage for some firewood and i heard some bells and a kind of freak me out an i gran inside was an my good guides i swear i heard some bells and my own my deals no way reallieron i went we went back slowly out side and and was be founds older man calling's younger brother atom was there too this man had fall in a back yard and slipped on the is but i was young it was who as as crazy man the back yard and the sort of are you care your care and they brought him inside he was wearing a very old run down weathered jacked an he said he has like windburn and you know could you dim the lights give got stop on from the time the north pole and there is a certain amount of glare that can't be a wat we dim the lights to talked in a very soft spoke in not not a whisper but we he talk quietly enough at the whole room was silentand had to woman in nitwit was that sort of weird intimate sort of e just it mere in whatever he was saying and he basic i said on chis change madam was for and he says this is is earliest memory of christian all the bachelor kids have memories this probably because they talked about it all the time when they were little collins and madam did not think there was just one manta class living at the north pole the machzor family had their own mythology with its own logic there was not just one manta but a net work of mantas all working together as christian helpers christy cringle was just one of them a working manzanita and just a guy in a nightshirt from hell he was exhausted we can of were almost helping him dynamic with such that it was he was in a rough place and we were trying to help him and i think we talked with him forbid and an put him on his way or visitors chis appeared every couple of years or in the band of woods dividing their house in harrington partner jersey from a near by golf course never the same guy never in exactly the same place they would be dishevelled bearded and horse foist abandoned by their kiddish and surprisingly losable reindeer and searching for the bachelors who home address they never quite figured out the bachelors also had a family elf secco who the kids never saw but who apparently lived in the attic for a few weeks before christian the kids would hear noises coming from upstairs hammering working and when christian was over they would find woodscraps in the attic from the gifts he would made for them proofed that deco had been there both their father and grandfather grew up with mecca the grandfather specially loved to tell scary stories about how mean secco could be and every christian the family spent hours coming over the details of deco wen their visitors comparing them to previous christmasmas and dissipating the next when you ask the mu color kids which christian visitor was the one who out did the rest there is no question christian eve nineteen eighty four collins was eight madam was five rica was two the family was out taking their usual walk and on this night they went down to the golf course it was foggy and dark here is madam and then in the distance we see this silhouette of a shadow scampering from my treed a tree and hits golf course is an open wide spaces and looking it does not they do not want us to know that they are there and ti days as what it is to find out who that is ans we start walking faster try to catch up with the sky only come upon him he is in this i no very worn dirty manta class suit that count of this greenish brown him and he introduces himself as class offer and he is one of many sort of the the manta class and incarnations some for andthat he goes into full explanation but he doesn't my some hi since that i can we mention an chriscrangon vein a chis clavus had a worn sack and began pulling out christian but the presence for very odd there was vegetables i had a richly and on onion and then he also i and gave us some bones and that sort of comes to the most important thing as he broke out one bone in particular and he said this is one of the bones from that his the original rudolph and i use it to call the r anger again hears calling and their sister rica and literally when he broke out bones and start blowing on them we were on my god now this is crazy made no noise we could not hear it but he said it was a pitch that only the randier could her and when he talked about rudolph it was not rudolph the bed knows ranger it was he can of was honoring the history of rudolph as some you a ranger that at at they all honored and the fact that he had some of these bones of rudolph and was using them to call to the ranger just it would mad sense to us it was that make sense the details were perfectly calibrated as only people who know you as well as your parents can get just right here is madam and that is what our concur he offered all the kids he said ire can only invite the kids but you ask more come on the on a slay do i come to the north both m and we just at there frozen will i could say yes the answers know the truth is in some old man that you just met in the dark golf course on christian eve actually asks m and my brother my sister if we want go with him somewhere that we have no idea my while that might be the coolest thing of all time it might also be o the end of life as i know it again rica who remember was too at the time and i remember screaming and not wanting to go i was just terrified actually that invitation to the north pole that never happened at least not the way they remember a this is a recording from that christian eve in nineteen eighty for rica madam and calling had just come back for me to class on the recording the kid seem happy and hopped up on a etalon they talk about class but in the entire courting never mention any invitation to the north pole what you hear instead is the grandfather suggesting how would you it if he had asked yo take the north pole then their father glenchempson behold the power of suggestion that is how it seemed a lot of it worked the muffler parents making suggestions an adding details and then retelling it all year after year christian was a big topic of conversation and the muffler parents encouraged their kids with the most exciting versions of what happened on this nights to the point where the stories gained and unstoppable momentum and as the machzor kids got older things as they do changed each of the kids dealt with a differently both calla and rica say they knew it a certain point to not talk about deco and the others to people outside their closest circles but madam did not get that at all madam loves to tell a good story he could not not tell this one and he believe tole hardly in his experiences even as a tea nature in public school in new jersey and it had consequences when madam was in fifth grate he defended his stories about class and chis and the rest in front of his whole class it got confrontational with madam telling the whole group how wrong they were but the teacher ended of calling madam's parents telling them that it almost started a fight and asking them to plead es to tell madam to stop talking about it madam remembers many arguments this well into middle school people would mailman idiot or weird and he would insist that these events were true he was there it was real you guys or case not me the next year six grate madam was that his grand parents house at christian time when his great aunt blanch made some offhanded comment about which uncle played what part what year back when they were kids madam walked himself through the logic of what she was saying and he knew write then that his parents had lied to him not only that they let i me it was thirteen years old i to deal with that is a social thing that i had done i had defended myself and told these stories in front of lots of wiled of people and s another my parents re sort of responsible for allowing me to perpetuate something that made me a linin a laughing stock you were embarrass i was very embarrassed madam felt betrayed and was angry about it for years one year he came home from college and accused is parents for being the reason he could not trust any one enough to have a serious girl friend not too different from the sorts of speeches lots of kids make to their parents at that age except it was about cant even he admits it was pretty extreme this one thing made you feel you could not trust your parents even though they were trustworthy parents well it was it was that it was the for me it was the intricacy and the planning of you spent seven years or ten years perpetrating a lie that was deep an complex whether it was harming people hinted suits in o hunting people through through the through the golf course through the woods but what are you insane this is diabolical for me there was a big i break down in i know the way i trusted people m i life that i shul i think it carried on into my a dust life and even to this day i do not a hundred per cent trust any one any more do you feel it made you cynical little bet you have little bit madam's thirty three and can laugh about most of this now he sees what was greased about what his parents did at christian but he will not be doing anything it he says when he has his own kids and because of the way he reacted as a tea nature these child hood chrismases are still a touchy subject in his family when they talk about it everybody is careful to keep things ut be i wondered if the parents had any regrets for how they handled it i went to meet the bachelors my tori i glean lorry bachelor live on a beautiful quiet street it is the kind of place where dear wander through the yards a giant wreath hangs off the top the bachelor's age closer house christian lights twinkle inside an outside we sit in the living room where the mantle has been turned into an altar crowded with an assortment of spiritual icons buds vichnew a sir mama bust of jess and two different portraits of jerry tarsia i was a hippy an did the whole nine yards glen told me on the west coast in the seventies though he does not the word hippy things has come to connote laziness and he is anything but we started talking about the elaborate christmass the bachelors used to have for their kids what and i asked lory how did you get roped into all this why i as wore i am at be my old i do not know if you caught that but he called me a cynic ism not a cynic we are just excited about how you pulled this off there is no pulling all f something happened people had an experience and then you have hi sot called somebody pull something off i was not prepared for this decades after these christmases glen was refusing to admit he had anything to do with creating them so young the conjecture an or in all that stuff at would really to under mine the magic infant all the details the as you call them the mechanic her or or i you poll had you pull it off it happened that is the magic and that stew went back and forth about this for more than ten minutes here is my producer robin having a go at it you would help to know if that is just can impossible thank for us to ask if he has we have som questions about how it how it work and i just ism wondering if we can something of you could hypothesis but that is that that you because the magic to powerful and too and did they have any regrets that when they i learn truth i asked glen an lorry about the time that madam fought with his fifth great class about the muffler christian stories it seemed it would have been a perfect moment to come cleans they said after the school called them they did talk to madam but they did not tell m he was wrong they did not tell him the truth if anything they encouraged him to believe the stories were real saying i was there you were there their only parental advice was be more private about it stop talking about it at school though lorry did come to worry that they should have handled it differently i think for me i i did really start to question whether we should be making such a big deal about and i wanted to stop doing it it dead deadly happened in my mind i did and and as you can tell once a very powerful force in our family and ism and he is very powwow for yet he is and i and even before this interview if sir alike you set up the ground road about how we were going to have the interview the gan ask us and we are not in a tell right both glen and lorry say they tried to make it right for day they had no idea how the trade he felt until later lorry says for a while she did not know what to do we talked about it lot we talked about the magic and the outing get state can you see can you can you find a place where you see where it all came from it all came from good it did not come from lying it did not come from tricking it we are not bad parents because we did that finally lorry tells me this story it is an important one for her and before she starts she says she knows glen does not wanted to tell it but that is not going to stop her one christian eve when madam wasn't junior high school lorry went to his bedroom and i was giving i ism ma him a good night kiss and he can merry christian and he looked me straight in the eyes and he said he got to tell me the truth your son is looking at right me i saying you got to tell me the truth did did where those are did manta really visit us and in the back of my mind it was glen i going you never stallion never tell it the magic the magic and i issue all this magic and it is the magic and it is the spirit and i went on and on and he would not let it down he just said stop it do not talk about that stuff lend talks about that stuff you will tell me the truth tell me the t is and i i do not even now what i exactly said but i did let him know that it was not real and and a just cry that to of us and because then it over the years he when he when he did say later when h said i cannot believe that that was parenting decision that you made that you want to that extreme he just it just heard him and it was heard because a and rica had taken the same wonderful experience and held it as a wonderful experts no matter what happened or what was real they could hold it as a just a magic wonderful moment and he somehow could not and it it made me really sad glen understands that something went wrong without i my experience is this was with kids you did best you can and sometimes you i t right thing and wrong thing when you say you did the right thing you knows there's ja time when the kids are young and you experienced the magic through them it it is just special to be round you young kids in to be in that maybe i chest a little bit and and you sort of become oh you are living through them glen had been eager from the moment we arrived at his house to take us on a tour of christmast pass and after our interview gleaned lory head out with us for a walk we go up the street passed through some trees and on to the golf course it was darker than i had imagined it would be fairly illuminated by the deviant orange of near by street lights mist clung to the rolling expanse of grass then glen does what his clearly breaching to do all night gives us the play by play from his finest hour the night class offer came to visit get away stay away who axis it looking for the bucklers then the kids sad no the the the marchers glen hunch is down and reenact class offers disappearance into the distorts to he loops along he is happy manic has glen strong and his glide body the work sting there gonads old on did did that really happen it was that it was pars it thus my grands she is the noise of the culture and politics pot cast the sauce coming out tight cast tight cast to you hear me as a rain deer and a christmase page the tail twitching in justice of it that is in a minute from chico tube radio when our program continues to smart on lie from mara glass he to got a program of hostages

it you will have to ad at this now cause ism going to say i i always say it oka yet ye go through town there is a church on the right there is an old school on the left you git down to the cross roads an there is a half at store on one side an the nouses office on the other side that is a o town maybe going to fifty people she says maybe fewer an the basic facts of her child heard o the kinds of things that lots of little girls only read about in story books during the summer skinny went or two sisters it would get up the have some food an they would spend the whole days she says on her own horses writing far and wide together and when they were good out they got a baby deer a baby deer of their very on went it up a part of christian at their elementary school in a way that i think probe very really happens with dears and elementary schools added christmasas the story then which tit was ha wonder know how a deer ended up on the stage just part of your schools christian agent when you were a kid an an i guys you should explain how yuan ended up with the dearie the first place ta do you remember when you first saw the dear oh ya ya we were all on our horses and there was a dove that i jest had a jest had a baby it was it'd say may be to a three days old well we chased the do off an took the deer took the fawn did you run off the the mim hoping to get the baby o ya you did yam oh y an but at home let me tell you what we never done it again because my dad was really piss jest livid he led in to us you cannot believe can what was his argument we gowns the problem with with bringing the dear a nature should we left to nature why did we want run that dear off that mother when she was perfectly capable of raisin this fan an takin care ait why did we what give us the right to do with it to take mother nature's course away from m how how big is a fan when it is that little a is not size of a big dog in a try to picture ya it to be about the size of a big dog maybe not a real big dog don they like it could not await any more than and gin to say twenty five thirty five pounds an we put it on our horses put it across the saddle an packed it back to the house o we was tickled we really thought we would done something good and you raised it how you feet it you put a nipple o lamb nipple on a pop bottle on the end of a job bottle an they they suck it an we raised hin that summer an then he a course he lost he spots do you i it a name well we called in baby very original oke a very original is he good pet ya ya he was a lot o fun we never had a caller anything on him never did breaking to lead we jest put our hands on he is what we caller weathers where their neck goes right into their shoulders an he would walk by you we could walking damn near any place we wanted to go he would go that year the year we gotten that was the ear that they done the play an a they took a balloon am bloated up bout the size of a half ball an put it on he is not an he stood there with this red thing on hes not all during the play an if i remember right the story jest more or less entered around sand claws been sad cause he could not git around what something grew off the resents in dear we we were his nose is what guides them the light from his nose is what guides them to her thane i i think i think that is what it was ell i can remember that the they the hall was jest yon crowded everybody knew that deer was gin to be in there an everybody come to was it o really at we he was the star attraction of the show he a ya a ya they still talk about that play i do not think they ever did tap that ply how could ye was he on stage from more to the show awe was on stage for the hole shell he probably stood there for a gid two hours we spent the whole night standing the mi the be he to he would look out in the crowd and look everybody over you could sees ears moving back an forth but we we would peed you over scratch him on the neck what did he do when they applodted i would think that for an animal that must ha been strange the noise that would come from that nothing he stood the he kind god's when he would wiggle's tail in his ears and go back an forth now your dad who would been against bring in a wild animal the who time you r would his reaction was to the play he i can remember him saying that it was really a i nice play an he was glad that the dear had a part in it but i remember when we ye when we started to bran we jest badge dad to let us casteradhi when he would not do it an you knows a kid i i jest a i was upset we wot whit you went your dad to castrate him he would stay home it is jest a a dog you take a dog an if you have got a man dog an you do not want that dog to go i call it tramp an all over the country side you castration we knew that e added let us castaradi we would a had him for ever but tat and he would not let us castration ever the next year baby grew up developed antlers kidding her sisters to touch the velvet on his dauntless she says an bobby started actin differently sometimes he just wander away for days an when hunting season roll around the girls begged the dad to lock up baby somewhere in the property but the dad said not it was not right and they did not ask twice she says fortunate because it was a small town an especially after the christian play everybody in the valley there knew about baby the girls would take him into town some times in a car people would come up to them on the street an pat i and they took speech precautions therein hunting season everybody would recognize him we had a a big red scarf on hin and then we had a a sheep bell with jest jest a little smaller than a cow bell an we would painted this sheet bell red an then a course when fall common a late fall what he took off an bout ten miles away some guy i guess they sad i ever did ever talk to the die but they said he drove right up to him an shooting oh the dear did he ran away o no no he would not run cause he was a de sensitized an he he was not afraid of people when the dear was killed would you dad a jest told us that that is jest a way it wasn't that is what we got for bringing him home he told us the he said that's what happens when you mess with mother nature i guess if there is a world o the story as ye you do not you do not mess was something that is wild you jest leave it be i really you think you dad was right i think he was right hat the time i did not but looking back on it now i still pissed at that guy that shooting because your sure that he knew him oh sore he did he would he would had to he would had to have known well in fact i heard that he did that the that he knew i hope he enjoy eaten the son of a big you better it at that at no that fly to that in as to o ka hat's fine o canal that is fine i just understand how he could shoot him knowing that he was your pet he knew you give r ah yah and it'd think him back i would imagine he would probably what nineteen years old smart ask the name's what he was i can remember we cried mother cried and dad was piss he he thought that was pretty pretty low for somebody to do that to an animal especially when he knew that it was ours did you blame yourselves yes i did yes the angrysalt would have probably been the same but he probably would have lived he would probably got another year to before he would get shot you mean if you left him with his mum ye oh ye ye it is finance everything have a sweet little sentimental christian story here but now i feel sad wat ya it did it'd used if i was you wen ye was down story i think may be id kind to take a little liberty with it and not burden kids with what hap to he really what o how wouldyou wanted to end all it was just a really nice play and not tell anything happens afterwards ye ye but then if you do that version to the story then in the argument between you guys in your dad you win and cause everything were about happily ever after well lit i think it christian time maybe we should win i well it is let us let us you take to after the play what happened to the dear oh we took him home the la was always put on on christian e we went home cause it would have been ten a clock in a course sand class was gin a coming we was all he sided and send this version the story you gs if hap a ever after it ye a right ye and then that i vividly remember the next morning after that we ask if we could bring him in and that the mother dad to said yest we put a lot of christian to was on in an we letting stay in the house until he wandered in the mother's plants and then he had to go at count my race of in my from the ranch which he group outside which with you ta than an if ye was yourequorty back n two thousand twelve i am really sad to say right

maltha had felt the exact same way on their first year anniversary maltha presented him with a pen the fancy kind that came in a box oh for the love of saint nicholas manta had said what good is a pen it'll just end up losing it save your money and by yourself something nice or let me buy for you that would make me most happy of all for a man famous for his giving manta was terrible at receiving maltha took the payback and apologized and that was the end of the gift after she had died and manta was cleaning out her stuff in a jeweller box filled with the old love letters he would want during their courtship he found the pen he clutched it on the edge of the bed and wept jingles took it upon himself to just go ahead and arrange a date for manta unbidden blinds expecting you at eight said

roasted chestnuts in his hand come on in mister class said kinda with a sweep of her arm she was dressed all in white and the house smelled of fresh gingerbread manta observed with a smile that there was several magic wands gold and sparkle in the umbrella rack for most of the evening they sat by the hearth and made clumsy conversation about the loneliness of living at the north pole mostly unless i absolutely half to i do not even bother going outside said kinda and when the cable goes out it is out said manta after a beat of silence kinda looked at him a smile across her face is this a good conversation she asked manta laughed and assured her it was they played cribbage drank region and watched the snow outside the window fall and in the vestibule before leaving kinda placed her hand on manta shoulder and kissed him right beneath his ye as she did manta felt as though his chest were a chimney and inside a sleeping dove was stirring away they made a date for the following week end and just before he last kinda gave him a container of cranberry minnymuff and she baked manta told her he could not accept such a gift and witch point she thrust it into his chest with surprising forest

him you have this weird crap in your beard she said she reached into pull it out and as she did she brought her face in close enough for manta to smell her where as kinda smelled baby powder and cinnamon shell smelt of something he could not quite put his finger on cigarettes of course but something else too it set the chimney in his chest to blaze ashy black doves trying to flap out their flaming wings as shell rummage through his beard the look on her face was all little girl concentration you have nice bone structure she said you should try wearing black you did have a s slimming effect with drawing a tiny shrivelled raisin from manta's beard shell crinkled up her face and flickered on to the carpet you gross she said kinda walked back into the room with drinks and would manta reached for one he realized his hand was shaking he excused himself to use the bathroom where he thought he might hum a few carols to calm himself down everything inside the bathroom was glittery and white white glittery soaps shampoos curtains but there hanging from the white shower curtain rod was something black strung there for all the world to see where a pair of silky black stockings shells blackstockings for years manta had dealt intimately with stockings stuffing them with cold or presents and never thought about it twice but just then seeing those black stockings of hers being alone with them something came over him and suddenly he was on his toes s biting the tips a playful pup a fat old playful pup returning the living room manta sat back down on the couch and listened in captured as shell encouraged him to revise his policy on naughtiness manta nodded his head as though giving her suggestion some thought in bed that night manta replayed each of shell's words and gestures shell said whatever she felt touching and smelling everything an animal she was not afraid to take veil herself of the world drink cigarettes hospitality without much as asking she would even plunged her hand into manta smiley temple plucking the marisheno cherry right out and using his hat to wipe her hands for manta one in love with giving he could not help at see before him a kind of black hole a sexy and sublime black hole into which he could deliver forth his greatest gifts in shell he saw and insatiable hunger for life with such a woman to give to to give himself to he would feel as though every day was christian when they had made plans for the following welkin kinda had asked if manta could bring along a friend for shell and he showed up with jingles anything to help a brother out jingles it said strolling into blind's living room jingles did that thing where he jumped on to the couch while crossing his legs in mid air he landed right beside shell you are just too cute for words exclaimed shell try anyways said jingles snipping the tip of his cigar it was the length of his forearm it'd prefer to keep the house smoke free said kinda more fun free said shell say what do you call people who live around here anyway north pole a we call ourselves cold poles said jingles ever put your tongue on a cold pol honey tends to get stuck there shell slapped him on the head dork she said laughing shell and jingles had a million things to talk about all the while kinda and manta just sort of sat there smiling awkwardly and watching the snowfall it is an uninhabitable waste land manta heard shell say tana sounds blossom said jingles if only i could convince ell here over there to move the operation out jingles looked over at manta and seeing his brows struggling with his at decided to kick things into gear come on ya all said the all addressing the group gather round for a little spin o the bottle have got just the not said shell downing the last of the red wine straight from the bottle spin the what asked kinda shell rolled her eyes placed the bottle down on the carpet and spun manta watched the bottle spin with an anxiety that bordered on mania what if the bottle dictated that he was to kiss shell he would almost certainly die but he did not have to ponder such a kiss for very long for soon the bottle slowed to a halt pointing directly at jingles and when shell licked her lips and leaned her face downward jingles grabbed her head in his small hands and planted his tiny mouth on hers manta felt the chimney fire in his chest snuff out he and kinda watched them kiss then after a while they watched the snow fall then they went back to watching them kist eventually jingles led shell into the vestibule where he said he wanted to show her the secret to getting the tips of his shoes curly in in left alone and at somewhat at a boss kinda got up and fished around in a cabinet drawer beside the couch manta thought she might be looking for a game of some sort but then she said i have something for you she held out a glistening package no wayhoseg manta said ism the gift giver round here and it is not even christian yet manta was about to really kick up a fuss but then as a downright which she look fell across blind's face he trailed off it is nothing that big she insisted thrusting the present at his chest besides it was fun trying to find the perfect something for you and then to actually find it there is no greater feeling in the world but look who ism telling this to hearing her words and seeing the look of excitement on her face manta had a puzzling that perhaps he would somehow miss judge things perhaps he would somehow gotten it wrong by refusing the gifts people wished to bestow on him he would consistently failed to give the experience of giving he would hogged that particular pleasure all to himself and he took the package it was flat and square tearing the wrapping paper open he saw it was a record rocking christian party songs volume on he absolutely hated it not just because the thought of listening to had made him feel one of those old white haired hippies who had to make everything from getting their prostate check to celebrating christian not just a good time but a rocking good time but i was also one of those gifts that said something about the recipient something that was hard to swallow the gift of a backscratcher that says you're alone in this world and must fend for yourself or the gift of a warm house coat that says you are days of party dresses are over the gift of a perfectly awful christian album being handed to you by a woman who liked you said loud and clear you must learn to compromise forester all his years of giving manta knew better than any one though we do not always receive what we want nor even what we deserve we receive what life brings us and when it comes to life we have not a choice but to open our arms i love it said manta with a half smile on pealing the plastic they placed the album on the record player manta held out his arms and kinda entered his embrace and together they a ended about the room has struck very belted out run rudely

to sent these that element my named it off to you you were going to sent these that element any way family sad you needed it for you secret project that silver old thing in your lab and the lady was not about me it was about yo i mean for god sit you wont you can tell me what it does ante side is there anything i can do to make it up to you family blinked back some tears i do not know i mean it is not you can just go back in time and get me a different present panda's expression brightened wight there he said it'll be right back panda hurried down the hall crept into his laboratory and locked the door behind him his time machine was right where he had left it he climbed inside the silver all and flicked on the pawaswitch his plan was simple travel back in time to this morning finding new gift for family and bring it to the present but there were a couple of risks there was a chance for example that using the machine would caused the universe to explode he would never tested the thing out before there was also no guaranty that he would be able to find a good present he only had enough emiladium to fuel five minutes of time travel that did not give him a lot of wiggleroom wherever he went he would have to shop efficiently panda was usually a pretty good problem solver he had for example invented a time machine but want in physics and nuclear hydraulics were trivial compared to the rigors of gift shopping he managed his temples trying to remember if family had dropped any hint lately he vaguely recalled her staring at a vain craton barrel but that place was full of vases there was no way he would be able to pick out the right one he was trying to remember the name of her favorite perfume when a thought entered his head maybe he was thinking too small he is machine could transport him to any time in place in human history why go back a few hours when he could go back a few centuries he knew family loved shakespeare she would written her senior thesis on one of his tragedies why not travel back to the glow theater and site our an original script it would not be too difficult he reasonable he would have to do was dash back stage and grab one it would be the most impressive gift she would ever received in her life but which tragedy had family written her thesis about he knew it was one of the king one's richer to something would charges the something but there are bunch of those if he got it wrong it was too risky it was always jewelry he knew the general construction dates for king turns tom he could park in front of the pyramid run inside and snatch a lodestone he entered the cord nets and was about to push the lever when he started to second guess himself again buying women jewelry was always chancy family had very specific tastes i would if she did not jade it was not ye be able to go back and return it he thought back to the night they met he was finishing his p hey at the time and his lab had closed early because of master he would stuffed his papers into his brief case and shuffled through the rain to the hundred and sixteenth street station it was four or five a m and the platform was deserted except for family it had been several days since panda's last conversation with the human and when she started to speak to him he felt the stirrings of a panic attack but family's friendly smile managed somehow to put him at ease she was awfully cheerful given her circumstances her metrocard had expired she said and the machines were broken she been stranded for over twenty minutes would he be willing to sell her ride panda nodded and watched as she routed around in her purse for some cash to pay him back it was a moment or two before it occurred to him that she had given him the chance to be gallant you do not have to reimburse me he said it'll swipe you in for free she thanked him enthusiastically and then shockingly wrapped her arms around his also panda was not used to physical contact and although the hug was brief it caused his entire body to tingle from head to to it was a startling sensation wite walking through an electrically charged field he still felt that way whenever she touched him wander was an atheist and believed fiercely in random causality but by the end of their shared subway wright he was sure he would experienced a miracle this wonderful person had shown up out of nowhere and given him a chance of love and in return he given her three years of misery he thought about all of his sturdy nights at the lab ignoring her calls making excuses he thought about the way she cried when he handed her the tulips how could he make up for three years of romantic an aptitude with a single birthday present he closed his eyes and concentrated the hat to be a right answer clear paras crown on of arc's sword e baby diner for what was the greatest thing he could give her the very best present in the world it was the hardest problem he would ever attempted to sold but then as always the solution came to him wander parked his time machine by the hundred and sixteenth street station and dashed into the subway it was three forty five a n a little over three years in the past family was standing by the turn style swiping and residing her expired metrocard he took a deep breath and approached her then me guess he said it spied metrocard she chuckled had i had a hunch come on it'll swipe you throw e that is i can she said it'll just go to the machine upstairs or the machines are all broken he said you better catch this one he said the next one will not come for another twenty minutes before she could protest he took out his metrocard and swiped her through the turn style she smiled back at him with confusion are not you coming she asked as the train pulled into the station wander averted his eyes he worried that if he looked at her he would start to cry i see to take a different train he said well at least let me pay you for that is all right he said his voice breaking it is present he was about to turn away when she leaned over the turn style and hugged him twas exactly as he remembered it her long brown hair brushing softly against his neck his entire body tingling with warmth thanks she said he tried to say you are welcome but the words got caught in his throat he waved good bye as she boarded the train then he marched out of the

taken any action it just seemed he did not want to he got around the world just find without reading she started realizing a wait his literacy was a way bigger probe for her than it was for him and it really started pushing them apart i stopped being his girl friend i sort of became his coach or his or his mam and it was not fun for either one of us i tried every tactic i was patient i was nice i was stern and then i lake con of back dolmen whatever he needs to do on his own time it started to lead its way into every moment they shared together she could never fully relax any more even when

magic in life from my re glass to day's programmed for valentine's day from cam stories must have taken from real life that mimic things that we have seen in romantic comedies we arrived to dike three of our so that three the ran this of course in romantic comedy is the seen where somebody has to crosstown at some point literally sprinting to chase down the person they love and stop them from other marrying somebody else winning them back somehow it does only send up at the airport but lots o these do and honestly i have con say always surprise we found this ever happened in real life but here is one story that mercy coins a dad used to to tell this story lives about his own marriage he dot couple years ago his name is from the story goes this when he was getting together with magic's mam versus mam derby drove across the country to move in with on in forbid and for to left she had the post office forward her mail to his house in forbid and he saw a letter arrive from her defiance i think it is crazy about my dad decided that he saw that letter and he had to read it this maria he just open the letter read the whole thing and is my dad put it my mom's exfiazce was declaring his undying love for her and was begging her not to go and was saying he wants to get back together with her and my at treated out he decided this is it it is now or never he decides he is going to meet her indawlus which is where she is in her car trip and also is were the defiance lives he hurries to the airport the way he told it was he was going through the airport running through the flora air port gets a ring out of a little gumball machine puts hoer much that costs a corder r whatever in the gumball machine om pulls out a making mashing because it is flora naturally ism gets on the plane flies and meets my mam and dawn's and write there n the airport gets on o to me the second he sees her i had no plans of seeing h alliance at all what soever was mercy's mam derby she had no idea the defiance had written a letter ore the run and open it all she knew is that he had offered to drive the rest of the way across the country with her and was convener in dallies airport he gets off the plain and i greed him and practically the very next thing out of his now is my marry me am any opens up a his and and an is hand he is got this little making mustering in his hand and i am not proud of my reaction at all do e in to hear it ye look areyour y ship let are you crazy this is the craziest thing have ever heard of i barely know you that was my reaction i to say that is my favorite part of this story i would have been a little more gentle now what i love about it is that in the movies when somebody does a gesture that often it is way crazier than what he did yes and kind of stalkragh but the move just acts oh that was a totally lovely thing for per son to do because h unloved out and i that you had the normal human reaction that a normal person would have would be a you nuts right right right right yet we ism to pragmatic to fall for that one i guess live e eventually did went out though at the wedding in addition to a regular ring she also wore the making outs s here's another straborhood about somebody running to wind love which actually kind of paralleled the run that happens at the end of neelsfavorite room when harry met sally when harry met sally the way it goes is that it is nears eve carry's wandering round the streets o thing your and he realizes that he loves sally has to tell her now breaks into a run to go tell her that is very new york centric in this one because his charge to catch o cab and of course t can than he is dislike he is just gin a run the entire distance devil castonbam has a real li version of this story bet a my name stove snider the

year pass and just in when harry met sally they me a second ti in stepped family's case it is at the very same birth this same apartment and they become friends it was the kind of friendship were really it could go either way she seemed kind of interested in something more but maybe not enough and the longer they were friends it was well maybe that is what they were stove had a job as a him

jam she djinni to see the word period it was something that was kind of very hushhush and and not something i was used to disgusting openly filial thinks there is no way we can sleep together to night she is disappointed and she is stressing over how she is even get to tell him but she cannot hide in the bather much longer he is waiting on the other side of the door si laughed the bath room and it was i stepped out into another world is romantic world where he actually taken a scarf and put it over a lamp like lighting ti sis arrange move listen he did not have a shard on and my mind remembers

this little red moment laughter and he leaves and i turn the light on again and t looks a crime seen there is blood everywhere this is the first time i had seen much of my own minstrel fluid i was afraid of it i gar wouldn't even fathom what he was going to think about it just when filial thinks it cannot get worse she looks up from the bed and then i do not now how this happened but my very own red belong hand print is on his white wall my god i just panic sultan tears the sheets up the bed and throws them aside next the handspring he not any water anything in his room shall use my own saliva to wipe that the bloody want i half of the wall a out out dam so new she bundles up the sheets but she has no idea what to do with him she starts to put them in the hamper but then realizes

did not want him to have to clean up my mess i guess to cover her tracks sultan throws the comforter over the beds you cannot see the sheets or missing strains the pillows and gets ready table when jeoffrey comes back from the shower she makes the blame excuse about why she cannot see the night something about having to go to work early the next morning she could tell how flimsy it sounded as she was saying it and i just oh it breaks my heart but i remember him looking hurt and confuse i i wish that i did not leave i wish that had stayed but she did not jeffrey offered to help sultan had a cab but she was no it is find it'll just take the subway she walked to the station totally miserable that it really hits me that i have stolen this mans sheet how do you come back from that how do yet how are you not the weald girl who took his bed sheets y then ism inside myself and i hear this foe being mam excuse me madam and i look up and in new york they have this station outside of subway

pretend i do not hear them and i try to inset the subway station i we a brisk runway and nothing looks more suspicious than trying to avoid a random beg anchor shut e at oh the officer catches up to filial unzips her back back and pulls out the sheet which re covered in blood i remember him and the subway has such distinct living i just remember him holding up these sheets my minstrel sheets of shame menstrual sheets of do an i realize that they did not look menstrual sheets of do they look murder she act he asked me to explain it and i just a crying and i can barely get the words out just i trying to explain to him it is my period on this sheets and i stole the sheets from the my that i was with and i know it that is wrong like i know it the actual theft of the sheets is wrong and i promised the officer that i would return them i but i just unneeded to wash them first the police officer looks filial up and down asks for er idea and points her to go stand in a little box take on the floor by the wall she watches and walk over to his partner and have a very serious looking conversation the sheet stay crumpled up on the plastic folding table he comes back and he gives me an automaton we can go down to the pet seems am and they can file of report and they have got to keep the sheets just in case it is evident nether gong to ask me abut her questions and follow up more i can take him back to the apartment the apartment that i just came from and have my partner corroborate my story and i had to think about it i honestly i honestly gave it a really solid good think

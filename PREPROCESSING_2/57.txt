can become a part of the daily wire plus team and we fifty but o new annual memberships well there are lot of threats facing america these days one is the threat of fiscal collapse mid to long term america economic system is increasingly unsustainable here currently running a thirty three trillion dollar national debt our actual national that including unfunded liabilities runs at least another eighty trillion dollars over the next seventy five years virtually all of that is driven by medicare medicate social security shortfalls this means sooner or later were going to have to radically increase taxes cut benefits or in late our own currency was the only options available another threat is the threat of foreign a egression the united states is lucky or surrounded by ocean on one side ocean on the other side pelicans to the south and canadians to the north but that does not mean that we are invulnerable as the world becomes a more and more dangerous place as america power recedes we will feel that everywhere from our pocket book to our military bullion america hegemony has cried a global economy that is paid off for the america consumers in extraordinary ways that can easily be reversed and indicators are that it will be a third threat is the threat of internal moral collapse indeed this threat is the chief factor behind the first two threats as our communities die our local institutions lose credibility and loyalty and we stop having kids our economy turns upside down the government grows but the population that has to fund it does not government spending grows but the population supporting that government spending does not as the post america future takes hold at home it will similarly take hold abroad with our enemies ready to fill that gap that last threat is the truly frightening one it is the reason for america polarized politics we use to share basic values particularly at the local level now those values our falling away replaced with hatred and rage largely at christian and white america take for example names carving canaille is a clintonia political voice in fact he was the lead political strategist for the pistons he is a person who's retell urged the democratic party to move away from its most extreme radical woke positions understanding that they are electoral poison but now his apparently decided that the republican party in general is a threat to the united states that it is what he calls a christian nationalist party now what doe he mean by that term apparently he does not mean that many republicans preferred to see a revitalized church of the center of america life a proposition which not only is reasonable it is proposition with which i whole heatedly agree as an orthodox u america need more church notes not what names canaille means he means the republican party is in the words of far left daily confounder macros colitis an america tarlatan here was canaille on bilmarsho on fridge night i parent t li is one of the greatest threats we have to day could a akin tat i you are not christian nationals at absolve be iris a a aga threat than a write fits carry the in tektite the speak of house they got probably in us two supine for hostiles maybe more i do not kin yourself in in pipe in are have no idea who disk his for what de that's in this is a fundamental threat two the united state it is a fundamental the don women o constitution dotaitat the i poison himself says what is democracy but but to of an ilium have been lunch now what he saying here is truly nutty in caviller's use he says two supreme sort justices and the speaker of the house are leading the charge are christian theocracy by the way that quote from mi johns it is not a revocation of republicanism meaning a representative democracy it is a revocation of the idea that you can simply through majority vottidolisies but according to him's canaille that is a christian theocracy and again he says there are two supreme sort justices wore on board with christian theocracy i wonder who those would be maybe my cony ferret clarence homes ye does not make it clear and says him's canaille they're a bigger threat then the terrorist group that committed nine eleven and by that he really means than radical is lot in general again this is wild stuff we will gets o more of this in just one second first pure take has he covered for the

sees traditional republicans as the enemy canaille says it is all about the christian nationalism that is inherent in the republican party but that is leaving aside the woke side of the party bow be represented by grifter extraordinary abeam extend it man candy you will recall is the author of how to be anti basis his entire premise is that if you do not mirror the prescriptions of evermaxcendy than you are in fact a basis and he says that his fellow america are generally white supremacist i do not think a white people were whine a really recon with how much the old person agility i hate by constructions of whiteness an in how much ah that construction of whiteness a proves a white people true a connecting to humanity another words ah recognizing than a would you when you recognize that you are parton parcel of humanity o were you not over humanity he o white people are all emblematic of white supremacy they are over other members of humanity and this according to maxkendy and his ilk this is represented by the republican party in the united states this apparently will be the democratic parties campaign in twenty twenty four republicans are christian theocrat and white supremacist according to them the entire republican party is dominated i desire for white christian fascism or something the response presumably would be an millions of the secularism and people of color not shockingly that is precisely the coalition the democratic party seems to be going running on abortion and one quote anti racism the are pushing ford this agent with ugly scare tactics that is why the aplanatic magazine is dedicating its first issue of twenty twenty four to suggesting that any vote for dona trump in twenty twenty four is a vote far rachis regime according to official bomb job strap sniffer jeffrey golfer editor of that rag quote i encourage you to read all the articles in this special issue carefully though perhaps not i one sitting for reasons of mental hygiene ore time of brilliant writers makes convincingly dis positive case that both trump and trumps pose an existential threats america and to the ideas that animated in quote yes according to these folks if you vote for trump you have handed away america future this sort of messaging is also being promoted by republicans experiencing strange new respect that is the respect youreceive when suddenly you start mimicking democratic lines that be people lis chant whose mirroring the duma mongering of the left here she was yesterday sat that we trump if he is reelected will be the end of the republic what you mean he is told us what he will do people who say well if he is elected it is not that dangerous because we have all these checks and balance as do not fully understand the extent to which the republicans in congress today am have been collapse one of the things that we see happening to day is a sort of a sleep walking in too a dictator ship and the united states sleep walking into dictatorship fathom white supremacy christian nationalism all the b s words and all of it is going to materialize if dona trump becomes president in twenty twenty four now ironically this sort of alarmism is one of the very biggest route threats to the country countries in which both sides start speaking about how the next selection is the last election about how they're political opponents if they win mean the end of the country are in serious serious trouble that sort of skermongring gets out votes because everybody freaks out but it also sets the house on fire in the name of saving the house listen i want jobidon to lose in twenty twenty four i thins a terrible president doing dangerous things that will be incredibly difficult to rectify but the end of america is not in fact nigh in twenty twenty four not unless ironically every one keeps saying it is the closer both sides draw ts the abyss the more each party said the next selection is the last election the more that fantasy draws closer to reality if you have two members of a couple and both of them keep saying then next thing you do i am going to divorce you divorce becomes significantly more likely when you do the same thing inside of a country the same thing is true the country comes closer and closer to falling apart when you see your neighbors on the it as people what white supremisis christian nationalist fashions it makes it very difficult to live with those people conversely if you are on the right and you see people who vote demon cat as such a threat to the nature of the very republic that we are part of that if jobidon would when the next selection we be the last election which by the way no one believe donate trump said the same thing in twenty twenty and then jobidon one and gets what he is running again in twenty twenty four once both sides decide that the next selection is the last election the reality of that threat starts to materialized and that in fact is a true threat to the republic it is a serious serious problem now speaking of the twenty twenty four election jobidon is in fact in dire trouble the current pulling is really really bad for jobidon right now again there is no point during the twenty twelve race in which program a seriously trailed it money there is no point in the twenty twenty race in which doll trump had a serious lead on jobidon and this particular race donate trump does have a material lead against it jobidon and things are only going get worse for bid mes tateverything is pretty much baked into the cake with regard to trump this we your being the language with regard to trump get more and more heated it is very hard to add new information to the trump system trump is such as that street since twenty sixteen he is a mudmonster the more mud you throw on him the more it looks mud and the youtromormotnyou still covered in mud that means that even work e to be convicted of a crime there be a brief spike in terms of people outraged and then it would immediately get absorbed into the rest of mudmonster and everything would go away that is not true with jobidon jobidon has been made to look very in competent jobidon has been made to look very bad largely because of his own performance mean in reality jobidon sagging economy has been quite terrible for him especially among the groups he needs to vote for him according to the walls journal the pandemic made america richer across every racial at theca an income group but not equally home value shut up but fewer opportunities to spend money during lock downs many people paid down debt and boosted savings bet tween twenty nineteen and twenty twenty one the median households not worth increase thirty per cent the wealth of whit an alien households increase the most in total dollars during those years but from many black an stannic families the boost was not enough to lift them at fully out of debt one an four black households in one and seven his panic household ad zero wealth at the end of twenty twenty one the manage want of dent in their debt but those families are lander greater strain now that many of the factors that boosted wealth during the pandemic have reverse other words the economy has been particularly bad for black and hispanic america those are exactly the sorts of people the democratic party is counting on what is more the economy is in fact starting to cool inflation is coming down but too is the stock market the stock market is starting to mediate because of course as inflation comes down prices on bonds are going up which means prices on stocks are comparatively less good your starring to see the unemployment starts creeping up that that sort of sweet spot even if we find it its going to mean an increase inion employment generated by bad economic plans from the bide administration and radical over spending by all of that is leading up to the election in which jobidon is going to be eighty some years old

right harder it is that the more she got hit the worst she look the same is true for codons to yesterday names comer whose the had of the house over my committee he him out wit the announcement that jo bison did in fact receive payments from e in organization that was run by hunter widen a fun that was essentially funded by foreign sources and belong to hunter bison here was it him's comer explaining resent jo bison claim there was an absolute wall but tween this official government duties and his family influent peddling schemes this was a lie present jo bison claim his family did not receive money from china this was a lie present jo bison claim being never spoke to his son hunter bison about the widens family shady business teelingsthis was a lie that hunter bid's legal and the widehouseis medially claim hunters corporate invites never made payments directly to jobidonwe can officially add this lathis talking point to the lis the lie to day the house overside committee is releasing superman bank rockers that so hunter bison's business unity a disco pa mad direct monthly payments to jo bison this was not a payment from hunter bidet's personal kill but a count for his corporation that receive payments from china and other shady corners of the world on case this is comer's claim and a claim happens to be true there was money that passed between this particular lawful a was p c which had receive payments from a chines stately company and other foreign companies to jo widen there is some direct monthly payments nowt were they large payments they were not the three payments of one thousand three hundred eighty dollars that currents and member october nonmember twenty eighteen were apparently for a twenty eighteen four rapper truck that widen had purchased that hunter bison was using according to an ye new verified by washington post forensic analysis under bidet's attorney aby towels said quote there chairman comer goes again reheating what his old as new tried revive his sham of an in investigation the truth is that hunters father helped him when he was struggling financially due to his addiction and could not secure credit to finance truck when hunter was able to he paid his father back and took over the payments himself i what that does not actually to bunk the charge the charge that comber is making is that money that was got ton ill gotten gains from foreign sources were used to reimburse jobiton is a matter the size of the payments an soy matters the matter is that this is now a documented instants of money passing from chines at linked firms to hunter bison and then to jo widen it does not have to be that jo bison receive this as can on top form of en richest just ease he have a wound to his son men is sun paid back the lone using money from ill gotten gas does not mean that jobitdon has not benefited from ill gotten gains if i give you lone and you go out nyourob a bank another you payee back that lone i still benefited i give you the loan you me money and if you give me he money i have benefited obviously a spokes person for the over si committed used the fact that the payments came from one of hunter bidet's accounts to suggest something more ti various quote there is now pattern of members of bison family using their bank accounts that been funded by chines another nonentities to send money to jobidon based on witness testa on bide knew and participated in his families influence peddling schemes the checks an payments we have in cover revealed jobidon benefited from them but the washington post was that this is a in oversold story their is representing the committee's findings and all the rest now again i do not even understand whate'er trying to to bunk here the thingthat they are trying to bunk his pretty obviously true meaning that job bison did receive money from hunter bison's accounts and those accounts were not in fact getting money from foreign sources the sizes of t of the payment does not really manner joins suggested he never receive money from any of these relationships first he suggested that hunts are never done anything wrong that turned out to be obviously untrue then he suggested that he had no knowledge of hunterever having done anything wrong and that obviously was untrue then he suggested that he was not involved in any way in his sons business that obviously was untrue then it was that he was not in business with his son that is not clear and then it was that he received no money from his son from ill gotten gains and that obviously is not true in fact corensjon pierce was asked yesterday world's worth pressecretary about the payments and does she simply ended the press conference eyes stele the the president and i son whatever as i beer ate rely a we a a r agree beer can her a won her iris o a he see e r ha e side i e preen we amen and we the be a a man ever a her wore es a wallseratan sees to be e clear with you i have not thin tat report i would have to refer to my colleagues over at the wen house councils office on that particular question a it every one see some of the in boon or on whencsthey tinkering catchlater by again none of this is going to benefit jobidon his record on the economy is week his personal foibles are obvious to every one and the more the media keep trying to talk past them the more everybody notices them there is a reason that jobidon is not contain up to bating donate trump in the selection cycle and it is because he actually cannot be on the same stage as dona trump donate trump is a very lives having seven year old and jobidon is a very not alive eighty one year old at this point in time or will be by the time the election happens in one second we will get to jobidon's foreign policy record

pound to fifty and sake were baby to get started saving lives to at commensal the bin ministration foreign policy right now there are several issues on foreign policy that are threatening to bides reelect efforts one of them is obviously u crane this was the great moral war that jobidon got behind very early on and it was an immoral for the united states to support you crane in preventing russia from taking over the entire country all the isolation is out there homelike well you crane provoked russia into it let us as som for a second that your totally rights that mean that russia now gets to completely invest you crane is that the actual solution as that russia its to unless you crane and put itself on the borders of ado by the way would that be a smart solution or does it make sense that you provide enough aid for you crane actually be able to repel that invasion and then recognized wat the realities are on the ground which the russia has significant build up in donnas in crime and that short of going to direct war with russia which nobody wants the final lines of demarcation were pretty obvious by aril mad tune of twenty twenty two and yet mobile never made clear what exactly his goals were in you crane instead they just kept saying things as long as it takes whatever the ucranians want well the problem is that the ucranians had never even articulated a goal other than the complete liberation of don was and crime and then the united states was not willing to provide the weapon my tat would actually be necessarily the have sixteens that e necessary in order to actually achieve i superiority for example in those particular regions they have not been given be amount ammunition and armaments necessary t actually make that sort of thing effective unto hundreds of thousands of people have been dying on both sides of this particular war in pursuit of moving a line that has not moved this is turned into world were one trench warfare essentially and yet the white house is not proclaiming that if this thing turns into a stale make which are already is then obviously that will be because of some short coming in funding that's pretty obvious all long what should have happened here and recessenger spelled it out again last year it was an in popular point of view but happen to be correct ye easily said that the united states was going to half to make clear to the ucranians what the solution was namely we will provide you enough aid that you gites are not invest invaded again an the can defend yourselves against future invasion we will provide some set of defense guaranty also you are probably not can end and tornado because if you an tornado than that is obviously going to project a egression against the ruffians you are not going to be formally admitted to the e at least not right now and also russia is going to easily maintain the lines that they gained under president mama by the way in twenty fourteen when they invited russia when the invaded crime and the donnas and then the united states was going to have to make that side deal of potent and go to zolenski and the ucranians in basically cramatdown on them in tillisen were the one for singing the checks and that lot the stealscan go why not because that is bad for you crane or kolinsky but because it is good for you crane or kolinsky because kolinsky at this point cannot go back to his own people and tell them ism not taking dohnbass ism not taking crime he obviously has every interest inlaying that he is going to take both of those things but it is not really a plausible solution and instead because the bid administrations did not have the stones to simply go and negotiate that deal and then give kolinsky the ability to rip on bison and saylason i wanted more but biding force it on me because bison was not willing to take that hit instead biding on t take the entire hit which is going to be a consistent feeling off stale mate with no offal anywhere in here and he is going be one pays the political price for that for his part bison and the white house there now trying to project all responsibility for that stalemate not on their own failure to spell out a strategy in the first place or a recognize reality on the ground when a materialized me again the united states tried to bride the armament's material necessary for a major winter offensive from you craned against russia e just never broke through in any serious way instead they are now trying to project their own failures on to congress for not wanting to extend to eight now will congress end up extending it yes congress lend up extending aid to the extent necessary tat you crane will not fall to the ruffians that is a thing that the united states will do there is a large support even in republican circles for at least that much even republicans do not want a see reeve fall to the ruffians at least the vast majority of them but what the white house now saying is that unless you continue to sort of grant blank tracks as the white house uses in its discretion then you are somehow helping potent national secure adviser take seven en represser yesterday in which you points it out that you crane would run out of resources by the end of the year on you crane as you ball seen earlier to day a medirectorsia on the young sent to letter to can session leader is with core is just referencing explaining that without congressional action the administration will run out of re sources by the end of the year to procure more we an equipment for you crane and to provide equipment for guess military stocks without in packing our own military readiness speaker o the house johns responded he said the bide administration has failed to substantively dress any of my conference is legitimate concerns about the lack of a clear strategy in you crane a path resolving the conflict or plan for adequately insuring accountability for aid provided by america tax payers house republicans have resolved that any national security supplemental package must begin with our on border and again there will be some sort of package yell that and unsigned here mainly because jobidon and the democrats keep vetoing each independent part of this bill but the white house instead of spelling out what their actual plan here is instead they're suggesting that if you do not support the kind of funding they want you are helping out gotten which again is not going to be a particularly strong argument you than many i believe that any member of congress ho is not support funding or you crane is voting for an outcome that will make it easier forprudent to er vail that is a not a g ends supporting you crane is a to to improve prudent i is iron that is just thin tiny capable reality that is nonspeaking to some one t to motive why they chose to go trains ti that is just speaking o the outcome of the cot well i mean it happens to be true that if you crane were to collapse to the ruffians of course that helps glanrpooten the question is how d you comes to an agreement on what exactly the united state should be doing here the your times reports that the democratic led sent is preparing o to weasand more than sixty one billion dollars and you crane focus to distance as part of one hundred and six billion dollar national security package there ware also fund israel war effort in gaze but apparently the white house is now trying to pressure grope waw makers to abandon border security concerns the republicans are a art aiming for some sort of for security package attach wall this an democrats a saying no now who is against the aid again if this a battle of poison pills that are significant poison pillar throwing in there republicans are saying habits border security and democracy sang no why would you say no and by the way it is not as though this administration is laid forth a cohesive strategy with regard to you crane the washington post admits as much quote is calculations divisions marked offensive planning by us you crane apparently a meeting in brusseles let than two weeks into the campaign illustrates how a counter offensive born and optimism has failed to deliver its expected punch generating friction an second guessing between washington and reeve and raising deeper questions that you crane nobility to retake decisive amounts of territory as winter approaches and the front lines free in a place you crane's most senior military officials acknowledge the war has reached a stale made this examination of the lead ups you cranes count our offensive his based on interviews with more than thirty senior officials from you crane the united states and european a nations and it chose that there is a gap between what the us and u crane thought were actually possible for example yours military officials were confident a mechanized frontal attack on russia lines was feasible wit the troops and weapons you crane had the simulations concluded that reeves forces the best case could reach the sea of so and cut off fussing troops in the south in sixty to ninety days but apparently that never happened you cranial did not want to do that there is a gap in stretch planning between the united states an u ran there is no offal and then the idea is that unless you give the running the white house is sort of asking for that you are anti u crane about you spell out a plan g but again jobidna's box himself in here because he has spelled there is no offal what looks a victory for twenty twenty four for you crane absolutely unclear at this point meanwhile victory is well within grasp for america ally israel against comose and meanwhile the the white house is he sort of fussing around over there hen it comes you can elk gong ho all in let us do this thing unstoppable aid no plan unstoppable aid no victory no us keep that money pouring in er you love gotten and then on the israel issue israel shall has the military capacity to finish off comes israel has the military capacity to make the gaze strip at the very least quyessen with regard to anti terrorism and this is where the united states is putting it to anti focus this is where they're like dunno got a stop short why the gap why the gap a man it comes from a fundamental under misunderstanding of for police is where the gap comes from russia is a new clear armed heavily caponized large power there dug in when it comes to don bass and the crime there is there is no rational for any sort of locked that you crane is going to take both those areas that is at absolutely clear the situation on the ground is the situation reground meanwhile the reason t the bid administration keeps fussing around with regard to the middleleast is because there still under the john carry misimpression that palistinians are central to middle east piece which is a lie it was debut completely by the abrahamicords in fact it is specifically because that notion was exploded by the abrahamicord to end by the burgeoning relationship town israel and saliurabia that commons tried to throw a wrench into the gears with they're a tap on october seven what is the bidemnistration doing there immediately doing compasses work by calling for concessions from israel to the palistinians and telling israel to stop short what is the rational for that other than a complete dunderhead foreign policy how problem for began is it is got be pretty obvious that if you stop israel from winning an choice of military victory in the got o trip that sing to look great either i understand is trying to place is radical base in democrats are filled with radicals who the israel i get it but that sign look a a victory to theamerican people who are going to punish america they can punish whatever america regime is in place whatever administrations in place for military losses america do not lost wars their not a big fan and far jobidon is presiding over lost war an afcannistan hots presiding over a stalemate that he refuses to declare stalemate in you crane and he is presiding over what could be a clear military victory for israel but is being hamstring by the america by the america state de apartment and radicals in the democratic party will get to that momentarily first the holidays not only allow us to spend time with family they are a minder of how important our

terrorist organization labeled that such by pretty much every western power compass is here that they're absolutely horrific in fact every day brings news of more of their atrocities including the fact that they apparently drug the hostages they were returning to israel that with rubies they literally ruby them s they would look as though they were happier or calmer when they were released from hostage captivity back to the israelies in fact the state department yesterday announced that commons is not turning over a bunch of young women where still hostages because they do not want those young women talking about what they did to them one of the reasons they do not want o turn women over that they bey hell then history and the reason is pistol apart is they don't what they one women to be on talk about what happen than them during their time and gossipy now one of the thing that is been happening inside the administration is a bit of a gap between the state department which is shockingly shockingly pro israel in many of these way and the pentagon which is shockingly pro israel elistrohn curly is and then some of the heroes the the people at the national security administration for example and us ay mulligan wits asked about wycomass with not turning over these women and said were not in speculate which is know completely at odds with what the say department s pokes person just said there bean speculate on that only to say that they have not done it and i only say were greatly concerned about that i ism i can speculate is to the reason against one the things that the administration has been doing is wailing and wavering which the making cause when it can when t came to crane there is no waffling no wavering know nothing despite no actual and of conflict that that was projected or expected or articulated here is pretty obvious what the goal is and theadministrationis working to obfuscate that call not only that the administration is working really hard not to tick off it is progressive left wing base on the tissue in the somehow mistaken belief that in order to win over it is left win and there and thus win the presidency that to throw israel under the bus which of course its ridiculous because by polling data most america are much more support of israel than for example come ass theadministration play to the other win said comes has to go compass is evil comas committed mass rape commas committed mass murder israel has to going to do it it has to do and were in of worry about what happens on the other end afterward this is a moral fight if the administration were to say something that in the same way that they say about you can that is a victory israel would actually win that is what is truly amazing about this meanwhile of oreencon pare yesterdations ask about for millogiopole who is that of the congressional progressive coulis your call yesterday we played a clip of her explaining that there need to be balance with regard to how people talks about rape by homos that sure comose was raping people but they have to be balanced and how they talk about that as to establish moral equivalence between israel an compass here is corncob our refusing to condemn giapoll on this sssatsgat a action e ben very very clear i ear little it from ism take somnolent about this i i and only speak her for the president that is who i can speak for and we have been clear we homattet is absolutely reprehensible and will stop began i continue to be clear about that and we think about in a rape and the yous rape ask bemused as as a weapon that is also reprehensible but why exactly will not they condemn fromilacioppole or for that men richer to leave or for that matter than oar and the answer s because they are afraid of their left wing base left going basis still governing this administration at least at the margins and and that lepton basis crazy take briony joy gray who is kind of a crazy person she is the former national pressecretary for burneystanders in surprising she treated this out quote believe all women she is talking about the rape of his daily women believe all women was always an absurd overtake women should be heard clam should be investigated but evidence is required the samdmnistre of the allegations out of israel but also this is not to believe women scenario because no female victims have offered testimony first of all it they were shot in the head e knows not around to a explain to about their rate the people who are dead cause they were shot in the head or kidnap those people not around to talk about it but there many contemporaneous accounts witness testimony medical reports but don't matter does not matter because again the idea from the radical left is to reestablish this moral equivalence and the by administration for some reason keeps on falling fort over and over it is in the democratic party and it certainly in the media burned standers yesterday did what he does best establish that moral equivalent he suggested that the nothing yow who government is being a moral that you t understand the voted language here is bid of a cot when people on lots the sitting now h government they're ignoring the fact that there is a unity government in israel right now yes benjamin in to now has the prime minister he is part of a war cabinet he can be overruled by that ware came he is just a vote in that war cabinet then he goats is a member of the opposition party he is the person many democrats would to see leading the country right now in israel and he is part thy government that is a unity government that is why burned keeps saying in it is nah because there is this bazar notion on the left that sitting out worn out there somehow the to be going to promptly out it would not who would be going exactly the same or in some in some ways probably harsher biting ow who tends to ben incrementalist on a lot of this sort of tuff gate and gallant not particularly clear that is the case anyway there as burned yesterday doing his routine ta come when over two hundred and fifty people have been killed in the west bank o the to to to got talking about the west bank since told the some an for tan a thousand pals ties have been driven a all they land in the west want tho in the midst of all o that i do not bell we should be appropriating open ten bullion galls for the right thing extreme ten net in ya who government to continue it is current nilitaryopot what the that in ya who government is doing is i marl it is in violation up intonational law and the united that's should not be complexity in those actions loving him bat international law from communist fellow travelers its reality is really a a lot of fun and when he talks about what is going on the wetback he is ignoring the fact that there it enough terrorists in the wetback in fact it was the amount of terrors m i the west bank that drove israel to prior to october seventh move many of its forces from the gaze envelope around gaze and lead up to october seventh into day and maria to trying fight terrorist in places lagtionen as far as t accusation that pallsingins are being driven off the land mass at no the answer there is the very bunch of illegal palistinian settlements that are in fact pen of corrugated iron shacks in many of these cases and those are being dismantled by the is really military in many cases it is amazing build an extra bedroom in a from which a really nice city in the west bank an his jewfish city in the wetback then this means or violating international law if ho ever you rob up a corrugated iron shaft injured and maria and you call it historic palistonian territory and then the idea of comes into sandals it than this is somehow dispossession that is the way all o this works in any case this narrative is being driven by the media as well the y narrative that israel is engaging in vasts human right violation despite the fact that they're engaging in more strenuous attempts to avoids villain casualties than any army in modern history by the way worth noting at this point that all the casuals i casualty starts theatre being repeated adnausan by the press are being gurnard by the fossa ministry of health namely commons and they are lying about all of those this has ben pointed out by an nimby an account hale iceberg fifty five these word member of honest reporting and a he points out that the women an children numbers from the gossip ministry of health are grossly in floated and that is perfectly obvious for example can cha publishers a daily flash up takes ins october eighth insisted i detailed music casualty figures provided by commas it's immediately obvious the commons is not report any combatant deaths the numbers amazingly seem to indicate that idea of command bullets list proportionately hit women children in the elderly buy the numbers are fate it first becomes apparent on october nineteenth reporting for common reports three thousand seven hundred eighty five deaths first is three thousand for hundred seventy eight the prior day on edition of three hundred seven deaths but children magically moved up from eight hundred fifty three dad to one thousand five hundred and twenty four dead plus six seventy one october eighteenth reporting deaths were twenty five per cent kids the next tantrum to forty per cent kids no explanation is given and this sort of idiocy marks ever single edition of casualties again it took israel weeks and weeks two determine who is eaten dad in far ora i know people who attended funerals literally yesterday for people who are killed on october seven and by the wander jewfish law one somebody is dangers pill sorry them the next day that is how long the took israel a highly a highly technical technocratic government to figure out how many people have died meanwhile commosgus throwing out one million begilian child poets being killed in gowan a r takin that at face value and tat of course is leading members the media to repeat that sort of nonsense will gets that in just one second first the holidays are here if you are looking for

in reporters he it is piratically has these interviews were he just a silly things he had an interview with margragav who is a who is a spoke person for these really government an which he points out that a bunch of members of a family of a mean and producer hade been killed in gaze and region points out that they ware weeks and minds of israel telling people to get out of the gosh strip a d millions of people did an tapper then says were cannot blame people who who did not i mean you certainly can point out that they had warning and they did not get out of a arson when millions of people literally did over a million people moved here is this exchange it is very hard to believe that especially on a day when one of our produce ears lost nine members of his family nine members of his family who were not members of comas not members of the plus million is onto hot not members of any group just nine people just trying to live their lives costume i extend my sorry to him and my sympathies but if i saw you re put correctly an and please correct me if i wasting mong that happened in northern gaze an gas city were a month ago we the ask to the civilians to leave and most of them did if there was one million to hundred thousand people they the was on couple of tens of thousands lift and what has to ask yes they had a ample opportunity love hem unidenknow what happened in under the specific circumstances i know this deadly come bat at going on now in the north still between these idea and and and and i us terms yes and we donkey see anyone put up in the creepy but why did not they he the advice anele anthmaerea i cannot blame them the there is now done lame but you cannot this fighting in the south now n where where are i can have been asking the since october seventh where i people suppose to go they did go they did go a million of them moved they are suppose to go to the areas that israel tells them to go to as at mean perfect securement of halala better secure than staying where israel telling you not to be again t but see an end's idea which is that somehow if israel gives weeks of warning than people do not move that somehow what what exactly was israel supposed to do ism just wondering every seems to think that israel has a magic gulas or it to making all the same people were pistol and marry tail agree with their silly jewfish space laterstoff seem to think the news actually have a spaceless ere in israel and they can use their magic space laser just at the baggie while leaving all of the norms sort of touch that is not the way war works and when you go out of your way to tell people to we for weeks on and and then they do not it is not that it is quonquat their fault it is that they are in a dangerous area they have been told to leave best ne is doing the same sort of moral equivalent nonsense able new at a full report on the supposed ma treatment of palistinian quotiqual defines now these details our people who tried to commit acts of terror against his rallies and the idea here is that israel is just hostages o no it is not my concern is that this rail authorities are not treating palistinian children told do not think that akin body conclave n that locking o large numbers of portray to long periods of time is either just or helpful beyond that the low is also different for palistinians and is realize palistinians living in the less bank tried in military out is really settler is legally living there arrive an civil court in israel child in a settlement next to a palistinian village throws a stone that child is tried under the israel system a palistinian child in the visit next store who throws the same stone its subject to a military court system pretrial attention is the norm well hold up a second that is because the palistinians are living under the palistinian aufcarty there foreign population in terms of actual governments that is saying that when a that when a crime is committed against america soldier over seas that person is tried in military court dispose to an america civocort well yes that is yes come t again the whole guy here is to trying and generate some sort of moral equivalency israel and its enemies here and this is this is the wholistic is the hook here is the bottom line for fort mobile the entire confused moral line taken by jordan is likely to result in no victory for mobile because even if israel gets done what it needs to do in the face of america pressing the by administration is now making in impossible for t to claim any sort of victory in all of this speaking of which victory in the generalized the aria seems to be difficult to come by for a fuss ad ministration the its focus on basically appeasing iron according to politico in ours long firefight involving us commercial vessels in the red see this weekend has left summit us officials frustrated by what they see as the bide administrations deliberate down plan of a major threats

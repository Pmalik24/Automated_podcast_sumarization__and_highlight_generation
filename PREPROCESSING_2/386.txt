welcome to the superman laponcens a science sciencepace to i man druwhuberman and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing fertility we will discuss male fertility and female fertility and i should mention that to day's discussion is not just for people who are seeking to conceive children or who want to know how their children were conceived but it is really for everybody and i say that because it is the story of all of us all of us are here because a specialize set of cells called germ cells that is the sperm and the egg and it'll make it very clear why they are called germcells limit later has nothing to do with infection but it is because a sperm cell and an eggshell arrived at one another either invite inside of our mother or invietro called invietro fertilization and then were implanted into our mother and became us and understanding the process of how the cell and the sperm cell came to be is really the key to understanding how that fertilization process came to be i know every one's think i know how fertilization occurs it occurs through sexual intercourse and on and will talk a little bit about that but i promise you that if you understand the menstrual cycle and the menstrual cycle and to days conversation can best be thought of as a biological cycle that occurs females that allows the potential for fertilization by the sperm because that is really what it is and it is a beautifully orchestrated process that ill describe to you and i should say all people males females should really understand how the menstrual cymbal works how it impacts fertilization but also how it impacts the brain and body behavior psychology et camera and weillalso talk about spermatagenesis how sperm cells come to be and how they arrive that is how they win to the egg and the incredible interplay between the biology of the sperm and the biology of the egg leads to this incredible thing that we call embryogenesis and the birth of the child and of course the development of that child into and infant a toddler and adolescent a teen and an adult to day's discussion again is not just for those of you set are seeking to have children and i say that because when you look at the data you look at the literature on longevity and vitality to themes in biology that oftentimes people lump together but are not always the same for incense there a lot of things that we can do to increase our vitality that acthican harm are longevity but there ore a subset of biological rules and mechanisms that when a lined allow us to maximize both our vitality and our longevity and i think it is fair to say that all of those mechanisms and tools are housed in the discussion around maximizing fertility and that is true whether not your male or female in other words if you want children or if you do not if you already have children or if you do not understanding how fertility and fertilization occurs in the brain and body will allow you to maximize your vitality and longevity and of course to day's discussion will provide an understanding of the biology and many actionable tools that will also help you conceive children if that is your wish of course as is characteristic of this podcast we will discuss science based tools including behavioral tools both the dues and the do not and we will discuss nutrition base tools and supplementation base tools and some other practices including things acupuncture which have quite good data to support them in terms of improving fertility and we will discuss why those certain practices can work and we will discuss prescription drugs that your doctor can prescribe to you if for instance you have a despite that at the level of hormone production or new transmitter production at the level of the brain or the pituitary gland all explain what all of those things are soon or the gonads the very and the tastes in females a males respectively again by the endings episode you will have a lot of knowledge and actionable tools related to maximizing fertility and you will have a lot of knowledge and actionable tools related to maximizing vitality and longevity before we begin it'd to emphasize at this podcast is separatefom my teaching an research rolls it stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performances element contains a science bactolectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one graham of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doctor slash supermen let us talk about fertility and in doing let us take a step back from this word fertility and ask what is fertility and fertilization really all about the obvious answer is that it is about pot using offspring but more importantly it is about producing offspring that contain the genetic components of both parents and indeed contain the half of the genes from one parent and half of the genes from another parent now there two general types of cells in the body the most common types of cells in the body are called somatic cells this would be all the cells in your body except the egg in females and the sperm an male the egg in females and the sperm males are part of what is called the germ line and again has nothing to do with infection it is just that the cells of the germ line have genes that cannot be modified by the behavior of the individual that houses those genes what o i mean by that well if i were to tell you that by exercising you can improve myna conduct function you can change hormones a by reducing stress you can produce cortesall by u hitting puberty for instance a you will have the assertion of hormones that then change scene expression an other cells leading to development of body hair facial hair deepening the voice brestgrowth et camera you would say oke great now that all makes perfect sense but that is all occurring in the called somatic cells the germ cells are the germ line cells that is the egg in the sperm are a very unique and protected set of cells that are generated in a particular way and whose genetic components are not modifiable by experiments and when you take a step back you thing about lousy oh that is right there is no reason to thing that exercising will make the children that you have not yet had stronger an ins of course not whet why is that well that is because there is a barrier between the genes of the germ line cells and behaviors the cannot be modified by behaviors and the various things that you do in your lifetime now i suppose there is an exception in the negative direction and what ism referring to her is if you were to say be exposed to a chemical that could mutate the dine of your egg or sperm or if you were to fertilize and embryo at a in a certain way at a certain stage of life that it got an extra chromosome for instance will talk about this limit later well then of course you could end up with offspring that have modified done that do not faithfully represent half of the genes from mam and half of the genes from dad but that is not the same as specific behaviors modifying the genes of those cells the sperm in the egg cells in a way that improves the offspring the key first thing to understand today is that there is a distinction between somatic cells which is the vast majority of cells in your body g the called germ line cells which are the egg in the sperm the egg in the sperm are these highly protected populations of cells that in females actually come to be during embryo genesis case for all females out there you generate what todaamina refer to as a vault of cells you have a vault of of eggs that are your germ line those eggs all contain all the comas comes of your d ane it is going to be as most of there r twenty three cromazomes and cromazomes a consist in pairs the way to think about this as each pair is one strand and you have twenty two called otozomes and thenyou have one sex cromazone the sex cromazon will either ex or why in a female they have two ex cromazomezo in each one of the eggs that a woman has and that she is had since she was an embryo and that is contained in this vault those eggs are of course going to be very immature at birth right she hasn't undergone puberty yet and certainly as an embryo she hasn't undergone puberty and those cells are going to contain twenty three pairs of cromazomes it is very important twenty the pairs of cromazomes the cromazomes are essentially the wrapped up d n e that contains all the genetic information to great any cell type in the body and actually to create an entirely new individual now there twenty three pairs of cromazomes twenty two of which are called autosomes of f that does not make sense u just remember ottozome okay there is twenty two of them and then there is one called sex cromazome the sex cromazomaz are either ex or why but this is a female she is can have twenty three pairs of cromazomes and she can have two ex cromazomes for the sex cromazomes c if this is already confusing to you do not worry it'll make it very clear how this all relates to fertility and how it relates to cromazoma aggregation and a bunch of things that i think that be we heard of and that perhaps a were opaque to you but i promise to make them clear but just understand that within a oh of those eggs they have twenty three pairs of cromazomes and for those of you that coming clatter it'll tell you that those cells are considered diploid they are called the diploid and that means that they have twenty three pairs of cromazomes as distinguish fromacells that are hap laid where there is only one set of those twenty three cromazome and stave twenty three pairs there is only twenty three cromazones will will come back to haploid cells aloe it later o k when a female is born she has all these eggs in the reserve in this vault that shall have for her entire life she is not going to make any more but they are very very immature when a woman is in embryo genius she develops these very immature eggs of to day we are also on n talk about folicals and and we will be careful to distinguish folicals from eggs there often talked about interchangeably on line and elsewhere and even by fertility demand of be givens but will know were just talking about the egg cells of the eggs themselves which are cells now the goal of fertilization is to bring that egg cell into close enough proximity that it can be fertilize by a single sprermacell and that permcell will bring twenty three cromazomes as well that include just as in the female egg it all have twenty two autosomes and one sex cromazome and in the male that sex cromazome can either be an ex cromazome which then would give rise to female offspring or e a we cromazome which would give rise to male offspring and to day we are not talking about sexual differentiation that's a topic of a previous and yet another future episode but just to give you a sense of how ex cromazomes and we cromazomes can actually accomplish that sexual differentiation both of body and brain it'll just mention in two sentences that for instance if there is a we cromazome as oppose to an next cromazome that we cromazome contains genes that suppress for instance the development of female genitalia and thereby give rise to male genitalia rather than the formation of liters is the formation of a penis and rather the formation of overs the formation of a testes oke that is more directed towards sexual differentiation were not going to get into that right now will get into that in a future episode but even if you are only tracking about ten per cent of what ism saying right now i promise you are doing great if you are tracking more than ten per cent well then you are going terrifically well because the essence of fertility in fertilization is to bring together that help laid cell that is the sperm that only has twenty three cromazomes but not pairs of cromzomes right carat's the dine from dad together with the egg which as i told you already has twenty three pairs of cromazomes part of the fertilization process has to be to get rid of one half of those twenty three pairs in the female and to get rid of it and you have to get the egg in the sperm in proximity that the egg can potentially be fertilized by the sperm bringing the dine the twenty three single strands f cromazomes from dad into a cell that has twenty three single strands from mom oke realize in proxy being a little bit repetitive here but i want everyone to understand this cause it really frames up fertility and reproduction and the proper way we have got a sell from mom the egg which has twenty three pairs of cromazomes we need to get rid of one set of those pairs that there is only twenty three cromazomes we need get rid of half of those cromazomes and then we need to bring that cell together physically with the sperm cell that contains the twenty three cromazomo strands from dad and we need to bring those together that you get twenty three cromazomo pars from dad and twenty three cromazomo pairs from mom and in doing you create a cell which then becomes multiple cells that is going to be the developing embryo that has half the genes from and half the genes from dad i hope that is clear that is the biological logic which i realize as a bit of a tongue twister but a forgive me it is the a most accurate way to describe this process we are trying to bring together the twenty three single strands of chromosomes from dad and the twenty three single strands of cromazomes from mom into the same cell now that requires a literal f physical contact and parring of the two cells but as i mention before all these eggs in mam are sitting in a vault and their very very immature the oblatory cycle in the menstrual cycle a really about first eliminating half of the chromosome pairs in that twenty three sets of chromosomes and not getting rid of for instance half just going one to ah one to eleven or and then or twelve to twenty three that is not the goal the goal is to have chromosomes one two three four five six all the way up to twenty three but only to have half of the chromosomes there and to bring that sell together with the sperm cell physically then allow them to fuse and allow the chromosomes from dad in the chromosomes from mam to fuse within a single cell and duplicate into cells that contain half the chromosomes from dad and half the chromosomes from mom that is what the oblatory and menstrual cycle are really all about en think about it that way it'd to just initiate the discussion by focussing first on the female component or the egg component of fertility and fertilization as i mention before a female has all the eggs it'll be it very immature eggs that she is going to have at the time that she is born now puberty will happen at some point and will allow the oblatory in the menstrual cycle to commence now one question that you perhaps a asking is what controls the onset of puberty and there there are number of different results each of which could be an entire episode of a podcast on its own but are just highlight a few things that we know about the onset of menses or menstruation or it sometimes also call themenarchy right one thing the go not about to day's discussion is that if you were to take any number of your notes on line and put them into o a search function that you would see a lot of different language used for the same thing for instance some people talk about the egg in the physical as the same thing even though they are not it'll explain the different soon some people talk about men sense or menstruation or monarchy is the exact same thing and in fact they are not the exact same thing but oftentimes these a words are used interchangeably it'll do my best to day to not overload you with nomenclature but rather to use the most commonly use terms for the different aspects of fertility and fertilization but when it comes to the onset of puberty first of all most of you have probably heard that the on said of puberty is happening much earlier in females now than it was some years ago and in fact that is the case and it'll talk about some statistics related to this on which are pretty striking but do not necessarily point to anything detrimental does not elderly mean that something bad is happening what o we know for shore hell we know that there are number of signals that come both through the brain end through the body and more likely both in order to control the onset of puberty and females a couple of examples the first is a mechanistic one we know for instance that the entire process of the oblatory an menstrual cycle is initiated from the brain were getting get into this enlotmore detail in a few minutes but there is a certain number of hormones and euro transmitters that are communicated from the brain a structure called the hypothalamus which roughly sits above the rufous mouth and that communicates with a gland an endocrine or hormone releasing gland calledthe pituitary glad the pituitary gland looks a a stalk a that essentially extends out of the brain its also located not far from a our the roof of your mouth and that has two sort of a small marble or great size a a protrusions that the after pituitary in the poster petuitor and they release different hormones into the blood stream puberty is part controlled by the fact that up in til puberty there are neurons in the hypothalamus that release a euro transmitter called gala which is inhibitory and that prevents the neurons in the hypothalamus from releasing a very important hormone called ganatatropn releasing hormone or g and r at the first thing i really everyone to know and commit to memory today is very easy g and a eight stands for ganatatropin releasing hormone this comes from the brain and will communicate to the pituitary to release certain hormones prior to puberty in both males and females there are neurons in the bring that are actively suppressing the neurons that release gan or age it is no puberty no puberty no puberty cannot have puberty cannot have puberty and in fact those cells are releasing this our transmitter called gala because its inhibitory prevents the firing of those neurons is puberty is activelease suppressed up until certain point it is also actively suppressed at least in some species hand we think at least partially inulins by the tonic release that means the ongoing release around the clock of a hormone called melatonin later in life in fact after puberty melatonin will be secreted only in the dark phase of each night and around the time that one goes to sleep but in children and in particular in children prior to puberty melatonin is released more or less constantly now melatonin is not the only source of suppression of puberty it is also these curl mechanisms involving gala but it is certainly a great candidate for one of the reasons why puberty does not generally tend to happen at say we four we five tat would be very unusual another component of suppression of puberty is that typically in children they have relatively low body fat stores wisest important well we know that one of the things that can trigger the onset of puberty in particular in female is that when enough body fat accumulates that body fat releases a hormone called lepton and that hormone lepton travels in the blood stream across the blood brain barrier and goes to the h pothalemas and can trigger the onset of puberty by activating the anurans that release canatitrop in releasing hormone many people believe that one of the reasons that puberty is happening earlier in earlier in females is because of the accumulation of more body fat at younger ages than was observed thirty or forty and certainly a hundred years ago now i can already imagine number people are think oh this must relate to the city crisis and indeed there is a crisis of of city obesity a is something that is causing all sorts of a problems with people's health various levels brain and body and that is far more frequent to day than it was even twenty years ago it is indeed a crisis because it has enormous detrimental effects for many aspects of of a brain an body health and longevity but this whole process of thinking about body fat signalling lept into the hype of traumas in the onset of puberty does not necessarily have to do with the of s crisis it might relate but it could also relate to for instance improve nutrition which is allowing body fat stores to a cumulate may be not to the level of obesity but to accumulate earlier and at younger ages an females which is then causing earlier puberty in females to just highlight how that might be possible when i want to review some data the talk about the onset of menses menstruation that is puberty in females according to country and according to age over the last hundred or more years what are the general trends in terms of the onset of puberty an females well that is an easy one to answer over the last hundred years or the onset of puberty has been occurring much earlier with each passing decade it is really an incredible set of statistics a out i will provide a link to these data since i know number of you're listening and nudist a watching on stob a this is from a study in which the onset of puberty has been analyzed from as early as the eighteen fifties it in certain countries there are date on that out to the nineteen seventies and another country starting an about nineteen hundred a extending out to about nineteen ninety these are on going collections of data but just to give you a sense how the date are falling out in a couple of different countries just to give you a a flavor but for those of you listening and for those of you watching the essence of all of these findings is that puberty is happening much much earlier with each passing debate for instance in the united states around nineteen hundred or nineteen o three the average age of menarche the onset of puberty in females was about fourteen years old whereas in nineteen ninety the average age is e even that is a pretty significant a we can say acceleration of the onset of puberty now of course these are averages there will be exceptions there is a distribution of data to day still there will be a young females who will undergo puberty at age eleven or ten or may be ten nine and others who will undergo puberty at age thirteen fourteen maybe even sixteen or seventy however if we look at for instance the date from norway which states back a quite far they have excellent record k to eighteen fifty we see is that the average age of the onset of female puberty in eighteen fifty in norway was seventeen years old whereas in nineteen seventy it is thirteen years old sis a dramatic acceleration of the onset of puberty and you see a similar trend in other countries as while if we were to look in a for instance in the use on they have a a smaller data set a meaning it only extends back to about nineteen forty but the average age of the onset of puberty in the use a in nineteen forty was thirteen and half years old again this is just a for females and in nineteen seventy it was closer to thirteen with a a then words declining even further unfortunately did not continue to collect data out to a twenty twenty two and as a final point if we were to look at for instance in a germany and finland a the average a onset of puberty in eighteen seventy was sixteen and half years old a by nineteen forty was down to thirteen and a half years old all of these date i have borne out over and over again regardless of location in the world which is important because when you start to thing about the of city crisis you stable that is mainly and developed countries believed or not or perhaps not surprisingly and may be the has to do with the of city crisis and yet i do not think we can conclude that at all something is happening however it could be increase body fat stories due to overeating an of city however it could also be unrelated to a b city it could be for instance improve nutrition and the available availability of quality nutrition which can signal the maturation of the brain embody mechanisms that trigger the onset of puberty oblatory cycle and menstruation we want to be very careful about leaping to conclusions about what these trees mean but the trees themselves are very very apparent and as a final point i should also mention that there are a number of different behavioral and psycho social as the re called interactions that can influence puberty as well this has been most strikingly observed in animals and i do not want any one to be alarmed or to leap to any great conclusions about the onset of timing of puberty in humans but i be remiss if i did not tell you about a certain result which shows that if a young female is exposed to the odor not o eerily the fairmones or there is a distinction between odors that we perceive and fairmones which are subconscious right the we do not actively perceive but that can impact our biology and airmen affects in humans are very controversial but we know for instance the if you take a female animal and their some evidence from humans that if you take a young are pubertal female and you exposed her to the sent of a reproductively competent male for series of days but maybe even as short as a few hours and she is also not regularly being exposed to the scent of her father that she can undergo puberty earlier that is right there is something about the odor and or hormones or perhaps something else that occurs when a young prepuberital female is in the has a father that she is in regular contact with he would not necessarily have to live at home but that is around a lot that her his smelescuws me is registered by her biological systems that i do not say protects because it kind of souse the the valance of the conversation but that that off sets or buffers the otherwise observed effect which is that the scent of a reproductively competent male if its present often enough or perhaps intensely enough that it can trigger the onset of puberty in that female in other words the scent of a of a male that is not the father and we think also that is not biologically related to her can trigger earlier onset of puberty and that effect can at least be partially buffered by her being in the presence of the scent from her biological father now some of you are probably already leaping to conclusions about what this means should you a not allow your daughter to be exposed to any males who are reproductive age et camera and that is certainly not what ism saying there is a huge number of considerations that that going to that calculation for everybody and circumstances et camera but the point is that the orders of individuals both related in particular closely related and non related individuals can shape that normal systems and the hormone systems that can trigger the onset of puberty of suppress the on set of purity whether or not or talking about onset of puberty at this age or that age and whether or not biologically related male or non biologically related male sense around et camera the thing i want everyone to know is that at some point during development typically nowadays between the ages of eleven and fifteen or again there is variability there the suppression of ganatitropen releasing hormone release from the hypothalamus is removed and then canatitropen releasing hormone can activate sells within the pituitary and if you really want to no its the after pituitary in particular and then the after pituitary gland which sits at and kind of bridges the brain and the body because it allows the release of hormones into the bloodstream that after pituitary is going to release two key hormones that every one should know the name of and what they do and when i say every one i mean males and females need to know about these hormones because they have an active roll in both males and females and of course you should want to know and should know about the biology of everyone on the planet in my opinion because it tells you a lot more about humans than if you just focus on your own biology but those two hormones are called utilizing hormone which is abbreviated l h and logical stimulating hormone which is abbreviated is e that the simple picture that you need have in your mind is ganaditrope and releasing hormone from the brain from the hypothermal in particular is causing the release of utilizing hormone an physical stimulating hormone g n r h stimulates l h utilizing hormone and physical stimulating hormone efface l h and was h travel in the blood and can access all the cells and tissues of the body this one of the incredible things about hormones is that many hormones and el h and eras re included in this crore can travel into cells and they can actually change the genetic expression of those cells they can change which genes are turned on in which genes are turned off and they can also attach to the surface of those cells and make those cells take on different property they can mature those cells for instance good example this outside of the context we been locking about is the hormone testosterone can travel to the heroical and can stimulate changes in the genes of the cells of the heroical that can make heirgro a different hormone estrogen can travel to the cells of the breast tissue an act of eight games that control enlargement of the cells of the breast tissue prolactin a different hormone can travel to the memory ducks and control the production in the secretion of milk and in males that can actually happen in certain cases although it is rare but prolactin can also travel to areas o the brain that control libido for instance and i just as you will never forget it males a elevated levels of prolactin or actually what set the refractory period after ejaculation and prevent erection for some period of time you will never forget prolactin the point being that different hormones have different effects on different cells depending on what cells those are right estrogen or straddles going have different effects on the breast tissue than it would on skin although has effects on both similarly when l h and was e utilizing hormone and police stimulating hormone travel in the blood to the gonad and the gonad is an very it will have a certain set of consequences and when utilizing hormone and logical stimulating hormone travel in the blood to a gonad and that gonad happens to be a testy then it will have a different set of biological implications let us focus now on what happens when l h and was eh arrive at the very and let us us sum now that we are talking about a female who his already undergone puberty or perhaps we could even frame this in the contact of a female who is about to undergo puberty ffisgean l e are now able to be released because she is undergoing puberty but the same set of processes essentially would occur for any point from puberty onward until mananas which is the depletion of that vault that ovarian reserve of all those mature eggs it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athlete i greens now called a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a egg is that it gets to be the robotics that i need for got health our god is very important its populated by up microbioda that communicate with the brain the in system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those robotics unathletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptegins vitamins and minerals that make sure that all f my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste right if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a years supply of vitamin d the k too again that is athletic green stock cam slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the years supply o vitamin three k to o case that we are now going to talk about ovulation in menstruation and let us just remember what this is all about this is all about creating the potential for an egg to be fertilized and that egg needs to have half of the chromosomal pair o no pairs but it is got have twenty three chromosomes just from mom and we need to position that egg that the egg can be met by the sperm and that sperm can penetrate that egg and donate it is twenty three individual strands of chromosomes to that egg tat yo can bring together the dona of dad and the dona of mong the oratory menstrual cycle occurs when utilizing hormone and physical stimulating hormone have been released and the oblatory slash menstrual cycle an here i have to can a pick what i want to call it a i guess to be really accurate we would just call it the female reproductive cycle but that includes underneath it with the menstrual cycle is it sometimes called in the oblatory cycle you decide ism going to interchangeably discuss the oblatory cycle an the menstrual cycle the promise when you seem menstruation people often think about just the period the shedding of the veteran lining when fertilization has not occurred if i start saying oblatory cycle just keep in mine referring to the entire thing now this is probably also good opportunity to say that if you heard that the oblatory clash menstrual cycle is twenty eight days long that is true in some cases but that is not always true it is on average twenty eight days long there are some females for which the oblatory cycle will be shorter can be as short as twenty one days and other females for which it will be thirty five days long shorter than twenty one days and longer than thirty five days is rare although it does occur one of the anythings the thing about fertility is a talk to of g wends wo r focus on fertility which i have in anticipation of this episode the will tell you that whether not your cycle is twenty one days long or thirty five days long is not as much of an issue necessarily unless it is happening to be couch shorter or much longer in a kind of erotic way if your somebody whose consistently had twenty three day long cycles and all the see our having thirty day long cycles that is not necessarily an indication of anything bad but if it is twenty one days one month and its thirty days the next month and that seventeen days the next month her even if it is always falling within that twenty one to thirty five day long cycle but it is very variable from each month or every other month or you probably wantad calk to your big we an because that could indicate a number of different things which things could it indicate while that will become clear as i spell out the biology in a bit more detail but this idea that the menstrual cycle of the tricycles always twenty eight days that is just false this just not true should also mention that there is a common misconception that because the average menstrual cycle is twenty eight days indeed the average is twenty eight days and the lunar cycle is twenty eight days and of course there is real biology to support the fact that the lunar cycle cant in fact impact certain aspects of human behavior it does and will talk about lunar cycles in a future episode but there is zero data to support the idea that the menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle are linked in any kind of causal way sorry to break it to the lunar cycle and the title cycles at the ocean are definitely linked in ways that are superinteresting relate o the tilt of the earth and the pull of gravity of different planets and it is incredible story to itself but the lunar cycle in the menstrual cycle despite having sum weak correlation in terms of their their get their duration their call periodicity no pun intended well there is no causal relationship whatsoever between the lunar cycle in the menstrual cycle if any of you are aware of any real data that conflict with what i just said please put that in the common section on you to but this is pretty well establishes as far as i know o k we need to bring together the called haploid contcontents the twenty three individual strands of of chromosomes from the egg to a place in a position where it cold potentially be fertilized by the mail what happens utilizing hormone and logical stimulating hormone travel to the very these hormones are able to act es the very there is a lot of blood supply to the very and effs h an ell ah arrive at the very the very has this vault this ovarian reserve of immature cells they reside within what are called follicles the flicks are little spherical packages that conpotentially provide a nice environment for those eggs to mature and when effs in particular arrives at the very a small number of those flicks will split off from the reserve they will exit the vault and they will undergo maturation and the key player here is logical stimulating hormone and the first fourteen days of the menstrual oblatory cycle is referred to as the follicular phase because of this relationship between effisates triggering the maturation of a subset of follicles now typically in the contacts of a twenty eight day or oblatory menstrual cycle day one is designated as the first say of the period of the shedding of the veteran lining from the previous oblatory menstrual cycle in which fertilization did not car day one is when the period initiates it is days one through fourteen approximately right cause herewhir is considering the average of a twenty eight day cycle but it would be longer could be shorter but the first half of that cycle is the call bilocular phase envisage has triggered the departure of a subset of these folicals that contain immature eggs and it is triggering the maturation of those eggs utilizing hormone is also present but also it relatively low levels and it is during the first half of this oblatory menstrual cycle that the maingoal is to get those folicals to mature inside of those folicals the egg is developing its growing it is maturing and in doing it is also making its own hormones this i think is one of the most elegant aspects of the ovulatory menstrual cycle that in a few minutes you will learn about something which still to this day even toughie known about the stuffed for decades now because of training still disavows my mind that you have us one hormone logical stimulating hormone triggering the maturation of some eggs inside of some folicals and then those folicals themselves making another hormone that furthers the process and then soon as you will learn create a hormone to trigger the second half of the process just a beautiful symphony of expression of different genes in different hormones to make everything work as optimal as possible as these different folicals mature somehow and we still do not know exactly how one of those follicles containing an egg get selected it is either because it matures the fastest or there something about it that is still not completely understood that allows it to be selected and all the other folicals that are maturing degenerate and die and they are gone they do not go back into the ovarian reserve they are now depleted from that bank account that is the ovarian reserve they die off but that single egg that keep in mind contains twenty three pairs of chromosomes or we have not gotten rid of one half of those twenty three sets of chromosomes yet but that one will continue to mature and then at some point that egg will s attune undergo a process in which those chromosomes are pulled apart by little components within the egg called spindles they early have a physical pulling of the cromozomeos apart now those twenty three pairs are no longer attached to one another at the middle they were before two beads of of strings or i should say twenty three short strands of beads that were at once connected to one another now are pulled apart that you have twenty three chromosomes on each side but the pulled apart from one another right that diploid cell is now starting to become a cell in which half of the chromomozomes half of those twenty three pairs are physically pulled away from the others and then the egg actually starts to form its own will we call involution a membrane around those twenty three pairs one set of them and in captivates them sort of got an egg with two parts where the two sets of chromosomes two sets of twenty three chromosomes are now separate from one another inside of the egg and then one of those actually gets ejected from the egg and the name of that thing that gets ejected its a the hovel pod as how i imagine it a from from standards you know from any kind of a spaceodyssy move where some thing is ready to happen in a hovel pod shootsoude of the ship well that twenty three pairs is now ejected from the egg it is called the pillar body and that is going to degenerate it is going to go away and in doing take it the egg cell which was once diploid add twenty three pairs of chromosomes and making it haploid and now what you have got in ideal circumstances is a beautifully prestige egg that was selected for and has twenty three single strands of chromosomes twenty two otozomes in one sex chromosome that sex chromosome is going to be an ex chromosome almost with certainty because female mother is creating that egg then the egg that contains just the appropriate twenty three single strand chromosomes is going to fuse with the wall of the very and that egg will be released and will travel into the philopian to now we will get back to that egg in a few moments but that process which represents the first half of the oblatory menstrual cycle again was triggered by office agent to some extent utilizing hormone but it is the on going maturation of that egg which also causes the production of estrogen which allows that whole process to a car and you could say why well the answer to the we is a very important biological principle that we are going to return to n a number f different contacts to day with as reference to female end male fertility and the principle is a called negative feed back when estrogen is present at relatively low levels and females in the very as it is during the development of these eggs some of that estrogen of course is going to ex at the very it is going to go into the blood stream and it is going to travel back to the pituitary now the pituitary can release things like physical stimulating hormone and lionizing hormone but the way it'd likely to think about the pituitary forsake of feed back loops is that it is sort of a thermometer that you would put into a pool a backyard pool that is attached to the heater and for instance if you were to put a thermometer in to a pool that you would to keep it seventy degrees and the temperature of that pool is sixty degrees well then that thermometer ought to trigger some sort of mechanism wear the poolwould heat up until the temperature f the pool hit seventy degrees and then it should trigger that thermometer to turn off the heating system look ay that to have a negative feed back system that would keep the temperature more or less correct that is a lot of the way that the systems related to estrogen and also testosterone and these different things utilizing hormonapholical stimulating hormone work is well typically when the level of a hormone is to high then it shuts down the production of the hormones that would trigger further production of that hormone i know that is a mouthful to lot to think about in some of your poly thing you wo ism getting dizzy now with biology but i promise you can understand this in females when estrogen is relatively low but not zero but is relatively low during that first follicular half of the oblatory cycle it actually triggers negative fee back on patient effete that not too much is produced but then just prior to population the levels of estrogen and the levels of some other hormones from those eggs right you have the eggs producing estrogen themselves gets high enough that it actually triggers a positive feed back loop on the pituitaries of the pituitaries is essentially observing the amount of estrogen in the bloodstream produced by the over it and the mount of estrogen towards the end of the second half of the menstrual cycle has increased and triggers a positive fee back loop it triggers the pituitary to release more efesateen ell age and that helps trigger ovulation ora that deployment are the release of that one mature proper selected egg with that is haploid with the twenty three individual pairs of crormozons into the philopian to scelestious back up really quickly and just and of summers what is happen ganatatropen releasing hormone from the hypothalamus triggers the release of pfolical stimulating hormone and utilizing hormone that travels to the very triggers the release of a subset of immature pfholicals with immature eggs those immature folicals and mature eggs start to mature start to grow because of the presence of physical stimulating hormone the growth of those eggs themselves increases estrogen as the estrogen start to accumulate in the environment some of that travels back to the pituitary and when levels of estrogen arriving at the pituitary are relatively low the pituitary you we do not need to release any more police stimulating andlutinizing hormone however it some point just prior population enough estrogen has been produced by that one single selected mature egg and some of the other policies around it that were maturing but than since died off that the estrogen triggers a positive feed backup the pituitary says oke and releases morpolical stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone and am the egg which has the propergenetic components sets off out of the very and into the philopian to called ovulation has begun e that itself what i just describe constitutes the first half of the oblatory menstrual cycle which we call the follicular phase and its marked by the presence of envisage en some other things but we can really think about it as marked by envisage from the pituitary and by estrogen or estradiol made within the very ora then comes the second half of the oblatory menstrual cycle which i personally think is one of the coolest mechanisms in all biology which is that remember the physical that housed that one egg that was the selected egg that became the mature egg and that physical which no longer contains the egg because the egg took off inoculated is called the corpus medium and the corpus medium starts making three hormones which include estradiol thing called inhibbon but the most important hormone the one that really need to know about is that it starts producing very high levels of progesterone progesterone levels start to increase a bout the time of ovulation although just priortobulation and over the next second half of the oblatory cycle about fourteen days of its a twenty eight day cycle lo bet longer lit shorter depending on the length of cycle levels of progesterone in the second half of the oblatory cycle are going to increase by fourteen hundredfold compared to what they were in the first half of the oblatory cycle again if we were to characterize the menstrual oblatory cycle which in broad strokes what we would say is that effuse and estrogen mark the initial part the first half called bilocular phase and that the estrogen and envisage second motion ovulation and they prime the system for the production of a corpus medium which produces progesterone and the second half of all this is called the audial phase the second half of the oratory menstrual cycle is the audio phase because of corpus medium this otherwise discarded tissue that produces progesterone what is progesterone due well progesterone impacts the veteran lining called endometrium ore the lining the mucus lining of the uterus where that egg that is ovulated is potentially going to implant if its fertilized and in a kind of perfect way or i should say in a a seemingly perfect way the egg is off on its way it might get fertilized the remnants of the compartment that let go of that egg produce a hormone that then prepares the endermetual lining of the uterus for the potential implantation of that egg it is basely making the beg for the fertilized egg to potentially imbed in to implant in and then achieve all the nourishment that it needs to grow eventually into a healthy embryo and child just an amazing set of biological mechanisms if you ask me because what your observing here is an incredible economy of function whereby the same cellar components that are producing the egg well some of them are being discarded but there not being discarded without purpose there being discarded in a way that triggers the onset of hormonal expression that then prepares the fertilized egg to be in an enriched environment which it can throw i realize that was a lot of detail but we have a couple of key themes we have got the hypothalamus gin or age we have got the pituitary with clean envisage and those hormones travel to the very the very has eggs in a vault basely immature eggs in vault some of those are activated by the presence of effisageian ullage each month and one of those eggs will be selected and will ovulate the remnants of the physical and egg that are not selected the chromosomes that you do not need er disappear in the polar body and the corpus medium give ride to progesterone and sets en motion the second half of the oratory menstrual cycle which is the audio phase which is essentially the potential for that fertilized egg to imbed in a nice nourishing environment and of course we should all be thinking if the egg is fertilized and then it lays down in the a nice copy veteran lining that is been prepared by a progesterone in the corpus medium well then everything's fine and good but what if fertilization does not occur we we all know what happens if fertilization does not occur fertilization does not occur for whatever reason that stere in lining is going to shed and that is actually what is referred to as the period its the actual removal over the departure rather of the thicken an deuterium lining of the uterus when fertilization has not occurred and of course if that happens we need another oblatory menstrual cycle how does that happen well the hormone inhibbon is also made by the corpus medium and does not go quite as high as the hormone progesterone but at kind of tracts that increase in progesterone that occurs in the second half of the ovulatory cycle but then if fertilization does not occur inhibbon level start to drop and what i have not told you is what inhibbon does inhibbon in concert with other hormones estrogen feed back to the hypothalamus and prevent the further release of physical stimulating hormone and utilizing hormone right if you have an egg that gets fertilized and can implant well then you do not want more eggs to mature right you want o hold on to the ones in the vault you do not want them to mature and hormones inhibbon and again working with other hormones are going to prevent the secretion of things effisagean ullage a typically people are not getting pregnant every month in fact that not possible in part the reason it is not possible is that if the fertilize beg in plants their number different hormone cascades that shut down the production of things gan a h effiasation blah in ways that pretend further maturation of follicles in a follicular phase but in the instance where fertilization does incur and menstruation occurs and i should mention that the the duration of menstruation the actual bleeding typically is anywhere from one to five days the quoting heaviness the lightness or heaviness of that bleeding will depend on you guessed it the amount of progesterone that is secreted from the corpus medium that is one of the key players there and if menstruation occurs well then in ribbon levels also drop progesterone levels also drop and when that occurs there is a positive feed back signal up at the level of the pituitary the pituitary literally can register how much in ribbon and progesterone and estrogen is present in the blood stream and if those levels are sufficiently low well then g in our h gets secreted again effasage gets secrete again an blah get secrete again and the first half the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle initiates all over again it is hard to overstate how beautifully orchestrated this entire system is the number of feed balloons and feed forward loops i think if you can just generally understand that the first half of the menstrual oblatory cycle is marked by the maturation the polices an effasage and that the second half is marked by the accumulation of progesterone and the thickening of the veteran lining should fertilization in in plantation occur i think that you will certainly understand the femaleber of productive cycle better than most people out there it will also of you understand a number of things that are sometimes associated with the female reproductive cycle for instance there are data showing that in many not all but in many women in the four to five days prior to population there is a dramatic increase in libido that dramatic increase in libido is trigger by a number of things but some of those things include the spike and efface that occurs the spike in blah that occurs and some associated increases in androgen things d g a and testosterone which just as in males can be related to libido in females trigger libido you can imagine why this would be in effective mechanism to have in place in females if the goal as it were certainly of the egg perhaps not of the the woman as a whole but if the goal is to fertilize the egg increases in libido just prior to the on set of ovulation there is also been a lot of discussion and interest and frankly data exploring the allays that can occur at certain portions of the of the menstrual cycle and there is a lot of misconception about this a lot of people have focus on the ma lays that can occur around the time of bleeding but there are actually stronger date o support the fact that some again some not all women experience a kind of always sometimes associate with anxiety sometimes not that is associate with the mid to second half of the ludialphase of the oblatory menstrual cycle and that despite what people commonly think is not associate with elevated levels of estrogen is actually associate with the depletion in estrogen levels that can occur during certain portions of that second half of the audial phase of the menstrual cycle a again this is highly variable a for some people they may not experience any always at any point during their menstrual cycle other individuals also for ins since mig not experience any variation in their libido at any point during their menstrual cycle again highly variable and yet there are some statistically significant trends that have been observe that tract o very specific coronal components within the menstrual cycle again this will all be very contextual and of course this can play out in a number of different ways for instance some women experience very lighten levels of sensitivity to caprine at certain portions of the menstrual cycle other women experience a more cramping than others a different portions of their menstrual cycle tremendous variation from individual to individual a one of the i view it as an advantage but one of a things that many females can really do and experience because they have cycles that occur every month that are fairly dramatic in terms of the levels of hormones for instance a more than thousandfold increase in progesterone during the ledludiophase the menstrual cycle and i should also mention a two hundredfold increase in estrogen during the period just prior to population that is why they always a estrogen primes progesterone what you learn in con basic under chronology when your learning the menstrual cycle estrogen in the first half of the menstrual cycle primes progesteronithe second half of the of the oblatory menstrual cycle well that those estrogen increases just prior to population are impart responsible for the increases in libido but it is also the presence of increase androgen just prior to population there is a lot of complex interplay i think what we will do as we reserve the discussion about libido per say and some of the other aspectsurelate to sexual differentiation that we talk about earlier for a future episode but hopefully now you have in mind what the oblatory menstrual cycle is it is a signal from the brain from the hypothalmets which then triggers a signal from the pituitary an enduring gland which then signals the release of hormones that travel to the very and that control two things maturation of eggs and the identification of one egg in particular and then preparation of the miles the environment in which that fertilized beg cold potentially land and mature into a healthy embryo and child if you have that framed up in your mind and even if you just extracted may be ten to fifteen per cent of the hormones in different aspects i described until now i would consider you far more knowledgeable about this entire process than ninety nine per cent of people out there now certainly not the obeguuyans and neurologists but than ninety nine per center individuals out there it also frames u for us the second half of this whole story about fertility and fertilization which is the generation of sperm and how the sperm eventually arrive at the egg and how certain sperm are selected to potentially fertilize that egg whereas others never really stand at chance next work in a talk about sperm organ a talk about what sperm are where they are generating how they are generated and how they need to travel both within the male and within the female in order to allow fertilization to potentially occur we have covered the oblatory cycle in females and i confess it was a lot of information with a lot of biological nomen glacier but i promise you than many of those same themes and indeed the same names an nomen cloture we will show up in the discussion that we are going to have now which is about the generation of sperm now sperm are similar to eggs in the sense that they are part of the germ line there these protected cells protecting the sense that the activities of an individual are not going to change the genetic make up of those cells now again there are instances and which muggins such as i chemicals could disrupt the genomes of the germ cells and males just as it could in females but in general the activities the things that we do the experiences we have does intend to change the genome of those cells however there are a lot of life style factors dues and does nutrition end supplements and prescription drugs et camera that kin indeed modify the quality of the sperm and well talk about what sperm quality means but the pint is that the sperm cell much the egg cell are both germ line cells they are not somatic cells they are unique populations and let us just remember what the job of the spermcell is the job of the sperm cell is to deliver the genetic material from the father and to do that in the form of a hap laid cell that means twenty three chromosomes twenty two odozomes one called sex chromosome again not sex the verb an we it not in this case sex the verb is a discussionwore can have in a few minutes but sex the now the sex chromosome can either be an ex chromosome or a we chromazone the case a twenty two odozomes and than one sex chromosomes going to be contained within the sperm because it is a haploid cell not a diploid cell remember the egg was diploid than it became haploid the sperm cells are sells that are created through the division of other cells but after that division occurs through a process called miosis the sperm cell is going to contain twenty three chromosomes consisting of twenty two adozomes and one sex cromorne and the sperm that manages to deposit its dean contents into the egg to fertilize the egg will either have an x sex cromaozome or a wise chromosome and the sex chromosome has a number of different genes on that cromazome that will suppress for instance the development of the female reproductive axis of one good examplewill be the malaria inhibiting hormones am i h the gene for managing inhibiting hormone which is a hormone that prevents the formation of the malaria ducks which is part of the female reproductive structure well that gene controls the prevention of the development of the female genitalia and in doing promotes the development of the male gentile and there are other examples of genes that are on the i chromosome that give you a what we call male genotype write you genotype and phenotype by the way in cause you've not a herd this in awhile from your my schabiology or if you never heard it no bi deal cerotype is the compliment of cromaozome ex ex or ex w and there are individuals out there that are exec war ex ugly a discussion for our episode on sex to frentiation that is karyotype with a k then there is genotype which are the genes that you have and then there is genotype spelled p h fend p h e and o t wipe tintype and the genotype is how the genes which then code for arcane which cot for proline how those are expressed in terms of things eye colors eye colors a phenotype height is a phenotype hair colors a phenotype guys of cerotype genotype and phenotype well what we need to do as we need to bring together that sperm which is hap laid contains this twenty three chromosome strands with either an extra we sex cromazom as the twenty third chromosome we need a get that sell to the egg and when we talk about fermata genesis of course we are talking about the generation of spermcells but what were really talking about is the generation of cells whose job is to deliver the genetic material from dad to the egg within the female in a way that increases the probability that not only will that egg be fertilized but that it will progress in a healthy way with each set of cromaozomes from mom and from dad each set of twenty three chromosomes that is we progress in a healthy way will implant in a healthy way and will maintain and grow in a healthy way to a healthy embryo and child and eventually adult that is the job of the sperm of as we talk about strata genesis let us just remember that and why they're there in the first place now a few things about sperm that are interesting besides the fact that their hap laid and besides the fact that as you all know they swim they have a head and a table there one a head a mid region and a tail n that midregion turns out to be very important it something will come back to again and again that midregion is really key for the ability for sperm to engage in forward progression to swim forward am an involves the activity of m itocondreo which are involved in generation of eight p which is involved in also aspects of energy in all cells but let just remember that the sperm are swimming cells and in order to create a really good swimmer or set of swimmers you need i a couple of things first of all within the testis is where the sperm develop and unlike in females and unlike in the very there is no vault of sperm the sperm are continually being generated takes about sixty days for sperm to be born from their parent cells because cells actually give rise to other cells us weight works to be born from their parent cells and then matured to the point were they can be a really good swimmer now that does not mean that a bunch of sperm are made on day one and then sixty days later all those sperm are deployed in the form of ejaculate and then the cycle starts over again sots little different than the copulatory menstrual cycle rather at any given point time right now if you have testes you have some sperm in your testes that a immature and cannot swim cannot deliver those contents a to those genetic contents rather to the female egg and you have some sperm the mature and you very likely have some sperm that are mature that they are dying off or that their dead almost certainly also regardless of your age you have some sperm that are healthier than others are better swimmers than others this is just a the way the system works now the processor spermatagenesis involves a couple of things but a lot of the players are the same as the process of developing the called o site the immature egg we have got gear h from the hypothalamus that can to be a player we have envisage police stimulating hormonalthough the names alibi of a misnomer in the contacts of spermatagenesis because in the contacts of permatagenesis there is no logical what were really talking about as envisage for stimulating the maturation of the sperm cell not egg logical but sperm cell but we still have gene h effing ell h and rather than the very being the target of those hormones its going to be the testes most everybody should know that the testes and the ovaries are the call gonads the testis of course reside outside of the body there are instances where the testes fail to descend during development certainly if the testes do not descend on time that something that doctors need to be made aware of the pediatrician to be made aware of because that can prevent fertility why would that be well turns out that the testis reside outside the body in the scrotum because the temperature conditions under which fermata genesis can occur and under which healthy sperm can be maintained are very restricted and is a proximately two degrees cooler then the rest of the body this is very important and i think this is something that used to be discussed a lot more but is not discuss much these days but keeping the testis cool enough does not new surely mean keeping m cold although there is a place for using cold exposure deliberate cold exposure to improve sperm quality and number and perhaps even testoster an levels will talk about the obit later but keeping the testes about two degrees cooler than the rest of the body is absolutely key if sperm get to hot they die and if sperm utilize the cells get that give rise to sperm get too warm will then often times the sperm that develop are not healthy not healthy in a number ways either they cannot engage in fast for progression and swat that is swimming or they will lack the ability to deposit their de ana contents within the egg again whatever is contain in the ejaculate is going to be a mixture of different sperm qualities and sperm of different ages will impact the quality but also the temperature under which those sperm developed is going to impact their quality and we are going to get into tools to list later as i mention but just to give you a simple take away if you are hoping to conceive in the next ninety days right the sperm antigens ti cycle take sixty days but then the sperm actually have to migrate from the testicle into the called epiditimus which is a related structure and then into the vast deference and then into the throw where it can be part of the ejaculate in order for sperm to do all that properly undergo that maturation and then exit in ejaculate in a way that is healthy or that the sperm is healthy if you plan to conceive children or to try and conceive children in the next ninety days you define want to avoid exposing your testicles that is your scrotum to elevated temperatures that means definitely avoiding hot tubs definitely you avoiding hot baths now a brief hot bath or hot tub or hot shower is not going to be a problem although if you're really interesting conceiving i would avoid hot tubs and and hot baths as much as possible hot showers are probably fine but if you are going to going to a sawnogh for instance you might want to rethink that decision and if you do decide to you almost certainly would want to bring a cold pack in that you could a fully put some material between the cold pack and anscrotumacy do not get a cold burn but put something there but keep the scrotal tissue cool keep it cold to cool because heat exposure can really mutate and disrupt the developing sperm and it can kill sperm and again that would be for an entire ninety days leading up to your attempts to to conceive again well get into more to us later but a number people also i have probably heard of the boxers verses briefs a controversy i guess it it is or whether not a people call it i going commando with no with no underwear of any kind boxers briefer briefs or otherwise rather turns out that the date on that point to the fact that there is not really a big difference in terms of sperm quality if people were boxers are briefs or don where anything under the a genes or shorts at all a the scrotum has the ability to move the testicles far enough away from the body in order to achieve lower temperatures if it needs to it it thieves that throw a muscle call the remaster muscle which is a really interesting muscle believe it or not as reading up on the biology the remaster muscle something i never thought it'd spend o too much time on but that i end id up spending far too much time a reading up about and is really fastening what you have is a is a a muscle there is a smooth muscle tissue unlike skeleton muscle which as stride in muscle that is temperature dependent it has certain nerve endings and it has certain a receptors on it that allow it to respond to local temperature and then to relax in order to a essentially let the testicles to descend further from the body or to contract and bring the testicles closer the body in order to try and maintain the optimal temperature range and it turns out the remaster muscle can achieve that whether not people are wearing boxers or briefs although it stands to reason that any kind of a there is no other name for undergarments you not no why that word is just seems kind of antiquated but undergarment that allows some movement of the of the scrotum in the testicles should be sufficient to allow these temperature a variations to occur and keep keep things in range a that said obit later all go into some detail really because it is important as to why for instance if you are somebody who has big thighs or not that it actialycan lower sperm count substantially whether not the big thighs occur because your very muscular the big thighs occur because you a are over weight it can increase the temperature of your sitting a lot increase s scrotal temperature for sure and there are some other tings that can increase scrotal temperature of seat heaters in cars for instance terrible idea if you just terrible idea if you are hoping to conceive in the near future a and again hot tub things of that sort o was temperature modulation of fermata genesis and sperm quality and function is key that relate to obit more to tools but what happens hates the actual sperm develop well contain within the testicle you have the cells the called spermatic gonna which differentiate into called spermicides you do not have to remember all this and the spermicides undergo this process of miosis miosis is a form of sell division which reduces the chromosome number to those twenty three individual strands has opposed to pairs right it makes them help laid is opposed to diploid very very important for reasons that we talked about earlier and the miosis process in these primordial sperm cells these immature sperm cells is similar to the miosis process that occurs in eggs when the bromism segregate in that involves these spindle a structures within the cell now why do i keep bringing up the spindles will turns out that the function of the spindle in the egg in the sperm is heavily dependent on mite conjure function and later when we get into tools for improving egg and sperm quality you're going to hereabout a lot of tools for improving mitochondria and it is not just because the mite conjure involved in in energy demand in aspects of cell biology but it is also because the might conure in this contact are very very important for the removal of ere the separation of one set of cromornes to give you these two sets of haploid cells the egg and the sperm and this is important because many failures at fertilization many failures at implantation many many miscarriages and many birth effects that do survive after birth that are very detrimental such as triremes and things that occur because the spindles do not effectively pull apart the chromosomes and the typically the egg but it can also occur in the sperm so the spindles and the fact that might have contrary rich on the spindle are very important for entering these haploid sperm again twenty three individuals transicromozomes that is o cursing inside of the testes o we there is not as much long distance migration of the spermatic of the spermicides and the sperm cells as there is the egg just when you think about the over all architecture of the uterus in the utopian tubes compared to the testicles wit a still lot of movement within the tetanal if you were to look at the testicle in cross section and i prefer to call at that rather than cut the testicle and half any timeout took about anatomy i she talk about slicing things that's what you would do in with a cadaverous wat u i teaching we do my laboratories frankly in biological laboratories all over the place but when you talk aby the youth talk about if you were to take a visual cross section through the testicle what you would find is that there are a lot of different little tubes lot of ducks do c t sucks those are pathways and the man ducks that are important for this discussion are called the luminiferous tubules ocasoits of it is a a mashie or network structure of tubes in the testicle and the immature sperm sit on a little compartment u along the edge of those tubes and as they mature they move towards the center of those tubes and then when they are mature enough those sperm cells actually drop into the hollow of the tube and then can travel through those tubes to a structure that along the side of the tetanal called the epiditimus the epiditimus again as a series of ducks and then the epiditimus converges with something called the vast deferent of thing in high school we all remember this by thing about it is the vast difference i on that on who came up with that maybe i think it was a young girl sitting to the left of me that a sychoits the vast difference i never forgot that no may was the topic matter maybe was heard may with some commination of the tube but in any case the sperm go from the luminiferous tubules to the epiditimus and then to the vast deferent and then are contained in the ejaculate along with seminal fluid now the seminal fluid is the carrier fluid for the sperm themselves this is important because it turns out that a lot of things that can both negatively or positively impact the quality of the sperm relates notch s to the sperm cells themselves and the temperature the environment that they were a matured in but also to the seamen quality for instance if you are a heavy drinker or if you are a smoker or if you are a regular user of minibus especially you smoke minibus are or tape anabas you create a lot of reactive oxygen species that disrupt the chemistry of the seminal fluid which disrupts the spermcells sos not a direct action always on the sperm cell itself although it can be references in the form of of smoked tobacco or anabas there lot of carcinogens and mutagens action mutate the liana can cause dean fragmentation and debilitate sperm but there also a lot of things created by smoking in particular whether regardless of what is being smoke they can create elevated react oxygen species and disrupt the seminal fluid that the sperm are contained in in the called the facula the seamen now this will also become a relevant conversation later when we briefly talk about vasectomies vasectomies it are literally a cutting of the vast deferent which leads to a situation provided the surgery was done correctly where men can still achieve all the other aspects of intercourse they can still a achieveerection they can still achieve orgasm they can still ejaculate but when they ejaculate the seminal fluid is released but there re no sperm contain within the seminar fluid and it turns out that a the becomes are very effective form of berth control and they always check to see if zero sperm and confirm the zero sperm are being a released in ejaculate they are reversible that is vasectomies are reversible but not always there are a subset of cases where it is not reversible which case of people still not have children you have to go in and actually surgically extract a sperm from the testicles but it is a process in which the vastdeferens is altered were severed in a way that the sperm cant actually exit the testicle they can get into the epiditimus usually but not into the vasteference and on and forth a if you have ever wonder whale of a become is that is what of a become is and i mention a become now because it illustrates the difference between the seminal fluid the seamen and the sperm that the seamen contain c sixty days to generate these thesperm another a two weeks are for the sperm to travel through the various ducks to the point where they can be contained in the ejaculate lots talk about the sperm cells themselves the sperm cells again have the twenty three pairs of a singlesterin chromizoms their haploid if the either in ex or why sex cromozom as the twenty third called sex cromazom and as we all know they have a head that head tends to be oval an most cases the head contains very important enzymes and prolines that are designed to fuse w it the much lardertur egg and to actually take the membrane of the sperm cell and combined actually mesh with the egg cells membrane and then deliver the genetic contents to the egg cell in other words to fertilize the egg cell now just behind the head is a region called the mid region that mid region is a slightly thickened region and here a corsontocambal healthy sperm cell for apology morphology simply mean shape a mid region that mid region has a bunch of things related to sell motility and to the ford progression of the cells first of all it is chalk block full of midocondre in fact if you are to look just behind the head of the of the sperm what you see is that it is completely surrounded by mid condo there are might a conjure elsewhere in the cell but most of them are contained in this mid region compartment just behind the head of the sperm and that thick region is where the tail movement of the sperm the o the coagulation back and forth is actually generated from much if you were to hold a rope you a battle rope in the lion o and you were to a whip the battle rope the whip at the one end of the rope is what allows for the o the the hiss just call what it is that the curves in the rope that the oscillations the rising and falling of of the rope all the way out to the end right is the force of the of the whip right at that end that your you know with the battle rope you doing with your hand and with the spermous that is occurring just behind the head of the sperm that is actually going to take how fast and how well that sperm can swim and indeed the sperm has to swim very far how far well on a relative scale and again these are estimations because they are going to be a hushaby say there will be difference is in the distance from the head of the minus and where the ejaculation occurs to the service depending on the relative size of the vaginal canal and the penis that delivers the ejaculate to the vaginal canal but once the sperm arrive at the service we which is at the back of the agent canal just at the opening to the uterus once the sperm arrive there the distance from the service to the egg of course will very depending on where that egg is in its ovulatory trajectory its pathway but it is a kin base if you scale for size to the distance between lost angels and san francisco which is many many hundreds of miles though sperm have to swim very far now of course if the sperm are delivered in the vaginal canal somewhat further away they will have further to go if there delivered right at the cervical opening they will have less far to go the very effective swimming sperm swim very fast they are able to accomplish that t distance in just a few days and this relates to a discussion that we will get into in a lot more detail later as to how often couples should have intercourse if they are trying to conceive laypeople might think well its every day however the more frequent the ejaculation the lower the concentration of sperm in each ejaculate this is not discussion about how often to have intercourse depending to your preferences for pleasure or bonding or whatever reason this is a discussion about often to have intercourse in order to optimize the probability of fertilization of the egg there some general rules that of course come to mind which is ejaculations close to population both be four during or sometimes after are obviously advantageous but you will also here obiguwians in neurologists suggesting intercourse every other day leading up to the day of ovulation starting about three to four days out from the day of population we got a little bit side tract all be it i think appropriately and focussing on fertilization but what we are talking about right up into the point of that is the anatomy of the sperm itself which is the head the mid region that contains all those mitochondria and then the talk now what we have in discussed is the actual generation of the sperm if you are a male or if you are a female think it is really important to understand howsepermatagenesis works sperbatagenesis works in much in the same way that the generation and maturation of eggs work although as i mention before it is going to occur on going throughout the cycle of the male's life after puberty we already talked about puberty andilgis cover this in two or three sentences as it relates to males and its essentially the same thing the hypothalamus up until the point of puberty is providing suppression of the release of ganatropand relying hormone then some biological clock which is still not clearly understood its probably not lept in coming from body fat again unlike in the females probably not lept in coming from bodyfat but some other signal arrives to the hypothalamus removes that inhibition and we in our each canatropand releasing hormone is now released on to the pituitary a bunch of hormones are deployed from the pituitary as a consequence the two most important ones for the contact of this discussion are physical stimulating hormone and utilizing hormone physical stimulating hormone and utilizing hormone travel to the testes and they re going to do two main things one they are going to trigger the production of testosterone and they are going to trigger the production of the sperm themselves they are going to set in motion for especially the rest of the life of the male the production of sperm they are going to initiate the spermatagenisa cycle and that cycles can be on going at various stages for different sperm for the rest of the man's life this v very different then the triggering of development of sites and eggs an females where there is an existing vault that vault can be depleted to the point of zero where it cants occur again men can generate sperm there entire lifetime course there is diminishment of sperm production in very very late age say eighties and nineties or hundreds but believe are not their still sperm being produce the quality of those sperm is another question everything we are going to talk about now is essentially puberty onward a prior to that testicles are present but there not generating sperm ejaculation is in possible or if it is possible its very unlikely and unusual and its not going to contain sperm everything we are going to talk about now is puberty forward o case puberty onward to the rest of life and utilizing hormone secreted from the pituitary acts on the testis and on a very specific cell type in the testes called the lid cells are ladegcells el e we de ice the lad cells the lad cells of the testis are what produced testosterone testosterone is going to have two major effects on here mean really major because it has many many hundreds of effects on different tissues of the body in fact that is the definition of a hormone really its ay its a substance that acts in an indicting fashion it can act on the very tissue that generated it for instance testosterone made by the lid tells within the testes will act on the testis's will talk about a moment but it can also act on other tissues it can act on the earrings and lacings and deep in the voice as it does during puberty can act on the heirfolicals in generate facial hair it can act on the musculature generate praying synthesis and development muscle bone et camera o at all the things we associate with puberty and with testosterone typically restricting the conversation to the effects of testosterone on the testicle itself and on spermatic genesis the lidigells make testosterone and keep in mind that some of that testostronal travel elsewhere in the body and do its thing for gene expression and the more acutifects of testosterone on the brain included but the testosterone within the testes is at extremely high concentration in fact the concentration of interetesticular testosterone is at least a hundred times higher than the concentration of testosterone anywhere else in the body even though it is being secreted into the rest of the body and that is because there are number of different called binding prolines and engines that sequester the testosterone within the testis the lid cells are making testosterone a lot of that testosterone is acting on and is restricted to the testes and that turns out to be very important because testosterone within the testis acts in concert with a different biological program that starts with visage physical stimulating hormone that also travels to the testes and acts on a very specific set of sells that are called supporting cells or more specifically the certolly cells the pertly cells are the cells that generate something called a b p or androgen binding proline and it is the combination of testosterone from the lid excels and a b p from the certify cells that is necessary for spermatagenesis it is necessary for those spermatesites to become what will eventually be healthy mature sperm that have really nice shaped overheads have a mid region chock block through mitochondria and can generate a fast whipping motion of the tell to swim from the service are up the gonna to the service and from the service to the egg to fertilize the egg it is really a basic set of chemical players that are involved here and basic in fact that if you were to disrupt any one of these chemical players either the utilizing form on the echinate the testosterum for the light excels or androgen dining proline you would observe pretty marked disruption inspermatagenesis or the elimination of sperm entirely will get into a few dephisists and sperm development and sperm number and sperm function li bit later but just keep in mind or i should say may be sit back and just appreciate that the exact same players generate from the hypothelemis which causes utilizing hormone and physical stimulate hormone release from the pituitary which travels to the gonad which in this cases the testicle which triggers the release of testosterum from lid excels which triggers the action of the supporting cells the pertly cells which make androgen dining proline testosterone and androgen dining preaching combine and create a chemical and actually structural milk in which those little spermatocytes and go from the walls from literally the walls of the tubes of the luminiferous tubules can mature into healthy well developed sperm and can hop into those ducts those little tubes and then head off to the epiditimus where they will reside the epiditimus is the tissue nearby the tetanal a surrounding one portion of the testicle and then eventually fuse with the vast deferent can combine with or be contained with rather the seminal fluid and then can be ejaculated tithe urethra into the female were than they can swim very quickly festively the distance for them anyway from lot angels to san francisco over the course of a very short period of time and fertilize the egg that is the process of spermatagenesis the maturation of sperm which is on going throughout the life span from purity onward and in doing we talked about some of the hormonal elements coming from the hypothalamus and coming from the pituitary and within the testis themselves the led excels which produced a stoker on the pertly cells which of the support cells that alow spermatagenesis to occur with that in mind next i to think about what is actually contained in the ejaculate interns of numbers of sperm and what is really being selected for interns of the sperm that actually successfully fertilizes the egg and what sorts of elements come into play in dictating whether not fertilization will or will not occur and the major themes that were going to discuss are frequency of ejaculation but really that is just kind of a proxy for talking about maximizing sperm concentration and quality of sperm arriving at the egg right because remember ovulation in the menstrual cycle or really about creating the opportunity for fertilization and we are also going to talk about how the vaginal duct the vagina and the miles around the service and some other elements within the female herself contribute to and support the sperm in their journey to the egg and in the likelihood that they will fertilize the egg really what we need to talk about first is sperm quality and we should also probably talk about ejaculate quality because as odd is that theme might seem really the ejaculate quality which has a number of different parameters including the number of mature sperm that are not mature that there swimming slower are dead but also qualities prom the have fences one table it is not entirely uncommento see sperm with two tails right because they just inform properly or sperm that are not moving very much am in fact sperm motility is scored along a scale of zero one two or three three being the best for fast forward progressing a zero is not moving at all a one their actually called twitches right twitches are sperm that s or just twitching place but do not undergo forward progression two is somewhere in between a one and three not surprisingly different clinics different obiguiends different neurologists will throwout different numbers but in general it is hoped that more than fifty per cent of the sperm should be motile in some way or another son not scoring a zero but a one two earth ideal a three the concentration of sperm of course if it is higher within the ejaculate now the total number of sperm per millileader of ejaculate if that is higher than there is a higher probability that one of those sperm will fertilize the egg something i did not mention before when discussing the production of eggs an ovulation and i probably should have i will now is that most often only one very give rise to an ovulating egg it is it happens but it is somewhat rare for two mature eggs one from each very to be deploy during a singlovulation a there is a name for that when it occurs and both are fertilized its called fraternal twins a if a single egg that of course comes from a single very is fertilize in the egg splits and that something that happens further along the process of fertilization and differentiation of the embryo will then what you get are identical twins a there are other instances that are a quite uncommon in which you can get fraternal twins through other circumstances been general ts the way it works but century what happens is one egg from one very that is the most common currents the sperm once ejaculated into the vaginal duct are going to pass through the service and then are going to swim toward the egg the egg could be at varying locations along the female reproductive access now this is actually a very important thing and actually gets right down to a the safety of both the potentially developing embryo and the mother there is something i refer to as ectopic pregnancy and that is when the pregnancy actually ours within the philopian tubes the precise location in which fertilization between the sperm an the egg occurs can vary somewhat but i deal the realizes egg implants into the endometrium were theundermetreal lining of the uterus and develops there as supposed to within the philopian tubes which is called ectopic pregnancy now where the sperm in the egg me exactly can vary as i mention before but in general the faster swimming sperm and the more far along the copulatory churchectory the egg are the higher the probability of a successful fertilization because of the proximity to the implantation on of the uterus easily it is all a probability's game it is a probabilities game related to the number of sperm cells that encounter the egg and where the egg is and terms of its oblatory cycle and also its position where it is in the copulatory cycle the sperm parameters i should say the seamen parameters and ejaculate parameters that most clinicians want to sea if you were to give a sperm sample would be somewhere in excess of fifteen million sperm per mill leader of ejaculate now there is a lot of discussion nowadays tit seems to be a very popular new theme to talk about diminishing sperm counts now the idea that a hundred years ago or maybeven thirty five years ago the typical male ejaculate contained a hundred million sperm per milleader and nowadays its down to fifteen to twenty or fifty and indeed sperm counts do seem to be declining and the exact reasons for that are not clear no confess o melodic reluctant to talk about this because a there have been a lot of back and forth discussions about the safety of e maps of electromagnetic fields it is not exactly what were talking about here but there ore some excellent data contained in medanalsies and reviews that i will provide links to and that will talk about in more detail in a minute that correlate the advent of smart phones and in particular carrying of smart phones in the pocket with diminishing sperm counts although there are certain to be other factors that can explain diminishing sperm counts as well o doctor shank swan a for instance is done beautiful work describing how the allies a and the b pies and called en endocrine destructor might be destructing some of the milieu of the a seminirforous tubules to this od be reductions in testosterone end or destruction to the surtholy cells and endergembining proline brought about by entircrine destructor such as allies contained in pesticides and contained on printed receipt somethings that sort there are some data that that is negatively impacting a sperm counts how much is still debatable there are also quite good data pointing the fact that both the heat related and the non heat related impact of smart phones and lap tops contained on the the lap are impacting sperm count and in a negative way again there is going to be tremendous variation in the concentration of sperm for one individual to next it will vary according to age and a number of other factors it will talk about a little bit later but in general of somebody is wishing to conceive then clinicians to see a ejaculate volume of more than two millileaders ejaculate volume can be anywhere from one point five to five mill leaders and that will strongly be determined by how frequent ejaculation is occurring there is a lot that goes in to a valuating the quality of ejaculate and sperm but basically these huge variations that are observed of anywhere from fifteen million sperm permileader or in some males who are not producing sperm for whatever reason we talk about those reasons in e obit the a as low as five million a sperm permit leader all the way up to hundred or maven two hundred million sperm permit leader huge variation the cause of which is not always clear but is certainly determined in part by the frequency of ejaculation because there many variables impacting why one male verses another male or even the same male across the lifespan might have variations in his a concentration of sperm within the ejaculate let us talk for a second about frequency of ejaculation as it relates to the goal of fertility persuade as that's really what to day's episode is all about what it'd to talk about next is how people can increase the probability of a successful fertilization focusing both on the components from the male side and from the female side and ism mainly going to couch this discussion in the context of the call natural method of sexual intercourse and ejaculation in veto right within the female but i will also touch on some parallel themes as it relates to inventor fertilization an intrauterine in semination a the idea here is that we want the maximum number of high quality sperm that is rapidly forward motile sperm that are of the correct morphology that is shape that is going to require a lot of mitacondra in the midregion a well shaped head at cannot an oval shaped head the tail is going t be a single tale not multiple tales these are can be of the twitches type of of a or immotile type of sperm that are either a twitching in place or aren't moving forward all of those components are going to be essential for increasing the probability of fertilization but of course there is the female side of it too which is that ovulation occurs on just one day during the menstrual copulatory cycle and that egg will be available for fertilization for approximately twenty four hours now keep in mind that the sperm can survive within the vaginal duct and within the area round the service and within the uterus and along the female reproductive tract for anywhere from three to five or its even been described as up to seven days but generally it is going to be about three to five days now most women can figure out the day of their ovulation by counting the total number of days of their typical cycle this is where it is really useful to have a cycle tats of more or less regular duration or rather of more or less regular length as we talked about earlier if somebody cycle is twenty one days or twenty five days and its twenty one or twenty five days consistently or even thirty days consistently that is going to be a far better scenario to favor fertilization than if it is twenty days one month and then twenty one days the next month within suddenly thirty days and then suddenly thirty five days those varying durations of the oblatory cycle make it very hard vouch to time and understand when ovulation is going to occur regular duration oblatory cycles are the ideal circumstance there the ideal circumstance because even though the beg is only available for fertilization for few days those sperm can survive for some period of time which leads to the issue of how often should couples be having intercourse and here referring specifically to intercourse with ejaculation how often should couples be having intercourse around the time of ovulation if the specific goal is successful fertilization of the egg and the creation of a baby this is leaving aside all issues which of course are interesting issues related to how often people are having intercourse whether not there is ejaculation every time they have intercourse or not forsake of pleasure or sake of perbonding and pleasure or forsake of any number of other potential goals of intercourse here ism only referring to intercourse as it relates to the goal of fertilization of the egg knowing what we know about spermatigenesis and the fact that ejaculate is going to contain a certain concentration of sperm but that within that ejaculate some of the sperm will be older and less healthy and some will be optimally mature and some might even be a little but immature although there is a tendency for the immature sperm to not have yet exited the seminiferist tubules a gone into the epiditimus and vast deference but given that the ejaculate contain sperm of varying ages and therefor varying quality and given that with each successive ejaculation in a short period of time there is going to be a decrease in the concentration of sperm per millileader of seamen of ejaculate we can make some good arguments as to how often couples should have intercourse with ejaculation around the time of ovulation if the goal is to fertilize if population occurs on for instance day fourteen of a cycle here were using the kind of standard average of twenty eight days the cycle but for some with thirty days cycle the could be a day fifteen or on with the shorter cycle could be day twelve for instance but given a twenty eight day average cycle let say ovulation occurs on day thirteen or on day fourteen and typically would occur on day fourteen of a twenty eight day cycle will then given how long sperm can survive inside of the woman you might think that the optimal stray would be to have as much intercourse with ejaculation in the three or four days leading up to population hope that these sperm is swim as far as they possibly can and will encounter the egg just as soon as possible after it populates turns out that s not the optimal stray the optimal stray is really to maximize the concentration of healthy sperm within each ejaculate and to really center that around the day of population what this involves generally with the typical recommendation is is to abstain from intercourse with ejaculation about two or three days out from ovulation and then on the day prior to population and on the day of population to essentially introduce as much seamen and ejaculate into the reproductive pathway of the female as possible now that is the general recommendation that the obigiwiends and the neurologist that i spoke to gave but you will also here a different stray it is only slightly different but the difference drag involves trying to maximize the concentration of healthy sperm within each ejaculate with the understanding that with each subsequent ejaculation over about a twenty four hour period that there is going to be a dramatic reduction in the concentration of sperm what that means is that if a couple for instance were to have intercourse with ejaculation many times on the day prior to population yes that will introduce a lot of sperm into the reproductive pathway the female but what it means is that on the day of ovulation if they were to have intercourse the number of high quality sperm that will be available to the egg will be greatly diminished and if none of the sperm that were introduced in the day prior mash a fertilize that egg will then essentially chances are off that there will be fertilization or there greatly diminished rather if there having intercourse with ejaculation once or twice on the day prior to population and then a maximum rumor of times with ejaculation on the day of population that itself can maximize the probability of fertilization whit stray is optimal should couples have as much intercourse with ejaculation on the day prior to ovulation end on the day of population or should they have intercourse on the day prior to population but not frequently that it diminishes the concentration of sperm and then allows for intercourse with the maximum number of ejaculations on the day of ovulation you really hear it both ways and what this really boils down to is frankly that nobody knows and the reason nobody knows is that there tremendous variation on males interns of the absolute concentration of sperm per millileader of ejaculate and the amount of sperm penile of ejaculate within a given time frame but what every one agrees on is that a period of abstinence ranging from forty eight to seventy two hours prior to an ejaculation increases the concentration of high quality sperm within that first ejaculation occur after the abstinence period eh again to reiterate if one's goal is to fertilize the egg you want to take into consideration that most often there is going to be a dramatic decline in the concentration of sperm per ejaculate any time those ejaculations are occurring within a short period of time say within twelve to twenty four hours of one another now all of this of course also relates to the female biology and the extent to which the women can precisely identify the day in timing of herovulation some women feel as if and indeed are very accurate at estimating their time of ovulation to within a couple of hours or some women even report being able to feel their actual ovulation whether not they are feeling the ovulation itself the ne or the deployment of the great is not clear i certainly would knownever produced eggs nor ofhovulated man i certainly not going to contest the idea that a women o can do that i mean it make sense that some people have a very o keen called interceptive awareness in awareness of the century events within their body and while of course the ovaries are not thought of as an organ that we want to be able to sense what is going on an there in terms o feel there are sensory endings within the very and the notion that a one could literally sense changes within their very including the deployment of the egg is not on outside on the bounds of reason and in fact could likely be the case now that said there are a number of different ways that women will tract their ovulation one is the temperature methods of they will actually measure interovagional temperature on their looking for changes in temperature that are consistent around the time of ovulation were going have an expert messed on and of given who can tell us a lot more about the details in enhances of the temperature method you will sea lot of information about this on line bit there is a lot of is understanding about it as well other women will use as that takeinto account either the temperature information if the acquiring temperature information that will be entered into the a as well as marking the onset of menstruation the onset of bleeding therefore the start of the oblatory cycle because of course as we mention early that marks day one of their cycle and then again and again you can see how regularity of cycle duration or relative regularity of cycle duration really favors this whole process of being able to predict when one populates and fortunately if the goal is fertilization there are some margins for error that are introduced by the fact that the sperm can survive within the female re productive tract for some period of days thereby reducing the need for absolute certainty about the time of population and on in fact it is pretty well known that around the time of ovulation a couple of things happen earlier we take about one thing which is there's an increase in libido just prior to population this relates to in part and increase in some of the androgen things d c e but also to stostrone and some related androgen they can increase libido both in males and females and changes to the reproductive pathway the female in particular a change in the p h that is the relative acidity verses basic nature of the mucosa lining near the service and also vaginal secretions such that around the time of ovulation the entire milk of the vagina and the service and the locations in which fertilization can occur and certainly in which the sperm are swimming towards the opportunity for fertilization is shifted to support sperm motility and half in other words the one of the best environments for sperm to survive is going to be within the female reproductive pathway itself and as long as we are talking about vaginal secretions and mucus it is important to point out that in number of commercially available lubricant can actually be detrimental for sperm health even if they do not contain spermicide this is something you want to discuss with your of i yen or certainly if your male you couldalso discuss thus with your neurologists and your partners obi g yen a lot of the commercially available lure can contain chemicals that while they may favorably change the consistency or the viscosity of the vaginal pathway for purposes of intercourse certainly may not be the most favorable for maintaining the health of the sperm in the motility the sperm again here were talking about intercourse only in the context of trynamaximize fertilization and i should mention that there are certain lubricants that are more conducive to the sperm environment but it is something that you really want to talk your of g can about or at least read up about if your interest is in trying to fertilize and develop an embryo we cover the optimal strategies for how often couples should have intercourse with ejaculation around the time of ovulation in order to maximize the probability that successful fertilization and ultimately pregnancy will occur what we have not covered yet however is how long couples should apply that method over time in order to achieve successful fertilization and pregnancy now of course if a couple decide that they want to conceive and they apply that method or any other method for instance and they a chief fertilization and a successful pregnancy the very first month that they try well then there is no other work to do at least until that child is born and if in only if they decide they want have more children however many couples find that they do not conceive in the first month of trying even w hen they apply the potable methods and even if their age and every other factor related to egg quality and sperm quality is optimized now i think it is the rare instance in which egg quality and sperm quality are optimize in fact the word optimal and optimization and optimized s lope misleading in general because no one really knows what that is but of course there is an ideal there is a perfect standard to which everyone would to achieve but of course we all enter the picture which genetic variables environmental variables and forth many of which will talk about because you can in fact a just them in the direction tat you would to improve sperm egg quality but most people simply will not succeed in achieving a successful fertilization the first month that they try now there is a truth that governs how many tries it ought to take in order to achieve successful fertilization an ultimately pregnancy and its very age dependent and in particular its dependent on the age of the mother because the age and quality of the egg while it is not the only factor is certainly one of the most determining factors and whether not successful fertilization occurs and as women age the quality of the eggs tends to diminish over time largely due to changes in the mitochondrial function and the spindle that pulls the chromosomes apart although there could be other factors involved as well now before continuing any further i just want to acknowledge that this whole language around egg quality and sperm quality is not the greatest language because it is entirely subjective and yet the word quality in these instances is really the to explain a broad variety of factors that can in fact be measured things the number of physicals that are deployed each month in a woman's population or the number of motile sperm are the number of morphologically that is correctly shaped sperm in the male and forth when we talk about egg quality of sperm quality were really referring to in amalgam of different features related to the different aspects of ovulation leading to successful fertilization were the different aspects of sperm related to whether not they can arrive in deliver their dean contents and forth i will use the words egg quality and sperm quality just as general themes because that is what a lot of the clinicians use but i do understand that its elicit of a loaded term in both instances and it does not relate to any one specific perimeter person getting back to this issue of how long couple should try according to the age of the female and perhaps also the age of the male well most of the data that have been collected relate to the age of the females i mention before and what were about to discuss is within the scientific literature described as what is called facundibility which is the amount of time over which a given couple needs to attempt to conceive course by having intercourse with ejaculation around the time of population it assumes that all the other things are being done correctly and what we know is that there is a strong age dependent effect that largely rests on the age of the egg that is of the few male and what we know is that for females thirty years old or younger if they have intercourse with ejaculation around the time of ovulation say on the day before and on the day of ovulation and there could be other intercourse with ejaculation round that time as well on average that will result in a successful fertilization in pregnancy about twenty per cent of the time on the first month of attempting the first ovulation cycle now if fertilization and pregnancy occurs great they will be at least nine month lag until they decide whether not they want to try and conceive again however most couples even if the woman is thirty years old or younger will not successfully conceive on that first attempt and that is because the probability is not a hundred per cent it is twenty per cents eighty per cent of the time they simply will not conceive which means that they hopefully will try again the very next month and if they successfully conceive great and if they do not then they ought to try again the next month the next month and forth now the typical advice that an of i y en would give you is that for a woman thirty years or younger and leaving a side the age of the father but still assuming that egg quality and sperm quality are sufficiently high to achieve fertilization that the couple should or if the woman's try to have is alone the woman should attempt to conceive over f the period of six months why willie you think about it if there is a twenty per cent chance in the first month and it is in successful will then on the second month they will also be a twenty per cent chance on the third month also a twenty per cent chance what ism describing here is what obviously is independent probabilities that is if you were to flipacoin and the probability of getting heads is fifty per cent the probability of getting tails is fifty percent of course you do not expect that the previous flip had anything to do with the result thatyou'l get on the subsequent flip that is what independent probabilities are however when it comes to for credibility were really talking about something which is called cumulative pregnancy rate which is not really independent probabilities now why would that be why would it be that if you did not successfully conceive in the first month of time that by simply trying again and again and again the probability of conceiving would increase hell the reason for that is that this whole business of fertilization is not just about what is happening withe egg it is also about what is happening with a sperm there are number of different events related to the biology of the egg in the biology the sperm which you are now very familiar with from everything have talked about up until now and there a bunch of chance events for instance that the sperm will not actually arrive at the egg in time or that the egg will not arrive at the spermic time because of course it is a by directional migration of those two centimes or that for whatever reason fertilization will not occur t really talking about when we talk about the cumulative pregnancy rate over time is the fact that there re multiple probabilities at work and yes those are somewhat independent in the cents that the by logy of the sperm does not really strictly depend on the biology of the egg at least not until they meet and fertilize but the likelihood of pregnancy depends on those independent probabilities which makes this a cumulative pregnancy rate now if any of that is confusing what it basely means is that for the egg in the sperm to meet and to fertilize a number of different events that carry some intentionality write the sperm swims towards the egg and for the egg we does not have a a personality in there at least not yet but it a cording what wants to be fortilieswright at it in principal receptive to fertilization well in order for that to happen therefore going to be some events related to chance that could limit the ability for that to happen and therewith be other events dictate by their biology of those who sell types ted are driving that event to happen that a rising the event to yes happen and what we are talking about when we ti about cumulative pregnancy rate is how much of the biology of the woman is scute towards fertilization to be likely to occur nice to make this very simple all we need to know is that for women thirty years old or younger because the probability of getting pregnant on any one attempt to conceive is twenty per cent well then if that does not occur the first time then she should simply repeat that at least five and probably six times before deciding to go to an of g we end and conclude that there something going on either with the egg or of course it could be with the per peg because twenty times five is a hundred where time accumulative per cents o twenty forty sixty eighty a hundred and he six month there would take you to a hundred twenty per cent am which is a a different thing altogether but in general that is why o b g we ends will tell their female patients look if you are setting out to conceive try for about five or six months and if you are not successful come back and seizing now for women who are age thirty one to thirty three the probability of conceiving in that first month drops to about eighteen per cent women in that age range and their partners should certainly try and conceive naturally over a period of six or seven months in order to get to that hundred per cent cumulative probability and then for women who are age thirty four to thirty seven the probability of conceiving in that first month of t of trying and certainly every month thereafter is about eleven per cent when the age of the woman starts extending out to about thirty four or thirty five years old then the typical advice of the o b g we penne is going to be to a tempt to conceive over a period of about nine months to a year be for deciding to take some sort of medical intervention and then at course as the age of the woman increases two does the quality of the eggs go down now that is not true for every woman there are many women who in their late thirties and forties and even really fifties have successfully conceived healthy children although the probability of that the likelihood of it drops substantially for instance for women who are age thirty eight to thirty nine the probability of a successful conception by natural conception intercourse with ejaculation is going to be about five per in went right it usually drop to a quarter of what it was when that woman was thirty again these are averages only what does that mean while it means that if you are age thirty eight or older chances are that you should probably go to your of g y end right at the outset of your desire to conceive and ask what you can do to improve egg quality otherwise if you hereto extend the math out right we know that if your aged thirty or younger twenty per cent chance in any one given month that means about for to six months of trying shall you can simply multiply that times four or five for some one in their late thirties or early forties and what you really talking about a several years of trying and of course what is happening during those several years the woman is getting older and as a consequence the quality of the eggs is declining even further if you are thirty five thirty six years old it might not be entirely unreasonable to talk your of g w and right at the outset of desiring to conceive but you could also just take the approach of thing to conceive naturally for about a year or a year and a half before deciding to do that keeping in mind that all the while you cannot stop time biological time an aging is going to occur in the back top but hopefully this description of cumuli of pregnancy rate make cents again the ideas that while it is true that every single month there is an independent chance of the woman getting pregnant and that chance is dropping from about twenty per cent at age thirty over time to about really one to three per cent for women forty or older there is also this notion of cumulative probability which involves multiple biological events in both the egg and the sperm that have to converge in time and space in order for successful fertilization to occur as long as we are on this topic i think it is only fair to address the issue of miscarriage and miscarriages can arise from variety of sources they can arise from genetic defects that can arise from issues in the mill e of the uteruses that can arise from issues with a sperm for that matter right it we really do not want to put all the weight and all the a responsibility on the egg this is always an egg sperm dynamic and when i sayggspirm dynamic now hopefully that calls to mine the huge library of information that we have ben covering up until now about a come salmon segregation and the coming together of these different cell types and their genetic information any number of different steps within the process of fertilization leading up to pregnancy can lead to miscarriage however the probability of miscarriage greatly increases as a function of the age of the egg and the basic numbers on this are that for women who are thirty five years or older about twenty five per cent of successful fertilization lead to miscarriages now when those miscarriages occur during pregnancy can be highly variable sometimes it is within the first trimester sometimes it could be later but the probabilities about twenty five per cent that probability increases greatly over time such that by the time women are in their early forty forty or older the probability of is s carriage after a successful fertilization is going to be about fifty per cent and this could be due to a number of factors as i mention before but one common reason is that there can be chromosomal abnormalities and that could be related typically to the segregation of the egg when half of the chromosomes in that egg are removed taking it from diploid to haploid yo recall is that little polar body which is the removal of the chromosomes it is ejected from the egg tat will eventually popular and sometimes not all the chromosomes that are were posed to the ejected in that polar body are ejected and consequence their multiple chromosomes or duplications of cromazomes things peristomes sometimes too many chromosomes move away and their actual removal of entire chromaozoms meaning both strands that you have chromosomal delusions and in that case typically fertilization will not occur but there are instances in which fertilization will occurs a woman will get a positive pregnancy test or periods will stop and they the couple will think that there advancing along a the steps to a successful pregnancy and then their will be sadly a miscarriage many many times those miscarriages are the consequence of the fact that when there are extra chromosomes there or there are too few chromosomes present that embryogenisist can simply not progress in a healthy way a there are some instances in which all of the chromosomes and all the chromazoma arrangements are perfectly normal and miscarriages can still occur ism going to do a future episode about pregnancy and embryonic development where we will get into this more deeply but just understand that the frequency of miscarriages increases dramatically after about age thirtyefore and then continues to increase dramatically a extending well out until the forties now very important consideration in terms of understanding and predicting fertility and fcundability this word that describes the probability of getting pregnant on a given try and over time is trying to address how quoting fertile a woman is and importantly how quote q fertile a male is and will talk that the mailside in a moment but when trying to address how fertile a woman is of course ages going to be one of the major factors but just one factor are we already talked about age determines the likelihood of a successful pregnancy if the intercourse and ejaculation is being carried out at the correct times and with viable sperm capable of fertilizing eggs and then of coursers the issue of egg quality but in general most women would to know how fertile they are as a function of their age i and i actually think this is one of the most important topics in this whole space around fertility that is not often discussed or at least is not often discussed until women are in there late thirties are forties when often times they will look back and wish that either they had frozen their eggs or they had frozen fertilized embryos which is a whooshing unto itself and we talk about that when we have an an episode on in vitrofertlization in more depth but there is a fairly straightforward way or set of ways that women can determine there basic level of fertility leaving aside a lot of the detailed issues about the quality of eggs and forth one thing that you already learn is that there is this vault there is this reserve that we call the ovarian reserve and that each month a certain number of folicals leave that reserve and there is the opportunity based on the ovulation of a single egg to fertilize that egg and for the women to get pregnant an one thing that we know for sure is that the size of the population that is released from that vault each month has a very strong positive correlation with the size of the reserve in the vault itself ka the weigh to thing about this perhaps is that the vault is a bank account has a certain amount of money in this case eggs in it and you could imagine if some one's reasonably logical that if they have more money in their bank account than we're going toe withdraw a larger amount each month than if they have a small amount each month if the idea is to make that vault that bank of eggs available to them over the longest period of time and indeed apologies pretty smart it does not deploy or release you half the folicals in one month and then just slowly trickolout the remainder of folicals now that is not out works what you find is that of course in younger women say in their eighteen twenties and thirties the ovarian reserve in the vault is going to have more eggs in it and the number of folicals and eggs that leave that vault each month is going to be quite high one way to evalueight how quote fertile you are again just one way is to go to your obguyen and say that you would to know how many folicals you have in a given month in of coursethey look at them on both sides in both ovaries and for instance if a omen has just two or three folicals that are out each month well then the assumption again it is just in assumption but the assumption that is pretty good because there is this positive correlation that generally curves is that that varying reserve that the number of eggs in the vault is fairly low compared to some one who say has twenty folicals or thirty folicals each month n that is the typical trend again these are averages and it is very important to not get attached to any one number here again these are averages for instance there are women who only deploy five folicals and eggs each month from out of their ovarian vault but who find themselves to be very fertile in there could be a number of different factors to explain that other women will have twenty or thirty eggs and folicals that leave that vault the ovarian reserve each month and they will have a harder time getting pregnant for any number of different reasons but in general the more eggs and folicals that leave the vault each month the higher number of eggs that are still in reserve meaning the greater amount of time over which a given woman could still attempt to have successful fertilization now this small collection of polls and eggs that are released each month actually has a name there called antralfolcals these are smolpolicals they tin to be about two define millimeters across the way these are analyzed or measured is woman will go into the of g we an office an by ultrasound typically there some local anaemia but its not often a general inasisia but by local in cassia sometimes no anasisia they will e sensually count the number of folicals that are present in each side on very on the left an the very on the right and give a woman some sense of how many policies she has and typically this is done over a series of months to determine how many eggs are leaving the ovarian reserve each month and therefore how many eggs she is likely to still have in the ovarian reserve now there is a non invasive way to do this as well although typically an of g y n will do both what i just described with ultrasound en measure something called a m h which is anti malaria hormone which is a hormone that is released by that antralfolical population the population of folicals and eggs that leave the ovarian reserve each month one is a blood draw measure of a hormone a m h the other is a structural imaging measure of the antraofolicals directly again the typical trend is for the number of antrofolicals to decline over time one might expect for instance that a woman in her twenties or thirties might have twenty thirty maybe even forty antralfolicals that are exiting the reserve each month and again that is the total across both ovaries again these are just averages these r distributions that ill be people with far fewer the will be people with far more but that over time regardless of where woman starts out from one decade to the next half decade an decade and on that the number of antrafolicals will decline end the amount of or the levels of a m h will also decline what does this all mean what this means is that if you are a woman who is in her twenties or thirties or forties whatever your age if you are interested in conceiving in the future it is very likely a good idea to go to our of g we n and get either your a m h levels measured or your logical count measured and to do that several times in a given period and i do not mean a menstrual period i mean given period of time across several months to determine what is the average number of locals what's your average a m h level thereby giving you some window into how many eggs you are likely to still have in your ovarian reserve i cannot tell you how many woman that have spoken to in how many of g we is more important my case they speak to many more women about this than i ever haver ever will wish that they had done this earlier right they thing o therme ism in my twentieth some likely to have a tonopolicals or they got pregnant once before and they are not concerned about the number of folicals or their a m h levels but over and over again i was to led in researching for the episode that the earlier and more frequent that women do this procedure of measuring a m each and measuring their logical count the higher the probability that they will eventually have a successful fertilization and pregnancy when they seek to do now the merger image of all this of course is the sperm and there is a kind of common misconception out there that know the sperm me only need one and indeed you only need one but actually you need many and it is only one that able to successfully fertilize the egg this whole concept of you only need one is a both dismissive of the sperm but more importantly dismissive of the biology of the sperm end the egg we it only takes one successful sperm and one successful egg it that sort of telling a woman he you only need one egg right you need one egg of sufficient quality in the right time and place and you need one sperm of sufficient quality in the right time and place in order to get successful fertilization and hopefully pregnancy but you need a lot of sperm in order to get a high probability that that one sperm will be able to successfully fertilize the egg we have this image of sperm is kind of these a dumb operators thatch a sort of swim a mindlessly towards anything amend if the bump into an egg than they fertilize the goners really not the way it works as i talk about earlier the sperm with its head its mid region its tail chalk a block with might a conure in the mid region is really an active motile sell that indeed will just swim forward if it is a healthy forward progressing sperm but you many mils out there just simply do not have any knowledge of how many quality sperm that they happen to have now given the fact that sperm analysis is relatively inexpensive and also the fact that freezing sperm is relatively in expensive think it stands to reason that most men should at least get some window into the numbering quality of their sperm now it is a fair assumption to say that a someone is in their eighteens or early twenties or thirties that they probably have high quality sperm but again as with the egg and the importance of measuring a m each and logical count across time men should really evaluate the quality and number of their sperm and we talked a obit earlier about some of the parameters that a neurologists and of g yens to see when a valuating sperm at there is a minimum number or concentration of sperm that they to see if a couple is going to use i f and be to fertilization and typically that is going to be about fifteen to twenty million per mill of sperm or seamen and typically they want to see somewhere between two and five mill leaders of seamen a over all in a given ejaculate after a seventy two to forty eight hour abstinence period because of course the more ejaculations the smaller the the volume of the ejaculate a in a short period of time but after forty eight to seventy two hours you more or less maximize the volume of ejaculate and then of course they want to see fifty but typically sixty per cent or more of motile sperm in order to get ivies but it more is better and of course there is an enormous range as i mention before some males will have anywhere from ten to twenty million sperm permit leader of ejaculate and some men will have hundred to two hundred million eh but just because they have a hundred to two hundred million does not mean that all of those spermary of high quality in can fertilize beg sometimes the more than half will be twitches and some will be immotile and on and forth it is very straight forward what i believe most people should do in what the neurologists i spoke to an advance of this episode i have said to do which is to simply do a spermanalysis refrain from ejaculation for forty eight to seventy two hours give a sperm sample have that sperm sample analyzed the cost of the sperm analysis is not typically that much a and considering that conception and healthy conception and fertilization is an expensive process if you have to go the in vutroferlization rout it stands to reason that the cost is pretty well justified you will s have the option to free sperm over time there is evidence that the age of the father and therefor the age of the sperm can dictate whether or not there is a higher instance of problematic pregnancy or developmental outcomes including autism that is true a you probably heard that if the father is forty years or older the incidence of autism is increased significantly that is true although the over all probability of having an autistic offspring if somebody if the father that is is forty years or older is still quite a bit lower then you would imagine it is not as if the probability suddenly sky rockets on case that we will have an episode on autism and genetic and congeneric a the influence is on autism and other aspects of the autism spectrum but the point is this i believe and the neurologists i spoke to who are interested in fertility and male health and sexual health suggests that men get the sperm analyzed at least once every five years and certainly if there going to want to conceive children in the distant future that they consider freezing their sperm because that too is fairly nominal cost in order to freeze sperm at a younger age and of course if you can freezing u sperm from the time in which you were younger why would not you right i mean you can still of to go for natural pregnancy later if that is what you want to do but having that in reserve is generally a good idea and i discuss some of the parameters that a that are looked for and perhaps most importantly there is the possibility of an underlying issue whereby for instance there is very little sperm in an ejaculate as i mention earlier the seminal fluid in the ejaculate could have zero sperm in it but the volume of ejaculate could appear completely normal just because yourejaculate volume is a normal to you or in that range of two to five mill leaders well then that does not surely mean that there are any sperm there or that there are very few sperm there and the few sperm that are there were the many sperm there there are functionally motile get this analyzed it is really worth doing and again is not somethingyou have to do every year at something that you want to do probably every five years at least until the point where you have conceived as many children as you ever want to conceive the basic take away here is that if you are a woman to get your egg count your antre physical count that is and therefore your reserve of eggs indirectly measured and of course alright your a mace a levels measured and if you're a male to have a sperm analysis and to do that relatively early in fact another incentive for doing that early is that you have a comparison point that for instance if you are in your early twenties in your not think about having kids at all are your thinking that you might someday have kids but it is a really some day some day far off in the future well it is wonderful to have a reference point from which to compare your biology in your early twenties to your biology in your mid or late thirties are forties when you might happen to be interested in conceiving and if that does not providinstantif enough i should mention and this is important to point out and that i think both males and females are not aware of is that one in five couples that have issues with fertility the issue and up falling on the biology that is the quality of the sperm or a lack of number of sperm you n i think there is a misconception that when festivities in issue its always in issue with the eggs and this age dependent a decline in the beg quality again s the best long which we have available to us at the moment this age dependent decline in egg quality is often to blame but not always one in five couples that have challenges conceiving turns out that its can be in issue with the sperm and of course there are number different sperm analysis that should all the other parameters of sperm assure normal now for instance you can get a idea fragmentation analysis can see whether or not the dance of the sperm are somehow destructed neurologists these days are excellent at figuring out for instance if a male has lots and lots of sperm everything would scrape but the shape of the head of the sperm is not quite right if it is not oval enough and it is to rounded that could be a genetic defect under which conditions there is zero probability of the male ever naturally conceiving right regardless of who the female partner is believe or not males can have a ton of sperm but if they carry a certain genetic defect this sperm will be incapable of depositing those twenty three chromosomes into the egg however there are ways in which that sperm can be coaxed or force to fertilize the beg an deposit its genetic contents by invited fertilization and then implantation into the female again lots of reasons to have a egg reserve analysis by ultrasound and mate for females and lots of reasons for males to have a sperm analysis and of course typically with a sperm analysis and a overran reserve analysis will be a hormone analysis and ism a very strong believer in people getting in insight that is a window into their hormonal composition conscious when they encounter problems but starting at a pretty early age you it is only done once every five years are having a reference point to your twenties and to your thirties and mid thirties for when you felt a certain way may be as in the case for many people i know they actually feel better in their forties than they did in their twenties because they are doing a lot of things to support their health that is possible but in many cases people start feeling not as well or their fertility seems to be dropping off or any number of different parameters that we discuss to day or related to vitality and longevity seem to be dropping off over time and they want to get a insight into what could be the issue and hormones are sometimes not always but sometimes involved in those underlying issues and there is nothing as valuable as having a reference point from a time in which things were going well to a valuate the for instance the levels of hormones not just testosterone but also estrogen and progesterone and forth you need a comparison point in order to determine what really needs to be changed all of this is a a strong push for people to use your insurance if you are able to put it on insurance oftentimes an people are and if not to try and find a reasonable or reasonably a price way to do a sperm and analysis and to ideally do a hormone analysis as well it is really gin a set you up for the maximum probability of being able to conceive children when you want to and also to avoid a bunch of other health related issues that are involve hormones and reproductive health and in general to support your mental health and physical health give ben talking about a bunch of things to do there are couple of things to be mindful of to actively avoid if your goal is to be and remain fertile and that is regardless of whether or not you want to conceive children in the future or not now in the contacts of this discussion the same things that we have heard to be true for other aspects of our health turn out to also be true let us to start with the basics everybody should be getting approximately six to eight hours of sleep every night that should be quality sleep optimizing your sleep is fundamental to balancing your hormones now bouncing your hormones as kind of a catch phrase for all things related to proper hormone regulation sleep is the fundamental layer of mental health physical earth and performance of all kinds end believe a not fertility when people are not sleeping well or enough stress hormones in particular quartesall shift to poking later in the day and those elevated cortical levels later in the day cause a bunch of different problems in both males and females many of which impact fertility controlling cortex all starts with controlling your sleep it also impacts to testosterone and estrogen levels of course the proper ratios of testosterone and estrogen will vary from males to females but in order to get those right or as right as they can be without other interventions you want to make surveyor regretting enough quality sleep how much sleep most people need about six to eight hours of sleep per night waking up once may be twice per night in mill the fighting going back to sleep is not such a bedel but sixty eight hours of solid sleep would be ideal some pe able need a little bat less in order to function you nit five hours some people need lo bit more developing than ages and babies and kids need a lotmore people are sick recovering from injury need a lotmore we have done multiple episodes on sleep we have a tool kip for sleep available free at superman labor come you go there you do not even have to sign up for the news letter although you can if you want s go to tool kip for sleep under the mind and you will be able to downtown that or you can manages viewed on the screen if you don on download has lots of tools we have done in episode called perfect your sleep that has a lot of tools there all time stamped for you have done a master your sleep episodes a lots of tools to get your sleep but get your sleep right if you are wishing to conceive and or to simply have healthy biology to be fertile or otherwise and this fundamental now there are other things to not do and those again fall into the somewhat obvious categories but think a lot of people arenaware of just how striking an effect these certain behaviors that you want to avoid can have in diminishing your fertility for both males and females as talk about those the first one is smoking and when we talk about smoking here which i not smoking nicotine and we are talking about smoking anabas and indeed there are strong data and i will put a reference to one of the better larger analysis of these data there strong data showing that anabas reduces fertility now i can already her the screams from the back although they are probably of fairly drawled out screams from the back of people saying they smoke anabas and the have no trouble conceiving certainly there will be exceptions but whether not your male or female smoking anabas is a bad idea if you want to conceive a healthy child can you still conceive a healthy child while smoking anabas probably certain people can many people will greatly decrease the probability of a healthy fertilization an pregnancy by smoking anabas there are excellent data to support that as well nicotine both smoked or raped is going to disrupt the process of fertilization and can destruct pregnancy dramatically orcas just avoided altogether how does this happen wile i turns out that smoking increases what a called reactive oxygen species this greatly disrupts the quality of the egg at the level the spindle in mitacondra and a number of other features and in the sperm turns out that smoking does not necessarily disrupt the sperm directly although it can causey and a fragmentation which can cause all sorts of abnormalities can prevent fertilization can lead to birth effects in the offspring but more importantly it increases what are called reactive oxygen species in the seminal fluid in the seamen that contain the sperm this very under normal circumstances under healthy circumstances beautifully orchestrated chemistry of fluid that allows a firm to thrive in their trajectory an attempt to fertilize the egg and lea to a healthy pregnancy if you are smoker and you want to conceive the best advice i can give you is to quit smoking and yes that includes cannabis as well now i am not somebody who believes that cannabis across the board is not useful there are medical applications and other applications i talk about that in an episode all about canabusts for health an disease and notice health was in their to you cannabis's smokers do not come after me with i guess whatever it is with a bongs and pipes or whatever it is that you want or with tapes the point is that while it can be beneficial for certain populations it is certainly bad for others and if you are trying to conceive it is bad for fertility and for a healthy pregnancy now that is smoking a end raping by the way raping is included there now the next category of do not relates to alcohol now everyone is heard that drinking during pregnancy is a bad idea you may have heard and some people of talked about the fact that there are cultures in which they alow if you will or even condone sadly one or two drinks while pregnant provided it is just champagne or something of that sort that is a terrible idea i did not episode all about alcohol both it is potential health effects of which they are turn out to be zero and yes that includes red wine it is far better to not drink at all and if you are going to drink the limit if you're a healthy adult who is not try to conceive not pregnant and you do not have issues with alcoholism is probably two drinks per weak total that is ride two drinks per weak total and that is the level that you really should consider if you are drinker if you are somebody who is trying to conceive however for woman who becomes pregnant the total number of drinks that you should allow yourself per weak while pregnant and breastfeeding is indeed zero there is absolutely know evidence that one can quit into get away which drinking during pregnancy and people say will i had a perfectly healthy child but of course you do not know what the health of that child would have been had you not drank at all now ism not here with any generally strong stance against alcohol i myself m i somebody wo has a drink every once in a while although ism do not consider myself somebody who has a strong proclivity for alcohol and of course ism at this moment ism not trying to conceive children and ism certainly not pregnant that is safe for me a but frankly have not ad o drink in all very long time and i do not miss it and that is me but i do realize that a lot of people enjoy alcohol and it is that two drinks per weak limit that really sets the upper limit and threshold beyond which you start running into issues with cellar mutation you start running into issues of oxidative tress greatly increase cancer risk and particular breast chance a risk all that is covered in the alcohol episode the we did you confine at superman labor calm and time stamped if you want a navigate to specific topics and forth i know all about the data supporting the statements that ism making on and forth now you are somebody who seeking to conceive or you fall into this category that some couples describe themselves as we are not trying but we are not not trying meaning they are not using birth control the have letting chance run it is course well then you should defy be aware of the date a showing that even just one bout one bout of called bin drinking which is five to six drinks in a given night or half day in a twelve hour period one bout of five to six drinks if you are woman prior man greatly increases both the likelihood of mutations in the embryo that would result from a fertilization and at the same time for reasons that should be obvious to you based on all the biology wove talked about it greatly reduce probability of fertilization now that absolute does not mean that you should use the ingestion of five or six drinks as a method of birth control that is not what i am saying here what i am saying is is that if you go out on a given night and you have five or six drinks and you happen to become pregnant the probability that that pregnancy will be disrupted in some way is greatly increased what the exact consequences are no one can tell you but also if you are somebody who is interested in conceiving a child will then you absolutely should abstain from ingesting drinks more than one or two during the time in which your trying to conceive an ideally it would be zero and you certainly would want to avoid drinking multiple drinks overnight and this idea of going out and having in ow three or four drinks or four or five drinks in a given night at a time in which you are also trying to conceive children the biology tells us the apdemeology tells us that this is just a terrible idea it is going to reduce the likelihood of fertility in successful pregnancy and if there is a successful pregnancy the word success needs to be in quotes right on anything every parent every species for that matter wants to increase the probability of having healthy offspring and a to my mind anyway and to the obiguiends and the neurologists that are fast on fertility that i spoke to everyone will say try as hard as you can to avoid the called bin drinking episodes and again these episodes are one night of consuming five to six drinks now another important thing to remember in this context is that the negative effects of consuming five or six drinks in a given night extend over many weeks following the ingestion of that alcohol if you are a male what that means is that is going to impact the quality of your sperm and greatly decrease the likelihood of successful fertilization and or healthy pregnancy over the period of that entire spermatagenesis window which is as we talked about before sixty to ninety days right sixty to generate the sperm and then in some additional time for the sperm to be transport to the point where they could be ejaculated if you're woman and you have five or six drinks on a given night will then you are going to destruct the quality not of just the egg that eventually ovulates but indeed the entire pool of folicals that leaves the ovarian vault and reserve and from which the one egg will be selected in other words you are reducing the quality of all of the eggs that you happen to deploy that month now some of you who were really following the biology earlier might say what if i have those five or six drinks during the time in which ism a menstruating just in which there is bleeding present and therefore i have not yet ovulated ah but if you remember the biology we talked about earlier specifically there is a subset of folicals and eggs that leave that ovarian reserve quite a bit before that one egg is selected for and ovulates and of course there are all the different hormonal cascades and the general mill e of the very which are important and are being regulated by different hormones and yes indeed the regulation of those hormones is strongly impacted by alcohol through a number of different pathways through the regulation of the her transmitter gala up in the brain its actually lot of gabon gala receptors in the hypothalamus the very region from which gan aditrope an releasing hormone ore old friend from couple hours ago in this discussion you to destruct gear h secretion you can destruct pituitary function with alcohol again and again what were seeing is that consuming more than one or two drinks per week of alcohol is really detrimental to the entire process of fertility and the entire process of healthy pregnancy and that is true from both the man side in the sperm and is true from the female side and the egg my simple advice on this as if you are wishing to have a healthy fertilization and pregnancy the best thing to do would be avoid alcohol together and if you are going to drink to really limit that drinking to one or two drinks per week maximum those of the major do not really avoid excessive stress and i should mention excessive tress is not just best avoided by getting enough quality sleep at night although that is the primary way there a other ways to avoid stress we have done entire episodes about this and we have a tool kit related to reducing stress with very simple zero cost tools again you can finally that superman lapdog come i should mention this you want to find any episode or topic or time stamp that web site is keyword search available you can just go to he rein lava calm put into the coach function stress tools and a bunch of different links will pop up related to those topics a likewise with sleep likewise with any number of different topics you might be interested in get enough quality sleep and thereby reduce stress and also directly buffer stress with real time tools to buffer stress thrave talked about om in the episodes that you can access and there ways to greatly reduce your overall level of stress to limit any courts all that is released to early in the day which is when you want coatis all released and not have it late in the day and on and forth reduce your stress and as i just told you by all means do not drink more than to drink per week and zero is better than to if any one tells you there is all this a rester tall in red wine in that is good for us the data simply tell us that there is not enoughfors very train red wine to really have any plosive health benefit the data round rests her tall and health benefits itself is under question nowadays zero alcohol is better than any alcohol two drinks per week is the limit also limit or eliminate or avoid nicotine and ideally candidate smoking and raping at the time in which you are trying to get pregnant and certainly if you are pregnant avoid all of the things as best you can that i just described a moment ago now there a couple other do not set are really important one of the most important do not relates to s t is or actually transmitter infections everyone who sexually active should get an it i check in fact you go to a fertility clinic or you go for spermanalysis or you go for analysis almost always they will do in s t i check even if you happen to be in a monogamous relationship even if you happen to be not sexually active in your somebody who seeking to use i v f with a spermedoner or something of that sort why would they do that why wiser much concern about that is it about avoiding giving birth to a child that a has am something a here's infection or something or oh i will certainly that is one reason but that is a down the line reason because at the time when some one goes into the clinic for one of these spermaraganalysies that is well in advance of any pregnancy right the reason is there are a number of s t s in particular ctenidia for which it greatly increases the probability of miscarriage clematis's one of those very insidious and critic s t is because a lot of people both mails and female do not even realize that they have ctenidia and then they can carry clematis at the time in which they conceive in the that can lead to topic pregnancies and or miscarriages by all means get an it i check if you are somebody who seeking to conceive children or a valuating your fertility generally clematis can also have damaging effects on the epiditimus and on the very other aspects of man re productive health in the future we will do an episode all about sexual health this is not the time for that but get an s t i check if your goal is to conceive a healthy child now the other thing that can have a very negative impact on fertility and healthy pregnancy is a viral infection for instance if a male has had a severe viral illness and this can be any number of different viraillnesses from flue to could or any number of different viruses pic your favorite virus in the previous seventy to ninety days that can greatly diminish the number and or quality of sperm is that is really important this is also important i for on to going in do a spermanalysis and you had a viral infection in the previous seventy to ninety days within you en to be aware of that because it could greatly impact the parameters of that spermanalysis likewise for women if you have had a serious viral infection in the previous thirty days does that mean you should not trying conceive not necessarily but you should talk to your of g w n about that there are data showing that viral infection in particular of influenza in the mother in the first trimester of pregnancy has some correlation it is not a hundred per cent but some correlation with negative mental health outcomes of the offspring sometime later including skis arena this is some of the work that was done a calteck a number of years ago and other laboratories as well those data are still being built up over time again it is not one for one it is not causal if you did get an influenza cold or other kind of viral infection during the first trimester or any trimester pregnancy am i do not want to cause alarm but you should talk your be g y an about this the goal of course is to avoid viralillness at any t me the you are trying to conceive or have a healthy pregnancy but of course ism sometimes people get ill and the children can turn out to be perfectly normal and fine but it is somethingthat you want to avoid any will impact your analysis and it will impact spermanalsis now one thing i found really surprising and researching this episode was that one in twenty five men carry a copy of i mutation for cystic fibrosis now some of you are probably familiar with mystic fibrosis as a condition that can cause a issues with the lungs the accumulation of fluid in the lungs or other tissues mystic fibrosis in order to express that way of accumulation of fled in the lungs you really need two copies are you need two mutant copies or you need two copies of the cystic fibrosis gene one and twenty five men will carry just one copy and therefore will not have any symptoms of mystic fibrosis but those one and twenty five men will have defects in the architecture of the vast deference the dock through which the ejaculate needs to pass in order to eventually be ejaculated out of the urethra and what that means is that these men can have what appears to be normal semen volume but that they will not have normal numbers of sperm and that is not because of a depositing making the sperm the testes conjunction just find the brain and the pituitary communicating with the testis just find but that literally the passage way by which the sperm arrive within the seminal fluid and eventually ejaculate is deserrupted by the mystic fibrosis gene luckily if somebody has just one copy the mystic fibrosis gene and their male and this is the issue the vast deference either can be repaired by a neurologist to expert in the surgical repair of vaseference or sperm can be extracted from the tactical directly which a might sound a painful procedure but i a believe nowadays a in talking with various experts on this turns out that it can be done with a minimum of discomfort and certainly if the goal is to have a healthy child you a need those sperm sign want to get them a one way or the other regardless of the discomfort now before getting into some of the things that you can do in the positive sense to increase your fertility we do need to touch on just a few other things the want to avoid in order to avoid diminishing your fertility and this mainly relates to males but it will also be relevant to females and of course when i say also relevant of females ism referring to the fact that if it is a woman and a man wo are trying to conceive o then she of course is going to be interested in here quality but also the sperm quality and of course there are women who are conceiving by way of sperm done through iviaferiuie or otherwise but in any case the need to understand and maximize the quality both the egg and the sperm is paramount in order for men to maximize the quality of their sperm as i mention earlier does not seem to be a big difference whether or not they use boxers or briefs or wether or not they one to q go commando they do not where any boxers or briefs of any kind however it is important to keep the testicles cool enough they need to be about two degrees cooler then the rest of the body and their number of different ways to do that as i mention before avoid going in hot tubs during the period in which you are trying to conceive children you should also avoid going insane during the period in which you are trying to conceive children and if you do go in the sand you can bring an ice pack there an you can put it on the testicles in order to offset the heat of the sand and keep the testicles cool while in the sand the other thing the you will defy want to do is avoid putting a lap top or any other hot device directly on to your lap there are a number of different devices that you can put on your lap you you can but books are a box are there these devices there design to a dispel the heat from the lap top i would say if you are trying to conceive just keep the laptop off of your lap just put it on a table or standing best or whatever just keep it off of your lap also there are some really interesting data showing that the amount of time that men spend sitting regardless of whether not they sit with their ankle on their opposite knee or with knees spread in the classic manspread stance or a or any other kind of seated stance is going to increase the temperature of the scrotum for reasons that are somewhat obvious if you thing but the architecture of all this than both men and women if you put enough thought to it oh ye that would increase the temperature obviously avoid u seat heaters in cars are otherwise but reducing the total mount of time that you spend seated is really important if you want to keep the temperature milieu of the scrotum optimal for sperm quality and fertilization and as i mention earlier it is going to be important to make sure that your legs are not really big to the point where they are creating a hotter than is healthy environment for the scrotum in testicles a hotter than normal environment f the testicles can be caused by legs that are very large operthies that are very large due to obesity or do to those oprothizes being too muscular by all means do not skip legal but be aware that if you are somebody whose trying to conceive you want to do whatever you can to reduce the temperature of the scrotum or at least not let it get too hot for too long an a i can thing of all sorts of of a reasons now that men or gan o come up with to u do the manspread stance of their knees really far apart even further if they have large legs that is not a discussion we want to have here and that is not really what to day's discussion is about really the principle is what is most important which is to keep the temperature of the scrotum in testicles lower than the rest of your body there is a direct blood flow from the body to the testicle that provides blood fluids designed in a way that that blood pathway should be outside the body and as far away from the body is possible in order to get the temperature miller of the scrotum in testicle correct for healthy sperm quality now a topic that is sure to be a bit controversial but it really should not be because the data at least to me are very clear is this issue of pone use and sperm quality now this can open up a whole a ray of issues related to things e m is and you have got people out there have ideas about five g and all f the stuff that is not what this discussion is about the discussion i about to have with you relates to the fact that the electromagnetic fields an the heat related effects of smart phones can indeed have a detrimental effect on sperm quality and yes indeed on testosterone levels as well ism going to refer you to a paper and we will link it in the shownote captions the title his paper is effects of mobile phone usage on sperm quality no time dependent relationship on usage a systematic review and up dated metaanalsis is the paper that came out in twenty twenty one and talks about the fact that phones amid a radio frequency electromagnetic waves which are called called r f radio frequency e m is electromagnetic waves and a low level between eighty and to twenty two hundred megahertz that can be absorbed by the human body we know this soke this is not controversial and have potential adverse effects on brain heart entrant system in re productive function that has been established keep in mind there is basically no controversy that radio frequency waves and e m is can have a negative impact on biological tissues the question is how intend are those radio frequency waves and m is and how detrimental are those on those biological tissues of it is a matter of degrees but there is very little controversy as to whether not they have an effect on biological tissues and i am aware of absolutely zero data showing that they can have a plosive effect on biological tissues since what were mainly talking about now are smartphones we want o separate out the heat effects of smartphones from the m is relate to the felt that they are wife smart phones or their using cellar towers and why one or the other a commination case their number different things in the phone that can be detrimental we been to separate those out why well because you might have heard that carrying your phone in your pocket can reduce your testosterone levels and sperm count and guess what that is true the data contain within this metanalsies and other men and allies clearly point out that it can reduce sperm count and maybe testosterone levels significantly but certainly sperm count and motility significantly it reduces sperm quality should you avoid putting your phone in your pocket your certainly your front pocket i would suggest yes right if you are somebody who is seeking to conceive right ism not somebody who is going to stop using my smart phone i do not expect any ones against using the smartphone the question is should you carry in your front pocket if you are mail i think to be on the safe side the answer is probably avoid doing that too much of the time ideally do not to it at all then people say what would defy turn off the why my or i turn off the cellar access then is it still a problem well it is a problem due to the heat related effects and then people say well i do not actually feel the heat of the phone a does not get that warm but the temperature effects of the phone it turns out are enough even under conditions in which people do not report it to be uncomfortably warm that it can change the temperature million of the testicle in ways that can diminish sperm quality how much and how that relates to fertility and healthy pregnancy not clear but since we are talking about things to avoid if your goal is to have a healthy fertilization and pregnancy well then by all means just do not carry end in your front pocket than people shay will what about back poker what about backpack it is very clear that avoiding being too close to the phone is probably better for your sperm quality then putting the phone very close to your testicles or anywhere else on your both but it is also the reality that most people are going to carry a phone now days right it is just the reality i think allowing the current one estimates ans discussed in this paper that ninety per cent of the human population has a smart phone ninety per cent which is incredible the adult population of course i although lot a kids have them as well this paper goes on to detail a number of different studies and out comes from studies but easily what they find and here on paraphrasing is that ah the data indicate that sperm quality declines when people start using a mobilephone from the point they start using mobilphone regardless of the usage time this is important use to be thought that it was four hours a day or more of holding your phone or having that phone close to your body was going to diminish sperm quality it turns out that it is not related to usage chime that is even the title of the paper it is just the fact that people are using mobilephones is reducing sperm count and quality that is the reality is it entirely responsible for all the reductions and sperm quality and may be even the reductions in testosterone levels that we are observing from decade to get debate going forward i doubt that is the case is it likely to be one of the major players have got my that on the fact that it is based on the data that have observed and if any of you would to peruse the data in this mount metanalsis are quite good the study looked at eighteen studies in include forty two hundred and eighty samples they we are able to separate out the radio frequency verses the heat effects and they were able to eliminate this time of usage invariable that previously we thought if you were exposed to a lot of a sulphone contact that it was far worse than if your exposed to a little bit turns out of your suppose to any at all you are going to diminish sir quality what dos that mean does i mean that no matter what you do if you on a smart phone they are going to diminish sperm quality i think that short answer is yes but that you can mitigate it what might you do well keeping your phone away from your growing are as far from your growing as possible if your man whose wishing to conceived may be even a male whose wishing to maximize is testosterone levels because it does appear that radio frequency waves and the heat from the phone both of those factors independently end together of course can destruct the ludic cells of the testees an the production f testosterone and intertesticular testosterone is important for sperm production the exact biological variables leading all these changes is in exactly clear but if you are me you say probably not a problem for most mails to carry their phone but probably best i not carry i in the front pocket maybe even avoid carrying the back pocket as well again in e future we will have an episode all about blue tooth will talk about hem a various aspects of mama's its a super interesting a data set and it is a data set which there is a ton of controversy a it is a really interesting however and their more and more quality data coming out all the time and i think going forward we are going to see that indeed there are some negative effects of smart payphones related to both their radio frequency a transmission and the fact that they generate heat and in general heat is not good for biological tissues any discussion about heat and sperm and how heat is detrimental to sperm has to raise this issue of weather not cold is good for the testicle hokey well now there is a lot of date a starting to come out about the positive effects the positive biological effects of deliberate cold exposure on different aspects of brain biology such as the release of dooming in noropaneferan and on the biology the body to some extent metabolism but more the impact on brown fat stores which are good for us can brown fat or to genesis it lot related to deliberate cold exposure and we have done entire episodes on deliberate cold exposure again you can find that a superman labor tom we did a guest episode with an expert on the use of cold for health and performance with my collie crap heller from stamford departmentobiology we all have a tool kit on how to apply deliberate cold exposure for health for both females and formal's for sports performance cognac performance mood sleep et camera you can find all that again hubris labia call tolyzero cost go into the man you go to news latter and scroll down and you will find those when thinking about sperm quality we want to remember that excessive heat is bad now does that mean that deliberate cold is good well it turns out that one of the major causes of lowered sperm count and overall reduce sperm quality that is quite common is the presence of what is call t a verocell of vermicelli is on the varicose veins of the veins that enervate the testicle and what it essentially does is it means that blood will pool in the testicular region it cannot circulate back to the body quickly enough and therefore the temperature of that environment increases there is some other things tat vehicles do which can be obstructive at the physical levels the not just temperature related it is pretty clear that using deliberate cold exposure can be healthy for the sperm because of the ways not that cold directly supports testosterone or sperm quality but rather because cold reduces heat a you will find a available on line a the i think they are actually called a forgive me but that is what are called ad in name them led snowballs these are of a there sort of jell pack a cold briefs that a you can buy and and men will wear for some period of time i i do not think you wear them all day you wear them for some period of time lot of people are now using cold showers and ice baths and circulating cold baths are going into a cold ocean or lake for any number of the different reasons the talk about early re i myself start every day with either a one to three minute cold power or one tor three minute a immersion up to my neck in a cold bath cold a water circulating water or a cold shower i do that meanly for the psychological facts related to the longlasting increases in opening an epinephrin but there are other data starting to come out showing that that sort of approach or similar approach is can increase testosterone levels and may be even sperm counts can reduce coatis all late in the evening if the cold exposure is done early in the day sone and forth lot of interesting data coming out in really good journals there are pure reviewed and on in humans i should mention the studies are done in humans to support the use of deliberate cold exposure but again if you are going to use deliberate cold exposure to improve sperm quality can it work yes indeed it can work either indirectly by increasing to testosterone or directly by improving sperm quality but both of those effects are likely to be indirect by virtue of reducing the temperature of the tactical over all not because there is any sort of magic effect of cold on the tactical now i have to imagine that a number of you in particular females listening to this going to say is deliberate cold exposure and for that matter is deliberate heat exposure honor hot tub good or bad for the very for eggs and for fertility now there there fewer data to look to unfortunately but what we do know is that deliberate cold exposure done in the way that i just described one to three minutes to day ideally early in the day through cold shower or immersion up to the neck does not have to be nice bath could be cold circulating a water or even noncirculating cold water and people say well how cold i should o mention that before how cold there is no way i can tell you exactly how cold the water should be because for some people sixty degrees farenheihte will be exceedingly cold for other people forty degrees is going to be more appropriate how cold should you make it if you are going to embrace these practices you want to according to the literature what you want to do is make it uncomfortably cold such that you really want to get out but safe right you soft want to going to thirty degree water a immediately you can actually have a hart attack and die if you do that you want a progress gradually into the cold you don't want a shock your system too much although it is the adrenal and evoked by that that quickening or shortening or elimination of the breath for a short period of time when you get into a uncomfortably cold water that correlates with or is actually the reflection of would be more accurate to say the release of a adrenalin and then dopamine and forth which has been very well documented uncomfortably cold but safe to stay in and i cannot tell you an exact number that is in comfortably cold but say for you it is going to differ a person by person you want to figure that out just i cannot tell you how much weight that you should squat in order to achieve some effect of a resistance training for the legs that it is going to differ depending on a your strength in your prier experience and forth ease into it be safe but it does appear that both for men for reasons i talked about a feu minutes ago and for women that deliberate cold exposure can be beneficial for fertility and for hormone production but in particular for females in terms of regulating coatis all and for hormone production now you might say locate getting into cold is stressful how can that be helpful for regulating stress will turns out when you get into the cold you get a big surgeon adrenaline and then doom which is very long lasting provided that is done in the early part of the day i would say not too close to sleep then what you do as you restrict your maximum coatis all release to a period earlier in the day that buffers refuses that is the likelihood that you would have excessive amounts of coatis all later in the day which not only can disturb sleep but is correlated with a number of other a hormonal effects that are not good for us and therefor not good for fertility hear what ism describing are positive yet indirect effects of the cold on hormone levels both in males and in females for men we talked about increase tustocerone improve sperm quality that was indirect right your reducing the temperature of the tastable but it is not that cold itself is positively impacting those things does not make sense heat is bad therefor reducing temperature is good likewise with females deliberate cold exposure can be good for the overall fertility process not because cold is good for the very or been cold is good for the very or for utilizing hormone or for logical stimulating hormone or anything else that but rather that using deliberate cold exposure as a way to restrict stress in a deliberate way to a particular time of day increases the release of coatis all then and indirectly reduces the amount of coatis all that is released at other times along the twenty four hours cycle case to these are positive yet indirect effects if your woman who really a is interested in an exploring deliberate cold exposure or enjoys it or is already doing it in your wishing to conceive great explore it do it safely of course but explore in continued to do it however if your somebody who just hates the cold ins the on to go anywhere near it there is no reason to think that you absolutely need it provided the your stress your sleep and other factors are all being carried out properly the next things that will talk about and arms a positive things or things that we can do in order to maxims fertility for both females and males are the things that you also generally hereabout elsewhere right along with sleep and avoiding alcohol and avoiding nicotine and avoiding canvas wooding excessive heat for the testicle avoiding six of stress is that you want to try to get enough exercise i why i would exercise have anything to do with of this well exercise and that is both a commination of resistance training and cardiovascular exercise is going to improve the health of the metacondre in particular party of vascular exercise now realize that for you fitness experts out there any times one says cardie people cannot roll their eyes what is that there is endurance training there is interval training there is hit training there is springs there is all sorts of different things some of those overlap some of them are separate indeed that is the case but we can use a general rule of thumb here which is that for most people getting anywhere from thirty and ideally forty five to sixty minutes of exercise per day for six days per week maybeven seven but most people to take a day offer need to take a complete day off each week six to seven days per week is going to be good for might of conceal health and function it is also going to impact all the other things quality sleep mood reducing stress and on and forth exercise we can handle pretty quickly am by just saying everyone should be doing it a now what people are pregnant they might have to of course change the about of exercise or the type of exercise tot their doing their varying opinions on that but certainly the type of exercise and the amount can very when people are pregnant but if you are seeking to conceive getting enough exercises good because good for the mite conure the mitacondrea are present in that midregion of the sperm and mirror condylar critical for cromizomel segregation and the spindle and other aspects of the formation of a healthy egg population and fertilization in the female one thing that i know a lot of peopleare interested in nowadays is called intermit an fasting or time restricted feeding an let us be fair everybody is restricting theirfeeding time because hopefully everybody is sleeping at some point in the twenty for our cycle and nobody's eating while they are sleeping that said many people are employing a called eight hour feeding window or a ten hour feeding window or twelve hour feeding window and indeed there are some data to support the idea that that can be a good thing for a number of different biological an health perambiters however also a lot of data spershlly recently pointed the fact that your overall number of calories and the quality of your food sources is going to be the most important variable and some people simply find that time restricted feeding intermittent fasting as it also called is just a convenient way to insure that your total in take of calories is not excessive for what you need now with all that said there is evidence that have covered in a solo episode and will soon have an expert guessed on showing that time restricted feeding can have certain positive outcomes for various aspects of organ seller and tissue health a this is somewhat controversial but there is growing evidence that by restricting your feeding window to say eight hours or ten hours or twelve hours that it is better than if you were to eat over a longer period of of each twenty four hour cycle butacaine the date are still in coming the reason we want to talk about time restricted feeding interment fasting is that a lot of people do use it because they find it easier to not eat at certain periods of their twenty four hour cycle than to restrict calories but again keep in mind you after restrict calories of your goal is to maintain or lose weight a discussion that we have covered in that episode on interment fasting and in the episode with doctor my north and that we will cover in other episodes in the future prefer to those episodes that supermen laved at calm if you would to learn more about interment fasting per say for sake of this conversation a number f people are probably asking if i restrict my feeding to a certain window each twenty four hours because that is what is convenient or because i am excited about the potential posieffects of intermittent fasting is that going to sister up the likelihood of fertility and thereby a healthy pregnancy and the short answer to that is if you are a female and you are having regular menstrual cycles that is of fairly consistent duration maybe's twenty one days maybe's thirty five or anywhere in between but it is fairly consistent from month to month and you are following intermitted fasting time restricted feeding well then chances are pretty good the it is not disrupting your fertility and likelihood of fertilization and a healthy pregnancy of course during pregnancy you need to talk to your doctor and make sure that you are eating in a way that supportive both of you and of the developing feudist that is extremely important i am not aware of data exploring in a regimented way time restricted feeding during pregnancy hocus please please please if your pregnant do not jump on a time restricted feeding called interment fasting my talk to your obeguyen talk to your your doctor taltomultible doctors for that matter o before doing anything that because of course were now eating forth or if you have twins in their your eating for three an very important if however you are not yet pregnant and you want to be fertile get pregnant or simply maintain a fertile potential and biology your falling interment fasting it is going to be the regularity of those periods and regularity of cecal lengththat will tell you whether not that is a good idea or not keeping in mind of course that if your total number of calories is too low your periods will cease that is well known effect but of course stress can also induce cessation of menstruation and there are other factors that can induce cessation of menstruation as well some of them start with changes in the brain literally on the hypothalamus some occur in the pituitary many of distal factors can do that but most typically it is going to be excessive colonic restriction or it is going to be a color deficit brought on by excess physical activity even as some one's eating a lot if they're not eating enough to offset their physical activity or there not eating enough of in particular fats the essential fatiacids and proline but also carbohydrates well then menstruation conceal an of course if menstruation is teasing chances are almost with certainty that you are not getting regular populations now in terms of males and whether not intermittent fasting is going to disrupts from about genesis and testosterone production a there there is essentially no data we can look to but we can look to the general logic around the relationship between body fat testosterone and spermatigenesis in this with something that was covered in a discussion i had on optimization of hormone health for males that i had with doctor cold delete whose a medical doctor an obesity specialist can you find that episode o hubremen ladoccalm if you ane learn all about hormone opposition in males an essentially the story es as follows if a male is excessively over weight he is carrying too much body fat in particular not too much muscle although that cam nonissue to but too much body fat is typically the issue more then say twenty per cent body fat well then losing body fat is going to be the primary goal for maximizing testosterone sperm health and spermatigenesis if however a mails already lean well then actually increasing calories will increase testosterone it is a bit of a of a complicated story although not complicated that none of us can understand it basically if you are over weight you should focus on losing weight in order to maximize firm quality and health if you are very lean well then restricting your calories to the point where you are staring to lose weight or you are dropping even more body fat is unlikely to increase your testosterone further i does not it surly mean its bad or that you should not try and go for instance from fifteen per cent to them per cent body found noting that that is bad in that will reduce your testosterone but in general if your already very lean you ten per cent body fat five per cent body fat and you start restricting calories further your testosterone levels will drop in the contacts of interment fasting it is really not an issue of whether not your feeding window is eight hours or twelve hours it is really issue of wether not your getting enough calories to onset the physical demands and activities of your life ether not you are own a maintenance diet to maintain your weight and of course you have to put all that in the context of whether not your over weight or lean to begin with the simple thing to take away from this as if your man whose using because you it interment fasting local time orscerto feeding and your following in eight hour or maybeven one meal per day type of porch although i do not really recommend that for number reasons we to to about separately if you are eating over the course of eight or ten or twelve holds hours per day because a what works for you and you are ingesting enough carries to maintain your weight if you are already lean or you are ingesting fewer calories then you are burning in order to lose weight because you are already over weight and you want to lose body fat you are probably optimizing for all the things that you need to do in order to improve sperm quality and testosterone levels now also in that episode that i did with doctor calgalet on optimizing hormones for mails we talked about testosterone replacement thereby it is not a topic i want to get into in any detail right now but i will say this remember earlier when we were talking about fermata genesis and the fact that in order for sperm to be generated consistently every month on going from the time of puberty until essentially the time that a man dies you need two things you need testosterone production from the living cells of the testes and you need spermatagenesis to be supported by that androgen dining proving coming from the support cells from the dirtily cells you testosterone any need average an binding proline and you need the listen cells and the sirtolly cells active when men take erogenous meaning from outside the body testosterone either by cream or by patch or by pellets or more typically by injection the most typical heart preach nowadays is testosterone bipinnate which is biologically identical to the kind of testosterone you would make well be as of negative febacc louis which you also learned about earlier the testicles themselves shut down their own testosterone production why would that be o cs you are taking testosterone in by stranger by patch or on any other method these circulating testosterone in the amount that derives at the tetanal is going to be holy clinically appropriate not superphysiological but till be somewhere in the healthy reference range may be alibi higher om nowdasom people are going little but higher for not telling about full blown quotinqanabolic steroid use keeping minofcourse get estrogen is asteroid testosterone a story but won thing about stories demean performance an hanging drug superphysiological doses were talking about within physiological or or near physiological ranges someones in taking their testosterone in from an outside exogenous source the levels of circulating testosterone will be sufficiently high that the pituitary will register that and will stop making utilizing hormone and generally physical stimulating hormone as well and as a consequence spermatagenesis is vastly reduce or eliminated in other words for men who are on iterative or who are taking testosterone from an external source thou number of sperm that they are going to make its going to be dramatically reduce there are things that they can do to set that taking h c g human cryonic ganatropen just us kind of a mimic for utilizing hormones stimulate the testes continue to make testosterone and some men will also or instead take epitaph to stimulate the sertolicells support some after smart a spermary genesis excuse me or both or some commination somber well take clomophine climate there any number of different ways of a by pass or onset the sperm reducing effects of taking erogenic testosterone this is a conversation that was covered in a fair amount of detail n that episode with doctor delete but just keep in mind that if you are taking testosterone from an exogenous source your sperm counts will dramatically be reduce unless you due something to offset it if you are wishing to conceive you need to think about whether not your going to offset the testosterone replacement therapy or whether not your gingko come off it entirely you will need to talk to a neurologist and a chronologist about that om and again a number of these different themes and ways to go about tampering off tart recovered in that episode with doctor calgelette if your on torture you considering taking in in your interest in having children not just now but at any point you really want to take these things into consideration now i do want to point out that for the number of you out there who are taking supplements some of which wee talked about on this podcast inane talked about an other podcast such as tonga all turns out that their lot of men and women taking tonga all to reduce sexhormon dining globular levels to increase testosterone and estrogen in some cases libido and forth those approaches meaning supplement based approaches to increase testosterone or free testosterone or some related hormones are not going to shut down your own indigenous testosterone production and reduce the number sperm that you make or least as far as we know disrupt population in any kind of we provided that the dosages are within normal ranges again supplementation to support your hormones should not disrupt ovulation or s permatigenesis or testosterone production quite the opposite it should enhance it what i just described around heart as taking exogenous testosterone a that it self is an entirely different beast now with all of that said there are some supplements out there that include testosterone as a ingredient that is been snuck in to various formulas that include blends and things of that sort you want to be aware of that and we did an episode but how to develop a rational guide to supplementation i highly recommend listening to that episode on again its time stamped available free at huborman lapdog cam and all formats because it talks about which supplements are likely to be clean quoting quote to contain the things that you expect them to contain there is more or more evidence coming out that a lot of supplements including some om for instance a supplements that contain tactical or the extracts of testicles can contain testosterone whether or not that can shut down your own indigenous testosterone production is clear no one's really explored that detail but based on everything we just talk about a tear ta it stands to reason that it might either reduce it or shut it down it is just never been explored yet by all means make sure that what you are taking if you are taking supplements but again the major point here is that for both females and males taking supplements to support healthy hormone production including things tonga all is not the same as taking hormones or byoidentical hormones which indeed can shut down your own indigenous production of hormones and thereby reduce both egg quality and the chance of fertilization and healthy pregnancy and sperm quality and the chance of fertilization and healthy pregnancy anytime there is a discussion about fertility and pregnancy there seems to also be a parallel discussion about sex determination that is what factors can influent whether or not the child that is born is male or female that is whether not it has double ex chromosomes one ex chromosome for mom one ex chromosome from dad because the egg was fertilized by a sperm that had an ex sex chromosome that twenty throughchromozome or whether or not the offspring is male whether not has the ex chromosome from because it is always can be the ex chromosome in that egg and a why chromosome from the sperm that fertilized that particular egg now of course there are instances out there of people that have ex ex why chromosomes or ex why why chromosomes but the vast majority of people out there are going to have either an ex ex chromosome we call that a female carriotype night this is different than genotype and biotype but female carroty would be ex ex or a male cerotype which would be ex why open now despite the fact that it is the egg an the sperm and the chromosomes that they carry that are going to determine the cromazomes there is a lot of lore and discussion about the factors that can buy as which sperm will fertilize the egg and thereby whether not you arguing to get an o exams female or an ex why male cromazome and therefore offspring now not only is the lore around this whorish of sex determination a rather prominent but it is also somewhat unusual and a perhaps even interesting for instance aristate himself propose that if a man is thinking about himself and his own pleasure more then his partner and her pleasure at the point of ejaculation then the offspring will be male aristate also asserted that if a man is thinking more about his partner and her pleasure at the point in which he ejaculates well then the offspring would be female of course we have zero reason to believe that there is any truth to aristotle's theory there are no data to support that in fact ism not even sure how you would run that experiment because you cannot really look at people's thoughts you would have to rely on a honest self report and a even if people were to faithful report what they were thinking about at the moment of ejaculation this would evolve a course bring people into the laboratory and somehow a measuring or analyzing their thoughts or gathering their thoughts during the a sexual intercourse at the point of ejaculation than figuringale which a biological sex was the offspring et camera a just a near impossible and a probably not the most important experiment an to invest a time doing none the less there continues to be a lot of lore about what determines the sex of the offspring most notably there is a lot of are and discussion and rumor about the idea that particular sexual positions at the point of ejaculation during intercourse can somehow bus the likelihood that a pregnancy will be either resulting in male or female offspring now again there are zero data to support this and yet this whole notion of sex determination s a really interesting one that people seem to be somewhat obsessed by much that again if you go on line or if you were to talk to people in the sort of a let us call it wholistic or peripheral a health spaces related to fertility there is discussion about oke while you take this sexual position at the point of ejaculation to get a boy and you take that sexual position the point of ejaculation to get a girl are you do a you do this in the early part of the day or the later part of the day again all for which there is zero data to support any kind of systematic relationship between what i just discussed and the biological sex of the offspring that said there are now emerging methods that people are using in order to separate out the sperm that will indeed give rise to a male offspring verses a female offspring now this of course is done in the context of inventor fertilization we have not talk too much about inventor fertilization but invetrofertilization involves as the name suggests taking an egg and taking a sperm parring them in a dish this can be done a number of different ways a but just ta briefly describe the if a procedure if involves administering supra meaning greater than normal superphysiological levels of helical stimulating hormone and utilizing hormone during the follicular phase of a woman's cycle what that cause is the maturation of not just one egg that would be ovulated but multiple flicks and eggs and then ovulation itself is suppressed also through the administration of exogenous hormones and then under ultrasound guidance and obigiuean goes in and collects the mature eggs and flicks puts them in a dish and then sperm are delivered to that dish and those could either be sperm that were frozen previously or more typically or ideally it would be livesperm collected that day that are a washed through a very of straight forward procedure and then those sperm either are allowed to compete for those eggs and fertilized those eggs and allow them to advance to a very early embryo stage before those embryos are frozen and eventually implanted into a woman in order to have them be carried to full term ideally or there's a procedure in which specific sperm are selected because they have the best more apology motility and forth and in a process called xi i see s i in which the sperm themselves are literally force to fertilize that particular egg now under those conditions typically a couple or woman if she is doing this on heroine with a sperm done will get multiple fertilized embryos that are carried to a multimulti collier stage that it is clear that they could grow into a child if they were implanted into a viable host now sometimes the surugat sometimes the woman who ants the child herself and under those conditions it is possible to look at the genetic make up including the cerotype of those early nasonto embryos in which case people really can select the sects of their offspring that is they will have some embryos that are exes some embryos that are ex my it is very likely also that they will have some embryos that have karyotypes or genotypes which are not ideal in that they would potentially lead to a miscarriage or some other genetic defect and typically people do not select to implant those embryos if they have the option to implant embryos that are of either exams or ex my karyotype and the normal chromosome a arrangements the for obvious reasons the the whole point here is that sex selection is possible but only using in nitro fertilization the other thing that is becoming clear to us in more recent years is that sex selection is actually possible at the level of the sperm even prior to fertilization this is an emerging data set and this is largely happening in clinics outside of the united states but there are some clinics that have figured out methods in which they can take a sperm sample and they can spin that sperm sample in a center huge at a rate that separates out the sperm into what are called different fractions for those you done all bit of biology with subterfuges when you spin any kind of substance that includes multiple things in it of different weights when you spin them that things of different weight segregate out into different fractions along the depth of the tube and then you can take out one fraction or the next simply withelittle pipet you take out the top fraction the middle fraction and forth and what these clinics have figured out is that if they spin the sperm sample at the correct spin rate that the sperm that will give rise to male offspring and the sperm that will give rise to female offspring segregate out into different fractions allowing them to take each of those fraction separately and to apply them to eggs if it is inventor fertilization and give rise very reliably certainly much more than chance to either male or female embryos they also of course can choose to do this outside the contexts of inventor fertilization some people are now outing to have their sperm samples spun out in this way separate out the sperm they give rise to male or female offspring and then to only use the fraction that they are interested in rites if they want a boy though use one fraction they want a girl the use different fraction and then to use those fractions in the context of what is called i u or intriuteran insemination which is as the name suggest rather than having the man deliver the ejaculate with his penis and the sperm with his penis they have a a device the devices are now commercially sold leaven to their sold over the counter and on the internet if people even do this at home and what their doing is they will take the the sperm an they'll do i u i in order to bias the probability that they are going get a male or female offspring again this is something that is now emerging a it is not common place most of the time people a simply roll the dice as as it were a by having either a intercourse and just hoping for or not caring if they get a male or female offspring a or in the instance of give ye selecting male or female offspring sometimes largely on the basis of the chromosomal arrangements of course a some people might prefer to have one or the other biological sex as their offspring but of course the healthy chromosomal arrangements are going to be paramount for getting a healthy child and a as a mention before unhealthy chromosomal arrangements or abnormal chromosomal arrangements often lead to miscarriage or end or birth defects selecting for healthy chromosomal arrangements is always paramount but some people are selecting for biological see and indeed some couples who can conceive naturally are opting for i u i in order to be able to select biological see because of this ability to spin out the spermsamples to a different fractions and select the male or female sperm that is hat the sperm that would give rise to a male or female offspring this is a a rapidly emerging theme believe it or not a who knew a and of course it has nothing to do with aristotle's assertions about what people are thinking about at the point of ejaculation nor does the have anything to do with body position at the point of ejaculation but i do find it rather interesting that a even in this day in age people a seem to be continually pursuing new and different ways to understand why one sperm or another sperm happens to how fertilize the egg and when that information is not available because frankly it is not available yet we do not know why a sperm containing a why chromosome or sperm contain excromizomeis more likely to fertilize an egg en there is some ideas for instance that older fathers tan to have more daughters is opposed to sons but when you really look at the data it is pretty mixed if you have heard that an before a has a particular nickname that a ism not going t describe podcastican look it up on line but a if any of you are aware of any other a kind of ideals or lore no matter how ridiculous or crazy a please put them in the common section on you two be be very curious to learn about a those mostly out of a a interesting curiosity but look sometimes these outrageous stories such as a notions a body position and what how they influence biological sex even hough they turn out not to be true turn out to be interesting for other reasons and in fact next we are going to talk about how body position during sexual intercourse can in fact influence fertility and pregnancy another common theme around fertility in pregnancy that you will hear about is that for couples that are trying to get pregnant that during intercourse they should do whatever it is at works for them but then after the man ejaculates that the woman should try and position her ankles above her head or somehow otherwise tilt her pelvis back in order to increase the rate and or probability that the sperm swim toward the egg as opposed to the other direction now i talk to a couple of different of g ends and neurologists that are focus on fertility about this topic and it turns thou you get pretty mixed answers as to whether not there is any validity to this idea that the woman's body position after the man ejaculates inside of her can somehow influence the probability of pregnancy one group of experts told me that there is no reason for a woman to need to continue to lie down elevate the ankles or in anyway tilt her pelvis back in order to increase the probability of successful fertilization the other group suggested that indeed there is a strong reason to believe that tilting the pelvis back maybe even keeping the ankles elevated and having woman li on her back for about fifteen minutes with the pelvis position at about twenty degrees s back is ideal for optimizing fertilization i mean they were really specific about the recommendations i find this interesting that within the a cohort of extremely well trained eddies o i obiguens and neurology fertility to and obi guans you see a split has nothing in do with whether not the a the physician was male or female a were their training or their institution none of that but seem to be a sort of even split between the two now granted it was not the largest ample size that i couldhave obtained and yet i do find interesting that there is this a the split in the opinion about this one group the group that said no pelvic position does not really matter do not worry about it it is not an influence a the rates of fertilization argue that the sperm swim very quickly and that if they are released near the services that are going to swim very quickly toward the egg in order to fertilize it regardless of pelvic position the other group said well yes sperm swim quickly and even if there released right at the entry to the service that the sperm still have a long distance to go again if you were to scale this a according to the size of the spermversof size of a human body entire human body what you would a scale it to is the distance between lost angels and san francisco when it needs do undergo that basely within twenty four hours or although as we mention earlier superman service quite a while inside of the woman's body may be three or five days at least in both cases they acknowledging along distance but on the one hand you have a group of experts that are saying the sperm for less know what to do and are going to do it regardless of the position of the woman after ejaculation inside her and the other group saying no we want to do everything we can to bias the likelihood that the sperm will fertilize the egg ski well setting aside the basic argument that tilting back at the pelvis and lying stationary or for about fifteen minutes after sexual intercourse and ejaculation is not a a an expensive i endeavor although it requires a lit a bit of time a and indorses people to remain motionless or or close to motionless and they are not up up and around a moving able aside from that it said relatively low investment one argument is well if it could bias the likelihood of of fertilization at all and people want at pregnant why would not they do that o case that is a reasonable argument but doesn't really point to the mechanism the the arguments that point to a potential mechanism are that you recall what we were ting about we talk about sperm quality sperm quality involves a bunch one different measures concentration of sperm ferial leader seamen a more ology of those sperm how many are forward motile it turns out that in any one ejaculate sample the total number of forward motile and yet fast forward motile sperm that are also of the highest quality more ology is actually u it low and the idea here is that you want to get as many sperm of the highest qualities swimming toward the egg because those sperm stand the highest probability of fertilizing that egg in in fact this relates to some of the discussion we are having earlier about behavior old does and dots forsake of increasing the probability of fertilization and the one that is most important here is anabas turns out that the data on anabas really do support the idea that some of you may have heard from a parents and teachers i do not know i did to hear this from a apparent and teachers that a anabas can b disrupt the swimming stiles of sperm in in ways that are not supportive of fertilization that it can turn more of the perm into twitches altho when i learned about this i was not informed of the word twitches what i was told is that if you use anabas that the sperm do not know which direction to go that there confused a almost implying that the the sperm themselves are are high on anabas well that certainly not the argument that ism making here but it does seem to be the case that people who use anabas even wants the sperm that are generated during that particular month or two months during which are after which they use anabas have less forward motility and possibly altered morphology as well o a one o be very clear i did not say that if you use anabas wants you are for ever disrupting the motility and more prologue of your sperm i did not say that what i said is that if you use anabas wants than the sperm that are generated in the sixty days after that anabas use are going to have a higher incidents of disrupted motility and perhaps more apology as well o a remember sperm a continually generated every sixty days or and if you use anabas wants you are not forever disrupting your sperm but if you are using anabas and than you are looking to conceive in the next sixty days you are going to be reducing we think significantly the number of quality forwardly motile sperm the simple take away from this is avoid anabas use although if you are going to use anabas and again there are medical uses of anabas and beneficial uses of anabas for certain populations it can be bad for other populations we talked about that in the hubermanladpodcast all about anabas but if you are going to use anabas you should trying abstain from anabas in the two months prior to the attempt to fertilize and get pregnant now ism not aware of any data on how anabas use by the woman can influence the likelihood of fertilization and pregnancy and i want a couch this whole discussion around anabas under the umbrella of something that came up in the episode that i did on anabas which is that for about half of people out their mail and female o case of herein were not distinguishing a biological sex about half of people that use anabas reported as an aphrodisiac it makes them want to have sexual interior use more than if they do not use anabas and for the other half it actually has the opposite effect by way of an influence on a hormone call prolactin which suppresses the dooming system the testosterone and the estrogenic system and the whole idea that anabas is an aphrodisiac seems to be true for about half of the human population and not for the other half the human population i mention that because i know a number of people a use anabas as an aphrodisiac they to use anabas before intercourse was actually am very surprising to me to discover when i research that anabas episode that approximately fifteen one five per cent a women who are pregnant continue to use anabas during pregnancy and that is a very alarming statistic and everything we know is that the use of anabas during pregnancy is detrimental to the health in particular the brain development to the feeds that is a real concern i highly recommend women abstain from anabas use during pregnancy am talked here obguyan about it if you are using it all are considering using it all bassoon what i told you earlier about the fact that anabas use is not good for egg quality and the fact that anabas use can disrupt the motility of sperm and therefore is not good for sperm quality and it can disrupt the patterns of swimming in sperm an ways that reduce the likelihood of fertility i think the take o messages clear which is that whether not am you want to be a anabas user or not if you are going to trying conceive and certainly while your pregnant you are going to want to avoid the use of anabas and that is smote anabas and raped anabas and during pregnancy the consumption of anabas even an edible former in tincture form is also going to be detrimental to the developing feeds but of course we started this conversation in the context of body position in particular at the point of ejaculation in determining the ex of the offspring and or the likelihood of getting a successful fertilization and pregnancy and i think that given that the tilting back of the pelvis again this is elevating the pelvis by about twenty degrees thing has to be exact exact but about twenty degrees for about fifteen minutes post ejaculation inside of the the woman or spas if people are using i u a interutern insemination since that seems to be the consensus among those experts that believe that pelvic tilt backward can be beneficial for increasing the probability of fertilization and given that it involves no cost but a little bit of time seems to me that if you want to get pregnant that that would be the right thing to do and as far as i know there is no information nor was i able to obtain any recommendations from experts about what the ideal body position of the male is after ejaculation if the goal is to increase the probability of fertilization and pregnancy sweep been talking about behavioral interventions some dues and some dots that people can do to increase o fertility and the likelihood that any fertilized egg will be carried to term successfully and soon will also talk about things that people can take to improve their fertility now keep in mind that this entire discussion is about fertility but also remember as we discuss to the beginning of the episode trying to increase your fertility is one of the best ways to think about trying to create and maintain optimal physical health for people thy are trying to conceived for people who are not trying to conceive optimizing your fertility status with not your male or female it is one of the best ways to target those approaches and there are now lot of data supporting the idea that acupuncture of all things can be very beneficial for improving both female and male fertility and showed a woman get pregnant for improving the quality of outcomes that is the likelihood that there will be a successful pregnancy that is carried to term not premature and on and forth now for some of you out there you might think oh of course acupuncture acupuncture been known to work for thousands of years and for in it is not surprising that it would assist with fertility an pregnancy for many view out there however probably thinking acupuncture that seems and fringe science but what i can assure you is that there are now quite a few clinical trials funded by government agencies the national institutes of health showing that acupuncture is a very effective treatment for a number of different things including fertility an pregnancy but for hormone status for stress relief but even for chronic illnesses of different kinds including autoomian illnesses this is no longer considered fringe science in fact one of the best laboratories in the world working on this is a laboratory out of hazard medical school run by a guy name chufumam a chef's lab has really been exploring in a mechanistic way how the different stimulation sites that are used in acupuncture to wear the needles are inserted happen to neural pathways that link the different organs of the body for instance they have found that stimulation of a particular site on the lower limb can reduce inflammation thematically throughout the body by way of neural pathways that originate in the lower limb and extend to areas such as the kidney and the pancreas all these a quotical ancient maps of the human body as they relate to acupuncture are now being part that the level of mechanism which i think it is wonderful because in not only is showing us that much of what has been purported and reported in the landscape of acupuncture actually has an underlying mechanistic basis and with additional mechanistic understanding of course always arrive new and better practices that is the idea to evolve these fields of acupuncture to evolve the fields of mechanistic understanding of our biology and health and the issue of whether not acupuncture can assist in getting pregnant and in carrying a child to term and for that child to be healthy a are really starting to emerge in a major way and a rather than go into all those data in detail what i can tell you is that there are clinical trials and data supporting the f act that female fertility itself can be supported by acupuncture through several mechanisms one of which is the balancing and i realize that the somewhat tricky term and all define it better in a moment the balancing of hormones a cross the oblatory flashmenstral cycle including regulating levels of effete that there are not too high nor too low and restricting the effisates to the vehicular pase of the of the menstrual cycle as well as using acupuncture to improve things blood flow and the health of the very itself and other aspects of the female reproductive axis acupuncture can operate at the chemical level impacting hormones it can act at the mechanical level impacting the different tissues through which the egg has to pass and on and forth likewise on the male side acupuncture has been shown to improve seem in volume quality of sperm spermotility et camera and in large part through changes in the curl pathways that innervate the very tissues and vascular in put to the scrotum and testicles because as we learned earlier temperature regulation of the scrotum in testicles is vital forgetting healthy sperm and increasing sperm quality in addition there are good data to support the idea that acupuncture can increase levels of testosterone free testosterone and the sorts of hormones that are going to support healthy hormone production and sperm production in males and this is distinct from applying testosterone from an extogean is source right when mere talking about acupuncture in increasing levels of testasterom were take about increasing levels indigenous testosterone those lad excels can support the certify cells in the certify cells can make that andrigimbining proving and you get enhanced spermatigenesis you can find evidence for all of these different features both changes to the chemical milieu that is the hormones and changes the mechanical milieu including for instance improvement of the pathways leading from the luminiferous tubules to the epiditimus to the vast deference easily clearing out the plumbing that more quality ejaculate can be delivered which course is going to increase the probability of fertilization when you hear that acupuncture can improve the likelihood of pregnancy o that is an accurate statement for which the are now increasing amounts of mechanistic data if you want to learn more about how acupuncture can be use to contribute to improve fertilization an pregnancy their number different excellent reviews on this on both as it relates to females and as it relates to males om one of the best papers that i happen to is one that will provide a link to in the references entitled acupuncture and ruble medicine for female fertility and overview of systematic reviews a view of review of reviews this was publish recently in twenty twenty one will provide a link to that an om there is also going to be link to a review that relates to acupuncture for male fertility and hormone augmentation i should just mention briefly that if your going to look at scientific papers one thing that you will want to consider is also looking at the references that they reference and of course papers tender reference of too references in particular in reviews what you'll want to do as looked for the references that are showing out most often in the introduction those references often are going to be the most prominent recent reviews or the most important findings in recent years that is not always the case but that is often the case if you read the first couple of paragraphs o these papers and these are openly available is full full ten by the way on line if you go to these link you will be able to access the best papers the most relevant papers in the contexts of acupuncture supporting female and act puncture supporting male fertility and hormone status now i to discuss things that both men and women can take in order to maximize their fertility and again and again when were walkabout fertility were talking about people who want to conceive and have children but also were talking about a basic measure of over all health status you are somebody who does not want to conceive children i still encourage you to think about whether r not you would want to do certain things ore not doe certain things in order to maximize your fertility as a means to maximize your vitality and longevity because that is really what maximizing fertility is about for a lot of people that is said i know a lot of people would to conceive children perhaps not right away but in the future what ism about to describe are some tools and interventions that is things that one can take in order to improve their hormone status but also in particular the quality of their eggs and the quality of their sperm in the short and long term the first on the list of things that people can take in order to improve egg quality or sperm quality is ell carnations ell carnations is present in various foods in particular in red meats but again it is going to be very hard to get sufficient levels of let carnations to improve egg quality in sperm quail the unless your going to take it and supplement form the typical recommendation based on previewed studies they've shown significant improvements in egg quality that is cromizomal arrangements that is the likelihood of fertility or pregnancy rather the likelihood of sperm being forward fast swimmers as supposed to twitches are immotile on having propermore polity all those measures has bee demonstrate to be significantly improved by the ingestion of a carnations how much ell carnations wheat that depends on how you're obtaining the a carnations if you are obtaining it in causal form one to three grahams per day of causal form of carnations is what is been suggested to improve egg quality and sperm quality now one to three grahams per day can be taken all at once or spread out throughout the twenty for our cycle it can be taken with or without food does not seem to matter and when taken for a period of thirty to sixty days does seem to significularly improve all the parameters that have been discussed for egg quality and sperm quality now the mechanism for that effect is pretty clear ell carnations is involved in the pro sting of lipids fats in terms of mitacondreal function and as we talked about before mitacondrea are vital for the organization and action of the spindle that pulls apart the chromosomes taking that sell within the female from diploid to haploid which is essential you really want just the twenty three individual chromazalmo strands you do not want cromasalmo repeats is also involved in the actual fusion of the egg as it exits the very and enters the ovulation cycle maticondreare also important as we talked about before for the forward motility of sperm because the enrichment of mite condemn that mid region just behind the head the cause the whipping a coagulation of of the tail allowing for forward movement as well as other aspects of cellar and morphology makes a lot of sense as to why a carnations supplementation would be beneficial gain at to one to three grams per day over a period about thirty to sixty months if you are hoping to conceive in the upcoming months recommend taking it for least thirty days prior to that a of course based on the day ta we talked about before the cumulative probability to computability et camera there is no reason to not continue to try for pregnancy before taking a carnations but a continue is going to improve begin sperm quality and you might actually take the stance that even if you do not have any problem getting pregnant would not you want to maximize the quality of the egg that gets fertilized and the quality of the sperm that fertilizes that egg that is additional rational for taking a carnations one important note if you are going to take el carnations in oral form in capsule form it can increase something can t man t man can cause stiffening of the orders you do not want t ammo levels to go too high one way to offset the increases in t ammo cause by travel carnations is to take six hundred milligrams of garlic per day a you propose you could eat cloves of garlic that would work just as well because garlic contains something called malison which can offset the increase in t ammo but six hundred milligram capsids of garlic are going to be or garlic extract rather is going to be the most a probably costeffective and a simplest way to do this a an also they are going to create that garlic smell some people the smell of garlic some people do not if you are going to take oriel carnations i suggest also taking six hundredmiligrams to day of garlic extract and you can do that at any time throughout the day does not have to be with the a carnations the next item on the list of compounds that hade been shown to improve egg quality and sperm quality and quite robustly is coensi'm cute kill anti's cute is somethingthat you can actually measure levels of in your blood most physicians will say that they want to see your levels of coensim cute to be somewhere between point five and two point five it is on to depend on the units most people i realize her o can a run off and get their cocuten measured a it is not included in most standard blood ten but if you were to measure cocuten that is the range that you want to look for that said many people of to supplement with cocuten and you will find that many fertility do o be guans and neurologist that are trying to assisted mail patients with fertility will suggest cocuten because again it supports the health of mytocondreo manocondreo vital to many aspects of the formation and fertilization of the egg and sperm that of course fertilizes the egg the coenzyme cute dosages that are most often suggested and that you will observe in the pure re viewed research literature on humans i should add is one hundred to four hundred milligrams per day and the coensim cute is taken generally with a meal and ideally a meal that contains fat and there is even some idea that taking coensim cute with your dinner assuming that dinner includes some fat you do not have to add additional fat is going to be more advantageous an taking coins ism cut ten early in the day although that is probably a detail that is o getting a little too far down in the what get a hundred to four hundred milligrams of coenzyme cute per day whether not you are a man or woman for improving the likelihood of fertility by way of improving egg an sperm quality and again if your somebody who just does not have any prom getting pregnant or fears already producing many sperm of quality morphology this is another case in which you could take a step back into shy will why would not i want to further optimize the quality of the beg in the sperm because the quality of the egg in the sperm ultimately are going to determine not just whether not you have a successful pregnancy but are going to o determine admittedly in ways that will for ever remain critic to you but none the less are going to be important determining the qualities of the brain tissue in body tissue of your offspring the third item on the list of compounds which are commonly suggested or prescribed by fertility folks nowadays for men and women wishing to conceive and or optimize their fertility as a basis for general vitality and health is inositol knowing doctor has many uses you will hereabout the use of inositol for reducing anxiety or improving mood or even for the treatment of depression we talked about in social and previous episodes of this podcast a princes i talked about inositol and in particular taking nine hundred milligrams of mix and inositol prior to sleep which is something that i do along with the other supplements that i take an recommend fer sleep such as magnesium three in ate apigenan and feline if you're curious about those you can see our newsletter on sleep or are perfect your sleep episode or the master sleep episode tons of a behavioral and supplementation base tools for improving sleep but mow inositol is not just suggested for or prescribed for people that are wishing to get pregnant and for general health but my ow inositol is often recommended for people that want to improve egg inspire quality because of the way that it can positively impact insolent sensitivity insolent sensitivity might sound a bad thing a to people out there but it turns out that you want to be insolent sensitive the lasting you want is to be insolent insensitive insolent insensitivity is associate with tight tudibeties with o bit and even for people who are not challenge with city you want your sells to be insolent sensitive you do not want a lot of insolent floating around in your system with your cells unable to use that insolent that is really what insolent sensitivities about mix and coital at dosages of one to five grams per day pretty high one fie grams per day keeping o mind that a thousand milligrams is one gram has been suggested to improve beg quality an sperm quality now one point of a i count take caution but of note is that moon coital can reduce anxiety and it can be a slight sedative which is why a some folks including myself take almost gram nine hundred milligrams prior to sleep if your going to take five grams of my own coital you would want to restrict that to the late evening or second half of your day and i do not suggest starting that high would start with one or two grams and then working your way up seeing what you can tolerate o in terms of the level of a anta anxiety in drowsiness that it produces one to five grams per day of mix and coital is what suggested for both men and women wishing to improve beg health and sperm health but for women it is also often suggested to include also o case of to take moon coital but to also take de ciao in octal de ciao and coital has elements in it that can be both pro and anti androgenic androgen are things tastostron and related molecules there are a number different causes of infertility and destruction to equality age being the most significant factor but another significant and very common factor even among young women who are of fertile age is having too many androgen and as it relates to something call poly mystical vary centrum and we will do an entire episode about men of pas and vicious and a number of other things that relate to fertility because it is an entire and very interesting other discussion that we need to have but the recommendation is that women take one to five grams of mix and coital but also de ciao and coital because of the ways that it can balance androgen and offset some of the negative effects of polysistic o ovarian indium or even for women who do not have polysystical vary centrum because of the ways that de ciao and coital can balance androgen and ways that are beneficial the dosages of de ciao and city that are recommended ten to be one twenty fifth to one fortieth of the mix and ocitoldos you have to get out your calculator remember a thousand milligrams equals one gram figure out if you are taking one gram of mix and coital per day or two grams you are going to want to convert that to milligram t let thy yore taking two grams of moan coital per day that is two thousand milligrams than you would want to divide that by twenty five and that is how many milligrams of de iron coital you would want to take as well or you could go with the lower aldose and divide it by forty and take that number of milligrams of de iron coital along with the an coital again it'll be taking it later in the day is going to be good it is not clear at all that take get with food or without food makes any difference whatsoever i would suggest you do either keep in mind is ism ism discussing these recommendations i may call them prescriptions but none of these are prescription drugs and of course you should always discuss any supplements that your planning to take or stop taking for that matter with your physician i do not say that to protect me i say that to protect you you any time you are going to add or change something in your over all health regimen you wanted discuss that with your a trusted health care professional typically i would hope aboard certified empty the fourth item in the list of commonly suggested supplements for men and women wishing to optimize egg and sperm quality respectively is megathere fatiacids and now here we are talking out something that could be obtained from food and can be obtain from foods if your consuming a fatty ocean fish things a sardines anchovies satin with the skin chances are you are going to get some quality omega threes o megatheres are also available and plant base sources om ins also falling chill for that matter a but most people find it difficult to reach the threshold required for optimizing mental health and physical health that is the threshold of the e p a o central fatiacids and for that matter have suggested before in this podcast and many fertility docs will suggest that there patients take megathere fatiacids and supplement forming could be taken in liquid former and capsid form but enough of those that you are getting at least one gram per day of the e p a form of omega threes case at least one gram per day and as high as two or even three gram's per my of the e p a forms you will need to look at the packaging because oftentimes you will say high potencyomega threes i you will say in it fifteen hundred milligrams of omega threes but that is not fifteen helped hundred milligrams of the e p a form out look on the back to label and you will say each serving contain seven hundred fifty milligrams of e p a you want to get above that one gram dosage per day and as high as three gram per day of the e p s the most cost effective way to do that is going to be liquid formomegas but that is a lobe in convenient for many people in some people do not the taste that is why they rely on the capsid formomegas and of course there are compounds that can impact fertility status quality of eggs quality of sperm not by adjusting mitochondria or insolent sensitivity or creating a general miles of support for the egg in the sperm production and function such as the compounds that i just list it off do but rather compounds that influence the hormones involved in the generation of sperm in the generation of the eggs in solved in the ovulatory cycle in the permategenisicycle that is now these are going to come in different forms and i want just emphasize that the supplements that do this that a just hormones in these ways that could be beneficial are distinct from hormone therapy or by identical hormones of distinct from hormontherapy or identical hormones because as we discuss earlier when you take a hormone testastron or even estrogen for that matter from an exogenous and outside source you are going to disrupt the feed back pathways inside of your body and youregin a shut down your own indogionous production the supplements i about to describe do not do that and yet can adjust levels of hormones in more subtle ways that can be beneficial for the process of maximizing fertility for males and for females the first of which on this list that would to discuss has been discussed in previous podcast as well which is a substance called tonga all tonga all also goes by other names and but when taken at four hundred milligrams per day sometimes separate into two dosages typically taken as once a day early in the day because it be a little bit stimulating although not anxiety provoke m never heard of that can be lout stimulating but four under milligrams a day of tonga a has been shown to increase free testosterone by way of reducing something called sextormon boninglobulane its also been shown to increase utilizing hormone the net effect of which has been described as a subtle but significant increase in libido and some of the other parameters associated with increased androgen free testosterone in males and females in number people out there are taking tongaali in this way four hundred milligrams per day respected to the early part of the day with or without food people always asked you nide to cycle tonga all ism not aware of any need to cycle tonga all in fact it tends to work better meaning the effects on libido and some other hormone profiles tens to increase over time again tongaali is an option as certainly none of these things are requirements can were simply listing off options but many people both males and females seem to benefit from and tonga all even if they are not seeking to conceive there is no reason think that tonga all directly improves a er sperm quality except in males the increase in androgen created by tonga all supplementation canindeed lead to improved spermatigenesis there is a growing amount of data in this research larger on tongaali many people find it beneficial and it something that both men and women wishing to conceive and or optimize their fertility just as a general health perimeter might want to explore the other supplement that is been shown to improve both beg quality and sperm quality and there i am referring to a number different parameters relate to equality ans firm quality as well as to increase libido fairly substantially is a substance called shikari shikari a spelled es h i el a g i t shikari is actually a a compound that used in aromatic medicine but there some really good research studies exploring the supplementation with shikari at about two hundred fifteen milligrams twice per day and this has benlooked at a males and in females it does seem to significantly increase two hormones one is testosterone and the other is physical stimulating hormone and for that reason schilagi as often considered a tonic that people use both as an afrodigiac a increase libido as well as to increase fertility now one note of caution if your woman and you are considering taking shelly in order to increase testosterone and police stimulating hormone keep in mind that the ovulatory cycle is this very tightly regulated cycle in which you want low but elevated levels of logical stimulating hormone early in the follicular phase than it peaks right before ovulation and then low levels of logical stimulating hormone in the second half of your cycle for that reason using shielagi chronically around the entire course of your victory cycle could be a little but risky and it'd recommend that you nature a big wan a prior to doing that or if doing that at all for males it is a little but less of an issue because as i mentioned earlier sperm a constantly being generated and the presence of effasage is going to increase permatagenesis now shielagi is not effasage itself shelagi stimulates the release of eatage end it stimulates the release of testaceron again there is no reason to think that it would shut down your indogeonis tostaceroner ease production am although there are limited amount of data ththhav really explored that in details many people u shielagi in order to increase their testoceron effs age their libido and various aspects of sperm health the again the dosages of shelagi are about two hundred fifty telegrams two times per day one issue with sheelagi as it often comes as a as a tar whose little hard to measure out the dosages yes a tar its this am can of thick gummy substance that yous just to dissolve in water and the recommendations are you take a little bead and dissolved in water it is ofvalabe n capsid form where the ability to control the dosage as a lob a is made a lobe easier but of course as with any supplement i recommend starting with the lowest possible dosage you might as on o tart with a small very small bead of shelly a dissolved in water takin once pray and then increase the dosage as needed in order to obtain the effects that you want things shelagi start to a bring us into the realm of a wat can only be described as a little bit unwieldy right here were saying you cannot really control the dosage now your talking about hormones that need to be tightly regulated at least for females across the ovarian cycle for males yes it has been shown to increase testosterone and effs age improve spermotility and sperm count pretty significantly no reason to think that you could not do that chronically withsheelagi and yet i do want acknowledge that shelagi as this black tar substance is contains a lot of different things in fact it comes from a mineral pitch what is that its that comes from the literally the dirt an plants that have ben compressed by rocks in the hemal is pretty esoteric stuff when really comes down to it but the biological effects of shelagi in both males and female seem to be related to the fact that it is highly enrich and something called fulfil acid anfulvic acid is involved in a lot of different cellar processes not the least of which at least in this contact is the transport of molecules across cell membranes and for hormones to have their effect they need to crossbill membranes on the outside in the inside of the cell am maybe that is how its having its effect again the mechanisms of exactly how shelagi increases testosterone an epic age and thereby libido equality and sperm quality are not entirely clear but for a the more adventurous of you out there a one experiment which geology whether not you are trying to conceive or or not a it might be something to consider but of course do talk to your physician the next compound that i want an discuss is zinc and that this discussion mainly pertains to males although i a of course should point out that females should get the recommended daily a allowance of zinc each day males on the other hand seem to benefit from having additionally high levels of zinc intake now that can be obtained through foods you often here ow you now oysters are enriched in zinc and and the oysters are aphrodisiac i n know who is doing the marketing for oysters but it is it is really a terrific i think that seems to have persisted and a and maybe it is true a they are the oysters are en rich in zinc what is zinc do for fertility well in males we know based on a really nice set of studies that zinc dosages that are pretty high of about a hundred and twenty milligrams taken twice per day it's quite a lot with meals can significantly increase testosterone end hydra testosterone and this probably should not come as a surprise to us it turns out that zinc is highly enriched in human testes and in the testis of other animals including fish and other mammals in was actually in nineteen twenty one that it was observed in fish that zinc levels sky rocket in the testis of fish during their breeding season zinc is correlated with increases in breeding but you never know which direction that correlation is running turns out that zinc in both animals cling fish other mammals and in humans strongly impacts the cinematic functions in the testis including the function of androgen binding proline it seems that high levels of zinc can increase permatagenesis and testosterone levels very significantly this was explored in a really nice study that it'll provide a reference to its an older study i really that it is called effect of zinc administration on plasmostostostrone dihygra disctrone and sperm count this is but just one study among a many now a this dates back to nineteen eighty one but there been a study subsequently the point to the fact that supplementation with zinc at those high levels can really be a helpful in terms of increasing sperm count testosterone and even testicular size of all things one important point about taking zinc this hundred and twenty milligrams of zinc two times daily a defy near to be done with meals if you have ever taken zinc on an empty stomach even if you just take fifteen or thirty milligrams of zinc you can feel very noxious not well for a few hours to make sure that you are taking zinc with full meals this would mean that you are taking a in at least two full meals per day a i should also mention that zinc supplementation did not appear to impact ganatatrope in releasing hormone or prolactin it seems to be a fairly targeted effect on the testosterone and related pathways and male as far as i know there have not been systematic explorations of the effects of high levels of zinc administration on females i would hope that those studies would soon be done but meanwhile if your male an your interested in improving sperm quality and your testosterone levels over all for whatever reason zinc likely is a good candidate that pretty much summarizes the compounds that men and women should take in order to maximizes beg qualities firm quality and fertility and then of course we say to enter the landscape of other things that men and women can take in order to improve fertility and those other things generally are prescription drugs and i just want to mention what a few of those are but of course these are things that you would absolutely have to obtain prescriptions for from your m d and your my would without question would want to take blood test prior to prescribing these things for instance if men have been taking exogenous testosterone through the use of animal ex steroids performance in dancing drugs or even testosterone replacement the be their indigenous testosterone levels are going to be very low and their sperm counts are going to be very low unless for instance they are prescribed in taking something h c g human coring genatatropen which mimics elation would stimulate the testes to produce testosterone and through some indirect pathways a rescue spermatogenisis although not to the same degree as if people are not taking exogenous sources of testosterone some men even if they have never touched t it or exogenous testosterone of any kind will be prescribed to take h c g because of its ability to stimulate the testes produce more testosterone and sperms the is taking h c g alone other men will take or will be prescribed rather effesah in order to stimulate permatagensis or h c g and effesage or clomaphin which can regulate all sorts of things in the both testosterone and estrogen related pathways of the level of brain and pituitary and gonad testes likewise for women if their low ineffisage that might be prescribed visage if there are i low in utilizing hormone they might be prescribed h c g if the lointistosterone they might even be prescribed to stosteron and if their testoseronis too high and their dealing with vicious they might be prescribed antiandrgens and androgen blockers and on and on and on there are many different hormones that can impact the different aspects of the copulatory in this prmatagenisicycle that the be g we ends and the neurologists focus on male fertility nowadays really have an excellent handle on which levers and buttons and threads to pull in cushion and forth in order to set in motion of proper copulatory cycle and a proper spermanagenisicycle know everything we talked about up until now and an the early pase of this episode especially about how the brain commands the pituitary and the pituitary commends the gonads and then the gonads e very or the testes send feed back signals to the pituitary to them influence the petuitor all of that incredible orchestra of that dance is tightly regulated in a way that really provides the of g w ends and the fermi lityducts concern with male fertility exceptional tools to for instance figure out if a man is not producing any sperm but his testosterone levels are well within normal range well then therefore some very clear sets of explorations and potential treatments some of which are mechanical making sure the expeditious and vasdeferens are clear allowing the sperm enter the ejaculate the ejaculate enter the urethra an the obviously o to enter the female as well as for a woman who is not ovulating to a just her levels of effasage or maybe even to apply accupuncturin conjunction with supplementation end various prescription hormontherapies to adjust fertility and ovulation and the probability of successful pregnancy there is a vast landscape of prescription drugs and surgical interventions of varying degrees of evasiveness and some are for instance outpatioprecedures some require general antenna et camera in order to maximize male and female fertility what have tried to do today is to provide you with a deep dive understanding of the obulatorian menstrual cycle we talk about the brain the pituitary the very the pilopiantubes and infant the whole female reproductive axis as it relates to fertility and reproduction also describe the male reproductive axis as it relates to the brain the pituitary the gonad the testees and the various duck the pathways out of the testes that allow the sperm to be enrich within the seamen and than the semen and the ejaculate exit through the urethra i did all that as a way to frame the various tools and interventions that can really assist in increasing fertility equality and sperm quality when we discuss might to country in the contacts of the development of venge we the development of sperm in its ability to swim quickly forward now it should make sense as to why given intervention whether or not its ell carnations or whether or not its exercise or whether notes getting enough sleep an limiting stress while that should matter and why in fact mechanistically those interventions can work because indeed there are many interventions that we can all do and use to support are fertility and again as a more general theme to day i really wanted to a teach you about the human reproductive axis do you find the biology of the oblatory and menstrual cycle and spermanagens is to be absolutely fascinating to me and again if you are somebody who's interested in conceiving or already conceive children and even if you do not want more children this is really the aspect of our biology that allowed us to be here it is the aspect of our biology that determined whether not we are male or female it is the aspect of our biology that determines much and yet i think that most of us generally are not taught this in school r at least not at the depth we discussed it to day hopefully that information was in an of itself interesting and perhaps useful as well and i do think that even if people are not wishing to conceive more children that the information related to fertility and of amazing egg and sperm health is of value in the sense that optimizing egg and sperm health can be used as a proxy for optimizing our body and brain health generally in other words and here i admittedly taking a words out of the mouths of the various wonderful doctors the obeli weans in urologists that helped a inform in intimation of this episode what is good for the woman is good for the egg and for fertility and pregnancy and what is good for the man is good for the quality and production of sperm and for fertility and pregnancy put differently whether not we are male or female the things that we can do to optimize our fertility are the exact same things that we should all be doing to optimize our vitality and our longevity i realize today's episode was much the deep dive and a fairly broad as well that it ended up being fairly long and extensive and yet we still have not touched on any of the important themes that i know a number of people want to know about for instants menopause andrupaus p c o s and other themes related to hormones and reproductive function and biology and i promise that we will have episodes both solo episodes and episodes with expert guests in the future to cover all of those topics in detail meanwhile the information discussed in to day's episode should serve as a basic foundation for those discussions going forward and hopefully were of interest to you in their own right if your learning from under enjoying this podcast please

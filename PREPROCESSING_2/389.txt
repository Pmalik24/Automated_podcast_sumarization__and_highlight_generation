let us get to answering your questions and as always i will strive to be as accurate as possible as thorough as possible and yet as concise as possible the first question to day is about adaptogens some of you may have heard of adaptogens ism guessing many of you have not heard of adaptogens the strict definition of adaptogens is still evolving meaning no one really knows what adaptagens mean and what is included in adaptogens in what is excluded from adaptogens but the most common definition of an adapted is a compound that is typically a supplement or a drug although it could be a behavior if you really think about it that helps you adapt and buffer stress when you hereabout adaptogens there three man categories of adaptogens that come to mind the first or things that are contained in food these would be vitamins or micronutrient that one could easily find in food but one would have to consume a fairly restricted number or type of foods in order to obtain those things or consume a lot of those foods in order to get sufficient dosages of those adaptygen compounds in order to buffer stress some good examples of these would be any kind of vitamin either water soluble or fat soluble that can a just or reduced what are called reactive oxygen species another that is what gives rise to this idea that anti oxygen are good for us now over the last ten years or there is been a shift what shift has occurred well about ten years ago you often heard about antioxygens antigens antigens incitements antigens than this food this supercool at camera and why were people talking about antigens will just remind you reactive ox get species are types of reactions and molecules that occurring cells when cells get stressed and or age an antioxygens are the compounds that reduce those reactive oxygen species reactive oxygen species are bad for cells because they tend to hinder the function of mite cornea which are associate with energy production in those cells what a we know for shore we know that as cells get older or as any cellar biological system organ tissue et camera get stressed a lot over time the number of reactive oxygen species increases in those cells and tissues and organs an antioxygens which can include certain siemens but also some micro nutrients are effective in reducing those reactive oxygen species now what is occurred over the last ten years is that we know that reactive oxygen species are a major source of depending cellar function by way of to pleading mitochondrial function but they are just one of many mechanisms that can to let cellar function mitochondrial functions nowadays you will hereabout reactive oxygen species an antigens but not as much as you use to now you hear a lot more about inflammatory responses and inflammatory sidakinds also be in an issue and the truth is all of these things are an issue going back to this question about adaptogens adaptogens include these three categories have told you the first which are the items and micronutrient that are contained in food that can reduce reactive oxygen species and other aspects of cellar stress such as inflammatory cidakids what are some of those things that occur in foods well in order to answer that less just thing about what sorts of foods themselves can act as adaptogens it is commonly held that the day leafy greens time foods for those view that eat plants i thing themajority of people out their do eat plants i know that the carnivore diet and lindies and on some other diets tend to exclude plants hm it will address that in briefly at some point om into day's discussion but dark leafy greens are known to contain a number of compounds in the form of vitamins and micronutrient that are very effective in reducing reactive oxygen species and inflammatory side kinds f your somebody who interested in adaptogens and adaptogenic processes reducing stress and buffering stress which of course has its roll in offering daily stress in order to help you sleep better to improve cellar function for longevity sports performance connive performance that is all good and it make sense why people would be interested adaptogens but remember that the two main adaptygens that you should think to first are going to be behaviors and nutrition have started with nutrition on purpose she menu ill get to behaviors in a moment you are interested in adaptogens at all i highly recommend that you include at least two to four servings of dark leafy greens and or cruciferous vegetables per day thing that be highly advantageous and just beware that excessively heating dark leafy greens or cruciferous vegetables can actually destroy of the very nutrias o micrnutrians that actin an adaptagenic way that does not mean that you need to eat robbrockly or colly flower just the thought of that makes me cautious it is very hard to digest some people might that are can digest it a more easily than others it is perfectly fined to cook you are cruciferous vegetables and day leafy greens but you do not want to overcook them what is overcooking and what is a under cooking there is a no strict cut off in terms of temperature but basely what the literature says is that if you heat vegetables to the point where the colored fluid is leeching out of them into a broth type a in no into water or o whatever fluid surrounds them well then you would be well off to ingest that fluid as well because it contained in the the water were the fluid that is leeching out from the cruciferous vegetables or from the dark leafy greens are gong to be a lot of those very adaptagenic molecules that your interested in the first place o case i probably surprise some people by starting off my answer to the question of what are adaptagens are they worth thinking about in pursuing and if how can i get them by talking about food but i think it is important understand that u can get a lot of adaptagens from food and indeed some of the best adaptagens do come from dark leafy greens in cruciferous vegetables be remiss i din a mention that the other two categories of adaptions are going to be supplement based adaptions and then behavioral adaptagencs again here adaptation to find is anything that can buffer stress in a substantial or meaningful way in order to support cellar health organ health and over all daily living and and functioning including sleep in performance in mental health the second category of adapted you are going to be supplements and here again i just want to take a step back make sure that we are clear about our operational definition about what a supplement is we had an episode all about how to design a rational guide to supplementation which included for example the idea that for some people the optimal dosage of many supplements is going to be zero and for other people the dosage will be something else but to really pinpoint the key message from that episode that it'd to reiterate now but the but a key message from that episode that it'd to reiterate now is that many people think of supplements as just vitamin supplements and for that reason you will often hear the arguments all are not supplements just expensive urine could not you get all of that from food are not you just urinating out all the water soluble vitamins and maybe even storing excess amounts o the fat soluble fitments in a way that is unhealthy or not cost effective and on when we talk about supplements yes it can include vitamin supplements however there are many compounds that we would describe as supplements that are not vitamin supplements and that you could not obtain from food or that you could never obtain from food in sufficient enough qualities to have a robust positive biological effect without consuming enormous number of calories ere overriding your you are got a mechanically for instance if there were say am herb and will talk about such herbs in a moment that contained an effective add toxin but you would never want to eat the plant itself or include that herb in any kind of recipe will then chances are this herb which will define in a moment is not a vitamin supplement it is probably not even best thought of as a supplement it is best thought of as a compound that sold over the counter much a prescription drug although it is not prescription it does not require prescription to get it there are lot of things that that we include under the umbrella of this word supplements and unfortunately because of that a lot of people think o you do not need supplements and of course you do not need supplements per say but many people do derive tremendous benefit from them in the contacts of adaptations there are two or three in particular that can be very beneficial for buffering the stress response especially over short periods of time of about two to three weeks when would you use these well for instance if you are in a particularly stressful mode of life either because of family or relational or school or work demands or new kid in the house or any number of different things or you have been ill or your recovering from injury taking an adaptation in the form of supplement can actually be very useful for buffering this hormone and the general systems is associate with called cortical it is very healthy to have high levels of cortical early in the day shortly after you wake up and then that ought to taper off toward the afternoon and evening however if quarters all is chronically elevated throughout the day or if that peak in cortical is arriving too late in the day that is known to be associated with mental health and physical health issues has been shown by labs it stamford and elsewhere been shown an animal models and in humans talk many times before walrus remind you again the one of the beltways to restrict that cortesall peak to the early part of the day is to get morning sunlight in your eyes as soon as you can once the sun is up get outside facing the direction the son even on over cast days do not were sunglasses look at it for five to thirty minutes definitely blink see do not damage your eyes on and forth why five minutes or thirty minutes will five minutes on a clear day should be sufficient longer would be fine again blink that you protect your eyes blink as needed facing the general direction the sun on days when you have a lot of overcast or ts really de dart dense cloud cover will then you would want to be outside longer and if you do not have access to sunlight for whatever reason than you want to do the same thing with bright artificial lights indoors am either called sad lamp or otherwise that is a great way to restrict that cortical peak to early in the day but even if you are doing that if you have a stressful life for whatever reason even if you are getting that morning sunlight which i hope you are you are getting your exercises you are trying to sleep better a and more as we all should most of the time well then your you may be somebody who wants to take a adaptation in the form of a supplement and the three supplements that can be very effective in buffering cortical are asheagonda which ill talk about first lions main and change lines man an chadar in the a fungi a group they count as mushrooms they are not psychedelic mushrooms the talk about ashwegon to first aschueganda is at the top of the list because it is indeed a very potent a daptagen how can i say that well there are number studies now including of several excellent ones in humans that report that taking two doses of three hundred milligrams of aschueganda per day can very dramatically buffer coatis all this is something that you would have a near impossible time accessing from food i cannot imagine that unless your cooking with the very sources of aschweganda am an extracting exact amounts that you be able to get this in any other form except a supplement form here menage us briefly reference o paper and we can provide o reference to a reference long to this that is am this is a a paper from twenty twelve that is had a lot of of excellent follow up papers that support it the title of the paper is a perspective randomize double blind placebo controlled study of safety in efficacy of high concentration o full spectrum extract of aschweganto root in reducing stress and anxiety in adults and it is a really nice study not a huge subject pool but both men and women and is carried out for long enough that they got to see some really interesting results and the the am i think that the most interesting result is that taking three hundred milligrams of aschweganda twice a day led to enormous i mean just enormous changes in serum coatis all am the statistical significance of that they observed in the study was really a fantastic am it fantastically a high statistical significance they saw the facts of aschweganda on day fifteen having initiated the the aschwegande i consumption on on day one of course day thirty in day forty five and again this was dramatic reductions in stress as perceived by people o subjective stress and parts all level aschwegona is very patient reducing cartisall how would you recapitulate this if if you wanted to use aschweganda do buffrestress wile a couple of key points mentioned earlier that you want your quarts all piss come earlier in the day therefore you would not want to buffer corps all early in the day in fact carts all piking early in the day provides in anti in lavatory immune supporting focus and mood supporting effect all day long i would recommend that people take the first dose of aschwegande anywhere from two hundred and fifty to three hundred milligrams sometime in the early afternoon and that gain in the evening as supposed to taking a morning dose in an afternoon dose also if you're somebody whose exercising forsake of trying to induce adaptations hypertrophy the growth of muscles or strength or improve your endurance in any way muscular endurance or more traditional cart of vascular endurance then i recommend that you not take your aschueganda prior to exercise because part of the adaptation response is triggered by increases in carts all during exercise sort of in the same way that some of the best adaptations to exercise or reduction in blood pressure and resting heart a t and those are stimulated by increases in blood pressure and increases in tartrate during exercise that is just how these biological systems work the take away as pretty simple if your interested in amusing oshwagandais an adaptation i would restricted to later in the day if you can and not before exercise divided into two doses of two hundred fifty to three hundred milligrams a that is a what this paper and other papers it a seem o indicate and then a very important final point about ashwagonda which is that if you are going to take oshuaganda i recommend not taking it for longer than a month and a half as they did in this study in fact i would suggests that you only take oshwaganda around periods of an of moderate to extreme stress what is moderate what is extreme is going to depend on what you are going through only how much stress and life events you can tolerate if you have had trouble sleeping and that is unusual for you your dealing with a very difficult life circumstances or your excessive work demand or a new kid as i mentioned before it will then buffering stress with oshwaganda buffering quartesall in the afternoon and evening can be very beneficial for you but then i would say after about a thirty days maximum i would take at least two to four weeks off two weeks is probably enough but four weeks off because you do not want to chronicle buffer carts all it is just not a good idea but that said i think oschwaganda is a very powerful adaptation i place at the populist of supplement based adaptagens but keep in mind that even if you are taking a supplement based adapted that is no reason to abandon the nutrition and behavioral type a adaptagenic effects that you can create through eating darkly fee greens crucifers vegetables the will talk about behaviors in a moment the other two supplement based adaptedgons as i mention are lions main mushroom and change and a i get asked a lot about lines main in hag for sake of a there purported rolls in acting as neurotics as quoting smart drugs there are fewer data on the beneficial rolls of lines man ain change for sake of a neurotic effects a do in a entire episode on neurotics at some point but a there have been a few studies showing that lions made in supplementation and an change supplementation can improve memory and maybe even divergent thinking associate with cat creativity and things of that sort again these are not psychedelic mushrooms a that said there are good data showing that a thousand milligrams that is one gram of lions main per day and or of these i will talk about the and or portion a women and or change mushroom at five hundred to fifteen hundred milligrams per day can act as adaptations in again reducing sort is all but also and mainly reducing some of the anta an inflammatory psytakinds that are known to circulate in high abundance when you are under a lot of psychological and or physical stress things intrlucan six and some related molecules here is what i would recommend if you are a interested n exploring adaptadgens ism a big fan as some of you probably know you heard that episode on rational gad to supplementation ism a big fan of mainly focussing on taking supplements in single ingredient formulations that you can figure out what dosages are best for you and that you can ogle in and out those adaptations as needed i of course amazon of taking certain blends and mixes the one that we talk about a lot on this podcast a and we have been a sponsor for the beginning have taken for a decade now long be for ever had a podcast is that let it greens which some of you might note does contain some ashuegandal though the levels of aschueganda that are contain in athletic greens are low enough that i do not see any issue would taking a athletic greens a consistently day to day every day because you're not getting anywhere near that six hundred milligram dosage but the ideas that if you are going to take any adaptation forsake of buffering stress over the short term say for a week or two weeks or a month and then taking that a recommended time off i would start with aschueganda and then if you feel you need something else to buffer stress keeping your mine of course that you are doing the behavioral the nutritional things to buffer stress as well you can never abandon those right well then i would suggest adding a thousand milligrams or a thousand milligrams of chap per day and being how that further a benefits your your system in terms of buffering stress how would you measure if your stress as being reduced well you are going to be sleeping better at night you are going to feel subjectively better lower levels of anxiety all the things that are measured in the types of studies i describe before ow of course there is nothing preventing you from taking six hundred milligrams of ashwaganda gram of lines man and a gram of change know some people to just cone to go a full distant everything but i am a big believer in really trying to isolate which supplements and molecules work best for you and which ones do not do you need to cycle on and off lions man in change ism not aware of any data showing that you do if however you are taking them every day i recommend that you cycle off them after a period of thirty days or and i want to be very clear about this just because hi said cycle off after a period of thirty days or does not mean that you cannot take them for a shorter period of time for instance if that you're coming up on a big week of stress well then you could take ashueganda and or lions may n and or change for that week or just that week are heading into that week were in the following week and then stop there is no reason why yo could not take them even just for one day although the the effects ten to be a bit cumulative at least come we are talking about a buffering anxiety in terms of buffering quarters all that is a very potent effect that as far as we know is going to take place on day one again keep that quarters all buffering effect away from exercise at least do not take it before exercise and trying buffer your quarters all in the afternoon in evening and this is assuming that your working a conventional shift and you are not up all night and sleeping all day for sake of a a shift work can o hopefully that clarifies things about what a daptugens are in fact i never actually red the specific question but i think have touched on a number of of issues that relate to the specific question and then it'll answer that the last portion of the answer of this question in a moment a as it relates to behavioral tools that can act as adaptagens of the question itself was there is a lot to mixed information about out there about adaptegens ashuagond and i think that relates to what i said earlier which is that the definition of an adaptagen has not rely been cemented a in a various a communities it is different in different communities and its of generally a used a as a matter of convenience rather than really strictly defining what it is and hopefully we have defined it a accurately in and broadly enough to day as something that buffers stress om the second part of the question was what does the scientific evidence say about adapted in the ability to mediate body stress response they say quite a lot and they they say that the stress response can be buffered substantially by certain adaptagens mainly darkleyfigreens cruciferous vegetables a ashuagonda linesman and change and of course all the behavioral things that are critical will list off in a moment and then the third portion of the question is is there any sold evidence that has an effect on burro transmitters or the h p which is part of the o stressmodulation acts the best evidence is that adaptegens can reduce cortical itself there is very little evidence that adapteggens can directly modulate narrow transmitters or nauromadulators dopamean ceratonan et camera but by a busting the timing and levels of coatis all especially in the afternoon in evening that is going to have indirect effects on levels of dopamine nor up and efferent etscetera an ceratonan but not direct effects the general contour that makes for an ideal diurnal schedule y heard of nocturnal wire the pass diurnal being awaitturin the daytime and sleep at night the ideal and of landscape of her transmitters is higher levels of dopamine nor up an veteran ineprneperan in the early parts day and cortical called catacomb in dopamine nor up an effort an epinefran and high levels of coatis all early in the day as directed by sunlight exercise caffeine hydration movement all that stuff being awaken busy an outside or indoors with bright lights and moving about in the early part of the day and into the early after nuts the best possible way that we are aware of to try and get those catacomb means released at the highest levels in the early part of the day and then the ideal contour of a twenty four hour csc will be in the later half of the day the evening and night time you have higher levels of things serotonin the gauge ex system all the things that are somewhat sedative in preparing you for sleep and lower levels of the catacolameans an cortical as i described before to directly once of the question is there any evidence that adaptegens can alter your narrow transmitters yes but only indirectly and yet that indirect control over narrow transmitters is substantial and is important and if you do what i described such as getting morning sunlight an ideally you would get obit a deliberate cold water exposure by the way to bust adrenaline and nor norpanefrnan dopamine those catacolmines early in the day o quick one minute cold shower even or three minute cold shower or you've access to an nice bath early in the day lissome sunlight does not matter which one you do first doing that early in the day is really going to create that peak of coatis all demean pin for an early in the day i cannot emphasize how beneficial all of that can be om and exercise if you can early in the day some people cannot exercise till later in the dad rather seep people exercise later in the day that not at all provided it does not disrupt their night time sleep which of course sleep is the foundation of mental heal physical health in performance yes there is modulation nor transfers but most of those are downstream of the effects on quarts all that we been talking about we have define nutritional adaptagens supplement based tadaptegens although i do not really the word supplements any more unless we're taiga out vehement supplements for reasons we talked about earlier and then there is the third category of adaptagens which are the behavioral tools that you can use to buffer stress which qualifies those as an adaptation i think it is really important that we always keep in mine the yes their supplements yester prescription drugs out there in fact their prescription drugs that you can get from a doctor that will potently zero out your cortical but most doctors are very reluctant to prescribe those drugs because coatis all provides a very important and functional roll early in the day behaviors are very effective it reducing coatis all what are the most effective behaviors to reduce cartisall well we talked about one to restrict coatis all the early part of the day which is viewing morning sunlight but how would you buffer coatis all on the late afternoon it is going to be all the things associate with reducing stress for instance ten minutes or even my laboratory another laboratories have shown it is even five minutes a day of just what would be called mindfulness meditation very simple you do not need to over complicate this you could use a great a the waking up a or another a of that sort or you can simply sit down eyes closed breathe through your nose and just concentrate on your breathing every time your mind drifts to om the olsbring it back to your breathing that is shown to reduce stress you could do a five minute deliberate breastwork practice my laboratory is publish some work related to that am the breastwork practice could be any number of things the two that i recommend the most would be double in had followed by a full exhale and then repeat for a period of five minutes known to substantially reduce anxiety stress and the various physiological systems associated with arousal you could also use box breathing inhale hold exhale hold for equal durations for a period of five minutes we will substantially reduce stress ism a big fan as many of of yoganedra which involves no movement it involves just lying there listening to a script lots of yoga dry scripts available on line if you are not interested in the intentions and other things including yoganedra you can buffer stress using an adaptation an sit a non sleep deep breast if your interesting trying these ism sorts of things there is a a an s d r protocol that is ten minutes long just put my name supermen and an it r into the search brows a on you tube and virtual is provided and a an it r that is completely zero cops and works very well for reducing stress it also teach your system and teach you how to am learn to fall asleep better at night any of those practices five to ten minute breathing practice or meditation or a a amnesty are yoganedrum if you can do longer twenty or thirty minute in the afternoon that is known to buffer charts all substantially as well any time your en countering stress in real time i highly recommend a tool over and over because it is effective the fastest way we know to buffer stress and calm down is the called physiological sigh big inhale through the nose till your lungs are empty but then sneak in a little bit more air byes second in hail maximilian late the lungs than a long exhale until your lungs are empty one to three of those will reduce your stress substantially over time that should reduce that is buffer your parts all acting as an adapting her'rea lot of thingsyoucoul take a hot bat to cut take a hot shower you can listen to some pleasant music anything that reduces your stress technically is an adaptadgen i hope i thoroughly i answered your question by a yours i mean this of course his answers going out to all of you this was a question that was asked by justice bevelaqua i hope i pronounce that correctly justice man thank you for that question i think their lot of people interest in adaptions now you can use nutrition such as chrucipher's vegetables directly my greens and i should also mention if you are not in jesting enough calories each day well then you are going to be in a mild mode of stress that is not to say that some people should not take in fever calories than they burn in order to lose weight some people really need to do that for their health or for whatever other reason but if you restrict calories too much you are going to increase carts all output keep that in mine in just sufficient calories for you and for your goals aim to get dark leafy greens and chruciphers vegetables do not overcook them if you want explore supplements the best supplements to act as adaptegins are going to be oshueganda lines man and change one or to or three of those although if your going to pick one it'd recommend oschuegonda six hundred milligrams pray taken in later half the day and then they're the behavioral tools ha we just talked about now which are anything they reduces stress can reduce carts all and in doing are technically adapters if you want to no more behavioral tools an other tools for adjusting stress and learn more about adaptedgins we did a whole episode call mastering stress s you can look to that it that episode also pretty clearly defines i i to think what short term medium vermin long term stress really are keep in mind stresses part o life learning how to work with it how to dance with it how to buffer it is terrific but zeroing out coatis all is not the goal the goal is to learn to modulate in control your quarts all and that is really what adaptagens are all about thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode do hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anythinsessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the superman labor cast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else please go to superman labor calm slash premium just to remind you why we launch the superman lapocast premium channel truly twofold first of all it is to raise support for the standard superman labpodcast channel which of course will still be continued to be released every money in full length we are not going to change the format or anything about the standard superman labpodcast and to fund research in particular research done on human being not animal models but on human beings which ha we all agrees a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is time toward developing further protocols for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all channels not just the premium channel but through all channels superman podcast and other medium channels the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides that whose kinds of answers in the first place now in especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance if you to sign up for the humeral lab premium channel again there is a cost of ten dollars per month or you can pay one hundred dollars up front for the entire year that will give you access to all the a m as you can ask questions and get answers to your questions and you will of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well there will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the a m as and various transcripts and protocols of superman labpodcast episodes newfound elsewhere and again you will be supporting research for mental health physical health and performance you can sign up for the premium channel by going to superman labor calm slash premium again that superman labor calm slash premium and as always thank you for your interest in sins

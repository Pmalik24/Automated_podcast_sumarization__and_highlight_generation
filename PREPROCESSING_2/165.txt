of the show in the billboard when she was growing up her father was was not he is not a fun dad a he himself had been orphan in shanghai when he was twelve he was raised in poverty and because of that he was just this this is pennypinture does even captured his miserly they did not celebrate christian he never took his children to dinner land even though it was less than an hour away from their home i therefore no real vacations sandbar tells this story of once she bought a book of chilly brown comics for a dollar at book fare and herd father threw it across the room furious at how she had wasted money he he was restrict but at sandbar found ourisently not everyone in the world sees her father the way she does there is a kind of news that your never prepared for and here last week was mine a friend told me that incredibly a local grunge band had composed a rock anthem about my dad and was performing it to great response an mambo aria clubs the group in question was called boy hits car and the song a wailing roc free do cur powered by pearl jam rifts was in fact called mister low the actual cover of the boy hits car demote was a grainy zerac'sd photo of a tiny wise seventy sixureold chines man gunning on a marabou beach in tattered swim trunks which was indeed my father i have to admit however that the mister low in the song was not wen i was familiar with a seeing through the eyes of life guards last singer crag on dell mister low is a mistecol dreamy figure who whins naked among the dolphins in the duality that characterize a certain times of rock poetry i reminded of the doors the natural dance mister low does on the beach brings the listener comfort while at the same time poses o profound spiritual challenge s is n so es tea the a s asses a n stand n san and s n my first instinct was that this had to be a sic froidian joke when of my siblings was playing on me as in what is the most wildly unlikely most frock with amazing drones most wacky sixty peter sellers shown thing you can imagine could happen to our family but no my father was these marabou mirror his german he was there wallet i decided to meet them cragrondelle base plarscot manille in guitars louis heard were all too happy to come into a studio and explain how their song came to be that was one day at the beach and there about five of us just sitting in the sand is talking mister low came casually walking up and and he was staying there for just ay me three seconds without saying anything an we cantle we and then he said you are old victims of modern technology i my start think house i a that in o deepen then in just started to talk to us saying throughout the conversation instant singing that is where the song the premise finding cameo you remember when you first saw my father i it's it timor dengue's fall everlyememris but it was in nineteen seventy eight at the big fire came our house burned down and removed m late west and i remember seeing mister low stretching naked and then taking a shower outside naked and at the b at the beach and i thought has kind of funny but non a bad way i thought it was interested was my first memory o we i to had some memories am ever since that been at that beach i awes since i basin person five six seven a years old ha stand there i not some can some sods in the sander do not had stands against the wall is a was naked as well a what did you talking to these guys uh it suddenly occurred to me who my dad really is how every neighborhood has its eccentric the cant lady the parent man the find with the umbrella hat an recycling cart who yells well in my southern californium home town maybe west my dad is that person it is an unsettling thing to realize about one of your own parents and be ha behind misters back he was known as the naked can sandman ears tin m a mi a i as a ante very aft e the song s song wan you me the then si o on if an on si no o there is a naked handstands in site yes of course there is a naked hand stand mans song unbelievably mister low song and recorded was only the late and a decade long esthetic exploration of my father on the part of boy hits a car basis shot maxwell as the i was walking down reach one day tans testa than an i happen to her the his way tastes to to tan there is i a man we o o ins ta anta e and is names was ta lo tans ta can tat he is ta the there wits tanks and that tans tan tan that he is the naked ans and and than ans an that's lo as to o i ta i well i invited my father to join me in the band in the studios he does not really see all the fuss about his nakedness for them buying staffer that tad for you visa which i wen the too in the man swimming pool everybody is naked because that is the most si hi genic most actin thing to do you see but if some young people when to see his nakedness is a symbol of something more important well my father's happy to be of service the way i discovered is tape was this one thin may be complement the glad hitchhike and the couple you man pick me up the i miss lo we hear that tabs about you in the oh i see this rascal they i tax the and it is very i an a i feel the happy me onto know robot if they don write any son about me robin nobody a ever write about me this i my li a yes that is not true to as have made my career writing about o s you see ut you see yon the writing i appreciate that too but you the something different that tats her precious for me we of course with all due respect to the members of boy hits car in my opinion my father is the least likely candidate to become a symbol of individual freedom of spiritual introspection of the healing powers of nature after all this is a man who believed all three of his children should get codes in engineering or else they would starve in the street then again all these things may be a matter of personal interpretation you see my father's nakedness as kind of that rebellion of some sorter no not actually i a son yes just he is be natural i feel that he as a ability to go beyond the general startup that america holds in that regard and is free contact i name that is very important nodi the society as bus busy busy bus but no much time in the talk you say a talk in the a you in nature but did you incronjous i remember suits if you encouraged us to do that oh yes an when a o we we do money things we always cool a on ti so my beech to the lobbing you cannot to collect those illumine cans and we compete to with the fandemaden's family not the going t not to put too fine a point on it but a come tuition to collect cans for spare change is not the sort of communing with nature say while wit men an rape made emersion extoll which brings me to another point i have to say there is something sort of point about sitting in a room full of young people who are hanging on to my father's every word he is an odd little voodoo they is apostles god knows he never got that from my sister brother a me at one point for reasons too complicated to explain here my father sang the boys in the band a chines fix song that he had translated into french i may they tons ye lo y were you were you crying i my say tears were coming why y why i as his dutiful as is in unkinder we expression of something i is fathers towering i just cabin it chis renew why not sing another one if this makes my father happy well then i guess it'll try to be happy for him o or and sames to a sins sass him y so mi a just a shaman tansamswdet the a the scripting beckon i have it o i when to give the beckon it sonde sing louis a writer performer composer an colors was mi island twenty twenty three tastes we ran i am jumping in to say that sand actually has in comedy called mad women of the west as winning at the goddess theatre sandal was right now that mister a that a few years ago at the age ninth six and the bandit life performance of the song at his way s she get when i things that you often complain to me about about stories tat you here on public radios that is that their too long how we doing far how long was that story just total the total story is about it i eleven minutes it's a pretty long piece too long touching i think it is to did your interest flag i know my interest in i slow down however if i were listening to the show at home with other distractions around it might to awful little bit in that i something a back ti back too father's music tad was for this i act i asked you to bring in an example of the kinds of music that you my father used to play around the house when i was kit cause you had musicgoing you whenever you were home when we cents and absolute lo at whit which would you being it well i brought a three grandson atroceetese right on scan can we can you just choose a song and

a cat or anything a define not this like a happy birthday i thinking what next my at its definitely from the dad's point of view it is about being a father he and brown recounted the forecast ta shutter we did in font of live audience no one drive fashionably late for seven year old birthday party that offended rule one of parental life never waste free baby sitting but all seven guests at my daughter whale's seventh birthday party we are dropped off by their parents mysteriously seven minutes early that sort of behavior is just playing rude it was being swarmed by a gang from planet tiny they dropped their coats in the hall an immediately scattered to the farthest corners of the house some new instantly contagious form of biological weapon i staggered upstairs with a small mountain of coats in my arms which is not a chore i saw myself performing back when i was young and longing to be grown up even when i was eleven i wanted to be married because married people i knew had secs every night of their lives that is another story i was logging coats back downstairs trash the mother of city valley's best friend two best friends ago trash shot me a knowing look magician wrist how can you tell i said fiber optic was by the forks that was the first hint that my wife and i might have gone slightly over the top birthday wive that we might have stepped over the strict moral boundary that separates carrying thoughtful parents who who believe in personal attention and quality time from cheeseballs us who tried to buy their way into their children hearts it is easy to commit that social gas these days my wife and i both work the harder we work the guiltier we feel the more we want daily's birthday parties to be well visible from outer space would be gratifying we would been planning valley's seventh birthday ore to be slightly more accurate my wife johnny had been planning it and it'd been doing nothing for weeks what there was was a cake iced by professionals in the shape of a magician's top hat which cost thirty bucks eight lumbago filled with thoughtful age appropriate peanut free party favors at fifteen dollars a bag and of course the magician himself hat a hundred fifty dollars for two hours he called himself the amazing robot i do not think he meant that ironically no i to do some especial on hall's birthday still do not you think i said to my wife is she frantically tried to find a magician who was not booked three months in advance do not you think we might be over camping but honey if we do not go slightly crazy john said quite logically some other parent will then what is pelican a think and anyway do you have a better idea and i did not have a better idea my sole contribution to the magician party had been to suggest that we include a whoop cushion in every postbag or or at least it was my idea to blow them up and put them in the lumbago preinflated in the old days when half was small we kept her birthday simple i learned that lesson when i lived in loss angels near every hills in every hill's parents their children birthday parties to have a theme and a very significant theme at that manifest destiny say or or a ass of moonshot in else i never went to a birthday party that featured anything less than pony rides in one mother actually gave out gootchee tea shirts in the loot bags it was hard to compete with that in an act of defiance of friend of ours a struggling river staged her daughter's birthday in a park of all places is had a good enough time they ran around and swung on swings and played tag and generally revelled in a whole two hours when they were not under the watchful eye of nanny or armed response security the grab bags contained what grab bags are supposed to contain candy rather than role watches afterwards the severely hill's parents flocked and literally flocked round our friend fabulous idea they said nature who would have fought can i steal a theme but our friend gathering is the queen of the less is more easy on mummy birthday party she says children want strong experiences not new ones which is why last week and for her daughter many seventh birthday gathering invited seven six girls over to string gummy bears on to extra long bamboo sate steers that was the theme of the party steering candies on a stick there was some risk of i injury and the entire mimic seemed to have rowdy an undertones the little girls kept saying ism going to stick this skewer up mammy's tiny but and giggling hysterically but all in all it was a winner only one girl barfed the entire party cast fifteen bucks canada it is true that gathering had a pineta piñatas are excellent because they entail hitting an object violently with a stick those where the old are bacchanalian birthdays by the ti daily turned five the year of our most corrupt and therefore most successful birthday we gone as low as a parent can go we would hired human baby for three hundred dollars human baby dressed up in full sized versions of baby all outfits and came to your house human baby arrived in a dodge gran caravan with human midge her assistant two giant moral racks of party dresses for the girls a the set in a case a two chests of make up she dressed the kids discussed the possibility of multiple careers and fed them cake all our friends were completely horrific i might as well have said oh this were daily's having a party we are having a cake made of crack to my canada friends put this crassness down to the fact that john my wife is an america but successful while it was as if the deli lama had made o stop at our house the girls were hit times with awe they spent most of the afternoon standing in a circle brushing human baby's her i had the feeling that secretly quite a few mums would not have minded giving it to try themselves as it turned out i need not have worried about the amazing robbery the magician either he was a a handsome guy with side burns an a an a my if somewhat resigned manner he knew what hews doing though he he started cracking jokes with the kids right away you must be daily said to one of the boys as he walked through the door no peter said i am a boy and clapped his hands hay the magician said no clapping to all the kids clapped i said no clapping by the time he start o pulling eggs out of their noses they were goners i chose that moment to run upstairs i find i need a moment alone at regular intervals at these kitty birthday bashes also at adult parties in fact i could use a moment alone right about now but when i opened the door to my bedroom what do i find lying lying on my bed surrounded by entire mountain ranges of miniature winter coats two of my adult guests holding hands their spouses were downstairs i must say they played at cool he headache the woman said rubbing her temples not that i asked said these kids parties can be brutal i tell you i left ask i did not one to ask i certainly did not want to know downstairs the amazing robot was making cards disappear and rapper batch baby's mum she kept staring at the magician i thought she disapproved of his tricks but then she gave a little shriek i know she said i knew i knew that magician he has just come through a terrible divorce from a birthday clown it pretty much said at all does not at it is terrible getting older the disappointments and the let downs but no child believes that they want to get older if you are seven you cannot wait to be nine me nine that is going to be the great it because they think life just gets better and better and better the older you get we grown ups we know better or we think we do or at least we need to think we do but i did not have much time for such marlin thoughts frankly convoluted once because a new sound was was wafting in from the living room a sound it is frankly impossible to be maudlin about they would found the loot bags crass sure cheesy absolutely grown up not at all that is what i liked about it an n

landing in three steps down and there was something crooked about them one of the steps that i went off at an angle that was a an iron railing along the way not very pretty now i looked out the window and watched dad packing his car and then driving away at that time what kind of car would it had been well he had bought a little sports car because his car was in the the grads in the shop and he had wont away till it was ready would you have been two or three days later and he bought a little car that he could leave right away and he told me he was leaving on a trip across the country because

he done it i was angry that he had not ever taken can in me a you and me on a trip rand he was walking down the steps away from me and he was hiring two down suitcases o put them in his jeep back when they still see wills on his side and he drove away a little while before he left that day he knelt down in front of me and tightened my belt from me i have a picture of that his has were bank bigger than mine will ever be farmer's hands or a ball players hands and he is pinching the belt want e titer and san something i remain ay i feel then i feel bad about all it it sort of gaps run but i was

and if you is a several years of memories you o at heart well is the snapshot of his doing your belt up for you when you were probably three or four an you were for when he left went you and do not member er exactly what the version was it was in had to men falling i be cause i member takin at pictures of you nsubuwekin we gettingether you her and was all honor an he is pinching the belt gently tighter o hon hunccannot back out the word a picture it was black and white and shows me standing there three years old in front of the big window that let the monochrome pitzburg light into the living a light o stock you all of a hod burn to smell hi steel in that city had burned the color out of the air and it reflects off his hair which is sooth with my talks and shows his strong jaw and the depths of his dark eyes you was no abuse in that household harsh words than i could her as not father any more and my mother sobbing over the dishes in the sink what do you think you would have done after he had packed up his car and left what would have been your reaction that i might have observed oh you probably saw me sad and mournful but then turning back to the house and and i trying to look cheerful but i also felt i also felt abandoned that i felt that it was de the end of a marriage and o my hopes for a marriage the end of a my hopes for family for you and me and he left us but i also felt as he drove out of sight well thank goodness what a sense of relief i am free of all that abuse and misunderstanding and bad feeling that have been going on for long and it least i could be me now and and not try to be something that somebody else was making me be e i pet up with my doing and a on coming out of it sot of a commination of my own you maturity restless is ti satisfaction a in late in hopes and expectation and i think can i guess i at just felt that i had never it'd never had any he and of freedom course i mean i never and ad never really found freedom afterward you a you where you got a change your light and and one behold your life turned out to be about am i was three and leaned over my bed which was narrow and told me this do not think this change is anything but dad's moving out and what i remember is telling him that it was not o say i did not want him to tell you first and he an wan me to tell you first we did it together and i remember i knew it was a a terrible blow for you i do not remember telling you with her ah you were in bad member and at least a a this is picture in my mind and in that little room a i a map high and i i came in an night and i ad i started to say something like an i going to be o leaving in whatever i was is going to say and you were somehow knew what was coming it was not o we and you and a i do not want to hear it and

when i when i when i walked own o your bedroom that night yet am tat was really a a i made your turning point my might and a an night and i do not know to this day whether it was a a good real r your when my father left my bed i was a turning point for me too it was the moment i moved outside the with of the america family left it and became a part of something else something was no affirming mythology to look forward to m i rest his memory t day to look back ani became a part of divorce which was the death of the familyand i turned down a path less well want less well but i unlike my father no longer wonder if it was for good or for ill adjusted r of car well i think that's about it a this well on the a i for father's day a i i to wish wish you happy father's day ow think you you

this next try is on is about a father and son the father was is a was this pretty well known man here in chicagol named names d oily he was an actor here and a director o from the nineteen sixty trough h nineteen eighties and om among people went to theatre just you knows wealthy soap everybody knew he is artistic director of the body politic theatre in the court theatre and om he was not a must reliable dad and his son a is a guide named beau oily who is a play wright and local musician and a stages the lot of theatre here in town and a and beau has this story about om about his father including a moment in their lives when they did reconcile in a way when i was a little kid five or six my fat r would do these big variety shows these musical reveals for college theatre groups and i would often appear with him playing the bad kitten tone or the clowns greeting the lines of this old man from the top of a step later and at the shows end we would rush first to the back when my father knew all the girl names and then to the train station to ketch the last trained home and i would get very tense then an an hot and my stomach i was gin a burn up an pass out z we would often missed the last trained home and have to spend the long hours till morning waiting in the train station my father falling quickly asleep is huge he thrown back in the train waiting from see it seemed to hang at an impossible odd angle from the rest of his body the dot at the bottom of a question mark that knows it hes to be there but hangs od an in a watched and this seen my father drunk and snoring of big question mark one presence wood be repeated numbers of times over the next twenty five years my father passed out at the family tabling aristas morning my father coding off behind the feel my father snoring through the still satin mass my father's head thrown back in the last roll during my highschool production of the last manager but when he was away he was not totally present either he wiz as silent brooding man home once a week for a family dinner and i would set up all night in that train station listening to the muted rumblings of the next mornings desolengions an the fluttering of pinions in the ceiling above my fathers snoring made rusty and noisy by two much cigarette san peer when i was twenty nine something change between me and my father i was twenty nine very drunk to stayed and i came home to shucago to work for my father i guess i had rarely seen him in my alcoholic adulthood his alcoholcadulted having taking him away from the family circle years ago and when my father he got me this job as o house manager and sometimes under study at his theater on mean avenue and he wiz warming kind about it i guess this kindness was unusual was hard for me to recognize that i did not know whether it was kindness reeler a not maybe he jest recognized something in my swaying walk and my overly bright told way of speaking a kindred alcoholic spirit we wood from then on do our drinking together late nights at the pub next door to the theater o job were we could sit for hours get a burger an a bear y fob we my father ran a tab and i was always on the tad now the pub tables were family long with my father always at the head an crowded with actors and confidence all with one ear pointed at my father hoping for a good joke from him which usually came or some word o praise which came rarer but when delivered were always delivered with a flare an a passion these tables wood start full full people an huge pints of black ginned an brown beer but by one or two in the morning they would be emptyexcept for my father and i me talking loud an feverish now lovers an women an broken harts and politics an plays and broken harts and lost lovers and lost him an an broken harts and me doing most of the talking my father nodding and grimacing looking appropriately sad but his eyes looking away always scanning the bodies of the young women who moved about on the jobs waiting hours sometimes these women stopped by the table to speak to my father hi finding flyways to kiss and touch and pinch them walking their eyes with his as if his eyes were gift enough to allow him his in appropriate touching the father would close with us still in it the tables having adopted the chairs and now holding the piggy back and my father would signed his tad with a flourish and we would part company me often watching him walk slowly up lion avenue a large man with a lordly old fashioned hid always aware that he was something out of shakespeare or on yell he might be swaying but swaying with a charm and a dignity the further my father got up the street the more real he felt to me there there that was the father i knew half a court yard away unto the hot lights doing shakespeare's leer or breckscall was and i would stand on bacon avenue crying crying of a twenty nine year old drunken baby of father is moving away always moving away and that baby knows he is better off having dead go i learned lot watching my father's theater that year wonderful productions an playboy the western world and royally hardwood the dresser bring feels translations my father's performances were always in the center of of the play and i was the hossemanager i was skittish an a buggy suit an non matching vintage ties greeting the audience of the door sewing them

on a professional stage there would be one rehearsal my father not even on stage but seated in the audience chain smoking hung over barking orders orders that move my body hot and frightened clumsily around the state me mumbling the lines and standing in all the wrong places and the night of the performance i was pacing and shaking in the hall outside of the green room where my father and the rest of the cast were making up and preparing to perform i could hear them talking but they could not see me at all they didn't know i was there and one of the after said with a good actors projection and promise actors striction get ready for amateur night what did you say my father set a quietly but with for get ready for amateur night well he will be fin you worry about yourself prick now this is

it is this america life from w easy chico am sudan burton sitting in for i last to day therefore these videos have been watching victims a female politicians telling very personal stories here is one of them even word it shows wretched whither she is now the governor of michigan but she is speaking here a few years ago and she was a member of the state legislature have it it before and i will say it again this is by far one of the most mesachinisit proposals have ever seen in the michican legislature writer's explaining why she is losing no on a bill that would forbid women from using insurance to cover abortions unless they bout separate abortion insurance what whiter calls rape insurance and for those of you who want to act a last that it'd use a term rape in durance to describe the proposal here in front of us you should be even more offended that it is absolutely accurate description of what this proposal requires this tells women that were rate and became to met that they should have thought i had and bought special insurance for it she is been talking for several minutes when suddenly she stops sets her papers down have a lot more prepared remarks here but i think it's important for me to just ventured a couple face ism about to tell you something that have not share with many people in my wife but over twenty years ago i was a victim of rate i thank got it did not result in a pregnancy is i cannot imagine going through what i went through and then been to consider what to do about an unwanted pregnant from an a tacker the whole time wither talks she grips the sides of the lecture her face looks she is in pain i have not enjoin talking about it it is something have hidden for a long time but i think you meed to see the face of the women that you are impacting by this for to day i have set by comments be my noble explanation my no vote explanation she says whiter story was not plan she said later that she decided to tell her secret in that moment standing at the light as soon as she left the floor and got into re car whiter called her father she would never told him that she would been rate she did not want him to hear about it on the news that night she had not expected to tell the misshican legislature before she told him i wondered if the call to her father was harder i think it sometimes easier to tell a secret in public than in private safer to have that distance when i first saw writers veto a year ago i was on the verge of revealing a secret in a very public way in a book that was about to be published it'd written a memoir about my eating disorder and until recently that eating disorder it had been a secret from every one in my life sometimes people say every one and then follow it with an accept except my mam an my best friend i really do mean every one not even my husband knew and we would been together for twenty five years it'd never talked about it and it'd also never been in therapy for it when i finally did see help i was forty five in the very first session my therapist trying to get the story strait i may be just trying to get me to hear how absurd the sounds said you wrote a whole book about this but you have never talked about it with any one that was right it'd gone to see the therapist partly because it did seem kind of must up to me when i done i knew it was just as urgent to under stand my relationship with secrets as my relationship with food that is where i was when i watch whiter speech thinking a lot about secrets and why we tell them and the form they take when we do what made whiter speech powerful was that her secret was not just a confession it was an argument it was told to persuade i was moved by her video and i went looking for others it of course politicians tell personal stories and speeches all the time but disclosing something you have kept private for years and doing it in a legislative session sometimes spontaneously that is pretty knew almost every example i turned up was about sexual drama which i mean there are bunch of reasons for this but a big one is the increasing number of bills that try to restrict access to abortion i watch bodies from all over the country victorious deal in arizona there fetter an oho many wright and was consol many mace sin south caroling one of the things i wondered about was what prompted them time what exactly made them stand up and say it of couple said they were infuriated by the conversation in the room comments women lie about being rate and i wondered what it felt to say the secret here newly knew disclosed to the new york state assembly that at edge thirteen she would been abuse by a teacher she drew attention to what was happening in her body as she spoke i never speak i ait or this is because i hover i cash see what just a couple weeks ago there was another similar video that got a lot of a tension from new york congress woman alexandrine cassia cortex she is talking about the riot at the capital and then charnevialed this am ma survive i actual and i have not told many people bat in my wife am of cousin cartel did not say this in a legislative session hervidio was on instogramlive but it felt the others i watched and that she was using her secret to make an argument in this case about the impact of drama that different kinds of drama compound on each other she and the others spoke out because there was something important at stake they disclosed their secrets as a public service of course for most of us the reasons we tell secrets they are not a straightforward my own reasons for telling my secret i cannot even call them reasons that is too rational what i had was an urge to tell one driven by desperation obsession anger longing to be known and understood there are all kinds of secrets and all kinds of reasons for telling and not telling that is our show this week why we tell secrets and what happens after we do stay with us act one my own very serious comedy about women and food let us get in to why you might hold on to a secret why it might be hard to tell and if you haven an eating disorder or rein recovery for a one a heads up that their stuff in here that could be triggering i want o start by telling you about a move one that i saw as a tea nature one that addressed my secret directly it was an warehouse move called eating subtitle a very serious comedy about women and food the summer i was seventeen my mother and i went to see it together it'd been been eating for a couple years by the in fact ism sure it'd belonged before the move sitting next to my mother i was uneasy my binging was a secret it was the move itself might give me away an i a becks you see that is of come more wo do ti pasta i e yen a to get it is the we quit eating altogether this was my only way too within a few years after that move i was anorectic then back to binding then annerectsia again more years passed decades bike some of the women in the move i never stopped having an eating disorder i never going to ever be able to be none people with i mean ism always going to be at the mercy of it and it is very very scary feeling it is very very p an i hate it the summer i was forty five i watched eating again the first thing i felt was install shoulder pans brandmuffins aura ashlar lines you got a perm gat a farm and the second thing i felt was o my god not only is this move about eating it is about telling which was the thing i was obsessiveith at that point the move is fiction but it feels a documentary because a lot of it is women staring into the camera telling personal stories about food the setting is a fortieth birthday party in law sandals and one of the main characters is a film maker named marine she is making a documentary to help her understand her own eating disorder identified with that at first marine tells everyone of the party that her film is about women in southern californiafinally she owns up to her real subject it is tat you the truth my one o in streets about that woman food that is really i am fearful really yet why then did yo a say the document who is bat at women in caplin i did set tat southern gotta fun an behave you is mod general you see it is i awkward to people when you say woman food just that wonewin why an an food it most terrible thing just marine it'd hidden my real subject at eating distort of memory i was writing i told people my book was a cultural history of the teenage girl it actually had started out that way but it took me a long time to admit what i really wanted to write about for years i was ashamed of my own story same as marine now you can say avian a got i feel oh ism died i dit that is a cave it is it is en o kind of interesting it just say a you not eating disorder as as one we at as is that is unattractive it is disturbing at just it was there able to ten as any one an lots of ways this move is dated and judge mental but it is apologetically about eating which still feels radical one by one the women come and sit before martin's camera and she asks them tell me do you have any problem about food at the end of the move she says that hearing their stories has change things for her and i feel close wit hem it is such a wonderful feeling an if we feel i do not want to be along any more i want to be able to share things with other people maybe the sound sappy but these lines did something to me it is what i wanted too i wanted marine to invite me to sit in front of her camera and ask do you have any problem about food i wanted to be marine asking others that question i wanted to be at the party with other women talking i closed my laptop i went downstairs to the kitchen and from the freezer i took out a lemonbar the size of a checkerboard square i put the lemon bar on a plate the size of something a child would use at a tea party i the bare to strips and then it is tiny bites i sat at the table an i ate all the bites then i wanted more but i won't let myself have it by this point it'd had enough therapy to understand that what i did with food was what i did with people fear full of connection but hungry for it sitting at the table i started a tanto signs about making my own version of the fill a radio version i wanted to have a party in the move though i did know who ad invite i year passed i got a little better i told people close to me about my history i told others i talked more then my memory was published it'd expected to hear from readers who connected with my experience of an eating disorder wat surprise me was how many also connected with my experience of not talking about it i realized here were my party guests i smelled the back with invitations to speak not really had a conversation what is with another person who as sap for meou surfer and it sounds why you toe that tat it is true i think this is the most i severed talked about it but certainly the most have ever talked about the begging side of things and eating other people's feet and to be honest sis as i for my tass the first you were the first person i have ever told about that in fiat because i no screened it i and ashamed of the way i wok tan what i did an i just i ye sign have you talked to anybody else besides the nutritionist about this stuff just you ye how does it feel to be talking about it i t i fin talking tat with you cause i know you really get it ye how does it feel to be talking about this stuff i asked every one that question and i paid attention to what it felt for me sometimes i felt self conscious i seize up in conversation have more ease when i write but i also felt the connection i crave i never met these women but i knew them because we would been alone in the same ways its such alone e experience going through er daily restrictions where and farming all cheers the normal i it o without anyone catching on i mu not i think that chasing stories woe does help that is the carious on o be for me swat an meaning disordering feeling alone yet i mean yet we two some of them said your book made me feel less alone and when i said back will this conversation made me feel less alone i half worried it sounded insincere and half worry they be bearded out if they knew just how sincere i was and in every conversation we talked about the thing i was curious about why it was hard to tell any one about this stuff or talk about it i faint a secrecy to the honest is is that how eat disorders at least for me a see be tire to sellout an i think that that why its sech a handing for me to talk about because we not tight that there is two things o for the interaciouside of it i think hi it is because you do not want people to think your shallow i do not want people to they go was she just wants to be shitty and with the bingo to any one that never experienced it you sound out of your mind it just it doesn't make an y y sens at all an new when you explain it is the it is in addiction whatever may be people have some better sens of it but it is it is helpful to talk to somewhat has been there i think i mean thing for me one other reasons who have not been a still i talked me there or pest about it and gently creepie meaning full how it's because i just do not even no how to talk about i li get do not father people talk about it i do not i guess i kind of know what the vocabulary is but lie basically my only experience is i read other people's books about it i do not talk to other people about it among these women there was one who was really brand new to talking about her eating disorder had only recently even identified it has an eating disorder and that is the conversation in gointoplain next because on one level it is exactly what it'd hoped for just a real and good conversation with a woman who shared the experience of having an eating disorder ut also i think it gets at something important about why we keep any kind of secret the conversation started the same way as all of them with hurry that is not her real name telling me the history of her eating disorder i thought nobody else had ever done that i it'd never heard of bulimia i the thought i was the only person the have it had ever done that audio sixty three and she started bringing in purging in college in the nineteen seventies this was before eating disorders were on afterschool specials before bulimia had been defined in a psychological journal i wondered how are had gotten the idea but did you remember how it occurred to you to do it to purge i do not i do not remember the initial time but i had been eating as my brain still says eating a pig and ah i thought hell have got get rid of this i i give got it make up for it somehow ye am and that is what i started doing and then i would spend my days in the dying hall eating and than my afternoons finding bat from somewhere to get i of it audio kept begging and purging and then she stopped the purging part and what finally stock me was i went to the health's service for something i do not remember what and there was a bottle of it the can on the count or an wen say nurse was out of the room i stalwart i pick serum is used to cops vomiting it used to be a common thing that people had in a medicine cabinets and i went back to my room and it's was hallowing night i remember and i drank the entire thing and i got violently ill did you had you used if a can here up before dare no not just a finger and how come you drank the whole bottle i was angry with myself was just angry with myself i thought ism just going to drink this whole dating ye i knew that anger knew the feeling of standing in a down room hating myself audio told this one story about leaving campus to fence that bi related to i knew the same shame i was walking up the street to a chicken place that i knew of that i knew not no other college toes when to that is why went there and on my way to a bunch and there was the sky and started walking behind me an he started whispering me began weasand i was not scared i was ashamed i was in bars i mean the fact that the sky could have attack me or whatever is problem was was not and i never turned and looked at him y a you followed me all the way to the place and then i went in and i was embarrassed rosette go i was embarrassed because i thought oh he knew what now he knows where i was going you knows i was going to eat why then that was the problem right i mean it just become all consuming that of course that is what everybody else is thinking because it is central part of of your own experience yer i have been many years thinking about this i cannot believe it i mean really if you put it altogether years of my wife the has been sort of thin the sound track along underneath everything else even as surrey kept binging for most of the next forty years that is not what she called it in ten in your head it sounds the phrase you used you a pig is that is that the phrase you used what yet i mean my phrase was eating bad oh my gold when have read that in your book i tout as it it i o get it er i did not sis not i did not know been get disorder was a thing until i read your book yer i mean it how did you make sense of it for yourself without without having a name for it i just thought of it is weakness yer i just thought of it is that i was ridiculously weak that i could not stop eating been eating disorder is the most common eating disorder but the least talked about it only became a formal eating disorder diagnosis a few years back when i was in college in the early nineties i spent hours in the stay reading about eating disorders and i could not find mine in any of the texts the best i could determine was hat i had belie me o without the throwing up but the seemed half a problem i know i had a whole problem a real one i had this kind of fiery righteous thing going on i felt i knew more than the scientists but my certainty that there was something really wrong with me that i alone had died not did not feel triumphant it was incredibly isolating to have an experience that i could not find named anywhere a beige it is eating a lot all at once pass the point of discomfort been getting disorder i can offer a textbook definition of it year but surrey's experience is the text book definition i do kind of dis appear i just kind of eat and it is a time in which i feel everything's o we actually while ism eating wile ism putting stuff in my mouth i feel everything's o we yer but ism kind an not really there er how do you feel right after oh got awful awful another day ruined i mean in yes i have felt hopeless i felt extremely hopeless ah having done it again ye om and then doing it again the next night and i felt completely hopeless and out of control of it and hating myself for it that is pretty much the cycle the innestatized feeling during the beige the self loathing that follows feeling this is out of your control but also that you should be able to stop and the secrecy about all of it it you did not you did not tell your room made see your year did you ever want to tell anyone about it oh oh my gash i never wanted to tell anybody a no it was it yer ah i have been in ferry most of my life and i have never told any of my pharmacists about this did not occur to me that i would talk about it why do you think that is i think it is just embarrassing and it is it is it is really shameful and it is something that i should be able to handle by myself ah i do not i think i just kind of blanked it out when i went to therapy to talk am i it was too personal which is bazar i mean i told my abet all sorts of personal stuff but that was that that was too embarrassing and i member water myself as having it and eating disorder been eating i never thought of that is a disorder i thought of it as a lack of disappoint if you had thought of it as a disorder do you think that would have made you any more likely to talk about it and team yes i thought it was a disorder ye i mean unarm from from a doctor's family any anything that can be in a book somewhere am i can except yet i thought of it as a disorder i probably would have talked about it ye ye in your male you talked about the move eating right and i went to see it when it came out with a friend of mine ye and we came out of the move and we talked aborted i made bi ye but not a whole lot it was way too close to home for me and i do not know if it was too close to home for her but it was uncomfortable it is interesting am i am glad that you had e experiencing that my in the theater when it came out am i you are the only perched give ever died to who also seen as movies is very exiting for me when hell what age were you when you saw that own inner lie ninety i do not know your in your thirty's zap ladies and a i remember lines that as all at once ye but i still remember linsfromewer i remember there is a woman who sitting in a jacket she says ism wearisjack because i do not want you to see my army i wear clothes to conceal it i man i have this jacket on because i do not like to to see my fat arms can then the the older one lost shes my her i like you there is the older woman says i do not understand these girls why do not they just drink aha who food food that i years to really into eating always ha in my time we have get to get it too have a drink o cutting fort hers on wen i was always that was a more desirable invitation of going to dinner and i thought what is wrong with you why do not i just drink i really did what is wrong wit me why wet i just drink instead of eating what else you remembered youremember any of anything else i remember it was really an embarrassing i experience watching the move and uncomfortable and the friend i went with is very light hearted and then we came it move e it was pretty dark there for a few minute do you think she connected with it too my feeling was that she connected with it on the level of women in this culture a told not to eat very much but i she connected with it a normal person a normal woman who suffers under the one's of you are not supposed to eat too much but not somebody me but can i ask you something ye when you saw it with your malm do you think your mam was area be worried about you and maybe that why she did not really say much about a moving she were talked some now about m eating disorders and she did not know about the binging and my mother probably is somewhere on the spectrum of ham in between eating having been really a destructive force and the friend with whom saw the mob who was a woman she can really to it long that land i do not understand what i mean by that about my my friend being a normal woman word about it i propose the somebody would problem work about it well i always wanted to be a normal woman rat ye on we that done drove me further underground how because i think because of not now that i think a better i be think because of the judgment ye is just thick with judgment of re women and their problems and i though of we no i was right this absolutely must remain secret for er ye and i did not i dontlyven think consciously a amount i recently have started thinking consciously about it but o i never even thought consciously about she ad better not tell anybody its that that would never in a million years have occurred to ne to tell them what finally prompted audio to tell somebody was learning that this thing she did in secret was something that many other people also dit and that it had a name it does not always work this way naming is not always something you want i talk to one woman who for years did not tell any one about her bulimia because she did not want the label she did not want to be saddled with shame she could never shake as long as she could fix it herself the eating disorder never existed in the first place finally she did tell and she did name it which was terrifying because it made it real but also made it more manageable another woman i talked to was also reluctant to name her eating disorder not because she did not want the label but because she did not feel she lived up to it i just did not think i mollified i yet i did she i was en orders thick not the images i had my head to beating disordered people were a very very rain person where a hospital gan who being force ad i actin a that that is what i thought this an bivalent about naming was totally familiar to me when i first went to therapy it took me a few months to look up my diagnosis cod i was scared to know what was now on my permanent record and when i looked it up and a it was inner exit i got nervous in a new way my thervistint understand i wanted to take off all my clothes an shore that i was not thin enough to be inner exit what i did not get yet was that one you can be inner exit at any size and too that my feelings were the essence of the illness ism not good enough to be inner exit ism not good enough that a name gave agree the words to say the unspeakable and it gave her the permission she needed to ask for help after hurry realize she might have been eating disorder she contacted an nutritionist i i contacted her an went i yo may and it that i thought i might have this problem i hello get but when i called her and we spoke i i could not commit i was i i i do not know if i really have it or not om i maybe i do i do not know i do not do it all the time y and she said well you know you we we do not necessarily have to name it you may have features of it and what i thought was no no no i have it cirri am laughing anlecause i totally relate yet nobody that what feels am what feels helpful about talking about it or what has felt helpful far what is made difference for me is that it is a name a and it out's not i sail your character be a i disorder it you know hasn't can be treated treatment for an eating disorder involve both changing behaviors and addressing the underlying emotional reasons for them that is exactly what odds to in the month since she and i spoke she is continued with the nutritionist and now she is also seeing at therapist she is not over this yet but she is working on it that is where i am to but i struggle with a lot of why cannot i dis get over it recently my there this suggested that i thought that telling my story would release me from shame i got a little defensive no no i had not thought that but she was right telling my story has opened up a lot for me especially with the people ism closest to but telling is a beginning not an end it is not a solution it does not fix your eating it does not release you from shame to release yourself from shame you need to understand where the shame comes from telling alone does not get you there but it put you in conversation with people who can help it gets you to the party with other women talking coming up keeping your job secret from

disease and of course it had shaped me the war form relationships how suspicious i am of joy my whole sale resignation to pain why i hate being cold telling people lets then in but the problem is i know who i am my a person who has a secret and who do i become if i tell what do i lose i have tried to be more open i even broke about my syce sell for on my publication a few years ago it positive feed back from strangers was encouraging overwhelming but hearing from people i knew felt embarrassing exposing fortunately it was not that many people went back to pasting out the telling keeping the information on the strictest need to no basis and then covet happened at t beginning of it about year ago i received a letter from the department of health and social care informing me that as i have a highest condition ism considered extremely vulnerable and i must stay out of the way of bovid by staying in my house for at least twelve weeks extremely vulnerable is the nicest thing a government organization has ever said about me extremely vulnerable made me feel dainty and precious a rare jewel uniquely worthy of special care until the reality set in of what it would mean to spend twelve weeks inside my house could i have lived to twelve weeks told people i was staying home because i was anxious overly cautious or maybe it would be easier to just tell the truth and for the first cumin my life by slipped into the habit of day to day face to face talking about my sickles en to old friends knew colleagues naigbours the postmen i would come by the house stand at the front gate i sat the mandated two meters away on the steps and they would ask me question s i rambled at them about bold marystemsells rigid red bloodsells in anemia chest crisis's increased infection risks and how scared i was everybody was nice understanding an listing to me i felt compelled by their kindness o tell but always sicker after i tell i felt powerless a child again my first ad all decision was to keep my illness a secret i spent much of my life hiding to give myself choices as to how it'd moved through the world and now in revealing myself i felt trapped once after a visit where i had told

closet in your own home and your din your trying to work and you have to deliver this media to people who have paid already for it a your you are under these dead lines to make porn a big reason sauna was not immediately up front she does not want other mams in her world knowing what she does for work land told me that is because she knows what the other mams think of her job a couple years ago there ware passing around a documentary about the dangers of porn it it is it is vilified it is something to be afraid to a they look it it is something that is very degrade to women ism just degrading myself am i really enjoy my own sexuality and being able to tap into that for other people who aren't looking for something really niciand sciatic am they do not see it that way at all they see it as this disease and if they see me as that i do not know if they would continue to wanted plan plates with my daughter she is kept her job a secret for years from the other mams and of course from her own kids which just to say doing your job while your kids are at home that is one saying doing a secret job while your kids are at home that is a whole other saying and on top of that the kid's at home there also a secret the fauna's customers for then land has no family she exists solely in the fines either paying for long's having to switch back and forth between these different sides of her life eat one has to be completely invisible to the other but she suddenly can do about it very matter of fact whenever i bring up hastrassful it seen it is a puzzle i bunch of moving parts all of them have a place just et needs salving a pay a typical morning before any kids come downstairs all she a small snap chat clip one is kind of she rated for my promotional and the other one is adult for my premium members i that is done in the morning and send its time for the kids to get up get dress she makes them breakfast insulates them for virtual learning by the way wanna is married her husband knows about and supports her work but because of the nature of his work he is often tied up during the day leaving at tolan while the kids are in some school she looks for small moments when it makes sense to slip away or when they are allowed there's screen time occupied by mind craft or you too or all even sneak off in the bath room with the door locked do a shower seen sometimes there is some peaclips because there is thebuncher p fans out there was interesting actually about most of what you just said is said it is the stuff that you would be doing in the bath room with the door close and locked anyway an you your you are musty task ye yet you work at it all my god it's every time you sit on the toilets e figured you ordeal your on the sharer or garments should

quietly land's been careful to manage what her kids know about her job at the time her daughter was eleven perceptive starting to have some questions sometimes shed notice land wearing something out of the ordinary beneath her teachertain genes full body longer or something and she wouldst german why are you wearing that and it'll be oh ya this sorry this is for work and shall be liken pay do you do you think it is possible that she just does not know that there is more to know than that why i do not i just i do not remember when when d you kids figure out that sexuality is a commodity i think that he is pretty clos sheep eventually figure this out here is what land's daughter does know she knows her mam has a quote grown up job which is why she has a lot of fun clothes on my heels which she likes to try on she knows her mam takes pictures for people it makes pities for them and she knows that sometimes people to buy her mom's clothes after she is worn them and that is what she knows for now she is not asking for more and land's waiting for her to ask and her son he was six when we take he did not know anything about his mams work yet he don't even know it was a door he could knock on nocking on doors by the way h less than he should probably learns sooner than leader one time anna told me she snuck off for a quick camphor i went up stairs i forgot to lock the door and i had just cull down my liking still had my are to wear on and my son's try to walking up the stairs and ism out n camera already and i had t we'll pull my pants really fast and ism can't we don't what is up and roll my candles not working quick o we god the works out fine land put the phone down before her son even walked into the room and met him out in the hallway actually almost the exact same thing happened on our phone call to second holt on one moment what many n an she gave him more kindly it is not just her kids looking for more screen time it is also her clients when the pandemic started for consumption in america shot up way up about twenty five per sent more streaming according to the website porn up especially in the middle of the day at around lunch time presumably people stuck at home wanna saw on up tick in her fan base too last spring she told me she gained about eight thousand followers on social media and that she was getting more and more requests for private

months i check back with wanna and every time we catch up shes sounded up be and i think this woman is good i compartmentalizing but when i called her back a couple wees ago to check in she is sounds different and she told me she is been having a hard time keeping up her poor an croon with clients it is it is hard stay motivated i have found and it just a run it takes a little bit of time to kind of get going to get in you don't have to put on music i half to sort of get in the mind set to actually create something that is good somethings are easier these days her kids do not needs much attention during the day land's daughter is old enough to manage her own virtual learning and her son hes seven now he is in a small pod with other dittos his days four days a week he is not at home land even rented a small office for work we she can go spend a few hours each morning shooting by herself she has more privacy and does not have to toggle back and forth all day between her kids and her secret job any more but the pandemic's been getting to her in some new ways there is i think a lot of real thing the gems being closed and ism not taking care of my body as well as i did before the pandemic am and you know i fee my body looks different now i and that makes you not feel you knot quite as sexy when you are looking back at the footage later n you while i really do not that angle and i find myself sometimes just have you bust out content because not because ism feeling or because i think s could be really great but it is a have to get it done actually long says the hour long foot worshipping session that she done just before this phone call is a good example of what she is talking about that appointment happened over ten she also sends photos to ism actually testing with him and and then ism also looking for a restaurant reservation cause i really want go out to dinner this fridge for out door dining artily text with someone else did you get your reservation now because i have to find a place with heaters and am a full bar and that is tricky commotion right now lats of us land's worn down having less fun on the job an honestly who can blame her but since our

you for you time this is holy holy he was eighteen he reported that story his frendjake was sixteen if we just turning in is is thismerican life we have tossed out our regular way of doing a show this we trashed it tucked it spurned it we laugh at it we spit on its grave and instead we are bringing as many short stories as we can fit into sixtyminutes is barely what eighteen minutes into the shelling a ready we are at act seven and in credible achievement it seven up with the air is clear we have this story from johnthan golden before he ever moved to gotta city before he grew into the overrated obsessive sad sack of his later years the penguin was a poet and a dandy who lived in onion he wrote complex villagers and through lavish dinner parties at which he only became more charming the more he drank he wore a monocle a top hat and carried in umbrella one evening at one of his dinner parties after hours spent sipping absent the penguin ran up to the roof of his building opened up his large black umbrella and leapt off into the year as he coasted to the ground and hollered out lines from blame stuff about grabbing life by the fat of its stomach and giving it its twist he was that crazy he was that bursting with life from that night on he made his habit he jump off roofs ever higher while clutching an umbrella after a while he got pretty good at it too he saw that by kicking his legs and twisting his back a certain want he could actually prolong his flight coasting all over the place sometimes only landing after several daring minute tall it came to pass that the penguin started hearing more and more about a certain any named many pains she too he was told had been floating around condone hanging from an umbrella handle everywhere he went the penguin kept hearing about her how it was simply inlaying that they had not met each other yet finally a dinner party was arranged by someone who knew them both and on the evening of the party the penguin walked into the drawing room saw many popping on the divan doff is top hat and bowed low as was his style in those days he planned a few things to say and do one first meeting many point he thought he might lift up his umbrella as though challenging or to a duel he imagined she would smile and take up er own frilly perhaps pink umbrella and then together they would dance about the room leaping over furniture parrying and thrusting perhaps even winding things of breathing heavily nose to nose o oo instead what happened was the penguin became very shy and quite it as he stood there staring at her his ta pat felt needlessly clumsy his monocle too small for his face and the squinting needed to keep it in place was giving him a slight headache for the first time in his life the penguin fell ludicrous i imagine you two must have an infinite amount of things to speak of said their host as he sat them together at the dinner table the penguin nodded uncertainly after three or four minutes it became clear that the penguin and many popping had absolutely nothing to say to one another that did not deal exclusively with umbrella travel getting stuck in trees the shoulder makes anxiety about tipping over in the wind everyone at the table just sat there staring at them expectantly which made the whole thing even more awkward trying to move things along many point asked the penguin if he to sing to which the penguin responded only whole ism drunk then she asked if he enjoy children to which he replied yes in a sweet wine sauce the penguin then asked many popping how she kept people from looking up her skirt when she flew she smiled politely then turned to the man on her last and asked him how he was enjoying the lamb the man on her left was wearing an elegant aristocratic hake marry a bit drunk on the sherry noted that if he spread his cape out he might be able to glide about a bat the man on her left chuckle and suggested after dinner they had up to the roof and give it a try

greater avid say arms an amends room at the hardy airport i watched a man take a cellphone from his jacket pocket step into an empty stall and proceed to dial i thought he had come for the relative privacy but looking through the space beneath the door i saw that his pants were gathered about his ankles he was sitting on the toilet most airport calls begin with geography ism in canvas city people say ism in button ism at kenned when asked where he was the man on the phone said simply ism at the airport what do you think the sounds of a public toilet are not the sounds he would generally associate with an airport and he is what do you think struck me is unfair the personae was talking to obviously felt the same way whet do you mean what airport the man said i it laggard and now put me through to marry a few hours later i was in boson relating the story to my sister tiffin i mean he actually placed a call while sitting on the toilet tiffin is big on rules and i expected a certain degree of outrage i want to discussed but instead she said one la i do not believe in telephones but you do believe in talking on the phone while sitting on the toilet was not a belief she said but i mean sure when asked how she explains the noise tiffin scrunched up her face and held an imaginary receiver to her mouth i say do not mind me ism just trying to get let off this jar her face returned to normal and i thought of all the times i had fallen for that line all the times i had pictured my sister standing helpless in her kitchen try tapping the lid against the counter top it'd said or since in hot water that is sometimes works he eventually after much struggle she would let out of breath there we go she would say have got it now and then she would say thank you and it'd hang up

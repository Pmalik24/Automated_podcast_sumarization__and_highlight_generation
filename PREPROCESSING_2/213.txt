voter be sure the voter is voting for the democrats out will you told that in your training i now do not recall hearing that but i do that in our scripts one of the first questions is where you supporting democrats on your ballet and if they say no you see to hang out sank them for their time an hang of be what would you be able to do it mean to say it is surely there is no pretence that this is about democracy counting every ballad as you do not i their place to set bout winning i mean if somebody said i voted for true but i really disappointed that my not is not an account i could not sleep that night if i had if i knew that i had suppress that about see would help him yet here we cannot say we want it and then not do it have you had to do that i y had one present eyelet me tramp twenty twenty an tan ha p i did not haveject to do et a but a day an our program after an election weekfull of uncertainty and even after news organizations looked at the official results and called the election for jordan there is still more uncertainty present an true of course is not conceited s call the not counts fraudulent sat it ay we ashtrays of people all over the country living through this weird o know what to colt gravityless window of uncertainty that we have all been floating through since tuesday speaking for myself of checking the news compulsively the watching impost of the day after the election this wednesday a hump day for the ages all of is winding how is this command o fellow citizens going through that stay with us cabin virgin my giggles a reporters been flowing militia groups for the last year and interviewing the man in them en couldn't lot tongues shove been bracing for civil war ever chelas few weeks from president trump repeatedly encouraged his supporters to go to polling stations and quote watch very carefully on election day my wondered if any these groups and the guise he knew would heed the call here is my when i called job clam the leader of a militia in virgin called the ridge runners he told me that is exactly with their going had to do i joined them for a are election training session in the operation mountains one chilly sturdy morning three weeks ago yet you jo would not tell me the location over the for i met him and about a dozen other guide in came at donates and followed them to a large farm they start the day standing out of mention behind a abandoned building with their ay or fifteens a rat great forget at to see you all here thank you all for coming out just to quake am wireman a go fer couple things to day u that is all goes a muscular twenty nine year old who looks exactly the former marine sergeant he tells me he is e this one of can bring us all the forefront of all f your minds with the election on the way we will not i need to stay vigilant an now we are all have been collaborating with all the other group commanders in the area each group is going to have us set number of polling slides that were an be responsible for each polling sight is going to have to hopefully three a drayman operating at that sight drayman with that means men in plain clothes trying to blend in to the crowds at the polling stations occasion jo tells me what their looking forest groups black late matter in antenna they believe could destruct the election in command voters or commit fraud they get this from the presided trump and writ wing media have been raising these fears without evidence for months every one in job elision is white the question of whether militias are sonaromis with white nationalists always comes up with groups this and they almost always reject that label all the places that jo images might be hotspots an election day a near by city the pots of people of color but he and his members insist or n t races before canary when job start of the group most of these guides did not know each other jowls one f the most intense people i hade went n on lichens and when he talks people tin to snap to attention he tells we stories about fighting as the black to soldier losing friends and killing enemies i chuck with the marines and they tell me they have no record of the service job claims that is because its classified when i ask people what drew them to the group they talk about jo is charisma here is a member called savage i went to a luster and withies for a group and that group dispasely wont a saner an talk and and there's nothing wrong with that at do not call yourself a magician if you just wanted standard talk politics jobs group when he come up and deliver his staying they talk about training and that tat having he do not lake it out shoot ran town range for fun no we does not wont a train and be a part of som the loud of the day seems the guides are just here to bond and have fun job let the man through six hours of drills starting with it and them moving to shooting positions and room clearing it the theta a con tat o can tat fro to under meter the ta ta tan tank an move lo the running a drill here where the ideas that they learn had to cocker each other i lo when i spent time with these groups a always wondering how seriously you take the idea that they might really engage in violence on the one hand to give each other nicknames slap each other on the back in sang bang but at the same time they really do believe the countries in danger that they might need ta turn their guns on their fellow citizens one day and they buy into all the in supported claims trump makes about liberals bent on election fraud an violence in the need to stop them and they think they are the once to do it nearly all the ambition men have spoken to this year believe that democrats commit mass of botorfraud an twenty sixteen and they bee doing it again i this year with mailman ballast and early voting joys worry the twenty twenty election could be stolen did did it did it marry you the trump said that om well ye of course it did because if considering all the a access in formation that he has that we do not if he is drop the little tidbits there is something that people me need to pay attention to you think that he is basemen on unreal information i mouthing as possible that he is playing politics om ion i do not thinks he seems more of a straightforr carnage i think that he is not the give of person to like politics some times they wish the people in these me lather groups could hear how much they sound people covered in countries the ad come on done it is pen a lit of time in each lion we crane and early going thirteen wit the progression actor this who you eventually country region into a war they were going sociamedian to an into mission cop agenda and convince themselves at their countrymen were out to destroy them they tell me that bans of notes were coming from see of to kill them i was struck by the way people had to convince themselvesthat the other side was absolutely out to get them what's bent on their destruction in order to take that step into real violence it's not that i think that would happen we crane will happen in america the talk of violence can become self fulfilling prophecy the stakes for you are they are the stakes jest an election the trump loos is oke may we can win again and four years the no i really believe that anybody who gets in after a trump if there liberal iris going the downfall of america for sure no this election is going to be some sort of tor a turn point for good or bad this going to be turn n let us roll out all is tuesday morning election a jo

day i saw job was warrior persona great day and tells me not long afterward the guides pack ted out the went hone they found no evidence of fraud no intimidation an destruction they never got chance to protect the motor engaging enemy and it was relief to see that this was totally lying with them the next day i called job it was ones day the news was moving towards the bid in victory and present in trump was ready crying fraud job was too u till right now not very happy ontic ore i think the the other that is than to introduced ball bow ton e on an the get a that o wiggitin make it to tat biding wind what may she think tit the doing that o where's unload i she tot go on an a a part mi sign and we couple of the play that they should a army call for true but they have the present has been pushing in substantiated claims to the lection making minivan another crucial states i it if it ends of being that bid hes declared the winner w do you think there could be away that youculd just say had as probably what happened and believe it absolutely nous no can s yet gotta wo everything that o no we thou expired wearing up to the election there is know whey that trump would lose a far election it is nowhere your own experience yesterday was that you guess checked on thralling stations in everything was run smoothly needn't see any fro know otic we was o that the fact that people were able to go and we know cat the to no i impeded i that a really have anything to do with what goes on with those bow o e know after the people o cat n job tells me he sure that if bid win some kind of violence is inevitable he says to can of finding some one a that matter ante for he is not sure ah what it would have i some point trump were t can seen say he exapsifiin i mister prat is present now u could he change her mind you absolve not mix can kelly he read about his experience is cozening civil work have sees in his book chatter the nations at to new york in germany four years ago the dafter don a trump one that election re porter symphony for met two army officers at t o diner to talk to them about the new boss the misery in the same unit close friends but they did not agree on politics at all why do each other i do not now on do we likely fellow we disagree on almost severython e know why because i know that he's have my back in to and it'll have this regardless of what he believes all those ill found an most of it et is also i give my life one i said my of line if if if the not a does wore e we a the time they went back and forth about what they thought the next four years foregoing to be the president trump is commander in chief whether it went they were more likely to be t a pay to a confirm own how it would affect moral and the possibility dona trump made start a newcleor war tho we find ye not he an tropic new some people none i think he is incredibly uneducated about ut he is a thing about the cops if people no realize people it is not he as a piece of paper in his pockanis a hers ne g cops is not work that way wat the guide president trump said the officer with the newquarfootball would prevent donate trump from random we necking somebody the henry quartan supporter was not shore any step checked i with t two of them again or wear this week one offs in the states one of them stationed in germany the biggest thing that happened to these gays in the last four years actually had nothing to do with crump they both had babies actually better i can ye get for you him late ah some be decided to take off their type and shoe on it we were dealing with that and now i were terrible parents the crying hysterically because how there we not let him eat his own facies a you reminds use much a e thou or you doters not through far behind at a tom these not their i names but chest and tom voted exactly how i expected them to in the election tom voted for bison chest again voted for trump but in twenty sixteen chest had been really hard for true supporter he really wanted an outsider but now that the outsider is an insider he feels more agnostic and maybe a little part of his indifference is because of true smog as their boss but the time trump made the comment saying why are we having all these people from shithole countries coming here chat was not crazy about that neither was tom the bind supporter who has deployed in africa went that went down is comments about shit whole countries certainly impacted my on we us a politer as training exercises across the world with partners i haven a be in a position at the time were running i group teams aid were in avian countries akin as you sit in there plain for these training agents these comments come out in just you know your partners accountalike as this with you get think about us is said sat what did you have to tell them i based we talk thready that does not represent you as militaries position on our partner ships and honestly sometimes it comes down to stay both shitting an having friendly relations with pose ow that is similar experiences to ism a trumps of port right mac at twenty twenty but yes it it does make your job more difficult ism back in ta defend the fact that when he says something it is o get it is time to brace they were not totally unhappy with his performance both chest and tom agreed that trump strong man personality did come in handy some times they that he engage with north care and supported the assassination of heroin an general costume only money but the thing that affected them the most during the last four years is the same thing we have all out with the thing that is not get a magically go away no matter who ins i feel the thing that is very clear to me is that it really feels there a two america right now you does it feel that way in the military yes i a that is chest i have colleagues on both sides and it is awkward lie yer you used to talk about it more and now people do not want to talk about politics it all ye one right when i went to i rack and two thousand aid it was people be ism voting for a boy or people abominable for mac sane but there was there was not any charged racism attached to it you were not a races if you voted for mac sane you could talk about i and nobody would get offended and now wit is dislike apparently ism a premises because i vote for trump according to some people and i mean ism just very much whatever man ism voting for common will for you can do the same i do not want to talk about it one of the moments that bugs chest the most is from his last to playpen one of his friends was a black woman who absolutely hated trump and she hated all of the wite trump supporting soldiers around her to she did hang out a chat he things that is because he is age in america and it just put me n an awkward position all the time an i would always could ask by both sides why you hanging out with them and i be really mam are almost painting the carse tom agrees he says that in the military the mind sat should be that there is an enemy and it is out there printing an encasing a gan stand somewhere not in the next style at the stop chop wen i was watching a stop on the days with that the black matter protest an national guard trotting calling i kept thing i that is the worst final map i would never ever want to do that right the these are people from your community and you are getting call in to do something no one in the military once to do this know in less again when it comes to e merchants situation that than everybody's of for join bring to do that in the case it say hurricane but nobody wants to go wen it trying to be a policemen that is not our chap now o know i follow some military inter grams in one of them is i killed people enough gangsta an now kill these people to day and i then hes before bulls she idiot's to those people probably fail their psychic say a lot of international relationships hade been tested by the turn president but not ten toms you is er sell friends yet i meat but we totally s that is because we have talk to friendship where we just one of each other all tan this is just one wore panoply we we worliamdo ye we hated each other long before true even beside a run to press slowing we u seen built on top of that heard non we have the he mountain over the friendship bridge sit is really beautiful thin sh o on tom says that the military creates and environment were people have to trust and communicate with each other even if he do not each other which does not an attitude america seems to have these days about our democracy i talk to them wednesday the day after the election tom said he be pretty horrified if trump one catestrabed if don winds he said basically whatever both said they respect either to come an tstaphany tho these to be a producer on our program s now writing a memoir about healing from complex p t it coming out somebody who thought as life as on a change lot to pending on who becomes president though now is not clear hat's in a minute mchicago be bagradio wen our program continues it is is amebic come li from our glass to day's program squeaker i donenouf i should admit here how many minutes to day we spent arguing over weather to call the episode elective dysfunction squeaker was our classy choice anyway i show this week his story from all over about this strange week evolve just live through waiting for election results of course for some people the out come of the presidential election might have a very direct effect in the o ti forinstance to people living in the ten camp that just over the border from texts in motomoris mexico he camp felt with people seeking asylum in reunited states we've been sent there under the presidents remain in mexico policy on election it the out of vigil all night long until five in the morning a patently the passers o put this together tried to keep at eight political stick with prayers and songs but by the end of the vigil in the early morning hours the was pastor who took the stage said the thing that apparently lots of them en been thinking all night he said i hope job bison wens and somebody was heres that it was everybody final we had a chance to let out their feelings they cheered they danced the have heard jordan promise to reform emigration n his first hundred days and office which brings us to act three at three louisiana man callous has this story if somebody else not from this country is ween following the election as closely as he can jonathan who was in an ice detention center in louisiana told me that this years presidential race actually solved the problem in the detention centers he is been in he is been moved room to a few jonathan told me the recurring problem was with the t yes take the ice detention center i called him in it was this small triangular room he said the to morrow oat to morrow i am o o a that the o ta we won a e be gee the o a ye t the problem with the detention enter t of is the n exerted the same with any tang america people cant agree loo to watch the watch english t v two u punish t v ho do b a what you e be be that wo you e o bet be the o wo e be be that o o o on o to o it o wat ta o e tat wait jonathan told me during the eighteen months he is been an iced attention one of the few times this wasn't an issue at all was the presidential debates this to every one jonathan said one to see those i called jonathan the week before the election because i wanted to talk to someone in our emigration system whose case could potentially be effected by it i wondered how the election looked from where they were jonathan said he talk to other detaining about the election he been talking to cards to most of them m he told me were biding supporters but yet lots of people were wondering how the election might change their cases including him jonathan's thirty it is from cameroon and he came to the u san twenty nineteen seeking asylum he is been stuck in to mention ever sent at o a ta wat o the to e tin moment o be o be o a o was e at a to oi o you e hi bi do w we i what o rule e a be i under president trump asylum seekers jonathan are getting reported even ones with strong evidence that their political refugees will be tortured or killed if the return to their home countries jonathan i should tell you that is not his real name am calling him that because he has family back in cameroon and he has good reason to worry about their safety jonathan is part of an english speaking minority that is been persecuted by camera's french speaking majority and it is long time autocratic president pal be at that whole situations gotten more and more violent jonathan was not part of that he was a business man a grocery whole sailor bought stop from farmers to sell in town he started the business to sport his mob if there dad at basically jonathan got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time he was in this barber shop when i got rated by soldiers he and fourteen others got thrown in jail and they were beaten and tortured for nearly a months one point a few men were taken out and they never came back and t soldier told the rest of them they were all con ad killed then one day a warning was his pretty graphic one day an officer took jonathan and one other man at gunpoint and he led them outside to a trunk he told them to clean it up jonathan look d inside it you o t o o i o o what yo be you mot be tat you it be a a ajonathan says it was blood all over the inside particles of flesh he started to clean and then at some point he noticed that the soldier was distract and talk into some one at a i o u you wat today i tat a we a a you wat at a man a a he on e you jonathan says he slipped around the corner of the building and then he ran through a corn field he just kept running eventually he got to a cousin's house and then eventually escape to equator i just one to say jonathan's account of all these details it is all well supported but documents and photos and legal affidavits among the documents there is a warrant for jonathan's arrest for quote terrorism secession and insurrection jonathan told me if the government gets hits hands on him chances will be killed our hundred per cent that is what he said a hundred per went jonathan's attorney told me under a different presidential administration than president trumps to thinks his asylum case would have a much better shot after escaping jonathan went through nine countries at some point some one gave jonathan a piece of advice that would end i being really important its had rip your passport out it will make it harder for any one to send you back to cameroon jonathan did that in the end he made it to u s he made into ice custody i asked jonathan why he did not seek asylum in any of the other nine countries and he told me it was simple he did not know enough about any of those other countries to know if they would protect him or if they would send him back o i now o a of o at e ti i know not i o a a tat you you moa at a bi not poor ta you or a to to morris what a a o i a e i w o me o i i o oi i we a i o o tea how i i we o iron e judge ordered jonathan to be deported the only reason he and his lawyer thought he had not been is because jonathan had taken that advice and destroyed his passport back in animal for months ice officers had been asking jonathan to sign this document that would apparently let that send him back to hammer room jonathan has been refusing telling them that he will be tortured and killed ice in response told jonathan they would hold him in indefinite detention until he signed and ice for their part that started leaning on jonathan harder and harder you half to signed this recently he told me that situation came to a head when an ice agent he knew let him into a room he tat i u see define people me you help wen we and e o point to a me en we bomb yo jonathan got on his knees and a said he would be killed the officer was in hearing it t he said he needed a picture of month inside to e repeated told me jo e or e define e i won be take o whew i o a o a oo i i a a o a o me o we i a i a a o i e o me here grabbed your hand not a a o o to a a put all of this only stopped jonathan says when a female officer opened the door and asked what was going on she called the other officers over to her and they talked where jonathan could not really hear them then he was allowed to go call his lawyer after jonathan and i talk we agreed that he would call me the day after the election at five p m i wanted to hear his reaction to whatever results i non results would have by them but that never happened because the morning after the election when every one was waking out to a map with eight state still suspended in gray i got a voice male from jonathan's lawyer o will not i you tin n o i for where i do not know were i a somewhere am i o a o e i or or r one i won we be i part woe ruth mangrove jonathan's lawyer could not signed him she woke in up the morning after the election to see four miscalls on her phone i bi the morning a five o'clock in the morning but to in o not in a lion that ta ta e tat call me an t he would being move and truth told me i day before er election day jonathan told her about this unusual inside where ice had taken him in to identify his belonging at property roan they asked about his sponsor you winwhich hes got an xanthin mainland his offered to take him in while he tries to get asylum ojonathan told ruth he was hopeful then that is what was ut that he was finally getting out abut ruth was suspicious she got in this male from an active i about a see hortation of light to came room on nonmember tanmorningshe would been getting increasingly nervous that jonathan might get put on i why and that morning after the election when jonathan was just removed from the lousy and a detention see her ruth started scrambling just thing to figure out where exactly was where he was going when we talked she was still recon o can o and i found out i think he for i way to a thing i already an aleganterya for ganja i ya a louis tiara a an to the a taking area for it you ruth told me she was trying every legal avenue she could an death ersh had not confirmed it a hundred per cent from ice that jonathan was being deported but she was increasingly sure had to be that she thought before i play you this tastes at take i need to tell you things about ruth she is no softy she is a former prosecutor she is the wife of a former navy seal an d a get bouquet but to the first time we talked she told me she had this kind of big worry around the election and around jonathan she was worried that even if mobile in one the trumpadministration officials would go on a scorched earth sort of tar with detainees jonathan and that he would be deported as part of that the i what if a what i thought with an a happen basally and i do not know if i told er to you were a what if some one out but the way i think of these people it the they they did not have confidence that come with an win may be i think may be they were wrong ten on cut go back at i can y you a the if i could get here here if i

said we got her just wait calmly for results and honestly for the good of the country maybe biding should win trump makes people angry this surprised me she had been clear about not wanting bit but when she unpacked es a little more i understand she does not want roast that she knows very wow she knows how that stor and nutty rayon it is when be tatstakes massachusetts s whatever produces shown call some talking head times on see an anvysently discussing the stakes of this years presidentiallection and ow both democrats and republican see it as existential that is where they used existential a the very existence of a democracy r even our planet hangs in the balance which in a the concise kind of abstract and he is pass two weeks as we approach direction day shown in somebody very lustrum have been dealing the very immediate and a real world existential questions he shot about two weeks before the election my stepfather end was admitted to cape cot hospital he was rushed there in an ambulance with extreme shortness of breath he was suffocating turned out to be lung cancer a tumor almost the size of a golf ball that caused all this fluid to build up in his left along plus a precarious blood clot on the same long i raced up there from new york before even knowing the diagnosis it is ninety and had already been battling stage four prostate cancer for a couple of years there is been this ambient sense of waiting for the other shoe to drop when i got to the hospital two nurses were settling him into the room where he would spend the next four days one of them asked him a whole battery of standard in take questions history of smoking yes you drink kafir yes and then she said do you feel threatened by any one at home or just in your life ad paused look down and said the president i thought that was really funny and also telling even in this dire moment for him trump in the election still kept bobbing back up to the surf's ad's a democrat follows the newspretty closely back when he was merely contending with stage for prostate cancer he told me several times that he just wanted to live long enough to see what happens with the election a that zero existential dread beyond that and at some point during his hospital stay i realized this was almost certainly going to be ex last presidential election and i wondered if he might be experiencing at differently than the rest of us for a couple of my daily hospital visits i brought my recorder along el i gather be glad her old be the last election i yo key why such tat sensual things wan people are ass excuse aspersion i mad beta republic in his turned to sought a religion bound been a demo cat to and once again i have the best position in the house i trump weds i do not care lie ta and i bid wens aka trupsgon o you think you'll make it till the election we'll be mighty pis at these doctors mom i do not at that point again this was more than a week before election day the doctor still had not given him a prognosis about how long he might live they did tell him that the blood clod could detached any time and go to his brain or his heart and kill him he was equally sanguine and philosophical about that as he spent about the cancer told me the clod will either kill him or at wont and if it does not why should he worry and if it does he will not be able to worry he placid about his mortality that it does not leave a lot of room for me morosely ringing my hands about it when ism with him but now there is this kind of gradient from what he is probably still going to be alive for to what he might be to what he probably will not be and he does not get to choose of course but i thought it'd ask him anyway how long do you want to be around for what of the things that you want to see still well it is see bide will take over trump sit will be a the president that to the election but still be press of it three months three months you want o keep on ways i mi two bore about gat a commit solid and you'll i mi count to say a to be rot three muts that is for mut go by people say why you still alive tat does'make any sense a to me is layabout it a you pay i do not in a little it can be to say lie there might be a could show at once at awhile the might be a good book to read be ism father what that was to live just for the sake i living i think it is excellent time and the next two or three years to die we your o for e all sorts a huge problems we have goal warming gamin that big time the country is soon to be divided evening a biting wins he's got a hell of hell of it i put it back together but i think he might but still rope is going totalitarian this country is going for totalitarian which is carry is tot much to look forward to things i would to see our answers to big questions is there in college in life in this universe is not others and tat i would he went on to talk about this thing he read about possible evidence of life on venue is usual he got excited talking about this stuff a battle i think it is is curiosity that is kept him around the long the same curiosity not partisan ship or spite or foolish vengeful ness but curiosity that is had him wanting to see how the election place out which i think it such a pure perspective to watch this whole yucky circus from especially as he would be totally forgiven for just changing the channel to i cant i ad how are you doing a a mi let fared a meddling e in this call was early fridge morning a three days after election day ad was back home from the hospital in a three new prescriptions including a heavy duty blood thinner for the clokwhich is actually ben working and while almost everyone else i knew was biding their nails waiting for the electoral scoreboard to change he was not in fact on election night itself he did change the channel then even watch the returns common i a make my which is er grit if you can a way tell the out to be a ye i bet e or it is the opposite of this election basically her bi the appetite of a lot thing than most bi what born treating that wo wend it what happens down er it will be time or interesting well a the craps the porter i

told that there is this thing give been trying to square how he can be at peace with his own mortality and yet concerned for the fate of the country and really the world he is leaving behind this

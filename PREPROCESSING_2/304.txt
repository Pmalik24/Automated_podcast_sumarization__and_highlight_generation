it is still a big part of camping all across america and after a year without lowball camp lake in the woods brought the police back most of the simply has to do i tradition the special songs and ceremonies ore a part of many america camps and it is not just because they are for i camp direct dor in is constant told us as we were putting together to day's program i financially you cannot run a camp without lots of repeat customers these traditions bring kids back year after year you have the consigning constantly about the royalty to their cabin made in the camp you let them know about all the extra rights and privileges and honors of the on toga if they return as older campers it is part of making the business run and in addition it is part of what makes camp thrilling it is using all of the stage craft wat all the world's religions always used the ceremonies the chanting the repeated words the official honors and offices but for an entirely secular purpose to thrill children to make them feel part of something big and special i i it i really impart part camp i mean i is in take i the chanson locals it is what it is on a hap en and you you can make cottage that its i ye i i come back for the titans i expect everything a a the way was last telecast terms an i come back i give everything chaos i do not think i lie get i newer what coming up war what is it good for answers

whose a theme bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme to day's program notes on camp summer camp you now lot of the pleasure of being in camp is the pleasure of being part of this team this group you just feel loyal to which also happens to be one f the pleasures of being in the military s in changing times while madam davidson is half as raillery grow up in america and when he was fifteen he went to a camp run by the as rally army in israel on their own training facilities the camp was round the same drills they shot m sixteens was all design to convince these america news to move to israel and join the astrally army some day it is exciting cause you really feel i mean that at that age when you are fifteen and you are in is rally army summer camp there is no one in the history of the world who is cooler than in a let army unit soldier i love the fact that we would go to the bath room and the toilets would not have a seat because that is a place where terra could put a on and it just faso poncho crouching on top of the see and showering in this freezing cold water because what the silent month god would see hot water what now for me for the first few weeks what was tough about this was that in i was really an nobody there and it'd always be bringing up the rear at always become a slow and i was not showing myself to be poncho even the there were many opportunities in a given say to prove yourself poncho i mean we were always for no apparent reason running crazy from one tree to another tree or up some mountain every few minutes there something you could be the best and i was never the best but all of this changed my geek status was completely transformed one night am the different units would put on plays and we were supposed to do take off fairy talk and this was some kind of a competition there was voting over who did the best job my group lugatberac our fairy table was stove white in the seven dwarfs and i would be stove white this fabulous layman who lives with these seven dwarfs and the prince who comes to after me would be mambo this was one of those moments where i just knew that i was i was in the down i was in my element i mean i was from grunge villages have been a an actor all through my childhood my dad was a after but more than that there is a way that america can be very free that is rally cannot be precisely because they have to be macro and no matter what they're doing even if they are mocking themselves they have to maintain that steeliness and i had no complications in that area am i dress myself just i tried not to be too outrageous but i had to be kind of outrageous for them to get it a little bit of quite a little bit of liner am my hair con a slick back with moose and do not sort of ridiculously short shorts and ism lying there and i her a knock on the door and i just stand up and i remember the entire crowd is howling just howling and and ism i just do the most awful mincing gay voice just who is it and my friend who is a skin head from torn whose parents happened to be is rally says it is a mambo i said oh mambo you sexy beast and every one is freaking out just laughing mad maniacs and of course tho out at all in making jokes about the camp members themselves saying oh i think commander along it is just the thing and everything i said the entire crowd is just with me is just laughing hysterically and what happens the snow white to steeve hint i eat the apply to pass out and i need to be resuscitated mambo comes to kiss me and what we would worked out if be put his hand in front of his mouth wand i put my hand in front of my out and we just touched hands and were kissing our mouths but from a distance at looks were making out and i me at this point thicamp is their standing up their hauling men i have transgressed every country that the is rally man sets for himself and am and they are laughing the other side and from that point on i was no longer the unknown america bring up the rear of the a obstacle count i was a move star made every one the is rally guises particularly the machinist touches is daily guys constantly wanted to do this make out thing where we put our hands over our mahunsan make out we would be were laying after some really long height in the negative desert or something and ma or chatwouler whatever would come up to me and say it is very funny well you lilies to make out thing show me do it let us do it and the first retene i would do it i mean i us pardon me was flatter that the macho future si get mot corgis or into me in any watching but after a while it was just weer i just be too chew ism just not going to do the do not do that any more ism just no dining doing they be once o boy tit is really funny that is all it is not to anything but just the funny you've been a plenty of company ten every camp your somehow a part of a team i remember in boyscelt camp when is at horse riding camp it was the people who wrote horses in the morning says the people who rode horses in the afternoon and i love my gives and i would look in the lunchroom at the other bunk ingest i just an understand how you could even live in that bunk but it is really a my summer camp is the purest dissolution have ever mean of this joy in being a hart of the group i just every week i would do things t i did not i would not have thought i could possibly do and that was in credible and i knew that was because of the girl i know that was given me the for and it was there was never a moment where i to ask myself can i do it it

the same team as you are being man to captain of the color days teams is considered such a big deal that many older campers can name all the captains of all the color day teams going back years two girls and two boys ware named is captain each year for each team only camp per from the oldest bunks can be captain bringers for girls hawks and blackcaps for boys councillors who were once named is captains if you talked t hem about it they get all choked up when they tell you about the moment they were chosen even can a pardon the twenty nine year old owner of the camp when to this long explanation of the ceremony with me went went her voice cracking ending with well ism unless in tears right now y w bank as in me is not bogus done in my life rules nicer watched the girls color days this year just to give you a sense of the intensity of color days a months before it all begins and eleven year old blue team member tells me color days is in all that competent i mean thee talk to a girl on the white team and everything and all i could think was if you have to say something that there is going to be trouble the speculation about who will get the honor of being captain at the color days team the biggest honor at camp its intense that weeks before color days begins line say wat and some friends and bregma was decide to consult winter's icy word them her e as as e e eh i i

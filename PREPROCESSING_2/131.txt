modern america history and the hunter biding legal team trips into the dog are dancing on his sweet hate onbenthvero this is e venthparo so todatospontrabacxpressdly plan thousands masters already secured their nordetta joined them express piazza can flash men they did it they finally did it as long awaited fanny wells is the d in futon county for a couple of years this as been coming she is very fond of charging re cases she is now going to charge dona trump and eighteen alleged to conspirators in a giant recon use according to the associated press dona trumpet eighteen allies were indicted in gorgon money over their efforts to overturn his twenty twenty election lost in the state with prosecutors using a station normally associated with mobsters to accuse the form president lawyers another age of a criminal enterprise to keep him in power is nearly one hundred page and nivemenites ninety eight pages in details dozens of the ax by rumors allies to undo his defeat including beseeching gorge's republican secretary state to find enough votes for him to win the battle ground state harassing an election worker who faced false claims of fraud and attempting to persuade georgia lawmakers to ago the willow voters and appoint a new slate of electoral college electors favorable to dona trump in one particularly brace an episode end also in outlines o plot involving one of dona's frog's lawyers in accessing voting machines in rural gorge county to steal data from the voting machine company's supposedly although of course the question there is whether they were looking for evidence of the possibility that the voting machines had been hack or something flan county district attorney fanny wills announced the charges last night to day mated on information developed by that investigation a futon county granary return a try bill of indictment charging nineteen individuals with violations of gorge all a writhing from a criminal conspiracy to overturn the result of the twenty twentieth presidential election inviolate the incitement in cute forty one felony count an is ninety seven pages long every indivintial charge in the indictment is charge with on count of violating gorges racketeer in fluent in corrupt organize action act fry participation in a criminal intialprize in futon county gorgon and elsewhere to accomplish the legal goal of blowing donate a trump to fifth the presidential charm of offish beginning on canary twentieth twenty one yesterday was complete mass at the georgia court house apparently there was a brief but is serious incident in which the county weight put up a list of criminal charge to be brought against before a president was were taken down pretty quickly and then of course something very very similar went up very lye last night trumps legal team says the events that have unfolded to day haven shocking and absurd starting with a leak of the presumed and premature indictment before the witnesses had even testified or the granjurers had deliberated and any with the a being unable taller any explanation the indictment which is ninety eight pages long which can of smack of you in forth grate attempting to writ a very long five paragraph assay in the hope the teacher would give you ana even though the lesser was not very good that sort of how the indictment reads its very long it is very details and it sort of goes over a lot of territory the is already been trod the accuse trump and his alleged to conspirators of a hundred and sixty one act many of these acts are things has simple as retreating things s f you look at the actual indictment it actually says that for example it accuses act twenty eight honor about the third day of remember twenty twenty dona john trump met with the speaker of the pensylvania house of representatives in the oval office in discussed holding a special sentsession of the pennsylvania general assembly this was an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy meetings are apparently now illegality it he call trying camp he retreated something from ocean en their people who are suggesting that those sorts of acts are now legal that that is not really how this work to understand how these charges work you first have to understand what recon is the racer influence in corrupt organizations act how that actually works is very controversial law this passed in nineteen seventy originally was aimed at them off and again the thematic predict for the law is that it is very difficult to charge people who are upper level gangsters with the crimes of their subordinates this is why recon was passed originally you would have a low level hetman and he get charged with murder and then he refused to rat on his bass and there is no way to actually try the bossing what they did is they started rapping together the entire criminal organization and in efforts get the low level hetman to flip on his superior and to get thatkite o flip on the boss that was the basic idea if you indict everybody all together it is easier to flip all of the associates by threatening them with the highest level charges that sort of the goal rat you charged the accountant with murder and therefore the account because t e the accounting is now rapped in the giant conspiracy headcount does not want go to jail for murder the accounting does one good jo at all into the account on flips on boss that what racket hearing originally was it comes from the from racket which went an organized the illegal activity all that requires the the violation of recon at least on the federal level in the georgia recon statute which is one this being champion it does make a large stole difference by way thesis a state case in not a federal case because when it means that even if dona trump were elected pressed he could not pardon himself of any charge for which who sound guilty in the state of georgia he could not free himself from that by the way any accusation that the georgia governor whose republican trying camp the bran count could pardon dona trumpfor this is not correct the is a panel in georgia that would actually have to sit and decide weather or not ho rest pardon he also does not have the power to summarily dismiss dies in the state of georgia brain coup to all of the jabber it it is amazing the overtime dona trumpets in trouble there is always a lot of talk about how the republic ins haw a or h responsibility to rescue him and very often that responsibility does not that is not even within their power i mean this goes all the way back to canary six that elf when dona trumpet suggested openly that might pence hade the ability to simply toss out electoral college vote that had been state certifideready he did not is not the responsibility of any of these other people to bale donate trump out when they do not have the legal power to do they the legal power to do lease you can make the argument but bran camp does never have that legal power in anyway anyways when it comes to the state ego act which is very very similar to the federal regal act the way that racateuring basically works is racketeering is broadly to time as requiring at least a couple of the acts of racketeering activity committed within ten years of each other and it also requires that there be a criminal conspiracy in furtherance of a crime criminal conspiracy an furtherance of a crime la gan what that means is that let say you and i we decide that were in conspire to go to the hallmark together not a crime because that is conspiracy without actual furtherance of a crime he unite as hi reign ta rob a bank together that means that if we go to palmar to buy a shot game one buy the shot gun at the local palmar or something normally tat wound be illegal a it becomes a legal because you and i are ow planning to use that shot gun in the robbing of the bank many of the acts that trump and his associates are being accused out our acts corn in furtherance of the crime the real question in this case is not whether dona trump did all the things that the incitement alleges most of the is undisputed the real question in this case is wether it was in furtherance of a criminal activity another words is it a criminal activity for dona trump to pursue a bunch of legal means to forestall his election loss is that stuffy legal now if you'd gottentogether munchers friends and he said let us actually overthrow the federal government time look illegal but then blacksmith would be charging that of the federal level right he be charging him with actual insurrection which he did not he would also be charging him with inclement of ariel which he did not when it comes to georgia the accusation is the dona trump essentially one to overturn the results of the georgia election through illegal means and who is pressuring people to do it through illegal means and is it pretty serious charge again i think that it is doubtful that this could be proved in corporate also happening an plant just the washington be see case this means that you have a local jury that is not going to be freely to president trump now as i say i think in to doubtful charge because for example some the things that are being charged here and some the people being charge are some of the quonncot false electors right these are people who signed in a a a document saying that they were the duly elected electors of the state of georgia when they were not but there is a problem a doubt which is that feu go all thewy back to nineteen sixty for example hoy democrats actually did the same thing how you believe our to was a very sort of racers edge state between publicans and democrats in the nineteen sixty election democrats created and alternative slate of electors who signed a document claiming that they were actually the alternative slate electors that was not illegal at the time if you sign on to a document saying ism a member of the duly elected slate of electors and then the state rejects that is that illegal if you take bad legal advice t is that illegal because it turns out then many of the people who are now being indicted a dona trump's lawyers and the idea here is the donna true would have to show it would have to be shown the dona trump knew for a fact that he lost the georgia election then he then pursue a bunch of means in order to overturn that elections you come back to the same thing the you have n the dracksinthe federal case which has what did dona true know and when did he know it do you think that he actively believe that he won the georgia election and ho is pursuing a bunch of legal strategies in order to assure that win or dit he know that he lost and he did not care and because he knew he lost who attempting to overthrow the election and that is going to be the open question now dona trump his done himself no favors along these lines and let us be clear about this dona true actively reach we didn't article after avid pursue who lost in a senate race in twenty twenty one largely coronal trump told out by not throat in twenty twenty one then run off after he lost dona trump tried to prop him up to run against sprang come for governor because bran camp did not go along with dona trumps georgia sedan against avid pet you got is asked by lie fifty points in the primary against brain cam and dona trump then proceeded to twee out an article suggesting that avid prude had lost because o motor fraud it again the case that fanny wills and company are going to make just to be totally legally fair here the case there going to a temp to makes the dona trump us an actually care at all whether he wins or loses an election his going to claim that he won and then he is going to attempt to overthrow the legitimate results of the election but dona trump also could legitimately believe that he won the georgia election even if that is not true and by the way it is not true the secretary of state of georgia has actually attempted to pry out information from true the boat which is the organization behind two thousand mules and tom the truthvot has refuse to turn over the in formation they stay supports the idea of widespread motor fraud in the state of georgia a that does not matter the real question is intent is it a criminal act to listen's bad legal advice is it a criminal act to call up the georgia secretary state ans a want you to find me eleven thous and right hundred seven boats is that a thing that is criminal or is that just you being an idiot wright you being an idiot not a crime a conspiracy to be an idiot also not a crime well get to more on this in just one second first i want talk to about dailywares most trusted privacy partner an the for mere sponsor of

sketch pen today and next for three months or free on a on your package that is x pe a yes as pans at comslashmen again express van dot come glassman to learn more two things can be to once onethis can be a fairly serious charge the dona trump is facing down particularly in an unfriendly jurisdiction at can also be true that dona trump is being targeted by fanny wills in highly political fashion it is the exact same thing as blacksmith going after him in washington d c although i will say that the gorge case jostsbased on statute is stronger then the washington d c case the washington d c case has a bunch of twisting and turning to try to fit what dona trump did into a bunch of statutes tot do not quite fit this one you can alleys make the argument legally speaking the donaltrump fits within the preview of the statutes in a way that that he does not in sort of the dc case but with all that said why is it that four cases have now come down in five months leading up to the election why that that is a little but suspicious i yet you have four major criminal cases that hae come down and last five fence against the leading republican contender for the presidency belts an awful lotic election interference just to any outside observer obviously as i say this this particular case is extremely broad fanny wills as now given dona trump a deadline to turn himself in and people at the court has mean to political this is people at the courthouse army sands into a mug shot which will easily be the most traffic photo in human history you can imagine the tonal trample smile for the photo because when you smile for your mog shot you at cool and dona true knows that here is a here is fannuwellis explaining the deadline y in giving me the fintift the opportunity two belly tallest to winder roll later then non on day the twenty fit day of august twenty twenty three say donaltrumps going to have to turn himself in probably next week it is worth while noting here that dona true is going to have one defense which is the grand jury was essentially preset bat the bias in the grand jury was essentially preset you will recall the there was a crazy lady who is the four person of the grand jury in this particular case fer name was family cops and a so was the with i believe who then went on a national mediate tour talking about the grand try workings and was extremely weird dona trump's legal team is going to have something to hang their hat on here here is a here is a flashback of family cops the grand jury four person who again is a weirdo personally a men beg off o a jury duty man it is the place where twelve people too due to get out a jury duty get the decide your fate i yet dona trumps team is going to have something to say about all of that as well ill get to more on this in just one second first everything is crazy right now and you need to be able to just calm down and take but the way that i do that is three times o day my according to jewfish ritual i have to pray but if you are not unorthodox yo and you r looking for time in your day to try to you do not commune with the almighty in actually get in touch with something greater hallo can help you

indictment here the people are named trump rudijuliani john eastern who is lawyer mark meadows who is the chief of staff john bistro who is a one of his lawyers as well jeffrey clerk who is a member of the d o ja jean alias one of his lawyers and then there a bunch of more local officials including a bunch people who signed on to the alternative elector scheme cake not how is this gun to play out is very likely that he faces apparently he faces thirteen charges and up to seventy one years in jail an he his now facing we are talking thirteen charges there he saying i believe fourteen charges in washington you see he is facing a bobby of charges in the class document's case are not trump is in serious upward of going jail n as we say because this is a state case he cannot pardon himself the argument that dona trump must be elected precedents that he can escape jail which is an argument ism seeing made right now i do not see how that works i do not see exactly how that argument is even operative in turns of which of these cases poses the largest scale legal threat to dona trump this is the case that obviously poses the larger seal legal threats dona trump the reason being it is broad it is all encompassing at allows fanny wills to tell this over asking story linking together his activities in pennsylvania and his activities in washington he see and his activities in georgia in this broad base conspiracy in which she can connect to all of these dots but smart o her to charge under the redo act to to be simple about the it is not a stupid charge for her to do this don you say that it is corrupt yo can say that it is politicly motivate i the there some truth to that it also happens to be the case that just from a legal perspective what she is doing here is not unintelligent what she is doing here is a weapon design to take down trump no can and note no question trump calls her an out of control in very corrupt district attorney he declares the charges are part of a which hunt the case again is the fourth targeting trump just this year alone the the this case probably will run all the way through the election because it is very large scold now she has says and this this part this party crazy she says shunts to try all of the dependence at once li put them all in a room together and try them at once sort that scene where garvey dent tries everybody all together in the dark night that youremember that seems he brings in all of the corrupt mob stars and put theme all in her room together and all their lawyers are protesting and all o the rest of thus and he does not throw scare into them bast part of it an what redoes designed to do as i suggested earlier is to get the account to flip on he hetman who flips on the headman my part of this is going to be an attempt to get people who are a round trump to flip on trump to avoid criminal charges when is this extricate to take place that is still up in the air wills did not say whether she is spoken with special prosecutor blacksmith at this point which probably means that she has she said she does not care whether this goes first or last which means that it will go all the way through the election without it out trump wrote on truth social the which in continues nineteen people indicated to night including the form president of the united states me by an out of e control and very corrupt district attorney who campaign and raised money on i will get trump and what about those indictment documents put out to day long before the grand jury even bored and then quickly withdrawn sounds rig to me why did not they indite two point five years ago becausethey want to do right in the middle of my political campaign which hunt and again that may very well be the case that does not mean he is not in legal danger two things can be true at once as always as always he can be illegal danger it can be a witch hunt it can be an attempt to take him out in the election the real question for a publicans is whether they are going to go long with the bate here n the obvious bate is nominate trump said he can take his revenge as hi said before i do not see how that worked even legally speaking if he goes to jail in georgia he will still be in jail in georgia as president of the united states there is the civil suit that's filed against dona against bill canton when he as president of reunited states by polojones at went forward it is why the conical link scandal happen we have never had a case where a state criminal targe as filed against the sitting president of the united states before he became president of the united states ow do you knowhow tat would work ism not are anybody knows how that would work what say that you get hit with a murder charge and you run for the presidency true jail are you automatically freed from jail on themurder charge we get let say the ted canned a she got an hit with a murder charge or at least a manslaughter charges he should haven in the kismaryjo cabana in massachusetts and then he continue to serve in the united state senate presumably he still to gone to jail i do not now tiny others work can much here anybody knows how any of this works georgia represents probablythe most serious threat to trumps liberty according to a wide variety of legal analysts including any macarthy it is it is highly likely at this point as i say it is hard to imagine the trump escapes all legal consequence for all of these charges i am not sure how he escapes what's can a happen him in washington see or georgia and we n we say that it is outrageous it is it also means that the glass is now been broken what we are about to see next is what truly what were about to see next is republican to as all over the country star to indite people jobidon four things racket tearing and corruption as rices president of the united states once the glass has ben broken it cannot be unbroken the glass is now been broken the predictable result of this is not the dona from unselected president the predictable result of this is that lawyer now be comes the way the political opponents go after each other on the regular in the united states and that is going to be a really really dangerous thing remember donaltrum who is con side wildly out oath bound o propriety when dona's from said to misery canton that selected president went she would be in jail you remember he said the during in o bate she said well what would you even do if your present at cover president you be in jail and then he did not do anything about in and a lot of people myself included thought well that is probably good we wafture do not want people persecuting their political opponents when that would clearly have democrats all over the country from manhattan you now georgia to washington to see to florid going after they're political opponents that is not a bell that can be wrung get ready for republicans to do the exact same thing as soon as they have the power and the grounds to do that swore we stands countries the things are about to get worse not better all those people on the left who thing that this sort of dit this is restoring rule of law and all the nonsense nonsense all this is going to do is going to achieve a ease to the bottom because again once the law can be used as a weapon directly against your political opponents why exactly which you allow the other side to use that weapon and to avoid culpability for their use of that weapon it is hard to see exactly how this does not and poorly for petty much everybody will get to more on this in one second firsts everyone knows how let my relic mattress did that just launch their newest most hight and collection the helices let hulk is hardest years of expensive mattresexbert he is

not do it with regard to your mattress within your know spend eight hours the night on minimum had over o quick sleep dot come slash bending that quick sleep dot come slash ben then there are the to conspirators again the real question hers whether rude julioni or mark meadows decide to flip on dona true as the waste journal points out aloud these people all are well known to defendant and the'reall legal advisers now we already know that some of these people are rudigulyony is highly likely to get convicted in this case the reason t rude julianiis holy likely to yet convicts in this cases because he is openly had to apologized to a particular pole worker for suggesting and applying that she was corruptly bringing in empty ballast to the futon county not counting location knowing presumably that she was not in fact doing that one you people who are caught false statements it should not be that hard to flip them kidney pathic the question is how strong is there loyalty going to be donate trump that had the loyalty of subordinates for very very long time an the class my documents case for example as well not and abut low level aids for maintaining they are unwillingness tobasiclly flip on him is the coot hold the sure kidney power does is thing kidney pall is somebody who is is going to tuna stick by her worse here and hold by present en trump hard to see that five of the to ti finding juliany tell johnnesmen kennel chesbro that jeffrey clerk are identifiable though unnamed as cop conspirators in a separate federal indictment from jacksmelt some the people who in to be called in this case and again it will be televised some the people who can t be called in this case will include i assume the current secretary of stapebrad rains burger in georgirum bran keep because he was called by dona trump could actually the called to testify in this particular case it will be televise it will be a spectacle and it will be an electoral disaster for republicans if this thing on a the with rally election i another a letter republicanswhere n love it the idea that the in a backfire on democrats to that the attempt do plnncl get trump is going to lead to a revenge play by trump that ends with the republican in the white house have love to see the poll day to supporting that have get to see one soda of data supporting that there is a lot of there is a motivated suggest that the ttargonin of trump has helped him the primaries have get to see one piece it one a single piece of data suggesting that the america people a can a react to all of this lawyer against trump be voting for trump have got there's not one poll showing it seriously not one even the most trump friendly poles do not how that what they show is than majority of the america public believes trump should be indited on something which is a very bad indicator they i think there wrong but it does not matter what i think tie matters whit the america public thinks cause there one tor can be boring also is trump likely to wind georgia in the twenty twenty four election if the entire case in georgia is about how he was basically pressuring people interchanging votes or in to finding lots whatever t is that going to help his case in the state of georgia remember bran keep one his reelect running away from stay aprons in the state of georgia meanwhile the more trump friendly bandits hernial walker lost avid perdu lost do you think georgia are really fond of the sort of stuff i have doubt if town trump loses gorge all the rest of the states onyx matter and by the way that for the the horizon a republican party continues to keep doubling down on the sort ofstuf you think that conto help them an certainlinn help them in twenty twenty two habit wisgonson pennsylvanian michigan is any of this going to help i say this because again whatever sympathy i have for president from being tartan i have sympathy for president and true being targeted for shore the question for me as a conservative who stops widen who stops the bad policy that facts me and my family and you who stops all of those bad policies yet you enough sympathy for somebody while still recognizing that the thing that shapes your life as an america is who is the president of the united states and yes it shapes your life that the d o j is going after political opponents cause those political opponents could be but the only way to stop that is tower the only way to stop that is to put some of in the whorehouse wo contractually clean out the d o j if don trump cannot make it it does know one any favors to run him this a really serious question this going to linger over the entire election cycle right now the court dates are spread out all over twenty twenty four we already know that the classic documents case is likely to begin some time in may right right in the middle of the election cycle lay just before the conventions this case is likely to begin yououldamagion it'll gust september right before the election there is every possibility that the jack smith incitement and s is in a start even before the primaries this thing is in a lurk over the entirety of the election nay have all f these other people what i say could flip in clouding people raise stalling smith hos in the landau area lawyer who filed and unsuccessful last challenging bisons gorge victory house subject he was the subject of a complaint from a legal at strong group to the state a seeking disciplinary measures where robot chilly who is been it with ten counts is a personal injury lawyer he presents a gorge state enters with video clips you claim shot election workers at a downtown atlantes o precinct double and triple counting boats and turns out at that was not actually the case and is the question is whether he knew that or not do yo think these low level officials want to go to jail for years on end hormonal trump do you thing that is a thing at they want to do and this is why what fanny wills is doing yo youcorrupt as it may be bad as it may be for the country it is smart legally bees the chances of flipping somebody are pretty significant it is it is this is this this is going to be wild ah and and by while that mean really really terrific for the country run pretty much every single level o cane just a second we will get to jo bison he is supposed to be captains

peal back in twenty twenty whatever appeal it was is that he was supposedly a big contrast with dona trump if outlook at the latest poles from gallop just before the election they looked at character dimensions worthy various candidates and what they found is that sixty six per cent of america voters thought that mobile note was likable as post to thirty six per cent without the don trump was likeable fifty two per cent thought that mobile was trustworthy is post to forty per cent without the trump was honest and trustworthy but most importantly fifty four per cent of america said that job and cared about people them as upmost only forty five percent who said the dona trump cared about people then will this has always been the lie about join he is not ones an trustworthy is not particular likable and he does not care about any one outside of his immediate circle this is why everybody who is a member of the biding family is rich if you re inside the circle he makes you rich if you are outside the circle he does not care about you and yours put this on display a multiplicity of times from afgannistand to most recently this laminate fire that killed at least a hundred

presence the immensely of him duspeering down at the abyss but hit so seen at all course on is refer to present though he was a at was of e was flying one that fore wan not landing i was peculiar was not at was we stool bath nog eleven we serve to as to he bush with h hellhole in the dressing the fifth as this was a man who who guilt the crises when it comes to the public relations hand he lost the touch when it came to latrine o what happened i think it was a a gan a break down at a level in in that particular case a the the pilots runs tract not to come in it would have ben more but obligation to bring their wain in i then to land i think it right respect it would've been better just to be your had to get that tin on the ground there tin keep it have ben the commander indeed you remember all this he remember when tad crews was in cannon for vacation and a freeze his taxes and supposedly the senator from texts had to be on sight suffering through the frees despite the fact that really the was a state level issue a again hurricane carina was a state level issue it was the governor's issued really it was the mayor's issue when i cane to new organs and when it came to what was going on in texts that really had very little to do with the senator who has very little power over any of that but this is the standard to which we hold our presidents of the united states it is my baracomama a big plotted during hurricane sandy when he showed up it new jerking to a big old hog from cries crispy remember this ans we of course sore shall be wish got rids of ant also what a with was jobidon responding two crises the answers he just ignores them and again this is not the first told member that time he said his gin a visit east palisade oho red train blew up and sad much of toxic wasting to the air and his own secretary f transportation peopled judge did not show up for quite a while in fact down frump beat him there yo member how jobidon side he was going visit east pausing oho well it has now been months and months and months no sign of president forbid number that time when we had giant crisis on our southern border we know now because it continues and join still has not made a her yous visit to the southerner this in fact is the way that bite govern he governs it a way that i the were any other president it would be treated as the sort of dereliction that it is treated as when it is just not jobidon but as soon as its jobidon transpose to ignore it and really is quite incredible a couple of hours a he he seen a couple of hours on rehoboth beach then he was asked about the rising dethtoln who this after to a fourteen vacation another he went back for another forty vacation to rehuboh beach delftware where e sits on the beach basically by himself being an old man and here's a picture of the president of the united states hundreds of feet away from the photographers sitting there enjoying his wife he was asked about the rising dethtol an how and he said no comment then he went a bicycling which is really important for the president of the united states to be a nicely bicycling obviously and tat hews asked about a potential visit to mall and he said the same thing the he said about east palestine oho he said we are looking at it here was it joint ah you in we no comment we are looking at it and am by calculator now if it is heartless for everybody else why would it not be heartless for jobidon the answer is it is heartless for jobidon in fact jobidon is now planning to travel to lake tohonevada on fridge an hes get t spend a week there leaving the following thursday fourteen vacation followed by a forty vacation in aware followed by a week long vacation in taco you he would not want to break up his vacation folks you would not you would not want him to worry to much about what is going on in mall this is not a carrying individual the sign who cares only about himself this been true his entire political career it is why he is congenital liar it is why he says things that are untrue on the regular it is why he lied when he suggested that i drunk driver killed his wife and his daughter in a car crash in the god was not drunk it is why he goes to veteran's houses and then he tells them wounded veteran's houses or gold star parent or gold stars abuses and he tells them that he send to died in battle in a rock or some such nonsense all join cares about is jobidon he is a mean sunbagon jobidon is not in fact a carrying president when he says no comment or when he says we are looking at a visit or when he says again no comment another when goes on more vacations who were cuppas to believe this person who has wells of empathy e honestly this is entire kitchen twenty twenty he felt your pain that was not a god actors it couldn't do it to canton but people wanted to believe because they believe the donnas from did not feel that cantonal trump of course being selfish and narsicistic and all the rest supposedly well jobidon is far more selfish and narsicistic then dona trump he just quieter about it this is why he has no problem plea rising and getting thrown out of his own presidential campaign for it mean this was jobidon stick for years and years and years and just remains in an object of enormous astonishment to me that the media willing to go along with this narrative the jobidon was a decent elderly fellow who truly cares about people you what is the evidence of any of this by the way i what the people are truly dishonest with other people on routine basis that is a sign of arsis at means they don't care about you the siren personal relationships anistran politics when people lie to you regularly it means they do not respect yo it meansthey do not treat you as a normal human being because if they treated you as they would wish to be treated presume then on be lie to but yobidonosn't care about hat o was later yesterday morning jobidon try to walk all of this back he treated out as the resident of why even wore in the loss of life an devastation taking place across their beautiful home we morn with them have said not only our prayers are with those impacted but every assist we have will be available to them here is the latest and the says that feet temporary sheltering assistance is now available for resident toward displaced from their homes that by the while fires blowing survivors to shelter in wo tells or motels temporarily as they level belong from housing plan and then guys the labor focus on getting ache to the survivors including critical needs assistance a one time seven hundred dollar payment per household offering relief during an unimaginably difficult time seven hundred dollars per household now far be it from me to suggest that we should just throw bags of cash people but if the idea here is that you have a federal crisis that necessitates a federal response seven hundred dollars a household that's thieving in a paper two weeks of groceries fear family in jobidens america seven hundred dollars is not going to do it thing on property devises onto leheina five points i billion dollars in property damage don to leheina seven hundred dollars then to beginning to scratch the surface we set a hundred and fifteen billion dollars to you crane and you you thing that is god expenditure of defense when ye get and asking yourself why a hundredand fifteen billion dollars of add crane and less than two million dollars to the people of leheina which is what that wouldamountobes there's at many households in leheina and then widen says we are making sure all residents receive critical in formation they can take steps toward to move for in their recovery this includes translating materials in to the most common language is spoken in the out of my god mean the aching on o trains lay government materials into foreign languages wow all the sacrifice o the amazing on the ground nature of all of this easy he is lounging at the beach and were suppose to believethat he gives two damns about this of course he does not hoiden as always cares only about hoiden which of course is why the hunter widen situation continues it is on going cover up to hundred bidensteem is now very very angry at prosecutors a very angry the done another right to be angry the done because jobidonstheoje hot ta sweethardeal with hunterbiden when nowt turns out that offend teem is really ticked off at the done we but because that that pledge blew up in open cord according to the waster journal hundred bisons legality said late sundae the justice department had decided to renal on the previously agreed upon pleagreement fascinating a dispute that is threatening o become a factor in the twenty twenty four presidential race as present by insects re election a major part of the bochteel hundred bids agreement to enroll in diversion program for gunoffenders should stand o the lawyers argued prosecutors had agree not per to a peppered felony gun possession charge against the youngrbidon as long as he remains at drug free and agrees to never on a fire arm again is he turned s t he intends to abide by the turns of the agreement an expects prosecutors to do the same that is actually not what was in there part of that diversion program for gun offenders pleadseal said that anything tangentially related to the tax chargers would also be taken off the board produces on fridge disclosed the pletolks with the president son had broken down h mericarland then name delftware you us to turning gave wise as a special council which of course as we talked by yesterday is completely insane you are not supposed to take the person who was not a special council and was the investigating person and then make him the special council the minute that he gets called out for the sweetheart tea there's obviously a cover up design of preventing testimony from that person in front of congress it is pretty impressive and meanwhile democrats continued to kick those goalposts into the ocean represent of jerk mascots says there is no evidence that any of this links back to jowls is not a fire cry from hunter bide never did anything wrong and jo never knew anything about thus and jo as never connected in anyway there is no evidence to link anything back to job was true about a colone with regard to murder they'd get him on a tax charge whores because the is no evidence that jo bison took money to erectly into his bank count of it mean benefit from hunter taking tens of millions of dollars in's the biding family bank accounts wild statement here is represent of jerk mascots hanging his hat on a a very very slim hook republicans the money publicans an house now they cannot thin now try i he has the trip crown i an i cans i now to in o the final for i mean hes making o four an on every atman we thought he was going to get at they they cannot the him for the whole i dead then in i ma jo biting job him ho the had o biding ban family like tome ow jo bin of e son is tons to plane but there is not a single shred of t evidence that has anything to do with jo baton this is the what they a hanger had i if were talking tout things you on have evidence for how at evidence the donnas from colluded with russia you an after that for four years about evidence that dona trumpetcommitted major campaign finance violations don't have evidence of at you recharging him criminally in manhattan he it evidence for the charges the bringing against him in washington do see with regard to canary sixth the evidence there is real slim i do not see augurs stopping your roll for half a second but jam rascal is doing the hares he s says they have not even laid a glove on job oh the hackery oh the unbelievable hackery here and for et a release o report about all of the foreign government a monuments millions of dollars wichand document that dona trunk pocketed at the hotels at the golf courses through business deals when he was president in that his family got but they not laid the glove on job barren as president they have not been able to show any criminal corruption on his part as residence they have be able t morning criminal corruption as president does hare t even the allegations the allegation is that there is criminal orruptionman who's vice residence not even naming the same piet by the way the evidence of criminal corruption is that his own a tried to keep the hunter biding scandal with a lid on it that is the actual evidence and we have testimony from iris whistle lowers to exactly the at effect again i think the house of cards that is jobidon's reputation is crumbling i thinks con materialize if republicans have the brains to you know run somebody who is able to make that the issue democrats or to distract a of course going to now apparently insist president trump every day of this week everyday of next week and every week to come ant's precisely what your bide one because again when you folks in on robin what you see is a corrupt elderly man who does not care about anyone except him and his immediate family and if you folk sons a trump don trump is likely to lose that is the simple father and dona trump makes it easy for his opponents when he prayers people lour lumber for lumber is a pretty obviously a crazy person and a an dona trump on fridge apparently praise air pretty fulsomely an a vidioclip posted to social media she flattered him and the he did oppose with her he said it is great to have you you for card your very opinionopinionated lady i have to tell you that in my opinion i that and then she prayed satin he pray sir and all of the rest trump had actually offered to hire lumber a little while ago lumber of course has a done things suggest that case disansis didn't naturally have cancer that she fake tor exaggerated her cancer she said the artery telegreene is a leeward who says she is spreadingall the truth that she is just spreading her legs a for lump is a delight an don trump once again associating with thou know people who flatter him but is that a great way to staff is that a great way to run a campaign i have some doubts you a meanwhile the craziest judicial ruling of the day according to the your times a group of young people in montane when a landmark lost ut on money when a judge rule that the states failure to consider climate change when a proving a fossil feel projects was unconstitutional the decision in the suit held versus montane coming during summer of record heat ans elywile affairs marks of victory in the expanding fight against government support for oiled gas and coal the burning of which has rapidly warmed the planet dulia nelson the founder of our children trusts which is a legal on profit group that brought the case ism behalf of miners said quote as fires rage in the west fuel by fossil feel pollution to day's ruling an montane is a game changer the marks of turning point in this generation's effort to save the planet the ruling means that montane must consider climate change when deciding whether to a prove or to renew fossil feel projects now it is an absurd ruling because normally in order to sue you have to have standing he standing means that you are damage by the thing and it is don enough to have general standing if you do not your a law and the law damages you you cannot just sue they'd don general standing the you do not the law for example the increased taxes your person who pays taxes that did it give you standing to sue that is a political question ha workout standing it is got i hate you with my car now you have standing to so me but in this particular case the court suggested that the mental anguish undergone by children because of climate change gave them standing to sue montane for not considering climate change when determining whether or not to drill for oil family flower spokeswoman for the attorney general said the ruling's our not surprising from a j g to let the panties turning put on a week long tax par fund an publicity on those supposed to be a trial it is ha bazar bazar case for sure michael burger who the executive director of the satin center for climate changelitigation o colombia sad quote this was climate science on trial and what the court is found is matter facts that the science is rights d now we have courts to busting the science is right and by the science is right that means that if montane drills for oil then indubitably this is going to create massive climate change that oltilliar kids because now it is the job of court presumably decide the science pretty incredible ruling first of all not the purview of course actually and i out else is not purvuof sort to simply give standing to plinths who do not have it in the first place the botanic case revolved around language in the state constitution the guaranties resident the right to a clean and helpful environment and stipulates the state individuals are responsible for maintaining an improving the environment for present and future generations but the right to clean and helpful environment does not mean that the state does not have to do a balancing routine and figure out whether or not it is worth while for the citizens to say drill now apparently all the young people can as so and states ranging from hoy to ta to virgin is the first kind of case this to go to trial in the united states the state contended tat mountains missions are miniscule when compared against the rest of the globes the plant ties argue the state has to do more to consider how omissions are contributing to trout wild fires another growing risks that it is an insane ruling obviously many of the youngsters testify in about the effects they had witness now we have fifteen year old testifying about how they saw the it was really hot outside and this is now the ground to shut down drilling in the state of montane thanks to this idiot judge not have a question have question why is it exactly that young people could not so wo stop for example pretty much every government program was the it'll take on debt really why not why why do not they say that the government has a responsibility to make sure that those who cannot vote are not burden wit the cost of policies the are undertaken now that seems to a violation of equal protection for example you the theoretically make a crazy argument that the equal protection class which says that every citizen entitled to equal protection of t e law should protect people who are not able to vote yet in their interests for example if yo saddle the country with take thirty two trillion dollars to national debt that is con hit my kids and my kids kids should not the be be able to so and tad the federal government should not beagle to pass laws that raise that that if they are actually going to actually spend money the may be people who are above the age of eighteen should have to pay for that thing is that the direction the were going to now have judges going i highly dock the left once to go down this this path first o all can n obstruct down at the spring for level began obviously specious and stupid but the fact that this is how the let with love court to rule just demonstrates once again the left has no limitswhen it comes to power they truly do not the will suggest that the right is power hungry when the supreme court says we will not step into the abortion of ate we will instead kicked back to the state in federal level that apparently is an egregious usurpation of power by the supreme court but it is a protection of rights when a local judge says than an entire state now has to stop drilling because munch of fifteen year old are mad which is literally with this decision is pretty incredible stuff well all of the society into a really fascinating piece by avid brookstoday over the aplanatic is called how america got mean here is what datebook says says over thastehtyears or have beenobsessd with two questions the firsts while america become sad the rising rates of depression been while publicized as have the rising depths of despair from drugs alkohollan suicide but other statistics are similarly troubling my second related questions is why have america become mean as recently talking with a restaurant owner we said he as to eject a customer from his restaurant from rude or cruel behavior once week something than ever use to happen i had nurse at a hospital told me many on her staff are leaving the process profession because patients have become abusive at the four extreme of meanness hate crimes rose in twenty twenty to their highs level in twelve years social trust is plummeting into thousand to thirds of america houses gave the charity in twenty eighteen few than half did the words that to fine our age rekofmenace conspiracy polarization mass shooting strata safe spaces we are in fashion some sort of emotional relational and spiritual crises what exactly is going on davidbrooks has a theory as to what exactly is going on here davidbrok says that there are a fewdiferent stories one and technology story social media is driving us all crazy second the sociology story we have stop participating and community organizations at are more isolated third the demography story america long an white dominated nation is becoming a much more never country a change that is milling o white america in a panic and fourth the economy story high levels of economic an equality n in security have left people afraid to alienated and pessimistic he says that he agrees to certainextent with all these stories but i do not think any of them is the deepest one he says the most important story about why america hod become satin alienated and route i believe puls of the simple we inhabit a society in which people are no longer trained and how to treat others with kindness and consideration our societies become one in which people feel license to give their selfishness free rain the story ism going t tells about morals and a healthy society web of institutions family schools religious scripts community organizations workplaces helps form people into kind and responsible citizens the sort o people who show up for one another we live in a society that is terrible at moral formation he says the moral formation comprises three things first helping people to learn to restrain their selfishness he says that america used to be goo o the second teaching basic social and ethical skills and third helping people find a purpose in life now he is right about all of this but he is missing we exactly all of this fell apart now part of it was the increasing atomization of america society with talked about and this ties back into the decline of church attendants for example it ties back into the rise of social media now the the sort of move toward individual expression as opposed to a communal a communal obligation that led to this sort of break down obviously he says schools began to abandon moral formation in the nineteen forties and fifties he was the post or period saw similar changes at the college level he says questions what is the meaning of life had livelihood life lost all purchase it is were after fear people decided that moral reasoning was not really relevant psychologist person g grow especially in family and educational matters it to vocabulary forming virtually all public discussion of the moral life of children its be the privatizing morality the the attempt to get away from the idea of a common good he says the moral instincts here are falling into a pattern that philosopher alisetheir mackantire called eroticism whatever feel good feels good to me is moral which of course what we have talked about is most lust who notice the press of de moralization as it was occurring thought a bland moral related this and empty consumers would be the result you do you and all to me that is not what happened jonathan hight says when your raisin a culture without ethical structure you become internally fragile you do not have a moral compass ogive you direction no permanent ideals to which you can swear ultimate allegiance and people star to suffer from what evil dulcimer has called enemy this is true i man all of this is true there is something else that is happen though and that is and attack on all these institutions a motivated attack and a reliance on the niceness of the america public to tolerate the attack suit is not just an mantis is true a lot of the moral education when away that underwriting niceness its kindness and kindness and niceness are not the same thing being nice to some one means that you just are inoffensive to them being kinds some one very often means you looking out for them means that toucan tell them a thing that maybe they do not want a here if you have a friend who is a drug abuser and you simply say you do you that may be nice but it is not kind if you have a child who does bad things on the regular and you just let them do it that may be nice but it is not actually kind but what is happen is over but kindness is undergirded by a belief in some sort of higher good because what it means is that you do have to use judge you would do have to be judgemental you have to know that not being a drug magnet it is actually morally preferable to being a dramatic a yatuallyhave to say that certain behavior is better than other behavior it is an act of kindness to chide your fellow when he goes astray but niceness says but that is mean niceness says that that is actually something you should not do and when you have an entire moral system that is base not on kindness but on niceness when you wipe away the moral framework and all your left with is nicest of course niceness is going to fall apart because what ends up happening is that people take advantage of the niceness niceness last only long as some one's fist does not much your face but it turns out that does not last very long it turns out when don't have a shared moral framework kindness devolves into niceness and that niceness has taken advantage of by people who have no care about you at all and the people whoosh do not abide by niceness are the beneficiaries initially a then you have an actual prisoner's dilemma a game theory prisoner's dilemma in which the person who benefits the most of the person who is not nice violates all the rules because while rope playing by the nice rules there is done what they want and their getting ahead and they are winning and you say well hold up a second i do not want o play by those rules i net con play by those rules either and then its just a race to the bottom and you can see this by the way in the pulling data democratspor example in the ninth nineties by late nineuninies democrat's thought that most republic ins were actually bad people and republicans still thought that most democrats ore just wrong and then around twenty thirteen twenty fourteen the staffs change and republican start say all may be democrats are also bad people and both sides now think the other side is bad people why what because again democrats we are relying on the niceness of republicans well at the same time taking advantage of the the lack of kindness in the system avid brook is right when he says that lack of moral education is the problem that of course is true what it is also people be aggressive in taking advantage of the niceness of others and that means social radicalism that is designed to tear down the institutions that is what this is really about inn actual attempt at dissolving the institutions themselves be this where avid brooks goes wrong be avid brooks now he sides for example ted lasso right as as an example of a restoration of niceness he says in the summer of twenty twenty the serious he last proper when lasso describes his goals socricoach he could mention the championships he hopes to win or some other conventual metric of success but he says for me success is not about the winds and losses it about helping these young fellows be the best versions of themselves on and off the field he says that is ha two sentence description of moral formation but as it turns out what tad lasso really ans up being is a moral relax of us he basically in the series whatever floats your boat is the morality of the series by the end therefore no actual real expectations other than sort f a generic niceness everybody else he cannot build a society on nicest no society functions on nice niceness is a by products of kindness when you kill kindness niceness will not remain meanwhile the economy looks it is about to turn bad i do not understand people who say that basically what goes up is spring to stay up and ever come down s modern military they this idea they conduct in late to currency and nothing filleter happen about that to get forty year high in inflation right now a lot o lets are bring are blinking rather particularly true in china and by the way china is in incipient rooming disaster area i an entire episode my new serious facts villblon you to where it really is seeing a lot of light and also over on ex slash twitter where has hundreds of thousands of yes says probably at about a million views total at the went on various platforms talking about the various promise the chins experiencing but chins in serious trouble there demographically completely upside own they've way more old people than they have young people to no ones can real bite bills they get a serious that problem gat really serious steal that problem and they are now pursuing a tragic economic policies that cut them off from the rest of the world market which means the canopy use their comparative managed properly they are really in n bleep load of trouble here right now corning t the walls for journal china latest property crisis threatening to spill over ins the broader economy worrying invested in causing a broad market sell off chines stock fell in honking and mainland china on money with real estate developers electric vehicle manufactures and other companies in economically sensitive sectors to lining the most the thing saying insects which is loaded with chines companies dropped one point six per cent taking its ear to date loss to five point one per ends the financial struggles of country garden holdings china top surviving privately run helper have been frontal enteron submiss t interest payments on two u s dollar bonds a week ago the property giant said that over the week end trading in eleven of wont dominated domestic ponds has been suspended and intends to discuss repayment plans with investors the property sectors gone from being a mass of contribute oft countries over all growth to a mass of drag on the economy the is because china basically had a giant pyramid scheme going here they would take retirement funds from the people who lived in china and thy would tell them that if they invested in empty shell of apartments in got cities that this would eventually turn into real money because those those cities would then be populated and you make a month money on on those on those shell apartments and turns out that there was no one picking up rental on those shell apartments on the other end the money just disappeared into these vast cities tat are completely empty at this point all built around debt new home sales increase in the first few month of twenty twenty three providing a glimmer of hope but the market then turned in aril and itiuaide tails of china top developers have slumped eversions chase now dropping into the flection households are now borrowing lest because they racked up high levels of saving chines banks extended the equipment of forty seven plenty billion dollars in new loans in jury that is down nearly half from the same month one year ago their currency is depreciating pretty significantly at this point again if china's economy takes a serious ship that can o have a major in packed on america markets it s token to be all roses for us because we are intertwined with the chines economy again thanks to a lot of bad form policy decision making over the course of last few decades particularly the decision to suggest that if we intertwined our economy with china that magically china would liberalized which of course they did not meanwhile those higher costs which are going to be brought on the america economy thanks to the claps of thechinese economy those higher costs are going to be exacerbated by a new model in the west of subsidization and a tenured trade lings according to the waster journal the world's biggest economies are offering huge subsidies and cut throat waste to win the industry of the futures the end the losers are all the countries that cannot pay up but the reality is that thee the losers are also the industries that a subsidized that money comes from somewhere subsidies you just take money from some one and you give i to another person in the hopes that second person is going to use the money abetter the wise the government picking winners and losers how do they chose who gets to win and who gets to lose subsidized industries by thewy overtime ten become fat they ten n become lazy they tend to have migrates of union is ationwench drives up labor cost the eventually to get under cut is the story of the america car market by the way from the nineteen fifties through the nineteen seventies in the nineteen fifties whose america cars all over the world by the nineteen seventies tooth was eating america lunch there is a reason for that when you subsidized industries to the point were those industries do not really have to worry about their cost structure they charge too much that thy be such o cost too much their post their part start to cost to much an eventually somebody undercuts them right now the level of em of subsidization is really really high in major developed countries ism not sure why people think that this is o a particular good idea particular when you are talking about totally inefficient industries clean energy the use is now offering three hundred sixty nine billion dollars and incentives in fooling for clean ever chis part of the inflation reduction act the starting to see a few people who are on wore building here but mainly because they know that the united states government is in a pony up for a bunch of this this is also combine with the down called globalization now the lot people o talk about global sort globalism as a bad nineteen i i agree in the all said globalist are bat if you pungent international governments america giving up their power to international organizations i agree if what your saying is that international trade is a bad thing by your mind you that if i were not for international trade w if you do not the inflation now wait instill international trade gets cut off a the realities we all benefit from those wide open shipping lanes the united states has been insuring essentially since world ware too when those start to fall apart when trade goes down the costs on every thing the currently pay for its can go up radically it is not just after of globalization helping low in come countries we are once poor countries south core or attain it is also that the standard of living in the united states is wag better now than it was in nineteen eighty n i you do not believe me go look at the craft people had in their house in nineteen eighty seriously pick up a product to nineteen eighty they suck they are terrible i understand ever wants to believe tut the middle class has not gotten any richersince nineteen eighty bast on false pictures of the wage staffs but that is not true the stuff of the average mental class person has now is better than petty much anything that rich person nankin nineteen eighty that is because what real world economics is about is the creation of new goods and services that are better and cheaper and that is in effect of globalization as we on wine globalization and as we direct money in subsidization we are onto get a slower economy that is going to be the the end results in all of this and for one of the lucky few in one of these subsidized industries you feel real gadabout yourself but if you are not you are cortical to up pretty much everywhere else it'll gate time for some things i and then some things that i hate sot things that i to day it turns out that terrible economic policy has some afrofacts this we republicans in the united states should take hart in the fact that eventually jobidon should pay for his economic crimes here if republicans have the brains to run somebody who actually has shot at winning that be he big one not thing the toilet from coodnwin he could but its sampan would actually have to be about the issues not about whatever the legal issue he has to day is about the reason i say this is because right now argentina is showing this the possibility which is kind of wild according to the her times a far right libertarian candidate one argentine is open presidential primary election on sundae a surprise showing for politician wants to adopt the america dollar as argentines official currency and embrace is comparisons tonal trump how your delay fifty two a congressmen economics and former to keep on insured thirty percents of the boat with ninety six percents of the balls counted making the front runner for the presidency in the fall general elections it as a clear shot at leading argentina argentine is general election in october which we could go to a nonmember run off will not become a new test of strength of the far right across the world again the way that this works that if you are anywhere to the right of coral marks according to the our times you are far right although hard right forces have gained a new influence and several power functions in recent years including just germany france italy sweeten an viddlan this suffer some defeats including in spain and brazil miles has pitched himself is the radical change at the collapsing argentine economy needs he could be a shock to the system if elected besides this o currents his ideas about the currency an central bank his proposed drastically lowering taxes cutting public health spending closing or privatizing all station enterprises and eliminating the health education environment ministries sarcomas of the argentine scent left finance minister finish second in the primary just twenty one per cents of the boat the third place finish patrician bullish is it conservative and shes in third place o seventeen which means the to out of the top three are conservatives and nearly the top to the sundae results showed that argentines three supper coalitions have similar levels of support make an unlikely that anyone will actually win in the first round these to right coalitions candidates received to combined a twenty eight percent of the one on sundae the centra left received twenty seven present both slightly less than meals total as well mule said were not only going to and curchonerism that is reference to former president cristinthe fernondos the cerchener were also going to and the useless parasitic criminal political cast that is sinking this country he also o thanks his sister and all of his dogs who are each named after a conservative economists which is sum men this is the result of bad left going policy see this way politics works when left run things thy to a bad job people swivel to the right if you give them some one who is capable of talking out the issues people actually want to here about oke other things that i you to had to apparently reverse course after they attempted to throttle a video that we did for our new serious facts we did o vino on to about the organization warm which is

democrats ranging from burned standers toggle an news are waiting in the wings for jobidon to fall down on the job from pal spells out an unclear path ford on inflation and we examine the latest republican poles and benshgur the sit bench burn show benshpirishrosponserba expressvepien protector all my pray today expressivepians i come flashes joined displaying a very very dangerous game ism just mean with regard to his presidential run against the presumptive republican nomineewright now doll from i mean with regard to his own parties jobidon is non existent as just a human being according to the republican at national committee hoiden has spend twenty three of the past thirty days on vacation later this week he is going back tor humor beech for more his entire strategy as a president of the united states is now apparently the same stray used in getting to the presidency which is hide in a basement in delftware and just stay there an every coffin they open the coffin and they rolled job on out and then they marinate his mouth for him and then they move him back in to his coffin then the door shuts handpick but here is the problem there lot of democrats were are particularly satisfied with all of this particularlybecause the person who is backing up jobidon is also wildly on popular in comely arris republicans are not just going to run against job and there also going to run against the person who presumptively will pick up the pieces when god forbid something happens to the current presidents of the united states this is we presumably you have burned sanders back in new samphire over the week en burned has no business in new samphire the ownerison for burning be new samphire is because he thinks maybe just maybe job name can be around if it is time to run for president again and everybody has talked about the gave nuwsums of the worldly gets him in a moment everytocsby comely hairs people forget that the person who won kiwi and new samphire in the last democratic primary season was neither of those two characters comely hairs dropped out before even hi californium the person who won was burned and if it had not been for the entire democratic party in for structure coming together to stop burned stands from winning the nomination they literally all got together then they all endorsed jobidon simultaneously if that does not happen burned standers is the nominee for the democratic party and there is every belief that dona from wins re election over burned standers o burned is getting active again and i got a telly common is am must be amazing for your rare blood because apparently being a complete leech on other people for your entire life which is burned stander's story one most useless people in all america history burned sander's entire life has been built around useless uselessness taking america public dollars and all the he is just the workers and burned is back in new samphire over the week en he delivered a speech entitled the agenda america needs at saint anselmat college is new samphire institute of politics he said this will lay out a concrete agenda which speaks to the needs of the long neglected working class and that he put out a statement saying have always believes a good public policy is good politics the america people are increasingly discussed at the growing levels of in come an wealth in quality in our country and the rampant corpse greed we are seeing all this is as sparking some speculation see an instant interview with burned over the wee gan hers wat he had to say is that o pro going to tenant the creeping authoritarian is an an it wing extremes tan there has to be an ideological change of course can explain what you mean by that well what i me by that that a is that the president has a right to be very proud a many of the accomplishments that we pecheeved in the last threat on employment very very low report in elation down werevestthing in clean energy were rebuilding our infer struck the a we have made real progress an a number of ferias but the reality is that to day six per present up people living packet the path we have bats of levels of uncommon wealth an equality three people or more wealth an the bottomhaf of a vehicle it burned that this is the language of a person who wants to campaign a as new hampsturns totapolitics executive director at loves told the chrisantines money said we invited him but he has coming here for reason living an opens the door for a lot of other sorts of thoughts about whether or not bid's going to be the nominate whether or not tidings going be running in next years a presidential election now biding i burned has set over and over an overdid get back bison but again it seems as though there is now that the door is now open to democrats openly talking about what happens if jobidon does not survive and this as been sort of verboten and there is been i i and a nay on the talking about jobidon to elfhaig the just do not talk about it and it will go away but now it is perfectly obvious to everyone that jobidon his ailing and even burned sanders by thewy is older than jobiton burned sanders is eighty one years old burned is notches con t give up the ghost right here he looks to that field he says well i have mora supports nationally than pavan news and the possibility that burned could theoretically be waiting in the wings forget i do not thing any people in jumetin to erectly against jobidon unless jobidon has some sort of serious healthcare but ones to god i mean it seems day to day the possibility of jobidon having serious healthcare fifty per cent every time that man has a press conference yore waiting for him for good forbid something to happen to the germ president of the unit end states yo on anything bad to happen anybody for health reasons but if you are democrat waiting in the wings right now you look at jobidon and they are hiding him on beach bi himself trying to stop the old man from getting covet or something you have to be thinking well who is backing him up and no one is tapping with come harries despite the attempt by politico to sort of revive the the enthusiasm that never existed around comma arris burned maybe back in the blame meanwhile everybody is pretty pretty clear on the fact that gain news is waiting in the wings as well have nuwsom is been running a shadow campaign it is i is been running against onto mantis according to enbysey news news is increasingly being autos an nuisance by some of president robin's political advisers according to for people familiar a t matter the bid's cameo longer sees nuwsum is o want to be challenger news's plans to debate for to governor on to san on ten carries more risk than potential reward according to those people this cause consternation within bison's operate son and particularly among vice president comely harries alias i should cause consternation with comely arris the notion that of comely arris were the airaparent to mobile known when challenger is nonsense every one would challenger the number people in the race of come arris is the presume to err to jobidon is insane in the that place can be more crowded then the u s open this week end an men it is it is totally crazy some bid advisers have complain privately the plan debate could make voters think newsmen as running a shat twenty twenty four campaign at a time en most democrats they prefer a different candidate at the top of the ticket the use argue could elevate to mantis whom white house vipers initially perceived as a greater threat to bidet's re election hopes than the jo p front runner form president doll trunk halls allot arris allies take prersticularly onstage to what they see as new some attempt o position himself for the twenty twenty eight democratic presidential primarily at her expense s again there wat a democrats and their champing at the bits to go after jobidon and at

failures of the biding ad ministration all of the in investigation surrounding we guilty of what jobidon has been doing those are not simply going to go away in fact there is an article in the broke post over the week end it's pretty dick with regard to blacksmith blacksmith is of course the special council who is appointed to go after dona trump and multiple cases he is got the florid case over down from s miss handling allegedly of class i documents and hes got the canary six case up in washington d see well now according to the yuropost to turns out the white house councils office met with a top aid two special council blacksmith just wees be fore he brought charges against former president true for ledgedly miss handling class documents raising series concerns about coordinated legal efforts aimed at president widens likely opponent in twenty twenty four j brat who join the special councilmen a nonmember twenty twenty two shortly after was form took a meeting in the white house on march thirty first twenty march thirty first t went twenty three with caroling saga the deputy cheep of staff of the white house councils office according to white house visitor logs thrower joined in the tennameeting by dance ray and alpha agents in the washington field office nine weeks later trump was invite investsmith's office on tune eighth twenty twenty three brad who sixty three also met with sabot a the wite house n nonmember twenty twenty one when trump was mired in negotiations with the national archives brad had a third meeting into wite house oftener twenty twenty one this with cateran rely in invited to the white houses chief of staff office it is not clear what exactly was dis crossed not critics in legal experts are quostcuning whybrat was taking meetings at all with the white house councils office while part of an active investigation into present an bisons likely twenty twenty four publican opponent i vas thou rujuliane is fighting madbagsas there no legitimate purpose for a do ja i to be meeting wit the white house except of its coordinated at the highest levels juliani said that he believes that obviously this to some sort of coordination gorge washington university lap vessel jonathan totally said that the meting was particularly troublesome and raises obvious concerns about visits to the white house after grab began his work with the special council he said there is no reason why the deogatiould not be able confirm whether this meeting was related to the ongoing investigation or concerns some other matter now theoretically at could concern some other matter but the fact is the when you have meetings between the people who are prosecuting donate trump and members of the white house staff that is not something that a special councils office should be doing quite obviously meanwhile on the other side of the ledger the congressional investigations into job and hunter bison continue caveman earthy overtime weekunspeaker the house he was asked about shutting down investigations in to hunter or jobidny set of condom not doing that walk a the your scenario is that you ex fact do not you think we will see a short term continuing resolution while you finish the appropriations process but one of our goals is to change washington wore tired of these omnibus bills were congress does not do their work their procreation in the death ceiling we put a provision in there if you did not dong your job there was one per cent cut across the board made a lot of members mad but they are actually doing their work i do not believe we will have enough time to pash all the appropriation bills by september thirtieth i would actually to have a short term my a only to make our argument stronger because maria if we shut down all the government shots at down investigation of everything else it hurts the america public but if we are able to pass our appropriation bills we are in a stronger position to remove those those policy policies that are locked in to all right not a the investigation into hunter is going to be on going from congress as well it should be victor showing who the center of a lot of this controversy you remember victor showing he was the former topucrane prosecutor who is targeted by jobidon as well as by berrizma now jobidon's claim is that the reason he got choke and fired in you crane is because there's international consternation over victor show in having the power that he did that he was corrupt in at the reason the jobidon was doing all of that batsman was at the same time lobbying for showing to be gone because he was investigating brim his claim is the reason that jobidon did it is because he was investing thing seriema hunter bide was on the bordeberisma and sobidan suddenly took a magical interest in his particular job over the weekend he did not interview with bring bombed in which he talked about why he thinks he was fired victorshokin why were you fired from your position by present preschenkko no you i have said repeatedly in my theintofuse that wcashanko fire me shave the insane o the than is a tan malice because i wasn'nvestogatin melisma the present presheko tell you that the he wanted cut stay on the job but there was pressure from present vice present bide we nosechusion a an a you ought to but me correctly this is how it was a there were no complaints wat so wen o most a o i was forming at a my to because crayon was repeatedly put on present fashanko a that is what ane t in no hen firing me he says the reason i oversaw the beriseman case was because i was prosecutor general breismosan ordinary case there is nothing particularly different about it the reason o handling it is because hit deserved o special mention it was on a list of cases to marispecial attention because hunter widen was involved the beriseman of course his father the vice president bid at the time oversaw you crane affairs for the whorehouse this is why he also added he had no doubt cerise most engaged in in legal activities and said would half a day to explain they'll among the allegations he said the berizemenht legally produce sold and utilized natural gas supplies this going to fox news is as have no doubt the legal activities engaged in by brisk as a matter of fact the criminal case had ben started before me it continued to explain ans lovchevsky with the time held the post of minister and was the founder in c oberisma start bringing people who could provide protection for him hunter bin was among them the corruption to work expanded as results agestagainsterior question there is no doubt i my mind berizmost engaged in illegal activities now as foxes point out it is pretty obvious that hunter can d c to work on showing howsoever si committee chairman chimes commersack what when berizema's owner was facing pressure from the cranial prosecute investigating company for corruption even archer who was hunter by ans fore business partner testified the berseem executives asked hunter tho call d c after berizmon board meeting in tube anfoxnewsditional reported that on a member seconds when fifteen berseem executive ratan pozarsky e male hunter bid an archer and fellow hunter associate ark schwerin abetter of vise proposal contract and initial envois for melisma holding from lobbying from bluest strategies hunter a reportedly connectedbrisemet with bluest strategies to help the energy from fight corruption charges levied against lovchevsky the company's owner an pasharsky emphasized in that heel the aliment purpose of the agreement was to shut down any cases or pursuits against t at nickel in e ran that be s lovchevsky a i get in bespoken also went on he acutely biding of actually taking bribes he said i i continued to oversee theberisma investigation we would have found the fact about the erupt activities there engaging in that included both hunter began and a an archer and others e said i soft want a deal an on proven facts my firm personal conviction is yes this was the e case they were being bribe the fact that jobidon gave way one billion dollars in you of money an exchange for ban his missile my firing alone is not that a case of eruption i mean the answer is yes men the only question there is whether jobidon is able to hide his motivation which maybe over breezmop by saying that everybody wanted chosen fired anyway but two things can be to once everybody want to who can fired and the real reason that join was interested in choking to the point where he was calling up the president of you crane and actually sending e tells from a sect to count two bison in to hunter over you crane the reason maybe he took a special interest maybe it is because of the fact that his son was working for breezmuk at the time all this is not that not by a long shot other democrats know it is why there is little but o blood in the water with regard to the turn president of the united states oka were in get to more on this race in just one second particularly with regard to the economy which it is very unclearest way the economy is going to go i have my doubts first we have a wonderful dog his name

my dog thirty three again are you f f greens dot tom slash ben to day and get that free jump start trial bag to day as well o case meanwhile the economy continues to b on sort of the edge here become pile give a speech and jacks hole over the weekend he is the head of the federal reserve an i will say it once again the fact that our entire economy is run by a small cabal of human beings for preside over massive enormous globule economy breaking power with regard to central banking is despicable it really is despicable the gold standard used to take this directly out of the hands of autocratic qonnquat experts and i saying these people are uniquely bad but i am saying is the system of incentives is uniquely bad the fact that federalreservers been tass with simultaneously keeping in elation lo and keeping employment high he used to be the that was the job of legislature that was the job and now when you handed off to the federal reserve basically their job is to continue to back fill all the bad legislation come and of washington to see physical responsibility can only happen when you do not have a bunch of central bankers for manipulating the switches behind the scenes in any case become page who everybody now watches u watch a canal con clave after we trying to pic a new pope an yours waiting for the smoke will merge and that is how we now watch the economic events which is insane become well and a room in jacks why eking because this is how again our macroeconomics is now done he give a speech talking about inflation and the interstates lot of people ore worried particularly that the federal reserve in the central banks across the world are going to continue to raise those interestratesion efforts to quell in elation an doing they are basically going to clamp down on the ability of lenders to lends they are going to increase standards four lenders because the money are not on to be quite as easy to recoup and and their rid that will tip us over into recession here is jgerone power over the woken to per cent is and will remain our n elation target we are committed to achieving and sustain sustaining a stanceofmlanitory policy the is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to that level over time it is challenging of course to know in real time when such stand has been achieved i gam meanwhile he says is he any given guidance and we we all know that he wants ring in elation down to so per cent that is always the targe made for the federal reserve which by the way is not in of its ofphemoral not the must point out that he two per cent in flacienrate over the course of fifty years is an one hundred percent platoon ray which just why everything is way more expensive in just pure dollar terms than it used to be the fact that we deliberately in fleet to currency in order to artificially job con summer spending in this country is a is is what wee call i nice aphonia it is something that is shameful we would not be doing this were actively degrading peoples savings in order to jog far consumer spending which does not actually generate innovation by the way what generates innovation is investment what generates innovation is it are indeed what generates innovation is not you buying additional hammier today that does not generate the new products and services than make the world they better played in any case become well then gave very little guidance e basically just kind of said well we do not know you do not know nobody knows as is often the case we are navigating by the stars under cloudy skies it is such circumstances risk management considerations a critical at up coming meetings we will assess our progress based on the totality of the data and the evolving out look and risks based

according to the waste journal panel's message was not terribly different from his previous comments annals an investor said it was not music the ears of many of the portfolio managers who have been crossing the fingers the fastest meet cycle in decades is finally at an end stocks rose fridge afternoon a rare advancing in august slog for yous indicate but futures markets showed a greater expectation rates could stay hirer for longer they well have he is rates are not going anywhere for a bet and what point dies the on market provide competitions to the stock market in the eyesminvestors said avid denabetian the chief investment officer of s i c private wealth you ass are they the idea would be the stock market right now is a is still inflated alilibit although you us

again by the end of the year that is up from thirty two per cent that they estimated a week earlier again the fact that everybody is now sitting or round and reading chicken an trails is to what a bunch of central bankers are going do with the rates is absurd there is a natural rates of inflation the natural rate of inflation occurs based on products and services and productivity there is a natural rates to lending a natural interstates exist there different from economy to economy they are not consistent they should not be set by any central point it is amazing that many of the same at free market economic thinkers who understand then no one cordate of people is capable of setting price is in literally any other area of theamerican economy believes that there is a color of people who should be setting the price of debt that is totally insane it is is not just people i me believe this mahoanal avian a oleins he were ta book along imago called the only game in town all about how basely central banks now control virtually all of the economic policy well then's gun be able to save and that is great such a set of perverse senses the pervert in cent of is if you are member of the legislature just spend endlessly hoping the federoserve but is on a coming mommy and kiss the booboo that is easily hero's pool job e problem is that means that everybody else out here who is trying to invest do not have an idea what your own power is going to do to morrow it is sitting round waiting for this guide of figure out exactly what the plan is for all the rest of our lives and your ant hae a say in it because it is not n elected position the fact that there is not more hue and cry about the outsize powers the fever reserve is absolutely beyond me especially because is not is those central bankers note to he their doing again when every of a small cobra of experts who say that they in all exactly what they are doing that is almost never the case according to the waster journal central bankers from around the world are finally getting inflation slow down they been expecting but they worry will not last that apprehension explain the uneasy optimismunderlying their discussions here in the we coming mountains this weekend about weather interstates have reached ta summit federals ore officials are grappling with new economic cross currents yours consumer spending has grown faster than they expected to recent months be by hirer and elation adjusted wages stronger demand prompted concerns it might prevent inflation from falling further but a recent surgeon long from government boned yields combined with weakening growth abroad could help touch off a yours economic slow down fedificials have ben trying to engineer by raising rates aggressively over the past eighteen months the problem is once you tip over that cliff you do not know what is you how far down it is meanwhile china they have destroyed their own economy the men doing that over the course of last we decades ha in hiding it with fake growth numbers based largely on borrowing extraordinary sums of money than spending it on empty cities hell now according to the waster journal ideology is driving china economic policy to agree not scene since the countries opening to the west nearly half a century go ti turning its leaders from taking steps to spur the sputtering economy a used to be that when chinagottn trouble they might try little free market stuff not any more h economists and investors o ben calling on bashing make bolder efforts to boost to output especially by promoting consumer spending if necessary by offering cashandouts as the us did during the pandemic but top leaders sustain pang has deep rooted philosophical objections to western style con sumption at driven growth people familiar with decision making in making say she sees at such growth as wasteful and at odds with is go of making china world leading industrial and technological power house now the way that china could theoretically do that is open up but the not got spit up instead there just canto follow this corporatist path mum's o making is that the same corporals path the china follows is one democrats an the united states wish to follow it is china that takes hundreds o billions of dollars and just shovels it into particular industries in the believe that this will somehow magically fix there ailing economy join mats to do the something here e calls to by comics the communist chines call it communism but is not either but it really is is corporatism it really is the government picking and choosing pro girl of business sectors or business is as they think our the most important business sectors are business is and taking money away from most efficient to give to these particular sectors it exists on boot the left in the right by the way and all it really is is favoritism combined with political ideology which is not the way that free market economics is supposed to work it does not generate the most efficient levels of growth it does not generate the best outcomes for the vast majority of the population the fact that the west wishes to copy china as china falls directly into the pit is a is absolutely insane but again the illusion of control is such a it is just desires for many people in positions o power the illusion that they alone can control they alone can fix give me enough power roll fix the america economy now the answer wheneveryou here president of either party say he has created jobs it is a lie the president of the united states is not create jobs neither do congress people you create the jobs in your business i create the jobs in my business we create the job i know be cause we signed the paychecks over here the fact that the federal government pretends that it creates jobs the federal movement can take awayjobs by destroying the base line preconditions for economic growth and that is one of the things that happens when you participate in the economic favoritism in the corporatism that both parties engagement here in the united states and that its engaged in why some of the most economically factious countries on the planet by the way all this is having pretty disaffects not just on the world economy but more specifically on the lower end of the world e economy you are starring to see a bunch of countries absolutely collapse in terms of emerging markets emerging markets are specially sensitive to fedfol policy according to the welter journal because hire just rates make riskier assets less attractive to investor very on can invest nigeria bonds if the money is just not is easy and get ready for for all those people who believe that the the markets are on solid footing i have on i have a bridge in bookman that is formal at the moment i can meanwhile on the re publican at side of the altoobideim is incredibly vulnerable even democrats a noticing this which is presumably why you have burning sanders travelling to me samphire republicans are steaming twenty donnas from nomination there is just now to wast about it right now the twenty twenty four presidential nomination the up date in the real clopoltic pulling average has donate trump up forty points over the rest of the field there is been some sign that the vac romasuamey is starting recede back to the field that nickel valley is starting pick up a little bit of ground the solid number two continues to be on to mantis by pity much all the available pulling dater right now he continues to be number two pence is picking up a little bit o ground in some of the latest pulls by a little i mean he is up to five or six per cent in some of the latest puls nobody is within shouting distance of donate trump after donate trumps pick was took at the at the georgia court house at the full county courthouse that was not the courthouse the jail at the fulling can jail he raised more money on that day alone than he had the entirely of the campaign which is both i would say encouraging in the sens the re publicans are very very motivated and a little bit discouraging in the fact that if you want oral trump to be president trolley should not wan be president just because he took a mug shot was i said the mungchout as an amazing amazing marketing opportunity for donate trump i talked out on fridge it is a great mugshot if there is such a thing it is a great men there are emit grandson torus most famously ma gang great and iconic mugshots this an iconic mugshot well trump turn that georgia mugshot into gold according to politico trump raised seven point one million dollars since he is book at an at lantagail on thursday evening according to figures provided first to political by his campaign on fridge alone trump raise four point one eight million dollars that is the single highest twenty four hour period of his campaign to date according to a person familiar with the totals the campaigns fun raising has ben power by much it is been selling through the online store which again man ens is all people signalling to each other that they also wished to throw the establishments the giant orange mental finger the campaign is also been rotting on line donors with emails and text messages as well trumps campaign says it is raised nearly twenty million dollars in last three weeks based on the repeated charges against him now as i said last week the polling does not demonstrate that tat donate trump is li call to win election based on this it demonstrates that he is likely to win the nomination based on the based on the charged against him but the fact is that in most america unfortunately still believe that trump should stand trial before the twenty twenty four election he has a court eight in georgia to day has other one in deceit to day all this can be about setting the time line the sort at the we is all about setting the blacksmith manual sixth case is that can be before the electioneer after his steam is trying to argue he shouldn't be tried there until twenty twenty six actually which i think is unlikely meanwhile in georgia it is not really about trump but there is a legal case against mark meadows that is on going their mark metros is trying to have that part move his case to federal sort and he is then going to claim that easily the supremacy claws prevents him from being tried in stake quart that whatever crimes he supposedly committed he committed as a federal official is chef of stafftodonal trump and therefore he should be tried in federal quart nine stake part if trump tried the same thing thautallys fore closed the possibility that he would be tried and convicted in a stake part and then he would be on the ballet and then you have a real mess of constitutional mess because the president came pardon himself of a non federal offense but again the polling does not show that the general public over all is in credibly warm toward donate trumps legal troubles there some people whore more warm than they otherwise would have been but they were penne lukewarm to begin with at ism more animated on behalf of trump because the trials than i otherwise would have bee but i voted for trumpet twenty twenty i cant not from twice you will go the polling data from political and what it shows is that sixty one per cent of america believe the trumps election trials should take place be four the election sixty one per cent meanwhile fifty one per cent believe that trump is guilty of lodged times in the federal twenty twenty election subversion election case at pens twenty six per cent who say no all are not great numbers meanwhile a plurality of respondence to politicos at a conviction in the case forty four per cent would have no impact on the likely to of supporting trump which makes sens again you figure half those people are pro half this people are against but among people who said that the result would in form their vote nearly one third of respond ins thirty two per cent said a conviction would make them less likely to spore trump that includes one third of independence only thirteen per cent of respond is total said a conviction would make them more likely to support trump that figure was more likely re publicans than not and by the way the numbers could go down because as the case drags on in as sort of the shock of trump being indicted drags on it becomes less shocking and more normal and then that she becomes baked into the cake by the way if you look at at who is considered a a villain in this particular case here is it here is the polling data again political magazines of poll drove a favorable or in favorable opinion of the action statement to behavior the following people regarding the cases against trump fifty eight percents on favorable twenty seven per cent favorable jobidon forty five per cent on favorable thirty six per cent favorable that is a nine point gap negative for bison that is a twenty nine per cent gap four dona trump right there jack smith to this point still has more favorable than in favorable and sot is the geode if the ho per is that donate trumps legal cases are going to spur him to the presidency again i thin there is my possibility they spy hm to the nomination but i think that there is a much lower chance that they actually have these sort of counts prevailing affect then a lot people of it about in peaches have never bought the argument by the way that i teaching somebody actually helps them elect frilly i still have get to see the evidence of that a bilclinton was not peach nineteeninety eight maybe it help democrat's a little bit in sort of minor elections it did not help all groan yo thousand and obviously i teaching trump twice didn't roll may gat difference on behalf of trump in the twenty twenty election either meanwhile there is a case afoot too now truly they you on talk about election interference this would be true election

interference in rocks about these cases yah they form of election interference foreshore no question but here is some actual direct election interference and it is coming from inside ta house going to buyer in york some don true s enemies are now attempting to have him removed from state primary ballast according to york he says that even though conviction to not legally bared trump from running and winning the hope is there is no way convicted true could regain the presidency from left but there are some of trumps opponents ware going further they are now exploring the possibility the trump is already disqualified from running for office state election boards or secretaries of state they say can an should simply re move his name from the ballot in their states no need for a hearing a trial legal ruling legislation or any of the other stuff now how would this magical killings work the magical result occurs proponencsay by way of the fourteenth amendment section three of the amendment prohibits anyone who's taken in oath to a pull the constitution and then engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the united states or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof maker holding public office section three was intended to apply to former confederate officials it has not played any significant roll in america governments since eighteen seventy two and it was basically a that letter now some people are saying wishful use against from now what is various about that is that the entire claim against trump for all the bad stuff that he did between nonmember and canary of twenty twenty one the claim is there was no legal basis for might pence to simply throw out state fortified electoral votes based on nothing in the constitution rancho make that judgment there hastibulic an actual reason that you are doing it but now trumps opponents are tempting to precisely that against him on the state ballast it is absurd is not going to happen if it were to happen would be a complete disaster area for bout the republican party in the country cannot just take people off the ballad without an actual legal reason to take them off the ballad totally craziocan meanwhile rondosantis has paused his campaign because they are bunch of issues in the state of floor particularly this giant storm that is bearing down on the gulf coast according to politico he canceled campaign events this week as majorstorm bears down on the state and also in the format of this horrific basis shooting in jacksonvillit will get to momentarily the mantis said during a sundae newsconference is can remain in lord in the coming days because tropical storm dahlia is expected to be come a hurricane to make landfall along the gulf coast later this week it says we are locked in on the final at the job don ism here he was slated to scant campaign in south caroling on money probably i soon case will be taking his place at some of those events the mantis also went to a vigilant sundae night for shooting left three people dead insacksonville on sturdy before the gunman killed himself de mantis began a sundae newsconference by condemning at the shooting here's rondo mantis showing up at a vigil over the weekend and a bunch of idiots started shouting it him because supposedly what the governor of the state is not spoke to show up in solidarity with communities that are afflicted by whites to premises mass killingsi'm ism confused why you would shout at somebody over this in any case here was to mantis and a the hero of this particular story is a democrat council member named jujube pitman who steps in here and basically tells the protestors shut up all on the same side of this one you are not you e ecu to be targeted by people we o the m we mesa you be fin to put party to that a ad ad a bipartite is to day ai do n pat oo we is tacit this one o the beautiful things i will say about living in florid and this is why there are dosantis democrats as well in the state of florid is that in florid when it comes to times of actual crisis everybody is on the same side by the way that is the nature of what a community should be is when there is a crisis all the stuff goes to the wayside the fact that the are people who are protesting when this sort of stuff happens and the mantis is not responsible in any way for this his response is open lackluster is not as though he went no comment and then wen for weak on the beach while all the sort of stuff happen a this was absolute a political good for this city council woman for for doing that believe er not the members of trump's campaign whore sheering on all of this nonsense the people who are protesting for lower predictably enough who is desperate to be dona trump's press secretary which for entertainment value i would be very very high i will say i she of course was that was celebrating people yelling at on dtosantis a for for being terrible enough to show up at this som at this particular event see ism glad he was booed he is visit tenuous just an absurdity obviously she said while retell governor to since was heckled tat vigil for the victims of shooting in jack'sville florid dollar general to day comments he made back in rely about floors are coming back to bite i in the ass is come on i seriously come on ridiculous kind of stuff put the mantis is doing what he is supposed to do he is the governor of florid he is back in the state and ta and he is going to be there overseeing whatever happens with regard to this florid hurricane meanwhile it is worth while noting here that do again in the state of florid florid is a fascinating and and complex state in i know because i know live here ism resident and do now this this particular shooting is is obviously it was motive by wite so premise according tot waster colonel authorities and jacksovill flora identified a local twenty one year old sundae as a white gunman who shot and killed three black victims at a dollar general store before killing himself and attack local and federal official said was racially motivated the gunman then shot himself who is carrying a hand gun any military style somoutamoutic rifle with waste case e marked on it according to the police the jacksovill sheriff t k waters said this is pretty obviously motivated by a by hatred of blackpeople community grating to understand why this atrocity occurred i end o us all not to look for since and the senses act violence there's no reason or explanation that we will ever account for the shoes elisions actions the sitting i ideology is not re presentative of the values of this capital community though we all of much we are not a community of ay we san you tit with a good and decent people the city we resent is inexcusable violence and the san s ho will not rested tot this inthiscusiis complete every available old avenue of accountably o thineaust gat is perfectly worth while to talk about the ideology of the shooter the shower did not have criminal history but in twenty sixteen was named in d domestic disturbance call in twenty seventeen had to i be put on seeing to our hold for mental health evaluation i i will point out at this point that whenever there is e white's premises shooting we know the motives right away and whenever there is a pretty obviously motivated anti christian shooting say in national tennessee just to take a quick example we still do not have the manifesto of that shooter and it has been how many months since all that happened which seems a bazaar to me at the at the very very least it the shooting obvious is condemned y every one ranging from president don said we must refuse to live in a country or black family's going to the store bassoon's going to school if infer being gun down because the color of their skin which of corse is true governor to basis said something similar he led the shooting terrific and said the the state was offering support to the local authorities but as i say florid is a fascinating and at complex place here was governor o basis speaking about the shooting florid the state in its people condemn the terrific racially motivated murders perpetrated by a decane scumbag a in jacks bill at the dollar general store a perpetrating violence of this kind is unacceptable and targeting people due to their race has no place in the state of florid case i extend condolence is to the victims of their in their families on behalf of the entire state of florid into that was his statement meanwhile the sheriff over here i again man in than waters he says he n r you won't try to blame the guns is not you the guns that is person is wielding guns teethe story's always about guns the the people a that this is of that got if i take my gun off right now nothing on this count nothing they will sit there as soon as a wicked person grass the hold at hand on so shooting people with it there is a pom the promise indofit ay that is the part of the less conference the mainstremenyou will never show you they will show you him talk about the whites remiss they'll never tell you that what he sayings that yes it was the shooter who pulled the trigger in the the lot of lack america by the way who are very very progun and something that the left wishes to a to obscure meanwhile the rest of the re publican field is em is trying to figure out away to pray some of the sans is support and all f them are i the held behind trump obviously nick hale who picked up some ground after her last good debate performance and by the pulling she did have probably the best night of of any one in arms of seamount of movement that her candidate the actually experience choose ask about president trump in him leading the passion why what i drop out for true carrylake she is calling on all of the candidates to pause the campaign to get behind t all trump because of two applications of the law i si is i suppose you are not considering that i mean i appreciate and body new on what should happen but we have got a a country o fave and ism not at a top an till wee favor i think that we look at the fact that were thirty two royal dollars and at love got crime that top we've got a lack of grant part an the cat ring we have got an open border and that we have three bathing of theroid the world an i think that we need a no generational water we fasten eerie problem t wet are not an philuncion ay she is not gone anywhere now problem is that of course the field can fragment six ways she have got got nickyhailey who presumably if she continues to show some sort of credibility in the race i sums hims got at some point is going drop out because you really has no support other than from some money people if he drops out some that is what i soon will move over to valley which makes or more competitive an south caroling which ironically makes dona trump a lotmore competitive and south caroling because if the south caroling primary splits trump to scientist half true probably walks away with a nomination fairly easily even if this race gets a lot tighter meanwhile chis crispy continues to double down on the never triplane thinking the sign win him new hampshir here was one the weekend and the true is the we cannot have a convict did felling h as or many present and expect for going to win and it was really must to matin parting the bate to me was the i the o then the majority of my conpediters believe that you can have a convict tie felling a as our many for president and ta that the report that that you could win i that is an impossibility ay i mean that is not what they were saying on the stage there thing if he is he nominees by nail vote for him that is not quite the same thing as a we think that he is likely to win if all those people on state lout he was likely to win they would be running i assume meanwhile the person sort of running still as dona from shadow is to vagrom swampy if a take in the pulling data has taken some hits since the debate but of course he want s be lightning rod he is lightning robin his real campaign isn't for the presidency ism not sure that he cars i think the idea that he is getting all sorts outsized attention means that he is pretty well set up for a san an oho center run onions is place of residence or for being a dona true cabinet pic or for if he be well he is now in an attempt to a bend over backwards for trump shifted his opinion completely onto trump's behavior after canary six if you look at he is want one of his books one this test books he talk specifically about canary six an he size that when you lose an election you should just admit you lost an election i he is now changed his opinion radically here is u he was not asked during there bate lot rather bandits for assuring the debate about milk pence his behavior on jaguar six did he do the righting in sort offing the election the answer by height is yes unequivocally yes there is no legal basis for mike pence to overturn state sort of find election results ism sorry if that hurts feelings that is just the way that it is but a take has tried tot he is trying to square the circle here and come up with a way of pleasing donate trump and ribbing my pence even tough he knows perfectly well the mi pence did the right thing on canary six here he was saying a thing that makes no sense at all and again vivid is to smart for thus the candidates on stage one day nip said mature hence kids the right thing on canary six do you agree i would have done it very differently i think that there was a historic opportunity that he missed to reunite this country in that window what i would have says this is a moment for a try national concenter were there is two elements of what is required for functioning democrat say n america on is secure elections and the set cold is a peaceful transfer of power when those things come into conflict that is an opportunity for heroism here is what i would have said the need single day voting on election day the need paper ballast and we need government issue idea matching the voter file and if we achieve that then we have achieved at victory and we should not have any further complain boy election integrity it you you have got tents an would as to to k off the election a in my capacity as president of the senate i would have led through that level of reform then on that condition certified the election results served it up to the president o president true than to sign that in the law and on canary seventh declare to the re election campaign pursuance to a free an fear election i think that was a mist opportunity but that is the kind of spirit wore gan a need to you nite this country rather i sweeping those concerns under the rug just to get this start his solution was that on generous ex have renown's print trumpspen two months lying that my pence could unilaterally overturn the election and on gantry sit he would have not certified the election on the condition that they pass a law doing all the things that i i those things also but that is not what the president of the senate actually does he does not in the hate legislation he is a deciding vote he is not a senior a but a coring of awake he should go outside his constitutional duty he should star proposing legislation my sense not certify the election in defiance of his actual job as the president promise of the senate and then he should at that point certify the election the next day and this would heal america conflicts yet don as from teeny would man baby wit that prowl now trumpitof said ut can now they fixed the next election ism really really happy with the results of this one prowl everything would have gone away wat is even talking about any the take is ha very smart lie can know the take he's a superheat you dude he knows a better than this and this part of my frustration with his candidacy is when gain this much credibility this quickly wen get this much attentions quickly it seems to me that you have sort of a duty to say honest things and again his entire campaign is truth he would not done that he knows he would not have done that come on he knows he would not done that because he literally did not do that o say i have spoken with the take after canary sex between generate that is when i actually spend he most time with the van is between canary six and now and the van he is never talk this way and we literally talk the opposite in his book scam but that this is ye for for for people to shift with the prevailing winds bothers me and i gan i feel we are time out blown opportunities the take has an opportunity this a died from the outside who extraordinarily wealthy really really bright and has the opportunity shift the debate and a lot a really fascinating an interesting directions and instead he saying things that he knows are not actually viable or true i think because again i i do not think that what he saying is coherent and i think is coherent guy for exactly he has a piece in the america conservative to day about his for policy and in i he says i will lead our nation from the bloody follies of no conservatism and liberal internationalism abroad sort a strategy that a affirmatively defends our home land we will be uncle succor no more rather than spending billions projecting power in to global vacuums wo our allies will not spend to maintain it themselves we will put america first again as gorge washington urged as we re calibrate and considerour truinterests o first of all e must point out every republican and and most democratic candidates campaign exactly him language virtually no one campaigns on the language of unlimited spending on foreign policy and intervention is everywhere brokoboma did not campaign on that to thousn't eight georshall be bush campaign on that into thousand the only candidate i can think of whoashlly campaign sort of that was madman into thousn't eat but every other candidate of my lifetime has campaign in exactly the way that evade is now talking about the part is in have problem with any of this that the problem that i have with this is that he seems to believe that just random things happen in form policy for example here is his solutions too crank here is my positinucrim able chinycrane is that the united state should be takin the leadership position in negotiations with the ruffians who should easily be saying to the ruffians we are willing to allow you to maintain occupant of crime and part of the don was region in return we are going to give security quarantines but not dato membership to the eucranians and that is can be the end of the war evade wants to go one step further in a way that i do not think is even plausible a here is what he was is i will go to mascot and twenty went five i will deliver piecing youcrane only under the terms that should matters terms the put america interest first the by administration is foolishly try to get g to dun photon right china's due russia in reality we should get gotten to jump g one now a no ism s in put that out nope russia is a giant gas station with fully weapons that is its entire economy you think they are going to dump china that that is not a thing that is going to happen it is a week state with no international times singing a piece agreement with russia is not going to restore those international ties to the extent necessary that russia would suddenly magically si to dump chinaquot a good deal require us all parts o get something out of it to that end i wilaccept to russia control of the occupied territories and ledge to block you cranes candidate fermata in exchange russia exciting its military lines with shindy no russia going to do not that tennis can editor military lines with china why that hell would they chin is the only competitive power on the world stage to the united states an then meanwhile he says for example that he is going to he is going to clear economic an happens from china which is fine and then he says that he is going to be clearer with regard to titan his take on titan is he says that we have operated in strateachicambiguity with the grardti wan for far too long it'll move to to to stratechi clarity by which me in the chinamustunderstand i will defend america interest in ti wan if him one wants any partnership in their defend they will men to raise their defend spending and military readiness to acceptable levels meanwhile it'll commit to making smriti wane has the weapons they need for that defense but from a seaborne invasion and in the future for long from insurgency against any occupying for force if needed get that now there is only one e problem that that is our current policy that is exactly are can policy that is star teach a ambiguity by the way that we will arm them but we are not did i miss the part in that paragrapher says whether we will actually actively defend wan in case of a chines invasion i did not ye this kind of stuff from of ache it is the reason why he his sore who is base on the idea that he was a free radical he could say whatever he wants it and then it apples that he is now saying things he is got a last audience capture it seems he is saying things hate wants people to think he releases but it seems unlikely that u that he actually believes those thingsand i think that is one of the things that came off on the stage the other night for vague my recommendation to him in this campaign if he actually wants take it no as a presidential candidate is stop trying to please president from personally and start actively saying the things that people need to here because i think he has the strength of character to do all those things ha meanwhile let us do some less you some things i in some things that i hate things that i over the weekend i ready a yo my my sort of brain relaxation is sports ism a big basket ballad rich con who is one o my favorite writers wrote a great sports book called when the game was war it comes out this week i it really is fantastic i this my early childhood it about the eighty seven eighty eights hes and out only three or four years old but i remember all o these players because they all continue to plain till the early nights that is bird magic jeordiniz a tom as charges barley anal the rest and the book is just a fun fun my because rich is a terrific writer it moves really fast and done it it reminds you of a time when o basketball was was less about the pretty and much more about the gritty it is it is it is a lot of fun i i again highly recommended when the game was war by rich goner say another thing that i environmentalists they think that somehow there in a gain support for their cause by being incredibly annoying superdupberinois what if i grew myself o this van go painting in ever it i hope that they just dump you into the river it'll be what what if i what if i just take this road and shut it down orb is what if we just you known let people run you over because you are annoying you are very very annoying he we wants him wen to die but come on get off the road in any case these idiots in evade decided to u to shut down a road in evade with sins abolish capitalism ut capitalism unfortunately for them was not abolished and instead they were abolished basically trial rangers were not what you are holding up the line and that hearts what occurred er is the good stuff right there come back for term ere come i as is yet better estrin as well they should be and i good for the good for the trail rangers by which sill lonicars stupid jacket blocking first of all whenever there this sort of stuff happens people shutting down traffic and it does not matter the country does not matter the timing stop shutting down traffic it is obnoxious not only is of noxious cause other people have livesyou are not the only person with life but also it is sometimes creates a medical hazards because sometimes there is an ambulance on the way to somewhere stupididious it my only regret here is that a they don't to it earlier be good good good for them already we will do a quick thing that i hate sensory has ben maintaining that no one is in favor of late from abortion which is heard because you all want late term abortion i noticed i she treated out on main be s she would treated out a a x no one supports abortion up until birth s which i treated excellent please name legislation you would prep you provide in order to prevent abortion up until birth she did not answer that question because just now in answer here she was trying to explain herself gensoki no one supports abortion up until birth i rather because there is a pervasive and misleading talking point that its aced by a number of frighting leaders in clotting presidential candidate on the stage suggest think that democrats are advocating for and even rooting for late time abortions ha babies who could live outside the come just take a listen to some of the answers in the debate on weekday nigh we are better than what the democrats a calling we are not in alow portion all the way still big and we will hold them accountable for their extreme as at we can not let states coupon you new york in ill nor hapabortions on the man open ti the be be birth how wit don't is for somewhere to have kidnap comply hair array for thirty eight week thirdly for thirty nide was thirdly for forty weeks this was not just some throwaway line for a plans on the debate take this is a talking point republican presidential candidates t is repeatedly on the trail yet ism because it is true nowhere in the semen does she actually rebut the idea that she would support legislation legalizing o abortion until birth instead just goes s what it does not happen all that often that is not the question the question is not with her abortion happens all that often close to birth the question is should it happen at all and now what point you to become illegal and she will not answer those question an neither will any other democrat because the democratic party position is there shall be no legislation the restricts abortion at any point up until birth that is the democratic party position and yet just denies it outright it is an amazing thing it must be fun to have your taken net to that way where were you clearly oppose any restrictions on abortion and then when you are called on it you habit i do not but i don't it well that do not care with you personally it i care whether you wish to make it illegal or not we are in the business of public policy are we not it is it is dishonest but you no she is to work for titan there you

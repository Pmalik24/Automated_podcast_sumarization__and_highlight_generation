todatihosponserbacks pressie plan thousands my liters already secured there not with they to join them express pianzicom freshmen the easiest moral place to stand is in the middle standing in the middle is comforting it grants you the illusion that you are being even handed that you seen nankin complexity were others just see black and white it is flattering to be in the middle no one hates your view points enough to make you their opponent and yet you get to stand apart from every one tut tutting both sides when it comes to israel and it is terror supporting enemies the west has for some decades takin precisely that middle position sure israel should be able to defend itself but not too much yes israel has the right to exist but it must make concessions to those who openly seek israel destruction when israel enemies pursue the worst atrocities in four generations it is difficult to maintain that position of study neutrality which attacks on israel are chalked up to political differences and shrugged away it turns out that scenes of brutally masseur children women and men tend to upset the moral stomach but then the stomach settles again all it takes return to that sophisticated neutrality it is a few false platitudes a few comforting lies three of those lies in particular have been provided in significant supply by the hard left and its allies in the legacy media the first lie is that israel must be warned not to engage in human rights violations we hear this all the time from the president of the united states from the united nations from the president of france from the media the idea is that if israel leadership is not reminded in the wake of the worst pogroms since the holiest those rude news might do something should evil they mat carpet boy loathe mat cute the place the purpose of the lie is really simple to get israel to stop defending itself at the first available opportunity see if you warn the world that israel has to be warn not to pursuatrocities and then as inevitably happens in war something awful happens israel can be blamed another can quickly be shoved back into the box of moral equivalents gala status duo any restored of course this lie is a lie and it is a stupidly offensive lie in the same way that it is lie when the united nations warns the united states about human rights violations israel is a professional military tit abides by the rules of war it is enemies openly her the death of civilians both israel and their own by all rights the entire political and media infer structure ought to be using they're supposed moral solution on human rights to convince come as truly hostages and protect open civilians but of course there is no interest in that the lie must be maintained israel has to be warned about human rights because secretly if it were not from the intervention of the west the news up just be commas that is lie number one then there is the second lie thatch we must all remember of the vaunted peace process yes the two states solution the peace process that was obviously and clearly and openly stated runs undertaken by over arphoght in order to provide the jumping off point her a genital war on the news the peace process that has t ended in the election of common in the gnosis strip the leadership of the palstinian authority and atomic jehad in the west bank we must of there goes remember the two statesolution is just important of course this lie is dangerous too it is dangerous because once again in inevitably places theblame on israel for murder of news in israel if only the news had made more concessions other than the partition plan of nineteen forty seven accepted by the news rejected by the grabs or the egyptian is rally piecemeal of nineteen seventy nine the arab states boycott egypt after warsatout's piece with israel for almost to decked the slow cords themselves an who broch two thousand campdavid proposal rejected baser earshot who then initiated violent terror war resulting in the death of one thousand one hundred eighty for is relies the got withdraw of to thousand five comas was elected and has been launching at tear takeover since and who omer two thousand eight piece plan rejected outright by manhood abs without count or offer and even did trumps called deal of the century rejected before even being seen but the li goes israel must continue to make painful concessions if they do not u murder is inevitable when news get killed it is actually the news fault moral equivalents restored finally there is the third and most comforting my that antisionism the wish for the destruction or non presents of the state of israel has nothing to dew with antisemitism that my is currently being encourage by the equation of antisemitism with is lamiphobia this happening all over the place they antisemitism we see to nancollece campus is part and parcel of the antisemitism that ended with the slaughter of fifteen hundred jaws in the gosh envelop hatred of news is the driving force behind hatred of israel but an orders restore and semblance of moral cover for hating israel the have to separate antisemitism from antisinism this allows you to hate news while pretending to just hate israel the easiest way to accomplish this is to down play the obvious reflection between international new hatred antataxon israel and instead to subsume antisemitism under a braider different rue brick of lack of mufti cultural tolerance now this a my and it is an obvious lie of course the are occasional acts of barging a muslin and they are nothing the jargon of jests are not the same category they do not follow the same logic they're not the same perpetrators they do not occur anywhere nearest frequently they are not spurred by the sort of cycle of violence in the middle east talk the keep hearing about all of these comforting lies are useful in allowing the morally idiotic to attempt to regain a moral highground the at a falsely restored moral equivalent and how eager they are for that moral equivalents how badly they want it how deeply they seek it how many people are itching for some terrible thing to happen in the war s they can blame israel then go right back to israel and its opponents their just the same and as site gets bomb by israel that is a camps sit and some the shrapnel had the wall of a church and some people get killed and its israel was targeting a church people are looking for the offal this moral equivalents allows for example left is news to pretend they will not be lumped in with their fellow news by the interjectional coalition it allows the interjectional to pretend that they are on the side of the righteous even as they make excuses forkamas it allows the international community to continue to pressure israel after the biggest mass murder of news since again the hollos never again does an apply after all if the news in the end are part of the problem and after approximately one week of local dyspepsia with the evilokamas the world is gradually returning to its steady diet of moral equivalent s they are doing with eagerness this is why the york times was excited to run but the false story of an is really air strike on a hospital believing a genecitle terror group from the jump that stor who o made their life much easier even in their retraction yesterday they rest claiming the problem was not that they trust a comas but that they just move too fast it was really not their fallout fall quote the early versions of the coverage and the prominence it receives in a headline news clear and social mediachelnels relive to have on claims by camass and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately bar i be verified they are for left readers with an incorrect impression about what was known and how credible the account was says the near times of course the real problem was trusting camps at all but you cannot trustkamas can you the only reason o truskamass from the jump is because again you wish to restore that moral equivalents moral equivalents between a legitimate state that protects its citizens and a terror group that seeks the extermination of that other state citizens and shields its own rockets with civilians that ends with blood it ends with blood calls for concessions to terrors groups end with blood preventing military intervention to protect citizens of the west from tears ends with blood moral equivalent is a sin standing in the middle is not e sign of some sort of moral righteousness it is a sign of weakness of mine and lack of moral backbone and just one second we will get to more on these lis because these lives have becomincredibly prevaintishsing them all over the place promoted by everyone from jordan toborako mama two certain members of the right will get to that momentarily first pure talk recently announce they would alleviate ten million dollars in veterans at by veteran's day thanks to your support they are fifty three per cent to that goal with two weeks to go thing about this thrust military is made up of one hundred percent volunteers these are men and women who willingly sacrifice everything they have for this country when they'edun serving they are turn home to a tight cop market and outrageous living expenses this is whlyi'm happy a private company are took his jumped in to help when you switch two pure rocks lightning fast each network the will don't a portion of every new order to this noble coss you can make a real difference just by choosing so prior self on service to get better service and lower coss and you having be helping veterans at the same time buttocks plans start just twenty bucxamon offering a limited talktact more data and molohokspo just head on over to our took come slash a pure make that switch to day let us rallied together showing wavering support for our veterans visit pure took come slash a pro switch to pure to today it is the right move its the america way again visit pure tomato come slash she pure to day tin all my calls the a pretockin an excellent tampon network the tout the tower not work is great the coverage's get cost mu lot money go checked or now purtokto come slash she pure o was let us get to some of these lies besagain the narrative is switching and it switching really fast really fast now out just everyone remember after nine eleven it took a couple of years from the arrive to switch through the overtaking evil of a merino and america roll in the middle reason maybe may be actually been laden was was right maybe was america imperialism the tool it to it's little wile to get there when it comes to the news i takes five seconds jaws get slaughtered by the way in overwhelmingly picnic left wistarias of israel in get what way one of the things that that is a making about this is that comas could not be clearer and it is advocates could not be clear in who they want to see die and the answer is every new the people in for example boots berry which is one of the places that was completely ravage half the population is dad in kubotzberry in the last israel electioncycle these are not members of loot they're not right wingers about two about three quarters of that boots voted for the left wing or far left wing parties in these rail elections it is the equivalent of terrace at tacking the center of san francisco and yet the idea is from know all the teratologist that the real reason this his happening is because of the intransigents of the news forever when the real reason this is happening of course is because the news have this pesky insistence on not dying on living on breathing it is e martin that is going around that is fairly accurate that that shows a comas terrorist withe boy strap to is just an a baby saying i want to kill all the news and then on the other side is baby nutinahu an in the center is the internatural comma saying sit to nitinahu can you met him half way and that is essentially the the statuskuo any tat we are now reverting to o lasso i mention threviglizer the the first big lie is that israel has to constantly be pressure to maintain human rights when do you see this tushy ism wondering one has there been one warred to you crane to lodgers lens about preserving human rights one word can you can you name one i cannot can has jobidon ever ever publicly set under any circumstances flowers lens your country is under attack by the ruffians but we have to make sure that you really maintain human rights now have you cranial forces violated human rights in certificate of course because it to war and that's what happens but only job not there every single day being whale that that is ha those youkranians yen never no they might go crazy you do not see that ever did you hear that with regard to even america troops in a rock and afghanistan the answer of course is notes are about brutish troops or french troops who are involved in the coalition forces in the places of course not the only place you over here this lie is with regard to israel as though israel is equivalent with us with it position israel this allows the perverse logic by which you see morons on television or terror apologists maskueradias morons on television saying things well news were killed in kubootz vermin faraway but also babies are being incinerated in gaze you mean for completely different reasons meaning yes it is horrible and awful when babies dying gaze and that is all the fault of compass which launch the war and is keeping physically babies in places they should not be keeping the babies as i yesterday clip some dust on brutish give suggesting for example that it is it is of no consequences when israel warns civilians to get out before tits building of coursethat is to catch twenty too that is get treat because of israel did not warn then would bet in drossy but israel does warn then it still in a atrocity is anotherwords when israel takes precaution to save civilians according to this idiots this obviously because israel does not care about human right but if israel did not give the warning then also is reeled not care about human rights an this all stupidity and hoiden promotes it because again there is this n n the moral equillencs must be restores we can all go back to our comforting illusions about how every one in the world things us there are no true barbarians in the world there are not people who seek the act of destruction of the wast in the murder of children we have to were all the same in if only we could sit down a table together and have tea would all be best friends edit is a lie an is stupid lie and also tenantisymatic lie in the sens at again it equates a moral states which israel is it has a legitimate military that pursues legitimate military goals with a murderous sis gang in comas a not group that broad casting own atrocities on television and teaches at children that a atrocities against just are an active public good jobidon yesterday g treated out along these lines and this is again typical jobidon this is the the foreign policy wisdom of the moans began said israel has right to to fenditself we must make sure they have what they need to protect the people to day and always far the treat should stop right there that is the end of it and if this were written the had ben attacked that would be the end of the tweet but it is not it is the news began says at the same time priministern not to kahuna i have discussedhow israel must operate by the laws of or again the implication being that if it were not for jobiton twisting into now who is arm he would be going in there with the tanks and just running over kids just for fun which of course is absurd israel abandoned the gozestrip in two thousand five they have undergone dozens of rounds with thousands of rock it is fired at israel and israel has never engage in the sorts of human rights violations that bid seems to be implying israel would engaging if you were not there kind of young managing them to stopping quote that means protecting civilians in combat as best they can we cannot ignore the humanity of innocent pasinians who only want to live in peace that is why i secured an agreement for the first shipment if humanitarian assistance for palsinans civilians and gaze and we cannot give up on a two state solution will get tote twosdate solution line just one second because again there is no one for israel to negotiate with seal's been trying but again the lie here the implicit lie and it is a lie is that in the and it is cause of is kalian transfer and also these relies thee really mean an if they were not some if they were not me none of this would be happening and it is complete and utter rubbish it is more on this momentarily first the menshiberisho is supported why grand canyon university in a fordable private christian university with a vibrant campus and

dot e to you to day also it is not to jobidon who is telling this big lie number one which is that israel if it were not for if it were not for america israel would just be gloves off murdering people borokobama of course does this is were the barokomami said many many years ago is effect lively antisemitic in his approached israel thighs been true since he became president brokabam's the only president america history who tried to deny are to israel in the middle he to he literally tried to stop the re supply of iron dome in the middle of a war in two thousand fourteen brokabama stock his administration with people who despise israel despise israel most anti israel present in my life time baron not close and it is no she which again meld with barokobamas anti colonialist world view which really a left wingworld view left over from the nineteen sites the basic idea being that the west and its tentacles are everywhere and must be fought everywhere there is a shift in how israel received on the far left from nineteen forty it to sixty seven israel was considered actually in anti colonial state betas it had thrown off the brutish and had aloud the indigenous people of idea namely the news to return to their home land and then after the news one in sixty seven the soviet union decided that israel was two pro western and they ginned up this whole new post colonials nonsense where israel actually a western colonial occupier which is an amazing switch an time to take time babrokobama really believes that that how he talk about the state of israel onrootin basis in fact in a speech that he made while he is present talking about the roots of the state of israel he did not attribute to israel historic presence he don't attribute it to you know jorishistery or jewfish present he tribute all to the polices meaning israel was a colonial lateral that that is barokobam's mines at he has said virtually nothing about this entire conflict and now he puts out a statement thought on israel and gaze because we needed to hear from him he was successful in the serena was barokobama we need to hear from him he throat clears for a topple of paragraphs about hawkamasibad right it is been seventeen days since mass launched i terrific attacking israel killing over fourteen hundred is really citizens including defenseless women children in the elderly as i stated in earlier post israel has a right to defend itself not bat right in there is the big but as we say not even as we support israel we should also be clear that how israel prosecutes this fight against comas matters in particular it matters as jobiton has repeatedly emphasize that israel military strategy abides by international law including those laws that seek to avoid to every extend possible the death or suffering of civilian populations upholding those values is important for its own sake because it is morally just and reflects our belief in the inherent value of everyday life by the way if you cared aby any of us the first priority is the destruction of compass there the biggest humorous violators on the planet right now and yet i do not see barokabama talking about that sort of stuff he by the way he says that he supports died ans call for the united the united states support israel in going after mass dismancelling's military capabilities and facilitating the safe return of hundreds of hostages to their family but by the way that is not the imposing comas he'll notice dis cancelling compass military capacity but living them in place to be just fine apparently with barokobama and again israel has to be leverage fit that we have to we have to jo broads can a stand there in tupupam all those dress if i do not got if i need o stop an the just con go on there there can be brutal began be horrible and then he says this is an enormously difficult task war is always tragic even most carefully plan military operations often put civilians as rest at risk as president by noted during his recent visit to israel america self has ha times fallen short of our higher values when engaged in war and in the aftermath of nine eleven us government was not interesting heating the advice of even our allies when it came to steps we took to protect ourselves against all kit now after the systematic masker of his really citizens amasser the evokes some of the darkest memories of persecution against yours people it's understandable many is relative demanded their government do whatever it takes to rut out compass o make sure the attar never happen again still again too big bottom in one in one piece still the world is watching closely as events in the region unfurl any military strategy that ignore the human cost could ultimately back fire ah here i and again there it is right therein is if israel defends itself they are just gin to be planting the seeds for mordant back tax which means it is really israel fall it is really israel felt in the end if israel goes in two hard and they take out mamas but comas is put too many civilians to run its rockets hell all that is on to do as is him crime or tar against israel then really who is to blame the news says barokabama because again the rely governments decision to cut off food water an electricity to a captive civilian population threatens not only to worse in a going humanitarian crises it could further harden palistinian attitudes for generation all the vaunted piston an attitudes because as we know they are extremely pliable right now and have been for thirty years much pliability much at temper piece many pea seeking people who do not exist that is obviously that that is the big priory the bird after the murder of fifteen hundred news in israel and the catnapping of two hundred is the playability of the palistonian population by the way israel i got a say the gaze hospitals where the power is still largely on it is a conical over there wish one day of a oil those supposed to last for one day lasted for eight we solid eighteen days under war and still magically there is still some electricity in northern gaze by the waythere till water in many's why cause israel provided five to ten per cents of all the water in the first place by the way there is still full power and water in the south of gaze the entire purpose of cutting off the water and power in the north is to send people too the south can do military operations in the north but brokabama now that instead he is just promoting this lie and it goes on and on and on and on and then of course he suggests that the the end of this an it is all the lies at once from barokabama because this is what he does will get to more of barokabama's lies in just one second again trying to set up that moral parade that ends with israel endangering its own existence and blaming israel for deduces i its that momentarily first the october fifteenth tax deadline has just pass a know many of you might be dreading the stress of filing those taxes will filing your taxes can be a long excruciating process but if you do not file your starch o pow penalties under tax tat that is why you need to check out

news of course he says finally in dealing with what isn't extraordinarily complexituition and there is the complexity there is the o much n ant much because standing in the moral mental allows you to stand with the bad got while pretending we're not he says in dealing with what is an extraordinary complex situation where many are in pain and passions are understandably running high all that is need to do our best to put our best values rather than our worst fears on displays that means actively opposing antisemitism in all of its forms everywhere it means rejecting efforts to minimized the terrible tragedy the is rally people have just endured notice these rally people not not the jewfish people these rely people as well as the morally bankrupt suggestion that any cause can somehow justify the deliberates slaughter of innocent people it means rejecting anti muscle anti arab or anti palistinian sentiment it means refusing to lump all palistinians with compass or other terror groups it means guarding against de humanizing language toward the people of goa o get about this about none of this has been humanize civilians got are sill civilians and it is compass fault they are in the way quote it means acknowledging the palstingians have also lived in disputed territories for generations that many of them we are not only displaced when israel was formed but continue to be forcibly displaced by a settler movements that too often has receive tacit or explicitsupport from the israel ah ah there it is it is the awe the two states all the settlers ah all the usual reasons why palistinian desire for is rally extermination is totally fine it is because somebody built a cattleman from that is really the problem that palstingan leaders who been willing to make concessions for two states lotion of too often had too little to show for their efforts who are these palstingan leaders who been superwilling to make concessions for to stay solution who are they name them seriously name them it'd to hear full list go o you do not have any oh there is a shock and that it is possible for people of good will to champion palistinian rights and oppose certain is rally government ponies in the west bank an got without being ansimetic nobody even made the accusation they have to grove everything israel does but you do have to look at reality in the face reality in the face the palcinian authority seeks the destruction of israel they are not shy about this they lie to the teston than an tragic they say what they actually thing which is solidary the compass pain as lomagyhot is a terrogroup commodity terrogroup i do not understand we i man i do i know exactluits going on here you got o promote the lie and then of course your first to tombs freedmen and ben roads and all the people who agree with them on the supermodel complexity o the situation which really amounts to israel is to blame and again the that is big line over one is big line umber one is israel has to be pressure beat if they do not there scan a violate him an rights an you can see it from all the usual proforma suspects thou include the venerably stupid to see a woman with barely one brain sell shamming shell was not even have two to rub together here it is its war crimes according to alexandra o cozy cross straight from the bar inn in brooklet mama is absolutely engaged in ornithic attacks and every single day at there are wore details on that are released about what occurred on october seven that shocks the human consciousness and a and and shocks a conscience are collected conscience however we do now as well that war crimes do not however constantly n are not an appropriate response for other war crimes a work that there there's the pure moral equivalences out to war crime you see shooting a baby in the head in the bast vicar is exactly the same thing as you are aiming at palistonian rocket has been fired bahamas from behind department building and ts villains get killed in the process of you destroying that rocket wants or behind he apartment building same thing to nosy and if we do not encourage thou those those pesky news and there and there defending themselves ow those human rides violators began is seen in gest rule jabrael doing the same exactrisyan israel is trying she says to expel palisonians which is heard since israel withdrew the on by that the only vewloman expelled from the gosistrip in last twenty years are dues eight thousand of them forcibly remove from twenty one communities in the gosistrip in two thousand five we hard have the expulsion of palistonians since nineteen forty eight has change the palestonian population in the land of israel and the westing in the gosestrip from promising one point to million to almost seven million people while worst mana cleansing fort of all time here is a rule gjebrael i mean what is r sabjasti to those contra but also to the politician we would beatific palau millions probably an bis a definition of acnaclantic if you are allowing races to an be never antic to the land they belonged to you are basically creating a math rabato crania country that is yo ready baying the price of the the rate cries to the only tarn e tat to trying to administration a crusher israel to great baticly a place where if aureate crab human life at the far o human life an international law is well is to is on the ultimate par that condetarmen what what to do with in a racket oh is israel that has to do it commons by the way was the en control of this entire area for twenty years but rule juries had nothing say of it nothing zero zip zilch egypt could take control this entire area and make it into a paradise have they done that no no by the way israel has twenty percent of its citizens a is daily arab twenty percent of a citizens this this talk of ethnic israel did not want to be in the gosh strip they do not want to be in the gossistrip the only reason that there is a refuge you room right now is because commons uses civilians as not only its human shields but as its targets for indoctrination no state no state on earth would accept a population in its very midst hat seeks its open destruction and if they do that to suicidal state if israel had its druthers israel would've turned the gas strip into hong long that was the alter in two thousand five an insteadicomos tennis into what you would imagine a terrostape again this is the lie the lies that ut again it is always israel talk go back right to the moral equivalents a a an idiot who resigned from the statedpartment me josh pal former director of the states departments bureau of political military affairs he resigned from the state department why because he says that the united states needed to force israel to abide by human rights he said when october seventh but comes massacre is ray's village i felt sicko my stomach but because of the for being visited upon innocence and because i knew what would come next ah that that is really it yes cause he knew will not come next those those bad bad news it'll gat that is big line number one big line number to big line number to is that israel effectively antiianism is not antisemitism and that really when were talking about the rise in antisemitism were sing all over the globe when we see giant crowds in the streets in onion chanting free palestine which means murder all the juicing the area or on we see people in kidney chanting gas the news they do not actually mean gas the news they mean that israel should be nicer that is what they actually mean that it gets transmuted and thus antisemitism jewhatred is not actually in any way wanting the destruction f the state sirens he hers the thing if you admit that antisianism is antisemitism the calls for a two state solution become untenable the reason they become untenable is because every one in the palsinian authority and is lonichy hot hierarchy every one and by large sloths of the placing an population are antisionist when i say large within me nearly every one is antisionist you admit that antisianism equals antisemitism you are admitting that that population is antisemitic adieu can make a deal with antisemite instead there has to be the self flattering western bazar view that antisinisman antisemitism are two separate things again that's completely exploded october seventh when a group of very left wing many of them piece activist in israel were slaughtered whole sale bi readies that was destroyed bathe no right back to tatisquanty if antisemitism is not antisinism if these are two separable things then what is antisemitism most ah of the best way to hide this is to pretend that antisemitism in is homophobia are two aspects of the same thing there is part of a broader rubric of of a cycle of violins that when muscles call for the destruction of radical moms call for the destruction of the state of israel when they go into the streets of kidney and thank asked the news that that sit part of a cycle of vixens in which news are doing the same thing to moles than it just a psych of violins altogether and it really has nothing to do with israel process we can put pressure on israel which just got absolutely destroyed in the south we cant we ants that is that is the goal here rid ti these together and you seen the administration do the all the time an normal donate had o sweet from two thousand sixteen that is that started go viral again anti and and it should go viral because it is really funny in which he said duo what terrifies me is vices were to detonate nuclear dicing kill fifty million america imagine the back clashing peaceful museums and that is precisely the the line that is now being taken by many members of the media many members of this administration many members of the left is it o my god that the rising is lmaphobia that's going to be attendants on the murder of fifteen hundred thus is just got it is gonbogle the mine the rising antisemitism that the rising is homophobia that is going to be attendant on seen hundreds of thousands people march and solidarity with terrace wow we cannot allow that in antisemitism and is homophobia there both just from the same place that r the same people that that is what is really happening king now it is not you really really is not that does not mean there are not people who are not racist against museums or or who or who see people with brownskan do not them in tat is a very different thing from what we are sing right now which is the desire to fool scale exterminate the state of israel because it is filled with news instead f is ore not filled with news it would not be interesting exterminating it would they in any can you are is corner jompyere yesterday choose ask about the rising antisemitism in the united states which ye i mean news do not feel comfortable on campus because many of them been beaten up news in smoky are being or our being confronted with mass protest in favor of comose every yo i know personally literally every job now personally is obtaining a on every one because if the rising antisemitism but here is cent cerencompier's askabaut antisemitism an she immediately swivels in this lomaphobialand ans yet just why we've to ask yevetask yourself why and the answer is again it is that desire to separate off artisan ism from antisemitism by instead lumping together antisemitism and is homophobia under some sort of broad rubric of all all discrimination is bet here is correncon pierce an competent press secretary t o my ai a thing a look am we have not there any credible a threat tin ow there is been always questions about a credible three and i just when to measure that that out there be muslemindos perceived to be muscle have idiot it dis proportionate a number of hate feel attacks and certainly president in days that many of our muslin arab a ermericans an panting america love ones and neighbors a worried about the hate being directed at there communities that is something you heard the president speak to in his in his address just last last thursday hum well i mean i heard the question being about antisemitism and yet you immediately swiveled into his homophobia how weird how strange why why because if you can swivel into his lamaphobia from a question about antisemitism this blows you to avoid you real time real world implications of the fact that anti israel is antisemitic and that is what that is instead you just is direct by the way coreencjom pair i mean show pretty much set it openly yesterday and a follow on in a follow on question chose asked about whether antisinism is antisemitism on college campus is not shes i o w i no a a carry e e potato college an so and i precut eye pecan e e r an ani of o the the plan you anta is real ta an banana o college an us a and the ten o i not going t get in to what is happening across the country in at if item not get t getting o t pic as the admiral and a a that wit something at peaceful protect it is really a partner parted by to marks it being able fopokto to ow these do o witty anti this is his the martothetictic old have ever heard when she says this canst as just cutter wishes moron when when she says the aorist of just remember her president ran and is going to run again on protestors in charlottes will shouting about things right antisemitic ant racist protestors in charlotsville i remember her saying things shall tat is the first mama right that is the way that it works that is not the question you have literally spent your entire modern political career suggesting that races has no place ant hes is lone these have no place they have no place but when you see it manifest every single day on college canvasses where thousands of people are marching in solid rarity with terrors group that is well that is creepy we have nothing to say here nothing to say here these again the idea here is that you can be as anti israel as you want to be up to an including the slaughter of news and that is basically just as lymph by the way just on the merits you in point out here that the number of anti jewfish incidents in two thousand and twenty to the the one thousand five or ninety federally reported incidents related to religion and from of hate crimes fifty one point four per cent we are against news a majority were against news how many were point boat antidromic nine point six per cent in other words five times five times as many hatcrime incidents against news as against museums but the administration is focassingin a leiserby mount is homophobia again the idea of doing that is to lump to gather all forms of discrimination we can pretend that antisemitism is not a difference in kind from is homophobia and that and that all of its springs from just people who are mean in their harts as oppose to in actual political position of the state of visceral should be eviscerated in that the news ought to go as well in a second we will get to big lie number three which is the one that is the most comforting people just cannot we just to it wo state solution

bent key is great and that it is material is fine but there really mad at it and the reason that mat ate of course it is because it provides an alternative the left would not you to have an alternative the left would love for your kids to watch you two for the kids and the the next video to be some trains influence or telling your kids about how genders a spectrum they will love that an

closable two daily wired out come slash subscribe right now start striking the next generation of kids entertain look can meanwhile already and then there is big line umber three big line number one is that israel has to be pressure because if they are not pressure to maintain human rights the in a violate human rights and of course that is all a set up that is ta set up it like a set up and punch line the set up is israel has to be pressured notes violate human rights then it to war and something goes wrongs hell we told them we told them but those news cannot be control really what happens this whole things big cycle of violence moral equivalents that is big line umber one it is told by a huge number of people in the media and in government big line number too is of course that antisinism is not antisemitism and of those two are separable and you can be just as anti israel as you want you can even know be in favor of its extermination and that is non anti's magic what you really should be focuston is all sorts of discrimination his homophobia that is really what we need to be tau king bout its is lamaphobia that is that is the big problem because where antisemitism comes from as the same place that anti is lam activity comes from they all come from the same place and that is you being not true not true at all many things can be bad and also not be alike a big line number three the two states solution is the thing we have to be focused in on right now that is insane ism sorry that is totally insane that is saying after nine eleven the thing that the united states has to be focus sunlight now as coming to a would toe talisman that is crazy it is nuts know one would suggest such a thing if you did suggest such a thing people would laugh you out of room but that is now the a adopted mode of literally everyone in western politics where we cannot let the two state solution die we cannot let it t with whom do you propose to do this two state solution with whom the biggest advocates of the two state solution an israel just got marred they're children just burned to death alive that is all again the communities around the gosh envelope those places are by and large members of the political left in israel it does not matter to these folks t does not matter at all this s were you get your bit an sweet again an join talking about the two state solution that is hard as it is we can not give up on piece who is we who is we wat what thy not known it of course the united states we love to see piece over there a tell will sty piece over their israel you know who does not want ta seek piece the other side clearly again very simple plot experiment tomorrow if the if the idea demanded and know new had a on every new in that region is dead every single one if they all give up their gone tomorrow they would all be dead meanwhile if compass had disarmed if comose were not a terror group t give happened success i give happened in the passing in authority areas were they not siphoning money off to their personal bank accounts mom databases worth now tens of not hundreds of millions dollars it ben happening if they not been building up terrigroups an an doctrinal their kids to hate news is a tool against the jewfish state it a ben happening prosperity the that the father is very simple and yet again it is this idea that we all want the same thing we serious we do not we do not ism sorry to break it to you we do not not everyone on the earth wants the same things as you and it is at no sentrocity of the highest possible level to believe they do when people tell you what they want and then you ignore them and they know what you really want is piece what you really warns is a better economic way of life what you real your being pier you once have a paternalism that is paternalism when join says we cannot give up on a two state solution is rallies in palcinians equally deserve to live in safety dignity and piece they may equally deserve to live in safety dignity and piece but only one side is seeking to live in safety dignity and piece you think is rallies are for of having to draft their eighteen year old kids and ten put them a check points you thing that something they love to do would you love to do that f their kits the answer of courses know and yet that is what israel has you why because they do not they will be overrun and marred in their beds as we saw but this is the lie and theyregoin to keep pushing this lie this is also that that lie by the way that this lie that everyone seeks the same things also what forwent up with the bazar spectacle of john curly who is thespokes person for the national security ad ministration saying that would be very bad to provoke the visits of common supporters if somebody is out their supporting commons an there on o vesuther're not even america citizen america citizens have free speech rights but if you are a vest holder you do not have the ability's sporttair group in fact we will not give you o we sit if you supported tairigroup and it can be applied retroactively legally speaking now joustgon a lie and he is going pretend that if your leaseholder let say thatyouare foreign student from egypt and you are out there in the streets shouting from the river to the sea palestine will be free and your holding up a poster of a common terrorist hes saying none of you one right to be he that is just free speak that is not true that is not trout again it goes back to this base line ridiculous willingness to believe lies that are told to your face while different language is spoken on arabia tea here is john curly and say spokes person abri algae o o or you or a or uncaring in the n action or they are later the action o ha the e the o or are oration worse an caution for t the a to remark oo e o s the do not have tore it every sentiment that express in free country li this e to to stand by the teethe lethe first semen in the idea peaceful vote that is not apply to importing terror supporters into america it does not it does not but again they realized they they are not really her suppers they just he is real and n that there really they seek piece and the have only put poor presser on the two stayeslishon now in a second herengigto get to the real the real issue here the real issue here is that people this people who are who despises we won we he destroyed people who are who are participating in these lies they are doing either out of moral cowardice or because reality being reality it turns out that the people israel is fighting they do not just hit israel they also hit honest and many of their fellow travellers also hit to west and what this really is what we are watching in real time an this with disturbing is the the friars canon coalition of the wretched a tempting to destroy western civilized institutions in the name of the supposedly colonialism that is what we are actually watching in real time will get to that momentarily first we do things here very differently at the daily wire ye has the lot of the tome news podcast in the nation we watch your chocolate company over night we took dishy head on we are let a hundred fifty apse's of kids content and we do all of those things which men were constantly seeking to grow and get better and are employs have to going ut better to

him out right now ziprocruier dad cams lash daily wire that zip recruiter a cam flash daily wire and start hiring batter to day what is the actual story as to what is happening here right the one that is behind all the wise again those big lies that israel is real humorist filing are war crime maven really bagels is bad comas too that anti animatism is on force basically two birds of the of the same color that and to biggie see that the the two statesolution israel must be pressor frotwostatesolution the solves the problem the real answer here is that the people who did what they did on october seven and their allies and their fellow travellers hat to at israealitious a symptom of that a some me saying this there is a guy who is a a son of e comas leader his name is most hassanuself called son of mamas he entered up converting to christiania and moving away from radical son he interviewed with take tapper last night and a he explained what exactly comas ones what did you see in experience the man you turn on mamas and in help israel is ice the was the child they always compleat to my father about mamas er abuse of power and the the reality an o they the very respect and the the very religious their fanatics and that that did not think at some point u or the course or this global trouble they they are wish her a brutality i witness the reality first hand when i was in risen when the tortured many pelistinian a people for suspicion e of colagratn with israel a again a he he goes on he suggested the fight renounce that israel action on the west side even if west as one acknowledge an here he is we surprised at the failure of his rain intelligence on october seventh listen there was a failure but this is not the time to blame anybody the the there is corruption iris failure a there's lack coffle thesis but this is not the time now to blame anybody this is the time to get end fit the that takes ne took i israel the necessary cover to cruel camps mama it israel is fighting on behalf of of america sired is fighting on behalf of the pelistinian people iran now is fighting on behalf of the free world this is not duple put i ti a propaganda he is right about that now here is the thing the the commas fight against the free world the that is back by a group of people who abide by particular philosophy that philosophy in the west is the post colonial philosophy seventeen hundred sociologist yesterday s first all sociologists its an nonsense it is a nonsense field of study tocologies a made up field of study almost entirely there are some good sociology books the have beenwritten but as a field of study t is a mishmash of absolute garbage stupidity and some interesting insights that is a sociology is but seventeen hundred sociologists including signatures from professors at hazard yell prince in oxford brown burly signed a letter solidarity with gaze and the palistinian people and here is what they write and again this this says the whole thing quote sociology as a discipline is rooted in recognition of relationships of power and in e quality as sociologist an human beings we unreservedly condemned the latest violence against the placing in people and gaze and wetback at the hands of the shall regime the entire by the ay the entire thing does not mention at any point what composted at any point in the entire later it is several paragraphs along it is two pages long no mention whatsoever of compass initiating this by marring fifteen hundred civilians at all instead what is the justification for their siding with the palistinians and with and with compass by their all the talk about how the palstinian people they do not support compass they do not the people of the la they soft support compass i just have question where are the protest against chinos in the arab world ware have you seen them anywhere at all ruler no i did not think in any case here is the a here is what the sociologists say quote we join people around the world while raising their voices in protest of this assault on human life as educators it is our duty to stand by the principles of critical inquiry and learning to hold the university is of space for conversation that four grounds historical truths and that contextualizes this past weeks violence in the context of seventy five years of settler colonial occupation in european empire of i mean they are just saying the quart out outright there seventy five years you may notice does not take you back to nineteen sixty seven it tan's you back to nineteen forty eight the establishment the tattoo israel they're saying israel must be destroyed is real must be destroyed because it is in their words a colonial outpost is real must be destroyed because the west cannot be allowed to existing any form even an indigenous form in the mat least it cannot be allowed according to these people that would be an act of colonialism of settler colonialism and that means that any news living the region in the inside of fronsfinon ought to be victimized by violent revolutionary violent is parton parcel decolonization these are people who not only live in the west and have benefited from the west these are people who sit at the highest institutions of learning in the west there calling the war that is rob now waging on compass a genocidal war which is weird be again generally when you commit genocide you do not warn the civilians first you just killed them u not genocide rushing into cutouts behind murdering every one you must nocenicidl warning people for a week on end to get out of an area becks youreatempting that a military tag t that is not the same thing they say the stands follows in the tradition of the civil rites movement anti warn anti parts ad protest of decades pass a lining ourselves with these freedom struggles we call on all of our colleagues to stand in solidary with palistinians and against settler colonialism imperialism in genocide now this letter is revealing because this is really what its a about the same people who believe that israel is a colonial settler and position believe that the wet is entirely colonial settler and position that the west ought to be dismantled the west is an imperialist structure because it is supported by things capitalism and free markets and free movement of labor and free speak those things are bad there settler colonial movements that must be destroyed from without or from within that is what this is all about which presumably is why these higher educators a for example at oxford now going to debate emotion on this day calling for quote into fade until victory a motion share with remembers of the university an college union report my states that the branch believes that quote only a mass uprising on both sides of the green line and across the middle least can free the palistinian people both sides of the green line would mean violence inside israel at the green line for folks are not versed and idle eastern politics that would be the territory held by israel before the nineteen sixty seven sixty war initiated by the grabs their saying that they want violent across the middle east in order to quornquo free the painting in people which would amount to what destroying israel obviously this apparently says quote that the war is a direct consequence of decades to violent oppression the painting in people by these daily state again it is all the juwsfalt and goes on to say it is the duty of the international movement of workers an youth to support the struggle and they call for a socialist federation of mileage and into fade until victory that is what this whole thing is about that that is that is what the holder and there just sang it out lats o you wonder why queers for palestine which makes no sense then i know their laypeople on the right who are puzzled by this what why r their bunch people a transfers marching alongside people who behead them at the first available opportunity why and the answer is because not about that its about western civilization is bad and must be torn down in israel is just the tip of the spear because it happens to be a western power that exists in a in a place that is a very different mine set and'swo it has to be dismantle that is the thing that matters more than anything else that is what this is really all about o can meanwhile in terms of the latest news two more hostages were released overnights compass set free two really really elderly hostages and they testify to the fact that compass has hundreds of bolometers of tunnels underground a right now what commossis attempting to do is separate off certain hostages from other hostages they have been focussing in on the ones they think will be most sympathetic to the world media that means people who have connections to america media or duel citizens they are going to hold presumably the the man hostages that they have taken until they shoot them or kill hem that that is their goal and they are going to try to get the west to basely put pressure on israel for a sense fire that israel that israel just pretend that the terratacks an take place if the hostages come back and jobidon unfortunately because he is no longer with us he is a he is making sounds that here is real bison being asked about a sense fire yesterday and a what in the worlds see talking about a fire whywhat what is it what is it e was first he says sure we should have see fire then he's a know we shouldn't have a see fire then he is were may be welled to the hostages home and then we will talk about a seas fire or maybe a seas fire would benefit comose which is why they are calling for one in the first place an there's there is one other concern that is now been raise to the for this is the concern on the part of some people on the right and this is the concern the there is some people on the right won think or being fully disingenuous and where looking for an excuse to jump right on the same moral equivalency bandwagon as e left i think there is certainly people that we talk about them the show before ism she be talk about them on the show again but one of the moves that is being made n or if you stifle israel response this is to claim that if israel does respond as attastrospond or to rude out comose entirely that this will end in worldworth ray yesterday tucker hat on his program a general name doubles my greater my greggor has in the pass suggested that jewfish money is behind america but for israel and all the last but my greggor it has military expertise and his essentially now warning that armagetten is coming which and and his propose solution would be that israel does nothing which by the way absolutely promotes the idea of a magenta because if israel nothing after fifteen hundred of hits citizens are slaughtered and close remains in place the chance is of a broad scale mufti front attack on israel that require america intervention go up practically but doubles my rigor is on a tuck across an tucker of course has been pushing a pacifist line on the since the beginning i hear what here is tucker my greggor last night do you think that we are moving toward war with the road yes i do and it looks the chasing destination singled armament there does not seem to be any real appreciation for the implications for us and and frankly for rope in the world as well as it the least of such action fora to hath my greggor has also been an advocate of the united states basically leaving you crane to fry but when when my greggor says things we are we are right on the verge of worth on the whole point is deterrents de terminus is a thing what em holding are on weakness this has been true for literally ever but there been the equation that is now happened on the right wore if you stand up to a terror power the idea is that i somehow puts a merino in a position that is weaker which again is a not righting position that is not a concerned of position it is never been a conservative position far as ism aware piece through strength has been at conservative position for as long as i been a lit certainly this idea that t you are tightening the chances of a world war if if america actually elected its muscles sometimes is its a bazaar one when what we knows precisely the opposite the reason this attack was launched on israel first place is because the bit administration was conciliatory toward on tit is one of the reasons the play from afghanistan is another reason my greggor says this thing will not ay contained which would be mostly true if america worst there to keep a lit on it the whole point of america having aircraft carriers n mediterranian is to say keep it keep a lit on it do not open up a second front with as block as that is going to there the lit off there too many unknowns an uncertainties here and everyone always assumes tat the beginning of such a conflict we'll be contained it will only have to fight these people summons may be hispelel it never works out that a these things always last longer than everyone thinks the resources required are much more profound than what we anticipated and remember we have already used up many of our wore stocks in you train hate when he is at first all every one has an interest in keeping this contain everyone the bet bet get i the there is this ugly thing that that is been happening tucker does not a lot in which he suggests that if you disagree with him on the tactic to keep the thing contain hear i want the same thing no war with a on no america involvement in this region of the world that amounts to america boots on the ground we all want the same thing here but the idea is that if you think america so flute its muscles in order to push pinball's off the ball for example then this means the us you want the worwrithr found which of course is is really scurrility is not t is not true my greggor goes farms say we have to save israel from itself that is israel must be saved that the only way is to cram down on israel what what can say israel apparently is em is some sort of piece steal broker with compass by the turns who support commas that is mom trigger's actual solution here the support for israel is going to e rod and at the same time the anger and hatred inside the region which already dislikes israel it is going to be phenomenal israel is doing something that i think no one has ever accomplished at least not in my lifetime and that is uniting sunny and sheer against itself that is why i think we have an obligation to save israel from itself but that is not a popular position right now it is bobs away and everyone is cheering well i mean save israel for himself how you men therein not earn the love of the soon and wheel world by not taking out comas and allowing in citizens to be slaughtered wholesale an taken hostage an tar's a fundamental is understanding of the region ill it'll chalk it up to fund mental misunderstanding and not something mornifarrious because that is what it seems to be but again t what is scurrility is the implication that if you believe that piece through strength is an actual workable stratagem in the least which his toricllate husband that if you believe that that somehow you are in favor of a broader war and that of course is not true in any way she perform army coming up wore can be joined by drew clavi has a bran new book out a lot of fine mussels get to theposic today with him if you are not a member become member use coach

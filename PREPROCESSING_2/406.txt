welcome to the superman l science science pace toe i ma indrhubermen and of professor neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medic to day we are discussing fitness a fitness of course is vitally important for cartevascular health for strength for endurance for life span for health span i can think of any one out there that would not want to have healthy hormonal function healthy party of vascular function to live a long time and to feel vital that is to have a long health span as well as a long life span fitness and fitness protocols are tremendously powerful for developing all of that however despite their being an enormous amount of information out their on the internet an in books and elsewhere it can be a bit overwhelming to day's episode is really designed to synthesize science base tools that we have covered on the podcast some with expert guess doctor any gain or doctor peter a ta or world renowned movement specialist eat portal or physiotherapists and strength and conditioning coach guff cavalier we have had all of them on its guests on the podcast and each an every one of them provided a wealth of knowledge in terms of the various things that you can do to optimize very specific or multiple aspects of fitness today we are gan no to do something a little bit different than usual typically on the superman lad podcast i offer mechanism up front or first and then we talk about protocols that you can use that really lean on those science and science based mechanisms to day ism going to describe a specific protocol that serves as a general templet that anyone in fact every one can you use in order to maximize all aspects of fitness that includes endurance strength flectsibility hypertrophy esthetic changes et camera however this general frame work can also be modify that is customize to your particular needs if your somebody who really wants to build more strength or bigger muscles you can change the protocol and that over all program according to that and it'll how about very specific ways to do that or if your somebody who really just wants to maintain strength be y want to build en durance will talk about that and of course we will cover real life issues such as should you train if you are sleep deprived what about food when should you eat what if you haven't eaten in your hungry should you still train et camera et camera were going to cover all of that again in the contact of this what i would all foundational templet of fitness this foundational templet of fitness is something that i personally use in fact have used it for over three decades are to believe that that open i just recently tern forty seven and i still use this basic protocol or templet a cross the week and modify it according to what my particular goals are that year that month even that day because i you live in the real world and sometimes have been traveling or i miss a work out yes it does happen or life is not organized in exactly the way that i need to in order to have everything go according to the protocol that is on paper organ to discuss real world issues and h t a work with the real world issues in order to get the most out of your fitness program and again by the end of to day's program i can assure you you will have a templet protocol that you can build up from built out change and modify and that will really serve your fitness goals according to the science and what previewed studies and the experts that appeared on this podcast and other podcast really tell us is best and optimal for our fitness before we dive into to day's content about fitness and fitness protocols when i tell you about a brand new study that is very exciting and frankly very unusual this is a study that was published out of the university of button examining a what i would call a micro exercise or a micro movement is hat very small movement of a very small portion of your body in fact just one per cent of your musculature that when it is perform continuously while seed has we s what they report are very dramatic positive changes and terms of blood sugar utilization and metabolism the title of this study is a potent physiological method to magnify and sustain solos oxidate of metabolism improves glucose and lipid regulation this study was published in i science and as i mention earlier it is getting a lot of attention and its very unusual without going into all the details of the study which just briefly give you a little bit the background first of oil you have a muscle called the holiest the soloist muscle is a for o less wide flat muscle that sits beneath what most people think of as their calf although its part of the calf muscle the other portion the calf as called the gastrocnemius the solid sits below that now the holiest muscle is a unique muscle because it is largely slow twice muscle fires it is design to be used continuously over and over again for stabilizing your body when you are standing upright for walking this is a muscle that is design to contract over and over and over again in fact you could walk all day on this muscle and most likely it would not get sore you probably done that and it did not get sore in contrast a muscle your beeper your triceps if i were to have you perform hundreds or thousands of repetitions even with a very light weight i one pound weight or too pound weight eventually it would fatigue you would feel that sort of a burn there it is a very unusual set of muscles to use repeatedly but the solipsism unusual muscle in that it really is design to be used continuously now this study was focused on how people who sit a lot of the day and do not have the opportunity for a lot of physical movement or maybe the do not even exercise at all can improve their metabolism and glucose utilization without going into a deep dive about glucose urination because we have done the deep dive on this podcast episode such as metabolism et camera you can look those up at suborn lapdog come that all time stamped and available there any time you eat your blood sugar goes up to some extent your blood glucose as its call goes up to some extent and then insolent as a hormone that is used to essentially chaperone a and sequester and use that blood glucose's basically the ideas you do not want blood locos to go too high hyper insolenemia is something associate with blood glucose's too high because insolent goes up to essentially match the level of blood locos you do not also do not want to be hypoglizing if you do not want o have blood sugar that is too low and insolent involved in both regulating peaks and troughs in blood sugar blood glucose we can basically say and this is very simple but we can basically say that you do not want blood glucose to be elevated too much or for too long that is not good in fact people who have diobetiens because they do not make insolent people of typondi beauties do not make insolent at all their blood locos has is high that they i should have to take insolent in order to regulate otherwise their blood locos can go high that it can damage cells and damage organs tat can even kill people people have to too diabetes are called insolent insensitive they make insolent but the receptors to insolent are not sensitive to it and they make more insolent than normally would be made and blood closes ant regulate properly et camera et camera the take come message about blood glucose is that you want your blood locos levels to go up when you eat but not too highland you do not want them to say elevated for too long this study looked at how people who are largely sedentary or at my sitting can increase the utilization the clearance of glucose from the blood stream after eating and they also looked at over all metabolism for people get this that we are using just that one percent of muscle the solids by doing what they call a holiest pushup the holiest push up can be described very simply as if you are sitting down with your knee bent at an approximately right angle i a square corner and pushing uprush es a lifting your heel while pushing down on your to and contracting the calf muscle as it were and then lowering the heel and then in lifting that heel again lowering the heel lifting the heel again each one of those is what they call a solid pushup this study had people continuously do solves pushups and they look at things blood lucosualization they looked at metabolism and on now couple of important things about the study before i tell you what they discovered which was frankly pretty miraculous almost hard to believe and yet i believe the data the dato look a to be collected quite a quite well and they are lot of statistics in the study looks to be quite thorough first of all they used an equal number of man and female subjects there were wide range of body mass indicate case this was not just superfix people are people that were purely sedentary not fit they used a wide variety of ages time of day that people who tended to walk a lot or not walk a lot they measured changes in metabolism and blood glues utilization in people that had done these holiest push ups wall seated in the laboratory and i must say they had them do these soles push ups are quite a long while continuously they have them do it for as long as too hundred and seventy minutes total throughout the day if you divide that that is four and a half hours you mighty while for and half hours of lifting the heel and putting the heel down lifting the heel putting the eel down that is a lot but they did not always do it continuously that had some breaks in there this is the sort of thing that you could imagine you or other people could do while seated while doing fumes or a while on calls or have even while eating doing that sort of thing although ism not suggesting that you constantly be focussing on solids pushups throughout your life the point is that people who did these holiest pushups experienced traumatic improvements in blood sugar regulation and in metabolism despite the fact that the solids is just one per cent of the total musculature here i am going to read from the abstract about what they found people who did these solves pushups despite being a tiny muscle and using very little local energy in fact they measured muscle glycogen the burn or essentially the the utilization of fuel within the muscle and the was very little utilization of fuel within the solids itself and that is because the solids has this unique property of needing to basely keep you going all day walking all day or moving all day what they saw was a large magnitude for example fifty two per cent less post prenatal that is after a meal glucose excursion fifty two per cent less increase in blood glucose and sixty per cent sixty r o less hyper insolenemia reduce levels of insolent they also miraculously observe that despite this being again at a small muscle one per cent of the total muscle mass very small oxidative use they saw big improvements in systemic metabolic regulation this is interesting i think something that we would at least know about ism not aware that any one's replicated the study yet i know there is a ton of excitement about the study in the popular press and if the data turn out to hold up which i to imagine they will i can understand why there much excitement what this means is that if you are somebody who cares about blood glucose regulation you want to keep your metabolism running please do not stop exercising the other ways that you exercise but if yore's somebody who wants to maximize your health doing these solves pushups fairly continuously while seated is going to be beneficial and in addition to that i know that there are going to be people out there who forincencs might be injured or your traveling in your sick on a plan or you are in the class room and your forced to study all day or take notes all day you've just not getting enough opportunity to get those steps that you want to take whether notes ten thousand or few r or more getting enough steps or movement maybeyou do not have time to get out into your run or maybe also running weight lifting and doing yoga classes and things of that sort but you want to further improve your fitness at least in terms of your metabolic health this seems a terrific very low investment way to do it certainly zero cost it does take a little bit of attention you have to divert your attention from other things you are doing to make sure that your still doing these solves pushups ism sure that many of you or can have a lot of detailed questions such as how high did they lift the heel l and did they contract the muscle very hard or not couple of things about that they did not have subjects really contract the muscle hard they did measure the angle of heel rays a man who was anywhere from ten to fifteen degrees you they did not have to go waylay up on their tiptoes or things of that sort in any event two hundred seventy minutes for and a half hours of doing these a solids push ups is a lot but by my read of the data and the rather significant or wishes a very significant effects that they observed on blood locos regulation in metabolism et camera seems to me that doing less would still be beneficial and that you do not necessarily have to do the full too under in seventy minutes in order to get the benefits that they observed more about the study includes the fact that the benefits thy observed were very long lasting as long as two hours after a meal they could still see this improve blood lucosealisation i do not know because i was not able to find it in the methods whether not they were doing the solids push ups while they were consuming am blood sugar in the study the point being that if you are somebody who cares about their fitness this study is interesting because what it means is that again if you are force to be i mobile or sitting longer than you would feel stuck in a meeting resumes or class or on a plane et camera or if your simply trying to add a bit more fitness and metabolic health to your overall regimen solids pushups least to me seem a very low investment simple zero cost tool to improve your metabolic health for those of you that want i proves the study a more detail we will provide a link to this paper publish inn science in the shoot caption before we begin id to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls et stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of today's pod cast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper rations and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back to electorolike ratio of one thousand milligrams that is one graham of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any biophysical training and after physical training as well especially if i have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doc come slash supermen to claim a free elements sample pack with your purchase again that drink element el event dot come slash supermen let us talk about fitness and let us talk about how you can develop the optimal fitness protocols for you that includes what to do each day of the week and your fitness protocol across the week and indeed across the month and the year and even year to year when we had doctor and galloping on the podcast he said something very important that we want to keep in mind to day which is concepts are few methods are many that is there are an infinite number of different programs and exercises and set in rest schemes in different runs and puppies and pushups et camera et camera that one can follow however there are really just a few basic concepts or principles of muscle physiology of cardiovascular function of connective tissue function that provide or set the basis for the adaptations that we call fitness or that lead to fitness can list this off now we can talk about a fitness protocol that is really aimed mainly toward developing skill that is one or speed that is another or power which is speed time strength or specifically strength or hypertrophy growth of muscles or endurance such as muscular endurance muscular endurance is for instance ability to stay in a plank position or to do a wall sit you now sit on an invisible chair against a wall or other forms of endurance near pure anerobic endurance a one minute sprint or less or one minute all out cycling on a stationary bike this sort of thing or endurance that occurs in the kind of three to twelve minute total duration range that might be sprints or huh intents the interval type training it could be a all out swim it could be all outgrow that is another form of endurance taps into different fuel systems diffeaspects of muscle physiology et camera and then endurance that last thirty minutes are more which is typically what people think about when they think about endurance but of course the other forms of endurance matter we have got skill speed power strength hypertrophy muscular endurance anerobic endurance what i would call three to twelve minutes insurance although it goes by other names as well and thirty minute or more endurance type exercise and adaptations each in every one of these requires different principles different concepts in order to improve a your muscular straight through your hypertrophy or both however there is a general theme that sits beneath all adaptations leading to fitness and that is what were really going to set down as the base layer the foundation of everything we talk about to day and that is that we need to think about what are the modifiable variables again i borrowing directly from the episode of doctor any yapping he was the one that said modifiable variables are the key thing to thing about what are you going to modify what are you going to change in order to increase one or sum of the various things i list it off before gillspeed power strength hypertrophy endurance et camera et camera and some of the key concepts that emerge from that discussion a that we need to think about progressive overload normally when people hereabout progressive overload they think about adding more weight to a bar picking up heavier dumb bells but that could also be progressive overload in the contacts of running up a hill of steeper incline or running a lota bit faster a little bit further and on and forth now as i promised earlier to day we are not going to drill into each in every one of the mechanisms that underlie the different adaptations that are going to develop speed and strength and endurance et camera because that was covered in the podcast with doctor any galloping and the other podcast with experts that i mention earlier and we again will provide links to those podcast if you want to drill into those mechanisms instead what we are going to do is we are going to start with a program that essentially is designed for you to maximize all aspects of fitness to the extent that you can simultaneously maximize all aspects of fitness but then to change or modify that protocol that if you want to build up more for instance strength than you want just hold on to the endurance you have you do not want to build endurance at least not in that weaker that month you can do that or if you want improve your endurance while maintaining your strength you can do that and on and forth most people i do believe would a commination of strength and endurance and flexibility and maybe even hypertrophy particularly for certain muscle groups that may be are not as well developed as other muscle groups they want to bring balance to their physique both for sake of aesthetics and for sake of health and forsake of no general functioning maybe vent eliminate pain the protocol that ism going to describe really works as a foundational templet for that is well let us drill into that foundational protocol and it'll keep referring to it as the foundational protocol not because it is the one that i use although it is the one that i use in not because it is he one the were talking about to day although it the were talking about to day but because we need some general frame work from which to build out the more specific protocols that will get into in a bit more detail later in this foundational protocol for fitness what you will notice is that on any one given day you are going to focus on one particular aspect of fitness maybe it is endurance may be its strength may be its hypertrophy in particular it might be hypertrophy for particular muscle group or muscle groups that said across the entire week it is design to bring fitness and different forms of fitness to all aspects of your body this particular protocol begins on sundae although that is simply the day that i happen to begin the protocol and again this protocol is not important because it is the one that i follow i follow it because it is important in other words it is a protocol that really glean from the scientific literature and the experts that is for u this fitness protocols really about you i just may refer to it as the one that i follow ism simply for ease of communication and for me my week begins on sundae i do my very best to get a work out in on sundae and for me that work out is that of a endurance work out it is design to either maintain or increase my endurance and the endurance type that ism referring to is endurance of thirty minutes or more in fact for me the goal is always to get either sixty to seventy five minutes of jogging this would be called zone to cardie people probably have heard of zone too cardie but if you have not that socket zone to cardie something that you could measure with a heart rate monitor or other device but you do not need to zone too cardie is the kind of carry of vascular exercise in which you are pushing yourself to move such that your breathing faster than normal your heart is beating faster than normal however you are still able to sustain a conversation but if you were to push yourself any harder that is move faster or go up a steeper incline at the same rate you happen to be at any one moment you would lose that ability to speak you would not be able to complete sentence as you would be out of breath you would have to pause mid sentence now it is near impossible even with a heart rate monitor to stay exactly in zone to unless you are very very skilled at that i do not obsess over that and in fact i do not wear a heart rate monitor when i do this exercise but for me the goal is to head out on sundae and get sixty to seventy five minutes of jogging in zone to now of course i to jog wit that does it mean that you have to jog you could replace jogging with rowing on a rowing machine or may be even rowing an actual boat you have access to that or cycling or swimming something that allows you continuous movement for sixty to seventy five minutes at that zone to threshold we talked about earlier for me that can include some hills and when i say hills that could be very steep hills but it'll simply slow my pace down in order to stay in that roughly zone to range or it could be that they are or low grate hills and i might you just slow down a little bit or i might even push myself a tiny bit that day but really ism just trying to build that long endurance ism trying to build up my capacity or maintain my capacity to go a long distance without fatiguing now some days meaning some sundaes since i tend to do this almost always on sundae although there are exceptions instead of doing the sixty to seventy five minute jog what it'll do is i will head out for a long height that could be two and a half hours or three hours or may be even a four or five hour hike sometimes it is very long and it'll do that sometimes simply to mix up the routine because sometimes jogging and jogging the same routes gets boring to me i do enjoy running that somethinghive been doing for a very long time but sometimes it just gets a little bit tedious and i want to do something different also sometimes i want to be social on sundaes i want a head out on a hike with my partner or i want to meet up with friends and hike with them and taking a long hike on sundae as something that also cold be quite social and then i do not have to worry about also getting in my work out when heading out on a hike with my partner or going out to meet with friends or things of that sort i will say that there is a specific tool or a specific change that you can make to this sundae long endurance or at least what i consider long for me an it is by no means a marathon or an roman but this long endurance training and that is the use of a weight vest something that have really start yulizing more recently and by more recently i really mean within the last year or is i purchased one of these weight vests that can be anywhere from ten to fifty pounds what i use in theweight vest is is irrelevant but it is certainly changes the level of effort required when taking a hike or even a walk now there is an additional benefit of the weight vest which is that if you are going out for a hike or even for a walk for social reasons and you are with somebody that is not quite at the same fitness level that you are frankly it isillibat rude to is walking ahead of them and running back or running ahead and running back you oftentimes you really want to spend time with the person and you do not want them to feel as if they are holding you up and the weight vest is a terrific way to get some additional work and as you will find if you wear a weight vest it is additional work on say a shorter hike may be the person you are with only has time for an hour long hike or may be they just do not have the fitness to do a two hour or three hour hike it'll throw on the weight vest and it'll head out for a walk with them or a hike with them or sometimes it'll go out on a long hike with the wight vest myself again the point of this for me sundae although it could fall on any day for you work out is really to build up that long form en durance and this fits well with what doctor and gain and doctor peterotio referred to as the real need to get in some long endurance type work at some point or even multiple points throughout the week for me this long sundae jog of sixty to seventy five minutes or long sundae hike or weighted walk or weighted hike really accomplishes that goal sometimes leads to a little bit of soreness ism particularly my calves or if ism wearing the weight vest sometimes my my midsection i get sore because ism trying to remain upright i think it also builds up some muscular endurance not just party of vascular endurance but again throughout the entire time that ism jogging or hiking what ism trying to get to is a place where i can feel that my pulsate is definitely elevated but it is not elevated that have to stop because ism out of breath and because i know some people out there might be really neurotic about this sort of thing if you have to stop because you are out of breath that does not mean that you blew the work out that are not getting endurance of course you are getting benefits from it ism not absolutely auric about always staying exactly in that heart rate down i might stop and have a conversation for a moment if it is a longer height although i really trying keep moving and i try in push myself just a little bit further than were ism exceedingly comfortable and for me doing this long sundae hike or jog really provides a foundation n a base for endurance that then the other endurance work outs that it'll describe later and that take place later in the week can build on as i mention earlier we will get back to the mechanisms that this taps into and we this is useful there are multiple benefits to doing these kinds of endurance type work outs and zone too cardie but by putting it at the start of my week again my week starts on sundae ism sure that regardless of how the rest of the weak goes that i got my endurance training in and of course ism going to want to and i will do insurance training other days during the week but if something comes up or i happen to get sick or ism really behind interns of work and i cannot get o the work outs in this sundae long jog or hike really provides that fundamental i can on see say foundation for cardiovascular fitness and endurance that i can hang my hat on and say o ka have got that one in the bag and i can then look to other days of the week to focus on other aspects of fitness now really important point to make about this sundae en durance work out is that a lows you to check off a box and that box is seventy five or minutes of zone too cardie because as you may have heard either in this podcast or from others out there doctor peter tat getting a hundred and eighty to two hundred minutes of zone too cardie per week has enormous plosive effects on longevity and enormous plosive effects on general health again in terms of cardiovascular function would also met a colic fuel utilization also in terms of your musculature and you are ability to use your body over long distances for long periods of time while it does not complete all one hundred an eighty to two hundredminutes per week it certainly gets you a good distance unintended toward that goal now i want to acknowledge that some people might be starting if witness program and sixty to seventy five minutes of jogging might be too long or a three hour waited vested hike or some people might even do what is called a rock you were a rucksack that might be too much in which case certainly start with less and go on flat ground and go at the rate that allows you to get into zone to but that is not excessively difficult for you and then as you build up fitness you can add time or you can add weight through a weight vest or if you do not want to buy a weight vest or cannot afford one is a simple solution to that i show a good anecdote about that one time i was am hunting out for a hike with a friend o mine he was former sealteame operator it'll never forget this and he said o yet it'll bring you a it'll bring you a sack and i thought you meant a sack lunch you was going bring lunch and i showed up an my busy give me a backpack that was loaded with a bunch of stuff and the backpack weight about forty pounds and then we took a hike a i was thinking lunch he was thinking weighted backpack and a waited backpack or even just any kind of strong sack that you can put over your shoulders or even carrying your arms it is going to work exceedingly well to build in some extra requirement for effort you certainly do not half to purchase a weight vest in order to a in order to get the benefits of bringing additional weight along with you on these long party of vascular events but again build up over time you can add time you can add weight and that is also a really nice feature of adding weight which is at some point your schedule might be such or you just do not really want to keep adding more and more and more time on this long endurance sundae in this case work out in that case add weight you can also as you build up fitnessyou can add speed to it your zone to and what zone too is will not shift but what work is required from you in order to get into zone to will shift that is as you get more and more fit you will have to move faster and or bring more weight in order to stay in zone to and that will simply tell you that you are indeed improving your endurance o cases then money rolls around and i most everyone else out there i work on money i get right into my meals and preparation for pod cars and running my laboratory et camera however i make sure that at some point on money and for me that some point is typically and ideally early in the morning seven a m or i train my legs on money that includes quaderseps hamstrings and calls why do i do that work out on money and what is that work out design to do will that work out is really designed to make sure that ism either maintaining or building strength in my legs and this is not simply for esthetic reasons this is not simply to grow bigger calves or grow bigger quadriceps and hamstrings although it can accomplish that as well depending on how you train will talk about details of training the reason for training legs on money is several full first of all they are the largest muscle groups of the body and by training your legs on money it sets in motion a large number of metabolic processes that carry you some distance even through the whole week in terms of elevating metabolism in terms of amplifying certain hormonal events in your body et camera that are really beneficial in addition to that ism of the belief that the legs are the foundation of the body and provided you can train legs safely that training legs is vitally important not just for strength of the legs but also for strength of your entire body against some of that is through systemic hormonal effects because if your going to train the large muscle groups of your body under substantial loads you will get systemic release of hormones not just testosterone although certainly testosterone but also things growth hormone you get increases in all sorts of called anabolic hormones that even if you are somebody whose not trying to increase muscle size because i realize a lot of people are not trying to do that these are hormones that shift your metabolism and your over all tender strength and ligament strength and over all musculature into what i would call a strong foundation for me money is leg work out it also just feels good to get the leg work out out of the way earlier in the week and it accomplishes another goal which is that i sometimes will take one or two days off of a leg work out because they can be very intense and they are large muscle groups and ill explain what i do on the off days the re not pure affrays they actually include some recovered type training or even some all out training but my training legs on money ism able to get what i consider the hardest strength and hybertrovy work out out of the way and again set all those positive physiological effects in motion for the entire week the other thing is that no work out exists in isolation what you do one day is going to be determined by what you did the previous day and even though the previous day i may have taken a three hour weight vested hight never are my legs sore from that long slow endurance work because it is long and slow that ism unable to train legs contrast that with a say high intense interval training work out which comes later in the week and my legs might be sore in fact they might not even be recovered such that ism able to do a real leg work and mi save real work out it'll describe what it that means in a moment legs come on money and i think that for those of you that are using or interested in using resistance training i suggest getting your leg work out done early in the week and for those of you that have heard the o the phrase ism do not skip leg day i i will go a step furtherance a do not skip likely in f in fact make leg day your first day of strength and hypertrophy training put it on money it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a item in mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to ben the robotics that i need for got health our got is very important its populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those robotics unathletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptedins elements and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste grip if you to tryathletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a years supply of vitamin d the k too again that is athletic green do calm slash supermen to get the five are travel packs and the years supply o item in d three k to o case know thar were talking about resistance training the question is going to come up about sets in raps in all of that business that was covered in a lot of detail on the podcast with doctor and galloping and ism going to get into some of that detail now but ism going to wait until i describe the entire set of work outs for the week before i go into even more detail because there is a way of what is called periodizing that is changing the sets and raps et camera across the week and indeed from month to month that is really optimal but i do not want to make it seem as if all of that just pertains to the leg work out it actually retains to all of the resistance training it'll just give you a couple of teeters about the key principles of resistance training that i think are almost universally if not universally then generally accepted in the strength training and physiology community and then later it'll get back to some of the overarching principles that apply to all strength and hypertrophy work outs across the week including the ones for the torso the arms et camera o say legs fall on money i should say that leg work outs all resistance training work outs for me consist of about again ism not nauradically attach this but about ten minutes of warming up and then about fifty five zero to sixty minutes of real work now of course some of that is going to be rest between sets but by real work i mean really hard work not necessarily to failure will talk about failure in a bit but hard work where ism struggling to complete the final repetitions if not going to to failure to o continue to move height repetitions and again the entire work portion of that work out is about fifty to sixty minutes why well pass sixty minutes you strike getting increases in cartes all that really impede recovery and i personally in somebody that does not recover very well from high intensity exercise i realize that within the literature it is believed and i think generally accepted that when you stimulate muscle hypertrophy our strength increases it impacts the nervous system it also causes things prating synthesis et camera their number of different forms of adaptation that occur to give you muscle strength in size changes and these days people talk a lot about needing to stimulate muscle growth or musclestrenth at least every forty eight hours but i can tell you that i recover out their slowly and i benefit from working the same muscle group about twice per week with longer when i should say more days of rest in between those work outs if i train legs on money believe it or not ism only training legs on money i do not have a second leg work out during the week however on fridge i do a high intense interval training session that serves two purposes one is it serves the purpose of triggering a certain type of endurance and getting my heart rat very very high and in addition to that because of the way i do that work out it acts as a sort of supplement or a more moderate intensity work out for quadriceps hamstrings an calves such that i at least never lose strength in fact generally build strength from one leg work out to the next provided ism doing things correctly what ism not referring to is a kind of classic a superrich intensity training once per week and then not actually training that muscle group again for me it is really train in each muscle group twice per week once directly and then once indirectly either during another weight training work out or during a party of vascular i should say in during straining work out again legs on money the work out is fifty to sixty minutes after a brief warm up i generally pick two exercises per muscle groups again ism doing calves ism doing quadriceps and ism doing hamstrings you should pick the exercises that work for you that is why am actually not going to share which exercises i use it'll give you a a couple suggestions about the ones i do use but really exercise selection as doctor and galop pointed out is a very important variable and the key thing to emphasis for that variables that you need to be able to perform the movement safely si know there the huge debate out there and people love to argue about whether not one can squat or dead lift for long periods of time or should or should not some people say yo absolushould i personally do not squat and do not dead lift have action never done much squatting or dead lifting and i know some people out there probably rolling their eyes or switching the channel at this point a but i can say that for me have been able to achieve the strength and high perchurefee goals that have been seeking doing thing like leg extensions and hack squats or for hamstrings droingthings leg curls and glue harass or for calves doing standing and seemed calfrases and on i think a key principle that everyone should pay attention to is one that was taught to me by a excellent strength coach years ago and i still use the and at least at works for me for each muscle group try and find an exercise in which you get that muscle into a weighted stretch position this would be for instance the standing calfrase you to down at the bottom its weighted and you are in it in a deep stretch provided you are doing the on the movement correctly as well as another exercise where you are getting contraction in the shortened position of the muscle for the hamstrings that would be the leg curl for a the calves it would be a seemed cameras or for the quadriceps the a the leg extension is if the machine is design right and you are doing it correctly the pea contraction is largely going to occur at the at the legs extended position but then another exercise for each muscle group that puts the muscling to more of us stretched or at least a larger range of motion or compound tight movement but ideally where there some stretch there i guess i will tell you what exercise i exercise i do for the quadricepses can be leg extensions and hack squats i use hack squats because i do not do freezer squats for safety reasons and i the hacksquat machine it'll do leg curls and glue ham rases for hamstrings and it'll do standing calfrases and see calfrases for the calfs again those of the movements that i use because i can perform them safely in the repetition ranges and with the weights that are required for me to either maintain or build like strength and calf strength but you might decide that for you dead lifts are absolutely essential and terrific or squats free bar squats a absolute terrific or front front squats ism not here to tell you which exercises to do er not do i am telling you that it is probably wise to at least consider doing at least two exercises permuscele group probably three maximum if you ask me for doing your entire legs and calls in one day but to think about doing one exercise where the muscles brought into that shorten pique contraction position curls are extensions or see to cares and then another exercise for each muscle group where there is more of a elongation and maybe even a stretch on the muscle group in fact that is a principle that you will hear me talk about later when i talk about training other muscle groups for strength and hypertrophy now approximately how long to train you might be somebody who can get away with training for an hour and a half and that will not impede to recovery for me that really starts to impede my recovery also if ism staying on task that sixty minute limit really works well for me do i occasionally train for seventy five minutes yes because if ism waiting for a piece of equipment sometimes i have to just wait longer that happens but i really try and keep the total duration of the work out shorter how many sets and reps and rest intervals without was covered by doctor and gallant as well without getting into the total science heres a brief summery of how to structure that it is pretty clear that if you are going to do lower repetitions and heavier weights that you are going to want to do a bit more volume i know that this spits in the face of what a lot of people think but if you are going to do five sets of five that i would consider five repetitions low low repetition range heavier weight and if you are going to train with higher repetitions you can do fewer sets that certainly works for me i generally follow a program where for about a month three to four weeks i will do all my resistance training in the repetition range of about four to eight repetitions that is rather heavy a few more sets it might be anywhere from three to four sets per exercise again still just two exercises and longer rest between sets anywhere from two minutes to maybe even four minutes if it is really heavy leg work and then for the next month switch to repetition range that is closer to eight to twelve maybe even fifteen repetitions per set but do fewer sets over all may be just two to three sets per exercise again just two exercises per muscle group typically and shorten the rest between sets that it is more in than ninety second may e unit as short as sixty second rests between sets petipically ninety second to about two minutes or two and a half minutes busily it is one month heavier the next month slightly lighter although i would not say light outs a moderate weight and moderate recpkrain that tens to work well for me it also adheres to a principle that came up during the discussion again with doctor and gallant that for hypertrophy you really can use repetition ranges anywhere from five to thirty three zero rep but he emphasize changing the repetition ranges in order to offset boredom frankly i to train heavier i enjoy training in the four to eight rep range however i notice that if i do that for more than four weeks in a row and i do not switch over to training in the eight to twelve may be in fifteen repetition range for about a month well then i cannot make continuous progress i start actually lose ground but by switching back and forth actually can make continuous progress at least across the year i hope that that principle or i should say that protocol a was communicated clearly it works very well i assure you does that mean that i never get ten repetitions on a week when ism is suppose to train in the four to eight repetition range no occasionallyi'll venture up into the ten repetition range but i really trying cluster the low repetition work for about a month again across all work outs in all exercises and the slightly hire outuence a moderate repetition work across to the next month one thing that you will notice since we are hung about total fitness programming is that during the month where you are doing moderate repetitions you will notice that your endurance work will actually be facilitated and i do not think that is a quiescence in fact its not a coincidence it is because when you are training very heavy or in the heavier range lower repetitions et camera you are tapping into different processes in those muscles when you head out for that long sundae height or as you will soon here whereas on fridge your going to do higntenste interval training we you'll notice is during certain months of weight training when you are training more heavy those work outs will feel literally will feel different then they will during the months when you are doing moderate repetition work i am not a competitive athlete ism not running races or truth lawns some of my friends ism very impressed by them ism really just trying to get over all party of vascular fitness overall strain over all hypertrophy where i need it maintain musclesize et camera in muscle groups for i just trying to maintain that is really my goal ism not trying to optimize any of these work outs for any one performance feature but in a little bit will talk about how you can change various aspects that is variable to this protocols in order to say for insists really emphasize hypertrophy or really emphasize endurance lasso with what i will call a standard endurance work out done on sundae and i say standard because most people when they here endurance they think of the ability to endure to continue a a repeated movement or exercise over some pariah give time with that work out done on sundae and then with the leg work out done on money you can feel really good about how you are heading into the week however after training legs on money i experience that doing cart of vascular work outs the next day is either inefficient or at least does not really allow me to completely recover from my leg work out i realize that some people are going to immediately scoff at that and in fact there are really beautiful papers out there talking about how one can actually do fair amount of carry of vascular exercise without interfering with their strength and speed and hyperterfe improvements and vice verse in fact there is a terrific review that was mentioned on the podcast with doctor and gal and this is a a review that will provide a citation to on and a reference and a link to which is the review by a track and badly which talks about whether not there is interference between strength and endurance work outs really interesting review if you want to apprise that but with all that said i to take tuesday as a no endurance no resistance training day but that does not mean that ism not doing anything for my over all health and fitness on tuesdays i do a series of heat cold contrast in other words i get really really warm and then i get really really cold i get really really warm wind i get really re cold repeatedly and the way i do that is by getting into a hot sand for me that is really hot but have built up my heat conditioning please do not do this unless you have built up your a ability to withstand heat and it'll get in for about twenty minutes sometimes fifteen but usually twenty minutes then i get out and then i will get into an ice bath or a cold water bath that is about forty five to fifty degrees fernheight again do not get in to water that cold that you go in to shock it'll explain what a good cold stimulus could be for you and how to determine that or if i do not have access to my sauna and my ice bath what i can do if ism travelling as i will take a hot bath and then alternate with cold show or hot bath cold shower am it is hard to do hot bath ice bath unlessyou have two baths i don't no any hotel rooms at least have never stated one that has two baths alone sure the out there but for me this is heat cold contrast and really what this day is about is two things first of all ism trying to accelerate recovery from the leg work out i did previously also if you listen to our episode of the suberin podcast about deliberate heat exposure or you listen to our episode to the he been lapodcasts about deliberate cold exposure i talk about some of the benefits of heat and cold and i get into a lot of details about how you can access heat you can do baths you can do sands you cave take hot showers you do not have accepting of that you can even wrap your body from the neck down in marriage bag plastic garbage bags belivee're not wrestlers used to do this put on some sweats and go running that will get you warm again be careful not to over heat and then you can get into a cold shower the lot of ways depending on your budget in what you have access to i do not use cry these crowd therapy chambers they are hard to find their expensive am again i using and ice bath and i will do anywhere from three to five rounds which is a lot anywhere from three to five rounds of heat for about twenty minutes and cold for about five minutes how cold should the cold be we cover this in the episode on deliberate cold exposure here is a general rule of thumb it should be cold enough that you really want to get out but not cold that it is unsafe and that will vary from person o persons i cannot give you a the simple prescriptive there same thing with the heat hot enough that you are sweating and the you want to get out but not hot that you are running the is of injuring yourself for killing yourself and again that will vary from person of persons you have to build up slowly be careful and build up empirically i do that on tuesdays again as a way to accelerate recovery and because it is very clear that their card vascular benefits may be even benefit is for the brain related to the carry of vascular benefits because worse the brain needs a lot of blood flow and needs a lot of a neutrons and other things flowing into and out of there debris out and nutrients and other things into the brain heat can help accelerate that or improve that and ism doing that to improve cardiac vascular function improve brain health and then the cold contrast provides that sort of accelerator on that or an amplifier i think it is the better way to phrase it on that process because in the cold you get azo constriction and then in the heat you get vase a dilation into your maximizing that process which is actually a neural process nerves actually enervate the blood vessels an calories and and even the arteries in order to allow that conscription in dilation process to occur tuesday is really about recovery but my recovery day is not necessarily about i just laying around and not doing anything i might still also take some walks that day remember i want at trying get that two hundredminutes of on two cardie cross the week and sometimes not often but sometimes it'll get in a few am minutes or more of walking quickly that day but generally ism working a lot on tuesday as i do on one day and ism manumit tired a may be even a little bit sore from my leg work out the previous day money i try and get that hot cold contrast there are other benefits to hot and cold contrast we have a description of the different protocols for hot and for cold and their contrast and our superman lav newsletter you can find that by going to human lav dot come go to the news later tab under the menu en you can sign up an i she down low those protocols very easily without even signing up if you just one o access straight off tuesdays really about recovery and about getting some additional cardie vascular benefits from heat cold contrast one other thing that is built into the ration a for doing a lot of heat and cold on one day as supposed to doing it every day well in addition to it being a limit more convenient because certainly some people do not access to heat in cold saran cold dunks at camera every day may be getting to i do that one day is more accessible or feasible but in addition to that it is very clear that while there ore benefits to doing sand often we talk about this in the deliberate heat episode and the episode with doctor dona trick when she was a guest on this podcast it is also clear that if you do sand seldom that is once a week but you do a lot of it on one day in this case it is an hour if it is remember it is or more it is three to five rounds of twenty minutes of sand followed by about five minutes of cold or by doing that all on one day the pure view to research that is cove red in the episode on deliberate heat s is it a study out of finland show that you get massive even sixteen fold increases in growth hormone which are extremely beneficial for metabolism and for recovery these massive increases in growth hormone are seen when you are doing these sessions of sand that are repeated on the same day and your only doing that about once a week whereas if you do sand more often there are certainly benefits to that but its time consuming and you need access to sand more often than one day a week if your doing it more than one day a week but if you do one day a week in your doing a lot of sessions within that day as have detailed here you see these massive increases in growth hormone that are not observed if you are doing sand more often for the other benefits of sand now the effects of cold are many and s notches vase of constriction but the effects of cold are also counterbalance by some of the problems with deliberate cold exposure then maybe you heard about on this podcast and a lot of other podcassin seem to be a and of a abuzztheme on twittering elsewhere and the point is this there are a number of quality studies showing that if you do deliberate cold exposure in particular ice baths or getting into very cold water immediately after and endurance straining session or a strength and hypertrophy session it can indeed yes it can disrupt or prevent some of the adaptations that you are seeking with strength and hypertrophy and endurance work outs you heard that right and i believe that to be true based on now several quality pure reviewed studies by doing your deliberate cold exposure on tuesday you are not going to get those of facts that is the blocking of hypertrophy or the blocking of strength improvement or the blocking or prevention of improvements and endurance that would occur a you immediately got into the ice bath after a hypertrophy strength or endurance workout now the caviar to that is if you are somebody who likes to do cold showers i am not aware of any data that says that cold showers cannot be performed after a strength hypertrophy your endurance workout cold showers or different then submersion up to the neck in an ice bath or another cold body of water for a number different reasons in fact they happen to different aspects of the nervous system entirely we do not have time to go into that now it is covered in the episode on deliberate cold exposure but the simple point is by doing your heat and cold contrast or ay listen if your somebody does not have access to sonar you do not combats in you just do some deliberate cold exposure on tuesday you are doing that separate from your strength and hypertrophy and endurance workouts such that it will not impede the benefits of those work outs o case a long endurance on sundae leg resistance training on money and on tuesday heat cold contrast that brings us to wednesday and on wednesday we get back to a resistance training work out and the resistance training work out that i emphasize on wednesday is one in which you train your torso yes literally your torso i know this is counter to the o called brow science of brow splits onto who originated that term it is a terrible term in of essentially a alienates any one who is not a brow or considers themselves a brow but in any case this is not about training chest or back or shoulders in fact it is really about straightening the muscles of the torso and of course includes the chest an the shoulders and the back and ism sure as i say this a number of people out the who are obsessed with hypertrophy and muscle growth and filling out their hurts or whatever it may be are thing oh no this is just kind of all around fitness but no the point is on wednesday you train your torso and that is going to involve some pushing that is for you it might include some training of things bench presses or incline presses as well as shoulder presses or lateral raises things for the shoulders as well as for the backs me pulling exercises these con be bent over rows or chin ups or pull ups again the are enormous number of exercise for each in every one of these muscle groups now i believe there is a clear benefit to training all these muscle groups together on the same day because much in the same way that training legs all on one day can lead to the systemic effects because their large muscle groups working both the pushing muscles in the pulling muscles of the torso on one day least in the contacts of this program is very time efficient and tends to win out into a number of different dimensions of health at least ism interested in in i think a lot of other people are interested what are those well let us think again i want to be strong in not just my legs but my underbody i also may want may want to engage some hypertrophy to grow certain muscle groups in order to create a sense of balance tit can be prosthetic reasons but also for balancing straight and for health of and the integrity of the joints et camera and in addition that by training a bunch of different muscle groups together you have the opportunity to get the more s atomic hormonal effects and metabolic effects that occur when you are not just training one muscle group in isolating that one muscle group but rather training a bunch of muscle groups together wednesday i train torso and i do that in pushball fashion just for am kind of time efficiency sometimes that means doing a pushing exercise and then a pulling exercise sometimes it might even mean doing a set of pushing and then a set of pulling and going back and forth however if you are in a him and a particular crowded him please do not be one of those people that colonizes multiple pieces of equipment and says ism working there of working there and yet that can be quite a dance and d con be hard to to orchistrain to work out that sometimes it will be you starting off with a set of shoulder presses and then doing all all your sets of those and then moving to your chin ups and then moving perhaps back to shoulders and realizing ah a one's on the machine that i wanted or using the equipment i wanted it'll just finish up the pulling of finish up the hackwork and then going to the push i do not obsess over the alternation in any kind of strict way i really just trying get the muscles of the torso trained and again it is two exercises per muscle group and one of those exercises is going to be something where there is i realize this isn't physio logically accurate but a shortening of the muscle or where they at the end of the movement the muscle is under maximal contraction i could throw out some names of exercises just for for purpose of of understands to this would be am cable crossovers for the chest that the of the pile contraction is at the end whereas a something an in cline press there is more of a stretch provided done over full range of motion at the beginning of the movements again something where there is a stretch in something where there is a peat contraction for the shoulders a little it harder do other their ways to do that an chef cavalier has excellent work outs available zero cost on you to be also has excellent programs on his aptly next talk bombsight but certainly has a lot of excellent photo calls on as you to and instragram but on you to you can put in his name and any muscle group that you want a train has some terrific idiots describing exercised choice and other features of exercise parameters again a pique contraction or shortening of the muscle pique contraction exercise and a scratching exercise and for the back one might say o k i seeded row or a leftover row or a dumbbell row where the elbow as brought behind the torso for a pique contracting movement and then from more of a tracking movement might be something a a chin up or a pull up and as i say this i understand that stretching and pile contraction are not the exact terms that one would use if they were a physio therapist ore strength and condition and coach but i think for the typical person whose trying to generate strength and hypertrophy in those muscles are maintain strength and hypertrophy in those muscles this kind of nomenclature way describing it at least should be a clear and and even efficient and just to remind you as with the leg work out the total duration of the torso work out is going to be fifty to sixty minutes after a brief warm up the sets and repetitions are going to be dictated in the same way that i ascribed earlier for about a month it is going to be more sets anywhere from three to five sets in the lower repetition range o for o a repetitions that is come be have your weights and longer rest as i described earlier the rest intervals and then for the next month it is going to be moderate repetitions fewer sets the same way i described earlier and if you want more details on all of that you can find that in the news letter related to the optimal or foundational fitness protocol tat you can access at superman lapdog calm something i should note about the wenstay torso work out is that i am a big believer in training the what i believe is the highly a avoided or at least overlooked but vitally important aspect of total body stability strength and safety really safety which is the neck i realize a lot of people do not want a large neck and i totally understand for a esthetic reasons why they do not want that it is kind of interesting actually if you think about it that people have a large neck are often told they have no neck people sat this i has no neck or hey eve no neck when in fact the referring to the fact that they've a very large neck how it came to be someone you put in the comments why that is how come when people of a big neck they refer to it as no neck why do i train the neck i train the neck for a couple of reasons one is years ago i had backseat where i she fell off a roof and it'd been training my neck at that time a for a sport that i was involved in and i walked away from it with a sore neck but not a broken neck and i thought while it is really great that i have a been training my neck in addition to that i was once in a car accident where i was part i just bought the car my first new car purchase part in that car with my mother my grandfather in the back seat at the red light and some one rammed into us at full speed now fortunately none of us were hurt when we were all rattled and once again i was very sore in my back and in my neck but i think one of the reasons why i was able to since the walk away from that i did not have any a sustain damage was because i train my neck but i started training my neck for sport and i continue to train my neck because i notice when i do not train my neck i start getting shoulder issues and if you talk to and excellent physiologist doctor kelly starred of the ready state as i excellent channel if in am on all the social medium standard channels are you talk to a any one out there who really understands the strength of the torso in the upper body and even the back what you learn is that of course being the upper portion of the spine stable icing your neck is very important now training the neck can be a little bit detailed and specific and even dangerous if you do it wrong again eff cavalier has a terrific set of idiot on training the neck properly i know a lot of people out there might think neck bridges and i used to do neck bridges i occasionally still sneak i a neck bridge here or there although i do not recommend it because in discussions with eff he will tell you and it is true that the disks eventually go and you can run into serious issues from doing bridges and it does not happen gradually you cannot notice it happen just happen suddenly i might occasionally do a neck bridge but in general it'll train neck by rapping a plate in a towel that it don't end up with an imprint of the the weight value on my head or face and then moving the neck from side to side or front or back and again we will provide a link to those videos it is a terrific set of idiot to describe how to train your neck properly an safely even if you are not trying to grow your neck you fully want to make sure that you some light weights to make sure that your neck is stable and upright i say stable and upright because it is very clear that for reasons related to testing and staring down at computers and related to weak neck relative to the rest of the muscles that stabilized the spine a lot of people there default stands for their dealt posture is with chin forward and that is not good not only is it ascetically not good but it also can create all sorts of issues relate to back pain and headaches and things that sort this is a real thing training your neck allows you to stand upright sit upright i even believe that it allows you to do things public speaking or have conversations with people the street in a way where you are front facing as suppose to looking down wednesday is torso and neck and then comes thursday and that means another party of vascular exercise cession although it is a brief one unlike the endurance training on sundae the carry of vascular cession on thursday and again for me it falls on thursday but for you it could fall on a different day depending on when you started this protocol is going to be about again about thirty five minutes of for me running although it could be rowing or could be cycling it could be something that sort the goal of this work out is what is important the goal of this work out is to tap in to member that long list we talked about earlier we have got skill and speed and power and strength and hypertrophy et camera different forms of endurance is to get into that range of endurance where your heart rate is elevated quite a bit more than down to but they you are not really going all out sprint what that means for me is warming up for about five to ten minutes that could be jogging a little bit of light calisthenics might even be happy on a stationary by though to be as i loathe the stationary bike and then setting a timer and doing about thirty but ideally thirty five minutes of what i call seventy five to eighty per cent of all out o can i realize this spits in the face of all you heart rate monitor wearing am supersede exercise types but when i think of all outpoint i think of one hundred per cent and what is that in my mind that is somebody is chasing me with a needle full of poison and i am sprinting away at maximal speed that for me is a hundred per cent after a brief warm up what ism going to do is go out typically outside although sometimes ask to be on a tread milia ism traveling and move run for about thirty to thirty five minutes at about seventy five or eighty per cent of that all out what that means is that ism striving to keep a steady pace but in reality i do not i sometimes have to stop it a stop light there are cars please do not run into traffic just to maintain that is speed in that timing that would be terribly i antagonistic to a fitness in particular life spent that running tends to be running in which ism breathing hard ism not able to restrict myself to purely nasal breathing and i should have mentioned earlier on the sundae long ruck or waited hike or jog if ism alone i trying do pure nasal breathing if ism with other people or ism talking obviously ism not gin do pure nasal breathingmbecasm talking although i sure that sometimes they wish i was doing pure nasal breathing that thursday work out accomplishes a number of things first of all it really gets my heart ray up and it improves multiple aspects of endurance because as you recall earlier the different bins of endurance that include muscular endurance anerobic that three to twelve minute range in than thirty minutes or longer none of them really precisely match what is accomplish in this thirty five minute or carry of ask ulnar section where ism pushing hard but not all out but that is exactly the reason to do it which is that it taps into multiple fuel systems for the muscle and multiple aspects of the hart and calories and arteries in pains that are involved and generating that movement it really cuts a broad swath into multiple categories of endurance and also just keep in mind what this foundational or optimulfitness protocol is really designed to do in my mind a foundational fitness protocol is one that leaves you or has you in a state where if you need to walk really far and carry a bunch of weight you can do it if you need to lift to have object with your legs you can do it if you need to run really fast for two minutes you can do it and if you need to run a little bit further mambo in ten minutes for whatever reason you can do that it is a really to all around fitness program and that thirty five minute run again could be swap for the thirty five minute ergo or sometimes if you only have access to a stationary bite you do that i suppose if you did not have access to any equipment and running is not your thing something that i have done especially if have been stuck in a hotel cause i arrive late some place and i really wont to get this work out in you could do the dreaded berry i know lout of opinions out there some people in berries are downright dangerous other people love berries you a do that or you cut do really fast but full jumping jacks i know it is a little p e class right physical education class is but sometimes if i need to get the work out in what it'll do in a hotel if have arrived late in particular they have travel as i will find the farewell the fire farewell it'll make sure by the way that i can get back into the building cause have been locked in those stairwells before and i will simply walk really fast up the farewell as many flights of stairs as there are or maybe even get not quite sprint but my run up those stairs over and over and over again in order to get that thirty five minutes of seventy five to eighty per cent of mac output party vascular work done and if ism really just restricted to by hotel rum it'll just do jumping jacks for thirty thirty five minutes sometimes while watching something on to and believe me if you are doing full jumping jack really extending your legs really getting arms overhead and really doing the full movement by tine you hit five or six minutes you are going to be sweating and you are your hart rate is really going to be up i also sometime will travel with a jump rope i always trying travel with the jump rope and skip rope i much to the dismay of the people were house below me in the hotel room skipping rope i should mention can be a very effective way of getting party vascular training while you are on the road but in all seriousness if you are in a hotel rumor an apartment and you cannot really jump high and you are very good at jumping rope what you will find is it is nocking ta get you into that hie elevated heart rate zone gag can be great for zone too tight training but if you are really good at skipping rope and i would not say ism really good at if ut have done enough skipping rope that i can just count of cruise and talk and it's more zone foolish you've feels walking at times now you can d double under where you you are really jumping and and putting the rope under you twice each t me or cross overs et camera depending on your skill level but again if you are in an apartment before in a hotel thatskan be harder to do and because of there is some skill involved sometimes your stopping more often than your continuing a by the way and i i just have to mention this a really terrific instrgram channel is anna skips this is a teacher a science teacher or i believe it is a math math as they say in the faucet case she is in the locate mat's teacher i do not know anna but i know she skips cause she has this amazing instrogram call called anna skips what is really cool about her instergrama she shows you her progression from not being able to skip rope at all to the absolute incredible types of a rope skipping that she is doing each morning while getting sunlight which of course is a essential health photo call to chick out anna skips on instrogram really inspiring and a made me want to get better at skipping rope and still working at it o pesto with that thursday carry vascular let us call it in durance but carry of vascular training work out done around rolls fridge and on fridge ism going to do another carry vascular training session and i lured to this earlier but this carry vascular training session is also design to tap into some of the ability of hard i should say high intense interval training to tap into strength and hypertrophy increases for the legs cause remember we train legs on money and what the science tells us is that proline synthesis in a muscle group can be stimulated about every forty to to seventy two hours and we have had tuesday off wednesday off and thursday off and you do not want to lose progress that you made from that terrific money leg work out but in order to make sure that you can do the other things that follow in this program and kickback up on money with another leg work out at least for me with my recovery abilities in my work sexual ism not going to do an entire other leg work out because it is going to set the whole thing out of wack that is i will not be able to consistently do the same work outs on the same days of each week now with that said a limit later all explain what happens if you have to miss work out and how you can combine days et camera but i really strive to get certain work out's done on certain days consistently at least as best i can friar's hi intend a interval training that can take a variety of different forms for me the ideal thing to do for me again you could do something completely different exercise choice again should be governed by what you can do safely sou do not injure yourself and that you can perform effectively and than gets yo or provide you the stimulus that you want and what ism trying to do on fridge is get my heartraht way way up talked about this in the episode with doctor aunty gain in addition to the benefits of getting a hundred ad eighty two hundred minutes of zone to cardie per week minimum it is a really good idea to get up to that man or near man heart rate at least once a week and you aren't going do that for very long periods of timeout i can do that for thirty minutesyou cannot sprint all out for thirty minutes unless your steeve prefontane have not seen the movies without limits or prefontane you should basally see those he was able to go out and run twelve laps what seem to be an all out sprint or close to it incredible but most people are not going to do that or are going to be carried away on a stretcher if they try these intents the interval training for me ideally would be on call a salt bike or air dine bike the likes to have the fan which might seem o you now just cools you off but is he there is a lot of resistance there what out i will typically do is a twenty to thirty second all out sprint using arms and legs and then ten seconds rest and then repeat all out sprint for twenty a thirty seconds ten seconds rest repeat and it'll do that for anywhere from eight to twelve rounds which trust me even if you start out a little it less er i souls not all out intensity or effort by time you hit the fifth or six one you will be certainly headed into if not a near your maximum heartraht now what is your maximum hartraht do you need a tartrate monitor no if you would using that sort of thing great but again and gallant beautifully supplied us with the information he said i you take the umber two hundred and twenty n you subtract your age that for most people most is going to be your maximum heartwraht although for certain people who are very fit or certain ages that is not going to apply it is little bit too crude a measure but it is a good starting place and you can look up other information or see that podcast episode we price to link to it in the shown captions f you want get more details on that i do not use a array monger what ism trying to do is get to that point where i quote quote feel i want to die now i do not want to die and please do not die right if you are not in good party of calculate health do not just jump right into this fitness pro to call but i want get to the point where i really feel i could not peddle any faster or pull any faster on the on the assault bike the air done bike or if ism doing this work out in a place or at a time or because i choose to not use a bike or a rower cause you could all see is a rower i will simply do sprint jog intervals i will sprint for twenty or thirty seconds then jog for ten seconds spring for twenty r thirty seconds an the jog for for ten seconds and just repeat i you's have a big field next to my laboratory my old laboratory and you bring my bull dog hostile out there he was really good at the first sprint part and the g is lie down and watch he didn't even do the jog part i would just go back and forth back and forth back and forth panting a bull dog non stop barely able to recover before sprinting again and the basis of this work out again is several first of all it is to get the heartbeat really high up towards maximum heartraht at least once a week s you accomplish that this fridge also if you are sprinting and then jogging or you are really pushing hard on an assault bitter an air dine bike we are using a for instance a sheer or the swear machine where any number of different party of vascular training tools you are going to get activation of the legs of course not to the same degree as you would with squats or dead less or leg extensions and leg curls that simply not the case but you are going to trigger strength and hypertrophy and other types of adaptations in those muscle group this for me also represent the second leg work out of the week where ism not touching any weights one important point that i do not think have heard mention anywhere else but that i hope to have doctor kelly starred on the podcast to discussing that have discussed with him a one on one which is be careful with all out sprints or all out anything party of vascular exercise you can get injured doing those for instance if you go out an you just sprint across a field all out twenty or thirty seconds and then walk back and can do it again and again do not be surprised if the next day you have some sciatica or even some pelvic floor pain i do not recommend going all out on any movement that you cannot perform with perfect form mocks for me i really try and stay away from all out sprints it'll sprinted about ninety five per cent of what i can do because i find if i go all out sprint i do not know what the reason is but it might be an over extension of a limb or something that ism not a sprinter ism not a sprinting coach i do hope to get sumac million on here or om an half there excellent sprinting coaches at some point their will class sprinting coaches but ism not a pro sprinter ism not even a amateur sprinter i may a fitness sprinter the ermine or assault bike or the rower is really a safe fer option for me and if ism running or ism doing some sort of movement where ism unconstrained really in terms of how far my stride is i man a ivory constrained by the musclemen ism really careful to not over extend or do something that the only way to do that to not go all out again the go for this fridge work out's e really get the heart right high do hindtencsthe interval training her number different ways you could do that you can look up h i i the hit work outs on line find the one that is best for you and really picks something that safe that you can do consistently and i believe that i really will also trigger a bit of either strength and hypertrophy and speed power maintenance or even give you a obit of a stimulus that by time you roll around to that leg work out on again on money you've got a little bit of an additional boost to your legs strength hypertrophy speed and power we have covered sundae through fridge and then sturdy rolls around and sturdy is when you train arms calves and neck this may sound as if you are training a bunch of small muscle groups biceps triceps next and calves and that is true but i should mention that you are also training your torso a second time and you are doing it indirectly er sometimes not it indirectly why do i say this well keep in mind again that for strength and hypertrophy you are going for that once about every forty eight to seventy two hours you want a stimulate that on wednesday is when you trained your torso right chest shoulders back and neck you have have thursday to rest fridge to rest i know a lot of people are going to on to emphasis those body parts than you think any you have to train it twice a week but if you have modest recovery ability were low recovery ability such as i do and your doing these other cardiovascular training sessions et camera will then on sturdy is when you will train arms calves an neck directly but included in that remember two exercises per muscle group one with a peat contraction one with somewhat of a stretching there included in that i suggest doing some sort of dip movement which i think it was povilset suits at the dip is synonymous with or at least similar to an upper body squat a excuse me able if i got that wrong maybe it was not you that said that but o big admirer of his work and certainly the dip is a great exercise to hit multiple muscle groups it chest shoulders and triceps o maybeven some back to some extend depending on how you do it doing some dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy et camera in the chest and shoulders and including some sort of pulling movement for the biceps a chin up or palms facing movement pulling up from to the bar specially if its a close script tight movement but even if it is a wide grip tight movement will of course trigger strength and hypertrophy maintenance or improvements in the biceps but will also trigger strength hypertrophy in the lats in the back orcas sturdy is this arm work out that it'll just give an example of a potential work out where you might do a few more exercise may be not just two but may be three to make sure you get the torso indirect stimulation what would this look well this might be your sort of classic dumbbell curls for the biceps and maybe inkling curl for the bicep because it has more of a steps on an incline bench and then you might finish with two sets of chin ups pops pass facing you chirrups or three sets of chirrups depending on whether not you are in a heavier load on through a l or more moderate weight month again activating the biceps muscles case armada but also activating strength and hypertrophy in the lats or at least maintaining it that because you're not training those morsel muscles again until wednesday you are not allowing the prhypertrophe and strength gains that you generated on wednesday to atrophy to disappear then thinking about triceps it might be some sort of triceps isolation or pe contraction movement that could be tries up kick back or its what overhead extension would be more of a stretchtight movement than a kickback but then also doing regular old dips you might even start with dips which again are going to activate those torso muscles and the triceps and then calf work in the same way that you did on money and network again i am a believer in training neck multiple times per week an you are able to finish all of that in forty five or fifty minutes great most people will find when you are doing a lot of small muscle groups actually takes longer because you have to go round to more exercises but again just adhere to the same principles we talked about before about fifty fives rope to sixty minutes of real work after a warm up with an astrict next to that that if some one's on the equipment or you cannot find the dumbbells you need et camera then maybe seventy five minutes man but really trying to not extend that work out too long making sure that you active ate the arms directly but also activating the torso muscles indirectly and again i will not repeat it this time again but falling the same wait and repetition and rest interval scheme that we talked about earlier a bit heavier lower rests more sets and longer rest for about a month and then alternating to more repetitions yet fewer sets shorter rest intervals and do that for about a month this carries through for all the resistance training work outs regardless of the day of the week wee completed the total ark across the week and we can sunrise it as saying sundae is let us just say long endurance money is leg resistance training tuesday heat cold contrast wednesday torso training plus neck thuresday i would call it moderate intensity party of vascular exercise of that thirty five minute moderate intense carton vascular exercise fridge high intense interval training of sprinting or some a variation thereof and sturdy armscalv's neck and torso indirect work that is the total structure but i want to emphasis again you do not need to start this on sundae that is you could make the long endurance work start on tuesday and then just fill in the rest as described before s really up to you there is another importantpoint i want to make which is that neither i nor any one is going to be successful in doing the exact work out on the exact same days of every week because of travel work illness other demands et camera the thing about the scent a hate much o that i do believe that will benefit you as well is that you have some flexibility there what is the flexibility well let us say you train you're typical sundae work out of endurance than you train legs on money and then you do not manage to do your heat cold contrast on tuesday for whatever reason well you can put it on wednesday just make sure that if you are going to do the cold stimulus that you do not do it too close not within four ideally eight hours after the training of torso but you could do it before or you could do it just heat and skip the cold that particular week i not ideal but better than not doing anything let us say for instance the leg work out was particularly brutal y do not sleep that well on money night or tuesday nigh well then should you do the torso work out on wednesday well i would say why not move the heat cold contrast til wednesday and then push that torso work out to thuresday and may be also try and do that thirty five minute run on thursday every once in a while rather then lose the total control of program and let everything shuffle forward here is the basic principle i do believe that any one of these work outs whether it is for endurance ore resistance training can be shifted either one day forward or one day back right you could delay it by a day or you could accelerate it by a day in order to make sure that you get everything done across the week in fact i would say the best way to think about this foundational fitness program is not from the details up but from the top down from the big picture down to the details and say to yourself once a week you arguing to get some long endurance in another day during the week you are going to make sure that you get a kind of moderate faster endurance work out in and then one other day trying the week you are going to get in all out sprint high intensity carry vascular exercise work out it you are going to get those three work outs in somehow and then in addition to that you will also do resistance training for every muscle group in your body and that means doing your legs hard at least once a week you are torso hard at least once a week and you are arms hard at least once a week and of course you are also paying attention to train your calves and i do for reasons it'd describe before believe that you want to train your neck at least to keep it strong you may not want to generate hypertrophy there people very in terms of how quickly there new grows some people grows very very fast other people for the life them that cannot get much hypertrophy in their neck but keeping that next strong at least through some very light work to moderate weight work very very important for reasons i stated earlier if you set out those goals then the specific days that you do each work out is not as critical but the specific spacing is for instance you are not going to want to do your high intents the interval training the day after you train your legs because if you are doing that high intents the interval training correctly you are going to be taxing your legs and eating into their recovery and you want ta space them out by two or three days i think you will notice that the point is really to optimize everything on the whole rather than any one specific aspect of training your adaptation now that said i do realize that some people might be hyper focussed on things strength and hypertrophy and the aesthetics that come with it a see point about strength hypertrophy and weight training and this is something that has been covered on until podcast certainly the one which eff cavalier and with i doctor any gain in the one that i did on om building muscle strength and hypertrophy the solo episode and that is the following it is the rare individual who has perfectly balanced musculature right most people can be a bit subdominant or hamstring dominant or they have trouble activating their eludes or somebody has a terrible time trying to activate the there chess muscles but there very strong in the back et camera it is very clear that we can now that not just based on esthetics right but based on deliberate contractibility of those muscles i don't an to get into this and too much detail for sake of time but this is something that has pure view to research to support it and was also discussed extensively with eff cavalier when he was a guess and that shall heeds really popularize this notion and its absolutely true which is that if you can contract a muscle very hard to the point were it almost feels its cramping if you can do that even when there is no weight in your hand or there is no resistance against it see you just using your mind muscle connection to contract that muscle heart and isolate it chances are you will be able to generate hypertrophy and strength gains pretty easily in that muscle compared to muscles that you have a harder time activating during all resistance training that mind muscle link is really important i much that some people will even try and emphasize contraction of the muscles and between sets et camera i personally because ism not somebody who i some mirror when i work out and ism not somebody who wants to spend time in between sets flexing muscles and et camera a for whatever reason i want actually rest between sets and ism more concern with performance during those sets and really putting my mind into the muscle during the set i really trying emphasize deep relaxation between sets and here is a a tool that again is built out of science and i should say previewed studies some of which are being done in my lab but other laves as well which is that in between sets what i really strive to do is to bring my heart right down as much as possible calm myself down as much as possible and of do the clue physiological sigh in order to do that that is two nails through the nose back to back and then long full hail through the mouth id just did it partially there first sake of time again big deep inhaul through the nose and then sneak in a little bit more on a second inhale to maximize inflate the lungs in the evilly the lungs and than i full hail of all your air i of the mouth to empty up lungs that is the fastest way that we are aware of to calm your nervous system down and really in between sets you can use that to calm yourself down and conserve energy but then as you move into the weight training set you really want to watch it up your focus and attention to the muscles that you are going to be using now i to acknowledge that there's a huge range of parameters an terms of how to actually perform during the set you can focus on a particular muscle and try and have really isolate from the beginning of the movement some people really try and isolate it only during the p contraction some people accentuate the negative their speed and cadence there are again remember concepts are few methods are many and if you are interested in the various methods of eccentrics and concentric and all the different ways of changing up came since and forth during sets as an enormous amount of quality information out there far too much for us to get into into detail now but what i describe the general principles of how to set your mind if you will during the set you should be focused on the muscles that your using and or moving the weight if movement of the weight is more important you can either focus on moving the weight or challenging muscles right you can neither try an isolate muscles and make specific muscles do the work or simply moving the weight moving the we to him is going to be more gear towards strength improvements but focussing on the muscles call my muscle lining going to shift that very same set more toward hypertrophy i realize ism painting with a broad brush here but none the less this is grounded in the way that the nervous system governs muscular contraction and while i think most people are familiar with the number of different variables associate with resistance training yo sets reps rest intervals cadence et camera they're also a tremendous number of very important variables for endurance in any kind of cartevascular training and there are a lot of excellent resources out thereabout that think the most important one in fact i will go on record saying what i believe to be the most important variable for any endurance ore caught vascular training is that because it is a repetitive movement that you are able to complete the movement safely meaning you are not putting your body in to range of motion or into positions that can damage joints are put you in any kind of compromised state and some know my thing the that seems kind of silly but if you have ever set that for instance the seat too high on a stationary bike and then done are dine or assault bite type a interval training sprints if it set too high and you are over striding as it were the next day you can really pay the price in terms of some back pain or sciatica and sometimes that pain can extend for for quite a while of course you do not want to approach any exercise with much caution that it is faradic and preventive and yet you do not want to approach any exercise in any way that is cavalier forgive the pun eff that you are also going to compromise your the integrity of your joints in muscular sure an connective tissue let us talk about some real world practical variables for instance let us say you get a poor to terrible night sleep should you train the next day or not wit that really depends i can honestly say have had some of the best training sessions resistance training or endurance training sessions after a really poor night sleep but that is the rarer event more often than not if i not sleeping well have had a terrible night sleep the next day i will just skip training that day i know that will shock a number of you out there or perhaps you arealready calling me names weak et camera but i find that if have slept really poorly or have had a very stressful event the day before and i do not sleep well training the next day sets me up for getting ill and getting ill sets me up for not being able to train for multiple days it is my preference in that case to skip a day and really focus on recovery and then as i mention earlier lie that work out to the next day and rarely double that work out up with another work out but then just slide the schedule forward by a day but i really try and strive that is i really try to double up at least some work outs later in the week in that case that i can get back on schedule of starting the seventy protocol again on the same day i do not want to be excessively vague there what ism trying to say is i trying at here to the same schedule but if i g t a poor night sleep it'll just simply skip the work out the next day slide the work out forward there is one exception to that and it is an i portent exception which is there are times when have not slept well or have had some particularly stressful event the day before and have not slept well but ism able to do called and it a non sleep deep rest the next day there have been times endive only at three or four hours of sleep the night before and ism feeling i really behind the ball the next morning i really want to get my work out in instead what i will do is a ten but ideally in that case a thirty or even sixty minutes non sleep deep rest and there is a ten minute non sleep deep rest protocol read by me am but it is a non spiritual non mystical science supported non sleep deep restprotocal available on you too be can simply put my name supermen put an it r and virtue san v i r t s a n into you women you will find that script there are other and it a scripts that you can find now on notify and on you to and if you fall asleep during those non sleep deep postscripts that is great and if you do not you will also find that it will restore your ability to perform mental and physical work there are times when i have not is much sleep as i would or ism feeling it a bit more stressed for whatever reason and it'll do an best re and then i will go train and that often works fabulously well for me and then i do not have to skip a work out entirely just because i did not get a good night sleep a lot of people ask whether or not you should train fasted or fed and this is a very controversial area i personally prefer to do my party of vascular work not having eaten anything in the previous three to ten hours and typically that is because i wake up and it'll do the cart of vascular training within about an hour of waking up sometimes later because to my first meal generally falls generally not always falls around eleven a m i do not do any kind of formal interment fasting but typically my meal schedule somewhere between eleven a m and my last bite of food is around eight p m but ism not superscript about that i might eat it one's latest nine p m and i might eat something at ten a m if i wake up really hungry am i have something before eleven a m ism not faradic about it but in terms of training i to train fasted and that includes the resistance training work outs and those come early in the day for me and typically if ism going to train legs on money for instance which is when i train legs it'll make sure that the right before ism investing some starch some carbohydrate rice or poster or something on that sort to make sure that when i do that morning leg work out i have enough lichen in the muscles et camera again nutrition is a somewhat controversial area in fact a it can evoke very strong feelings as i know we have got vegans and we have it omnivore and we have got carnivores and people a recite this isn't really the format for us to get in all of that i think the rule to follow is figure out what optimizes your training for your particular training rolls for me that most often means training fasted and then eating pretty soon after i train and if it is a high intensity resistance training work out and frankly all my resistance training work outs a pretty high intensity ism not going to failure on every set but at least they bout thirty per cent of those sets ism going to failure and the other sets hm working very hard none the less well then i eat some starches after i train and i also invest some approaching in the form of approaching drink or a meal that include some preaching food but i do not to eat before i do resistance train our not ere at least not within the hour or two before i do re distance training their exceptions to that and i should say that the same basically applies to endurance work if ism going heat out for run to glad do not want my belly full of food or any food at all but there are times where i wake up hungry and i very much need to eat something or i have something anhedral socially a breakfast and ill now m have that breakfast and then an hour or ninety minutes later it'll do my work out m because i want to make sure that i finish the work out i again am not neurotically attached to training fasted or fed for me fast end is preferred but if i have to train fed better to train than to not train at all we have not talk much about flexibility yet but we did not entire episode to the superman labpodcast on flexibility and i encourage you to check out that episode if your interested in increasing your flexibility but the basic take away from that episode is that if you look it what i to call the center of mass of the research that is most of the studies and what the conclusions of most of the quality studies point to not the exceptions but the kind of general rules that have been gleaned over time from multiple labs over multiple decades et camera well you find is that static stretching that is holding a stretch and in fact exhaling and relaxing the midsection and torso and relaxing into the stretch has supposed to staying full of air and tense but mentally and physically relaxing into the stretch but not stretching maximally that is not extending as far as you possibly can go but more sixty per cent or even less and then holding those static stretches for anywhere from thirty to sixty seconds and then repeating doing that two or three times throughout the week for multiple muscle group could be for quadriceps could be rams trains for your lats their protocols out therein fact we have a news letter that is fast entirely on protocols for flexibility and stretching you can find that again by going superman lab dot calm you do not even need to sign of for the news letter although we invite you to if you but you can simply go there scroll down to the flexibility news letter and all the protocols are there for each of the muscle groups et camera but what i typically try and do is some stretching in the evening because i train in the morning as ism perhaps getting ready for bed or if the levy is on which in our house does not typically a go on because we do not have a levy but of course they're computers and people are on their computers et camera well it'll try and do some stretching while i do that it'll have a standing desk during the day at work regardless of whether night i train that morning or not ore omen to train in the afternoon it'll try and do some static stretch my hamstrings my curds my lats my shoulder is my back really does not take much time and i really try to space that out throughout the weak which if you look at the previewed research matches well to what is known to be most effective which are going to be short repeated sections ideally every day but truthtold i fail i categorically fix i was about to think of whether not i ever stretch everyday i fail to do it every day but i get about three or treating sections in per weak and again its eustatic hold trying to really relax into the stretch now the relax into the stretches something has been talked about in marshal art circles and poles at sultan has an excellent book on striction we can provide a link to that talks about this has a lot to do with relaxation of the nervous system an the way that the nerves innervate muscles in a you for stretch if you will also the way that the tendons and ligaments are are enervated by nerves the converse is also true and here again this is a principle that unpovelis put force i believe he calls it irradiation meaning irradiating out or emanating out from a force which is that while exhaling and relaxing the torso the mid section some people call the cores although some people do not that tern can facilitate relaxation and striction through a larger range of motion too can contracting the core the midsection or griping very tightly with the fist can facilitate muscular contraction because of the way that the nervous system heavily i we can even say over represents the fists in the brain and how would you apply this to your overall a foundational fitness protocol well it turns out that let us say you are doing a movement that involves a one limb moving and then the other tut say it is bisect curls just for sake of example turns out that you willable be stronger in moving that dumbbell with the arm that happens to be moving if you grip the handle very tightly but also grip the handle of the opposite dumbbell very tightly ow that said in between sets i encourage you to do the opposite to trying completely relaxing between sets combine that with the physiological side and then when the set the next set commences employ that very strong grip both again of the of the wight that is moving in the and the weight that at that moment might be stationary or an asymmetric position the nervous system of course is what controls muscles and that operates in both directions if you want to relax trying use long emails may be been physiological size and really concentrate on mentally in physically relaxing in particular core and your fists and if you want to generate force and you want to move a heavy bar bell or dumbbell you want to do it chin up with the maximal force that is when you can employ the opposite which oud be to grip the bar or dumbbell et camera very tightly and you want to contract your core or even fill your body with air as i say plug all the leaks et camera this gets into inform and movement on which is an extensive an er infinite a a landscape of discussion again that we do not have time to go into just want to mention those two nervous system related tips because i suppose is a new scientists they appeal to me because they are grounded in fundamental principles of how the nervous system enervates muscle and i know that they will benefit you the first time you use them and every time speaking of grip and nervous system and fitness and longevity doctor peter area who is a medical doctor was a guest on the huborman ladpodcast and provided an enormous wealth of information on that podcast episode i really ensure you to check it out ow when you have time and of course has his own spectacular podcast the drive with peter aria peter doctor at i should say often talks about certain movements were exercises that you should perform not just to improve your fitness but also to touch in to or measure how fit you are and how well you are progressing toward a long life stand and health span and one of those includes the ability to hang from a bar for a minute or longer and there are number of different expectations that one can have of how long they should be able to hang from a bar depending on their age and the fitness level et camera please check out doctorate is podcast and his vary socialmediasigts to get more information on that but what i can tell you is that if you are going to hang from a bar and you wan o hang from that bar as long as possible which turns out to be a interesting and important metric of your health then gripping the bar very tightly will actually help earlier we talks about whether or not to train if your sleep deprived and how to recover from what i would say is moderate sleep deprivation by doing tannest ti a supposed to total sleep deprivation being up all night or having a truly miserable night which case i think you should just skip training the next day and slide it forward now similar issue comes up from time to time where people wonder whether not they should train or not if they are sick here there is all sorts of crazy a him lore and sport specific lore a for instance a i used to hear this when i ran cross country there was this adage that if the symptoms were from the neck up you could still train that is if you were really congested and you had a headache you could still run whereas if it was in your chest in your lungs you could not run i do not think there is any data howsoever to support whether not that is true or whether it is it is not true for myself and because o my general goal is to be training and fit over time but also to include general health in the fitness equation that is to not be sick or chronically sick and certainly not to get other people sick if i have a little tiny sniffle i think i might be getting sick even then ism a little cautious in the sense that ism not going to do my typical work out i might stop it about fifteen minutes earlier and i would do that not by a neglecting any body parts or anything of that sort if its await training work out by by simply reducing the total number of sets i probably would not do any sets to failure if i did might reduce the total number or percentage of sets to failure from about thirty per cent of sets to may be closer to ten per cent of sets something that and if it was endurance work i might throttle back by ten or twenty percent and i will shorten the total duration of the work out and i often find that because of the known yes pure reviewed known immune system enhancing effects of exercise sometimes that alone will allow me to avoid getting sick but of course ism also careful to get home take a hot shower not stress myself out if i can avoid getting myself stressed out in focus on sleep and star other forms of recovery good nutrition et camera if however i have a real sniffle a cold ism not feeling well or i think i might be coming down with a flue i absolutely do not train and i do not get back into training of any kind until ism completely recovered what i basically saying is that no i do not believe you should train if you are sick and perhaps equally importantly when you come back from a lay off of any kind whether not because of illness or for whatever reason i do believe that because your body is a bit untrained it is not ideal to jump right back in a maximal training and to take one maybe two weeks of camping up the to the full duration and intensity of workouts that then i would continue on going for however many cycles i can complete before i hid another sickness or i hid another gap in my schedule do to family obligations or other obligations et camera we have covered a lot of tools and protocols and variables related to fitness but we have by no means covered all the available tools and protocols an bibles before we wrap up i do want emphasize one tool it is a very easy in fact zero cost very low time commitment tool and this was one that was provided again by doctor into gain when he was on the superman labpodcast and it is a tool that there is excellent research to support the effectiveness of and that i do believe should come at the end of every training session and that is to do three to five minutes of deliberately slow breathing it sounds simple three to five minutes of deliberately slowed breathing this could be while your in the shower or when you arrive at your car you might sit in your car quietly and do that if you have time or maybe even while you are driving bat to or on to your next an destination just to really slow down your breathing to really look at the recovery period that has to follow each training session and of course during which the adaptations the changes that make you more fit than you were going into the exercise occur and that three to five minutes of deliberately slow breathing has been shown nanny's croup and in related experiments not exactly say but related experiments in our laboratory in another laboratories to really call down shift the nervous system and really set you up for maximal recovery rapid recovery and allow you to lean into the next training session with we intensity when that training cession eventually arrives moths a very simple tool but a very potent tool for your overall fitness thank you for joining me for this discussion of what ism calling a foundational less we could even get bold and call it an optimal fitness protocol though the word optimal is a tricky one here is no real optimal fitness protocol and to day what give really try to focus on is this foundational protocol because it does allow you to check off most if not all the boxes related to strength endurance hypertrophy speed power flexibility you will also teach you how to regulate your nervous system up and down that is to ramp and hocus mine musclelink et camera and then quickly calm down physiological size three to five minute decompress breathing at the end of training et camera really even though i talked about the protocol that i follow and again that we will provide as a news letter at superman labor come if you want t look at it in more detail eventhough we talked about it in the contact of what i do again i really want emphasize that this protocol and the description of this protocol and all its variables s really for you and for you to tailor to your specific needs please take the protocol into consideration but do not treat it as wholly treated as a

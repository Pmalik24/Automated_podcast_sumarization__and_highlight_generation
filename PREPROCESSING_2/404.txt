welcome to the superman lances of science science that to i mandrel superman and on o professor of her biology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing meditation we are going to discuss the science of meditation that is what happens in the brain and body while we are meditating and we will talk about the science of meditation as it relates to how the brain and body change as a consequence of meditation that is what you export or take from a meditation practice that can impact everything from your sleep to your mood for instance meditation has been shown to alleviate symptoms of depression and we will also talk about how meditation can be used to enhance police and other states of mind that are useful for work and other aspects of life now of course most of you have probably heard of meditation and when we think of meditation most often we think of somebody either sitting or lying down if they are sitting we might imagine them in the socolodisposition sitting with legs crossed very upright with hands on the knees or you know crossed in our lap or something of that sort typically we think of somebody who's in a very calm stayed eyes closed focussed on they're call third eye center the thirdly center is the area just behind one's forehead here is no third eye there at least o there should not be but it'll tell you why it is call the thirdly center what the origins is that are and why it is relevant actually for a meditative practice with all that said it turns out that meditation en compasses a huge variety of different practices some of those practices indeed are done sitting or lying down with one's eyes closed focussing on the third eye center other of those practices are focused on a body scan and really focusing on one area of the body in its contact with whatever surface you have to be sitting or lying on or can be done walking in fact there are walking meditations done with eyes open there are many different forms of meditation but to day we are going to focus mainly on how specific types of meditation and specific areas of the brain that are activated during those meditation s change our way of being in fundamental ways not just during the meditation practice but afterwards as well if you are somebody whose interested in changing your default state of mood or of thinking or enhancing your ability to focus or improving your sleep or improving performance in some cognitive or physical endeavor meditation is powerful but you want to make sure that you pick the right meditation practice will talk about picking a meditation practice that is not just feasible because you will do it but is actually directed at the goal specific to you and what you need most to give you some sense of the contour of to day's episode first ism going to talk about some of the underlying biology the mechanisms and the brain areas and also the areas of the body that are activated during certain forms of meditation and equally important which airs the brain and body are shut down or reduced in their activity during specific types of meditation then i transition into how to best do a meditation practice how to get the most out of that meditation practice and then i will talk about how to change your alter your meditation practices according to your specific goals and as you get better and meditation and this can get a littlest counter intuitive but in a positive way what i mean by that as for instance a lot of people think that as you meditate and get better it meditating you need to meditate more and more and more so if you get better at running endurance races that you need to keep running longer and longer you know first of five a than attend than a marathon than ultras with meditation is shall quite the opposite the better that you get at dropping into a particular brain state and the more your called traits of brain state shift not just states as their sometimes refer to but traits this is a theme that i picked up from a terrific book that it'll refer to later but the more that you can get into specific normal circuits quickly actually the less you need to meditate in order to derive the benefits of meditation that is a wonderful aspect of meditative practices that is unlike a lot of other forms of mental exercise and cognitive enhancing exercises will talk about all that to day and i promise that by the end of to day's episode you will have a richer ray of meditative practices to select from you will know why each of them work and why they can be directed toward particular goals and how to do that and you will also know how to modify those meditation practices under conditions where you might get busier or where your suffering from lack of sleep i think a lot of people will be excited to know that to day we are going to disiscust a specific form of meditation that can indeed reduce your need for sleep and still allow you to enhance your cognitive and physical abilities before we begin i to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to brings eurocostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead you deposits in cognitive end physical performance element contains a science backtolectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two hundermiligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and measure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doctor slash supermen let us talk about meditation as i mentioned earlier we are going to talk about water is of the brain and body are active during meditation and after meditation and why that can be beneficial we last talk about when and how best to meditate this is a topic have long been interested in i was first given a book on meditation when i was in high school cause to make a long story short was a bit of a wild one early in my school years and as a consequence of a program that i was in somebody handed me a book on meditation that book is still available now that book is called wherever you go there you are by john robot in he was one of the first not the only but one of the first people to really start popularizing meditation mindfulness practices in the united states this was in the late nineteen eighties and it was really only until recently that there were very few studies of meditation although those really picked up in the nineties now you can find many many thousands of studies on meditation and their mechanistic basis of brain imaging studies changes and hormones in the body but in the late nineteen eighties and in the early nineteen nineties because functional imaging of the brain called mark or femur was really just starting to emerge as a popular tool in laboratories and hospitals there really was not that much mechanistic understanding about how meditation worked but of course there was a deep understanding from cultures outside the united states that meditation was extremely useful i should just mention as long as were talking about the history of meditation any discussion about meditation is going to be a discussion about states of mind and any discussion about states of mind invokes the word consciousness a kind of a a dangerous topic to get into in any format because a lot of people talk about consciousness but people use consciousness the word to mean different things it does not have one standard operational definition as scientists call it however discussions about consciousness are often part and parcel with conversations about things psychedelics and kind of alternative therapies and in the nineteen sixties and especially in the nineteen seventies meditation and psychedelics were actually close cousins in the conversation about conscious less and states of mind that conversation started to split into two different divisions and it'll explain why in a moment ts gets to a little bit of interesting academic sociology but what happened was there were couple of guide at hazard including timothy learn and others who got really interested in psychedelics in particular plenty licurgicaciddietal mind and at that time that was part of the whole counter culture movement it was considered very anti establishment and they were really encouraging students at hazard to take eldest they were also very interested in meditation but what ended up happening as they essentially got kicked out or fired from hazard and there is a book that it'll refer you to in that shoot captions if you interested in learning more about all this but they got kicked out and fired for their emphasis on psychedelics now nowadays there is a lot of interests in psychedelics we have had episodes with doctor matter johns from john hoping university whose running clinical trials on psychedelic syce sylicibon and plenty for the treatment of depression and petiasty it also had doctor norland willies on the podcast my collie at stamford whose doing incredible studies on some of those compounds as well nowadays the conversation about psychedelics as coming back and it somewhat divorced from the conversation about meditation but in the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies the conversation about psychedelics and meditation was sort of one in the same that changed in the late nineteen eighties and early nineteen nineties when people john robots in started writing books that were purely about meditation and suggesting that people explore meditative practices for the utility to bring coyness a justness in prove sleep et camera divorced from the conversation about psychedelics now that is not to say that the scientific community immediately embraced the conversation about meditation in fact it took quite a long while for schools hazard and stamford and other universities around the world to start i bracing and funding studies of meditation asking what sorts of brain areas are involved how it changes the body and perhaps most importantly how a meditation practice can shift the brain an body when somebody is finished meditating and is off in their life doing their everyday things in the late nineteen eighties and especially within the nineteen nineties the advent of brain imaging technology magnetic resident imaging m r i or functional magnetic residents imaging was away to look at the brain while it was active notjust to get a an image of its structure but also how its functioning the areas that call light up when all that technology became accessible and popular will that allowed an large number of laboratories to start asking how specific patterns of thinking and breathing maybe people sitting in the low disposition but more often than that it would be people inside of an smart magnet because is magnets or put you into old tube and push you into the tube not against your will of course but put people into the tube have them meditate and then look at how the brain changed in to do that over time when those studies were done what was discovered was really quite miraculous really and now we do not think of its surprising but what was discovered was a huge laundry list of brain changes and then when people were evaluated in their outside life when they would fill out reports of their subjective feelings of happiness r they would report their sleep or even if objective measures were taken changes in hormones or markers of inflammation et camera a large list of information fell out of that which revealed that indeed there are many a dozen or more clear benefits of a regular meditation practice and some of those meditation practices could be quite short nowadays we think of meditation as pretty commonly accepted an an fact that has a lot to do with the fact that many of the major get companies in the a area during the two thousands such as goal and apple and any number of different social media companies and other companies and business ventures et camera investment firms all over the world starlit hiring people to train meditation or had on line courses for meditation nowadays we think of meditation as this thing that almost everybody understands can benefit us but we now sit at an interesting frontier where most people think of meditation as one thing the word exercise which of course could bean wait training it cold be running it could bean high intense interval training all of which as we will get you different results depending on what you do how often you do it and the specifics of what you actually do too meditation can give you very specific results it can give you more focus it can give you better sleep and can give you a commination of results just exercise can depending on the exercise what we are going to talk about exes that specific changes that happen in the brain with specific aspects of meditation that is what happens when you close your eyes what happens when you focus youritention inward verses focusing your mention outward because as i mention before there's third eye meditation were you close your eyes and focus on that spot just behind your forehead and you focus on your breathing there is also meditation practises where your focusing on what your eating with a lot of called mindfulness being very present to whatever happening not letting your mind wander or think about yesterday or to morrow what is happening next but really focusing on the present there also meditation practices of course where you are in a form at of interpersonal communication where you are really listening very intensely that too is a form of mindfulness we are going to parse each of these things and we are going to ask what is happening in the brain and body during each of these meditation practices that you can develop specific meditation practices that you can invoke in your real life on a daily basis or thankfully i would say for some who are pretty busy that you could even do once a week or even once a month that will still clearly benefit you in specific ways it'd to spend the next ten minutes or talking about the now science of meditation i promise you ism not going to just list off a bunch of different brain areas that are active during meditation that would not be useful to you in fact i do not believe in throwing out a lot of coming clatter without also giving some mechanistic explanation as to what different brain areas do and you could say well what good is it knowing what different brain areas do and their names if i cannot actually manipulate those brain areas but the good news is you actually can manipulate those brain areas as it'll tell you to day you can turn up the activity in certain brain airs and turn down the activity in specific brain areas with specific elements of a meditation practise that is quite exciting in quite different really from other aspects of narrow side that we might discuss on this podcast there are few different brain areas whose names it'd to arm you with and again the names themselves are not essential but if you can grasp even the top contour of what ism about to say you will be in a much better position to parse and use the information that follows there is an area of your brain that sits right behind your forehead that is call the prefrontal quarter basely it is the front bumper of your head just behind the bone of that area just behind your forehead that we call the prefrontal quarter acshaly encompasses a lot of different things and actually you have two of them you have one on the right side of your brain and you have one on the left side of your brain and they are connected to one another but they should do different things the area that it'd to focus on today far bit is the called left prefrontal quarter or if we we are going to get really specific we would say the left dor collateral prefrontal quarter dorsal means up lateral means to the side if you want to touch the left side of your head and move your hand just toward the midline toward the this or top your head a little bit that is dorsal and then laterals on your hand is still on the side your head you are in the left or collateral prefrontal quarter k you get your hand probably right over your left or collateral prefrontal quarter that area of the brain we know from lesion studies where it is been damaged in animals or humans and we know from stimulation studies where it is been selectively stimulated in animals or yes indeed also it is been done in humans has an incredible ability to control your family senses and to make sense that is to interpret what is going on in terms of your emotions and your bodily sensations from now on unless i say otherwise if i say prefrontal quarter ism specifically referring to the left or lateral prefrontal quarter but ism a shorten that up just for sake of simplicity and ease of communication if ism in ta talk about another of prefrontal quarter i talk about another area but f i say pry frontal quarter today what i mean is left dor lateral prefrontal quarter stimulation of left or collateral prefrontal carte or i should say more appropriately when your left or collateral prefrontal quarter is active you are in a great position to interpret what is going on with you emotionally to interpret your bodily signals of comfort or discomfort and then make really good decisions on the basis of that interpretation and that is because the left or cultural prefrontal quarter is indirect communication with and is directly connected to another brain area called the interior singular quarter or a c c now ism just going to refer to it as the a c c the a c c is an area of your brain that is interpreting a at of different things about bodily signals for instance how fast your breathing whether not your heart is beating quickly or slowly and more importantly whether not your heart is beating quickly or slowly for the circumstance that you are in frinctance if you are running up a hill and it is you are in even in great shape and your heart is beating very fast it is unlikely that your are going to be concerned about your heart beating fast because that is appropriate for the circumstance however if you are just walking along anal amen your heart start's beating very quickly for no apparent reason well then you are going to interpret that as either pathologic or uncomfortable inappropriate for the context that you happen to be in the left dorsulato prefrontal quarter is the area of the brain that actually has some control over and especially can interpret what is going on in this a c c region now most of you probably have not heard of the a c c most of you probably have heard of a brain area called the amigdulats an omen shape structure on the two sides of the brain people tuck was the fire center et camera but your a c c the inter lingulate quarter gets input from areas the emigdula your threaten detection centers but it also gets input from an enormous number of other areas of your brain and body including your heart your gut it gets information bout how full that is distended or how empty your gut is it gets information about how quickly your breathing from in put from your lungs and related structures is an absolutely critical station for making sense of what is going on in your body and it works very closely along with one other structure and i promises going to be the third structure in this tread and then it'll stop listing off name we have dorslato prefrontal quarters think of that as for of the interpreter of what is going on inside of you you have the a c c or inter lingulate quarter which is the area of your brain that is bringing in all this information about what is going on inside your body any been on the surface of your body you know if you have any pain or an itch or a mosquito bite on the surface your body your a c c would define register that then there is this other absolutely incredible brain structure which is called the insula i ones you all insula the insula as a bunch of different parts to it but the insula is another area that is interpreting signals of what is going on in your brain and body the a c c and the insulate working together a trying figure out yew what is going on inside me and in addition to that the insula is interpreting information about what is going on outside of you your insula is saying for instance a this is a she hill that ism running up and as a consequence whatever heart rate increase that ism experiencing or heavy breathing or burning in my lungs this all make sense i do not have to be worried i do not have to be scared i might want a slow down but this makes sense whereas it for instance in the example i previously gave where if your sitting in a room and everything is pretty calm and all a sudden you start feeling really uncomfortable your stomach does not feel rider you tart breathing quickly you start having a called anxiety or panic attack in large part that is because the shift in your bodily sensations does not match or does not correspond to something in the outside world there is this incredible treat which includes the left or slate prefrontal quarters the lingulate or inter singular quarter and the insula and those three a working together in a kind of conversation it is a curl conversation but a conversation on the last try to figure out look at what is going on inside me how do i feel what am i thinking about and this could be thoughts about the past or the future or the present they are also in a conversation as to whether not the sensations that your experiencing meaning how quick your breathing is or how slow your breathing is how your heart feels how your skin n feels any sensations of pain or pleasure for that matter whether not that make sense for the situation you rein and thing to determine whether or not you are doing the right things as a consequence of those sensations because again if you cannot remember the names of these different normal structures in the brain do not worry about it it is really not that critical what is critical that you understand that there is a conversation that is constantly occurring as long as you are awake trying to figure out what is going on inside of you whether not it makes sense relative to what is going on outside and around you now humans are smart that is we are to some extent conscious of the fact that we have memories of the past awareness of the present and anticipation of the future we do realize for instance that we can be fitted seated at the dinner table souse me and have a thought about something tomorrow may be it exam that stressing us out or something that and that will change our bodily state in a way that is not optimal for what we are doing in the moment but that can still make sense to us because that examine important may be refueling some pressure about a hard conversation we have to have or maybe we are very excited about the next day and we cannot eat because we are excited and that can make perfect sense to us because we do have access to this knowledge about self that we can think about the past the present or the future that makes the conversation these three structures rein even more interesting in dynamic because what it means is that we can be doing something eating talking running any number of different activities and our bodily state may or may not match what we are doing in a way that is adaptive for that and yet that can be completely obey or at least understandable for us now major emphasis of a meditation practice is to make us called more mindful what is mindfulness will again there is not one perfect universally accepted operational definition of mindfulness that sparsely nerd speak for saying people cant agree exactly what mindfulness should be is and means for everyone but most people assume and i think agree that mindfulness include something about being present and when i say present that does not necessarily mean present to ones surroundings because of course a lot of meditation practices that a designed to make us more mindful and present are design to make us more mindful and present to what is happening internally while ignoring everything that is happening externally but they are designed to make us more present to our bodily sensations and in particular our breathing and our thoughts in the moment sole us now explore what a generic meditation practice looks and lets evaluate how that tends to change the activity of these normal circuits in the brain and body and then from there we can split the conversation into a couple different bins that is meditation practices that are ideal for enhancing focus meditation practices that our ideal for improving mood meditation practices that are ideal for improving sleep and meditation practices that believe it or not benefit all of those things in one fill swoop o case what happens during a meditation practice at the curl level in order to answer that question we are going to be scientists that means you and i are going to be scientists now we are going to break down or practice into its different component parts and address what we know for sure about the brain activation states that occur with those different component parts in order to do that let us use a somewhat generic form of meditation but it is generic and pretty far reaching because i would say that for most people above seventy five percent lets say a meditation practices going to involve stopping meaning getting out of motion sitting or lying down and in most cases closing one's eyes although it is absolutely not required to close one's eyes during meditation there are many forms of meditation that are done eyes open but for most people it is going to involve stopping our movement that is not ambulating not walking or running o s seemed or lying down with eyes closed when we do that meaning when we sit or lie down and close our eyes as trivial is that shift might sound to you it actually is a profound shift in the way that your brain and other curl circuits in your body function for the following reason when we close our eyes we shut down a major avenue of what is called exteroceptor what i mean by exteroceptor well very briefly we are sensing things on our body and in our body all the time we are also sensing things from outside of us all the times these to be sights or sounds touch on our body sensations with inside or body et camera now sensation is distinct from what we call perception perception is put simply the sensations that we happen to be paying attention too at any given moment you are sensing many many things the a sound waves sitting your ears there are pressure receptors on the bottoms of your feet sensing your shoes or your sandals or the floor et camera but you are not perceiving them until you place your attention on them now the way perception works is that you have called spotlights of attention you cannot perceive everything all at once every sound every sight every touch that would be overwhelming in fact that would be terrible rather you have spotlights of perception that can either be very narrow for instance you could focus all of your perception right now on your big toe of your right foot and really pure all of your awareness your attention into what your perceiving there what it feels if there is tingling or pressure heat or cold et camera or you can broad in that spotlight to include both feet or all your toes on both feet and then your legs in your whole body or the entire room percept ion is a spotlight and i should mention there very good data that we can split our attention into two but probably not more than two spotlights and we can make those spotlights of perception either very broad and diffuse or very narrow you can practise us now if you you can pick a spot on the wall away from you anywhere or if you are driving you can look at some location and you can focus intensely on one small location for instance a tree in the horizon or a person on the street or any number of different things outside of you or you can broad in that spotlight to include the entire scene at once you can also focus a spotlight of perception on your body say on the left upper portion of your chest and of course you can focus on the left upperportion of your chest and something outside of you can split your attention between those two perceptual spotlights it is very hard although not impossible to have three perceptual spotlights but most people can split to two points of attention or perception pretty easily the other thing that most people can do pretty easily is merge those two spotlights or rather to have just one spotlight of attention you do not always have to have two spotlights of attention on and here i amusing the word attention and perception interchangeably you could for instance have two points of attention s you are talking somebody in your paying attention to whether not somebody is walking in the door not that is two or you could be completely focus on the person your talking to or you could be completely focus n the stomach ache or the great sensation of hunger that you have in your belly while talking a somebody in fact you are not even listening to whether saying at all of you've two spotlights of perception you can split them or merge them into one and this is very important those spotlights of perception can intensify or dim and there amusing analogy what i mean by that is your perception f what is happening within those spotlights can be very very high a city that is you can register very fine changes in detail tingling on one side of your big toe of your right foot verses the other or it can be somewhat more diffuse you are rustling about your whole to which in that case seems a small area but the point is that you can consciously adjust the acuity that is the fineness of your perception all of this is under your power because of the incredible ability of a brain structure whose name you now understand and now which is the left or collateral prefrontal quarter although there others of your brain involved as well your ability to direct your attention to specific things in your environment or within your body or to split those points of attention or merge them or dial up the intensity of how closely your paying attention to every little shift or ripple and change in sensation there or to kind of dissociate if you will for lack of a better word to disengage from that perception all of that is under control because of your ability to engage this area that we call the prefrontal quartern in particular the left dor collateral prefrontal quarters it'd to take a u i break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the robotics that i need for got health our got is very important its populated by up microbioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those robotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptions fitments and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tasteright if you to tryathletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a years supply of vitamin d three k two again that athletic green stock cam slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of item indeed the cay to o case now if we look at the example of what happens when you sit or lie down and close your eyes and decide to meditate you should immediately realizes that that is a tremendous shift in your perceptual ability why because that spotlight of attention while it can be oriented toward for instance what you hear in the room or maybe the feeling of wind moving trees in the environment thatyou happen to be in when we close our eyes we shut down one of the major avenues for sensory input which is vision and when we do that there is a tendency for those perceptional spotlights to be focused more on what happens at the level of the surface of our skin and inside of our bodies and that informs us about something very important which is that their actually two axis are two ends of a continuum of perception up until now iavebeen talking about perception and intention as kind of the same thing and indeed they are least for sake of this conversation but within that word perception or within that word attention there is a continuum and that continuum has on one end something called interception interceptions spelled with an eye is everything that we sense that the level of our skin and inward the sensation inside our stomach the sensation of our heart beating some people nonsense their heart beating pretty easily other people have more challenge doing that what we are feeling on the surface of our skin how hot or cold we feel that is interception in contrast at the other end of the continuum is called exterroception spelled with an e exteroceptor is perception of everything that is outside or beyond the confines of our skin by shutting our eyes and in particular in a meditative practice where we direct our attention toward our called third eye center this area right behind our forehead which not incidentally is the prefrontal cortex or in some cases where people will focus on their breathings o the movements of their stomach or the movement of their diaphragm or the lifting of their chest or the extension their belly while they breathe by doing that we are taking what ordinarily is a perceptual state that split between the outside world exterroception and usually also toward our inner state you almost people are generally touch with how they are feeling from the skin inward while they are also paying a mention to what is outside of them you can think about somebody forces at a restaurant or sandpit shop about to order a sandwich your reading the man's that is exteroceptor right the many outside the confines of your skin and little ideas or may be big ideas come to mind about what the roast beef sandwiches the vegetarian sandwich will taste what it will do for you what what is in it what you what you do not et camera that splitting interception and exterreception but when we close our eyes we stop we slow down we focus on our breathing or that thirdly center then majority of our perception then shifts to interception and when we shift down to that end of the continue of interception something very important happens what happens is that those two regions the a c c the enterasingulate quarter and the insula really ramp up their levels of neural activity and that should make perfect sense to you because those are areas of your brain that are registering and pay attention to the serious sensations of how full or empty your stomach feels whether not the surface of your skin feels hot or cold and on and on by just sitting down or lying down and closing your eyes your brain undergoes a massive shift from exteroceptor to nterreception no that is not to say you cannot be distracted by external events in fact many people are but the early stages of transitioning into a meditative state involve this shift down the continuum or i should say to one end of the continue cause there is no down up there is just the continuum shift along continuum to heighten levels of interception now i mention this briefly before but many people are very interroceptively aware just naturally even if they do not do a meditation practice other people are not and there is a pretty good measure of whether r not you have high levels of interceptive awareness or capability and that is your ability to count your heart beats without placing your fingers anywhere with any pressure to take your pulse you can do this if you you can actually try and estimate your number of heart beats simply by trying to feel your heart beat some people are very good mind the very accurate at doing this other people are not it does seem to be in ability that can be trained up quite a bit and in fact meditative practices will improve your interceptive awareness but and this is a very important point heighten levels of interceptive awareness while that might sound attractive oh be to really in touch with your body that is not always beneficial why because many people who for instance have excessive levels of anxiety have excessive levels in it of anxiety because they are very keenly aware of any subtle shift in their heart rate or breathing or change in their the sensations within their stomach whereas other people for less aware of their bodily state that can be beneficial right it can be adaptive or not depending on the circumstances is probably not adaptive to be very very aware of your internal state if for instance you are doing public speaking you do not wat anything about what is going on in your stomach or how quickly your breathing ism certainly trying ignore all those a signals those sensations now but for somebody who has no awareness of what is going on very little interceptive awareness that can be problematic too because these are the very people who can ignore the fact that there having a heart attack or can ignore the fact that they have high blood pressure and are carrying about life focussed on everything external with no awareness of their own body their quoting go out of touch with their body we want to be very careful about placing valance which is a sort of value of good or bad on interceptive awareness for us extereceptib awareness more importantly we want emphasized that when you undergo a meditation practice if it is of the sort where you stop your movement and close your eyes you are training for interceptive awareness this becomes important later we get into discussions about meditation for reducing anxiety some people may opt in fact i would say some people ought to opt for a meditative practice which involves more exteroceptor awareness actually a meditation a walking meditation or even a seated meditation where they are bringing their focus to a place outside their body as suppose to inside their body and in fact there are examples of people who have meditated quite a lot who develop such a heightened state or awareness of their interceptive components that is just fancy again nerd speak for aware of their breathing and of their heart and of their the state of their gut that it actually is intrusive for daily activities i will ask you to ask this question of yourself now are you somebody who tends to be very in touch with your bodily sensations for instance from the skin inwards or are you somebody who tends to be less touch with or aware of your interceptive state there is no right or wrong answer you do not get an air an off for a de or see depending on your answer it is just a good question for each in every one of us to answer and i think most people will answer that it depends it depends on whether not you are in a social getting or whether not your alone but we are going to return to that answer keep it in mind because it will become very beneficial in building and optimal meditation practice for you but for now just note there is this continuum of perception interception and extereception closing your eyes increases in terreception opening your eyes dramatically increases exterreception just automatically just automatically because much of your brain in fact forty per cent or more is dedicated to vision and this i should say for those of couther low vision or no vision than those you that are blind or have poor vision this entire process is translated to the auditory to the sound domain it is true for people that conceive at true for people that cannot see of course people that cannot see closing the eyes does not have this huge shift towards in terreception but there have been a feu studies not as many as i would have to find but a few studies of for instance people who are blind or have low vision do not see very well and when they close their ears and they cannot hear the external world or they put headphones on or noise cancelling headphones then the world inside of them becomes very prominent relative to the world outside of them for obvious reasons i ask you to ask yourself whether not you are somebody who tends to be more interreceptively aware or not more extern receptively aware or not and some of you might not be able to answer that question and if you cannot chances are that you are effectively sliding along that continuum depending on the activities that you are doing you are probably the kind of person where somebody comes over to you and s ares talking you you will engage in that conversation and you do not feel inside your body that you are thinking about you are heart beating and whether not your flushing red at camera you are going to pay attention o what they say many people however when somebody talks to them if they have social anxiety or even a slight bit of social anxiety will be thinking about whether not their cheeks are flushing or whether not they lookwright or songwriter whether not they have something in their teeth these are normal responses but they really speak to this issue of whether not you tend to shift more towards interceptive awareness or exterreceptive awareness and of course context dependent it will depend on whether not your young out on a date with somebody that you would loath to find out later that you had food in your in your teeth or whether to your with somebody your more familiar with where that would not really matter much or the other person would tell you this kind of thing what does it mean to be at one location or another location along this continuum of interception or extereception what we know what it means neurally right we know that if you are more interreceptively aware you are incelanac we or active but that is not very useful that is not that is not helpful as a tool that is just a fact now there actually been studies of what a meditation practice can do in terms of moving you along this continuum from where you naturally sit in order to help you function not just during the meditation but at all times and in order to illustrate this i want to start with a description of what is now a classic study a very cool study has a very cool name talks about something very important that will me up again and again into days conversation that is on my call the default mode network the default mode network as a collection of different brain areas that essentially are active when we are not doing much of anything and certainly is active when we are not focussed on one particular past or conversation or activity the default mode network can be thought of more or less as the network that generates mind wandering or our thoughts drifting from the past of the present to the future remember earlier i talked about how your perceptual spotlight can either be two spotlights or they can merge well similarly human beings can think about the past surely the present definitely and the future and it turns out we can also split our thoughts just we can split our perception into two of those three things i can think about the past a past event and i can think about the present i can split my thinking an my memory in that way i can also think about the present in the future i can also think about the future and the past although it is very difficult although not impossible to split one's thinking and memory into the past the present and future simultaneously not easily done but pretty easy to split one's attention an thinking into two of those three things either the past the present the future or any two of those three things o kin just with attentional spotlighting you can place your mind your thinking in your memory your cognition on to one of those things would be very very present or the past in the present and on and forth the default mode network while it involves a lot of different brainareas can be thought of simply as the network of brain areas that are active when your mind is wandering between these different time domains and the paper i to share with you as a mention me for is now a classic paper has a a wonderful title which is a wandering mind is an unhappy mind now that sounds almost a newsarticle or a a news article about to scientific paper but it's i shall the title of the scientific paper which was published in the journal science which is one of the three apex journals you scientific publishing is competitive but it is especially competitive to get manuscripts excepted into science into nature and into the journal cell represents can of the one of the superbowle a tibia championships and standby cup if you will new sports of fisionatos of scientific publishing this is a paper from matter killingsworth and can gilbert it was publish in two thousand ten but it still considered a classic and this paper a wandering mine is an unhappy mine has a number of very important points ism going to paraphrase certain elements of it for you because they say eventually what i would you to know far better than i could am than i could say first of all they start out with a statement which i confess i disagree with which is unlike other animals human being spend a lot of time thinking about what is not going on around them contemplating events that happened in the past might happen in the future or will never happen at all i agree with the assertion that human beings do that that certainly my experience although i must say i do not thin there is any evidence whatsoever that other animals do not do it also a my apologies killingsworth in gilbert but i behave it to go tattoo with you on that i am not aware of any data that or one one way or the other what other animals are thinking lets set aside other animals and lets focus on the human animal now their point is still a very good one which is that humans have this a wandering of the mind that they call stimulus independent thought that is there is nothing happening to create these thoughts were anything happening in the immediate environment these thoughts are just happening on their own internally that is the default mode network this study was important in fact it was a landmark study because they did at right about the time that smartphones became of widely available and in use again twenty ten they basically pined people they contact if people on their phones many times per day and they did this for well over two thousand two hundred adults they'd a mix of male and female people in the study the mean age was thirty four years but there was a rain mean of course being average but there were a range of of of different ages and forth and at any moment they asked people what a you feeling right now and they also asked them what re you doing right now they were looking for the match or mismatch between what people were doing in what they were feeling they were sensual trying to probe what people were thinking about and they also addressed that and they came up with a a kind of a a bubble chart if you will where the bigger the bubble a the more answers came back about one particular thing and they assessed whether not people were happy or not in that moment or sad or not whether not they were focused on what they were doing or not there lot of bubbles in this charts when nothing a read them all but they important points that came from the data and again that's a very large data set was that and here again on paraphrasing first people's minds wandered frequently regardless of what they were doing in nearly half of the samples taken people were generally thinking about something else except it turns out there is just one little bubble sitting way far out on the horizon here people claimed and ism inclined to believe them that they tend to be very focus on making love if they were making love in the moment where they were pinged on their phone now why their phone was there with them at that moment i do not know that is a was not included in this a description of the study but all the other activities grooming in self care listening to the news watching tell vision relaxing working et camera et camera during all those activities people claim hat their mind wandered a lot and then they also assessed of course their mood and how those people felt at any given moment depending on what they were doing in how well their mind and their emotions matched what they were doing and what they say here is second they revealed that people were less happy when their minds were wandering than when they were not and this was true during all activities and then third what people were thinking at a given moment was far better a predictor of their happiness than what they were doing this is interesting and i think matches a lot of people's experience in fact i think as you here about the study many of you will p fly just say and i mean if you are working and you do not your work in your thinking about something bad that happened well than of course you are not can to be happy but the key point of this study is that it did not necessarily have to be the case that people were thinking about something unpleasant in fact if people were working and they were thinking about something else that was pleasant that also made them feel unhappy in other words the mismatch between being in inactivity in having our mind elsewhere led people to report themselves this feeling more unhappy in that moment and when you total this up what you find is that people are often not present to what they are doing and that is a great source of unhappiness even if their thoughts are those of happy joyful thoughts this is interesting and i think runs counter to what most of us have heard or we been taught which is you ow think good thoughts trying suppress bad thoughts have a good internal landscape t create a good narrative that is all true but equally if not more important is to have the ability to be fully engaged in what you are doing at given moment that is the strongest predictor of being happy and there were several other studies that followed up on this but their conclusion that they put in the final short paragraph of this paper i think really captures it beautifully they say and here ism quoting directly conclusion a human mind is a wandering mind and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind the ability to think about what is not happening in a moment i added in a moment part is a cognitive achievement that comes at an emotional cost i know ism not alone in believing that this paper a wandering mind is an unhappy mind and we will providelink to this paper in the slowpoke captions is absolutely key in understanding why a meditation practices important because a meditation practice is really about a busting your place along that interceptive extereceptive continuum too what you happen to be experiencing in that moment and while most people thing of a meditative practice as focussing on what is going on internally with your eyes close third eye center focussing under breathing et camera for any number of minutes or maybe even an hour or longer there are other forms of meditation in which your enter reception dominates in which you are actively focussing on things outside or beyond the confines of your skin and internal landscape and that too is meditation and if we are to take the work of killingsworth and gilbert this a wandering mind is an unhappy mind seriously and i know a number of other laboratories have and have supported this research with their findings again and again and again what this means is that meditating is not necessarily a practice that we do divorced from the rest of life meditation and mindfulness in particular being present to what we are doing in a given moment is one of the essential keys to happiness an improved mood even if what we or doing is unpleasant that brings us to a tool and it is a tool that any in all of us can use whether not you tend to be intereceptively dominant that you tend to pay more attention to your bodily sensations or extereceptively dominant and again if you do not know the answer to that question there is a simple test that you can do you can just sit down or lie down close your eyes and you can ask yourself or a less whether or not your attention tends to fleet to things outside of you cars honking or going by people in the room or whether not you tend to be able to focus on your internal landscape to the exclusion of extra reception and attention to things outside the confines of your skin easily now course this will depend on context and situation even how well rested you are at camera but that is exactly the point this is the sort of thing you want to do every time you decide to do a meditation practice in fact i would suggest that you use this to determine what meditation you do at any given moment let say you are somebody who is a regular meditator or let say your somebody whose never meditated and you to develop a meditation practice i suggest that you do a test of whether or not you are more intereceptively dominant or extrareceptively dominant in that moment this again this is not a personality trait this is a question about where you happen to be in a moment let us say you are on a plane or your in the car if your the car please do not close your eyes well driving that sort of obvious but do this in a safe way please but stop close your eyes and a best whether or not you can access and focus your attention primarily on your internal state or whether or not your attention and perception gets pulled to something external to exteraception and again that will vary depending on circumstance and who you are then i suggest opening your eyes and trying to focus your attention to something external to you and seeing or valuating the extent to which you can divorce your perception from sensations that occur at the level of your skin or internally now i should say that there is no technology at least not that ism aware of absence of far more machine and which case you are inside enough more machine while you do this but unless you are in that experiment and most of us are not there is no technology that can tell you for instance whether not you are intereceptively dominant or extrareceptively dominant and whether not the ratio is yo seventy five to twenty five or what have you at any given moment you have to access this subjectively however if you sit down for instance and you notice that you can equally split your attention between internal sensations and external sensations or whether not you find yourself pulled into external sensations when your trinafocus inward or you find yourself pulled inward when your chinafocus outward well that will dictate the sort of meditation that you perhaps ought to perform in that moment let me give an example how you would do this you would stop in some way a sit er lie down close your eyes and evaluate whether not you can essentially rule out or eliminate attention to all outside events most people will not be able to do that entirely but try and focus your attention for instance on your breathing or the typical third my center no focussing at a spotlight behind your forehead if you feel you can do that reasonably well to the exclusion of what is happening around you well then an important question arises should you meditate in a way to enhance that interceptive awareness or rather should you meditate in away for instance with your eyes open and your attention on a particular portion of the landscape yourein a tree or or maybe even i a an object or a plant or something else in your immediate environment to try in cultivate or enhance your exteroceptor awareness that is up to you but my bias would be one in which you work against your default state again the default mode network is where you land on this interceptive extra receptive continuum is going to lead to more mind wandering whereas when you encourage ore we can even say force yourself a little bit to anchor your attention to either inside your body your outside your body and you make that decision according to what you are doing less easily well then you are actively training up the hurry circuits you're engaging called hurry plasticity the brains ability to change in response to experience you are deliberately engaging a shift along that continuum to make this crystal clear what i mean is this let me give an example if i were to sit down and i want to do some meditation let to say three minutes of meditation there is good evidence that even three minutes of meditation can be beneficial for a variety of things including enhanced focus an enhanced anxiety management wat say i sit down and i notice that i can really focus inward on what is happening at the level my skin and my internal organs and i can rule out everything maybe that is cause the room is quiet or maybe it is just because my brain is in a state that ism particularly good at that at that moment maybes just a natural ability well then i would opt for a three minute meditation practice in which i deliberately exteroceptor that i build up the circuitry to focus on something external to me because i want and i think most people would to have an adaptive mechanism within them that they can slide along that continuum and they do not default to whatever it happens to be easiest for them in that moment now if i were to sit down and try and focus on what is going on internally and i kept getting distracted by things happening outside of me opening my eyes a feeling i kneed to reach for my phone or paying attention to sounds in the room well then i would actively engage a meditation practise in this case a three minute example but it could be longer where ism deliberately trying to focus my perception on events at the level the confines of my skin and internally why do i say this well i love to use the phrase a any time with kids a when they say this is really her d or something is challenging or adults will say that is really tough well as my graduate adviser used to say that means your learning if something were easy if you can perform any activity or thought et camera will then there is absolutely zero reason for your nerd circuits to change it is the friction it is the feeling that something is hard that turns on the enormous variety of mechanisms at the level cells et camera that allow you to potentially change your nerd circuitry challenge and discomfort is the signal to your brain embody that something needs to change i am encouraging you to embark on meditative practices that are not your default to essentially go against the grain of where your interceptive bias or your extoreceptive bias happens to be at a given moment and again this will change for some of you this will change across the day where early in the day you are very very good at doing an interceptive bias meditation and later in the day you are not i actually believe based on the data that have covered and will get into a few more papers about this and my lab is actively working on this as well that a meditative practice can be made far more effective that is it can invoke more neural plasticity more shift in brain states and brain circuitry if we do not take the easy path that is we go against the grain of what our brain would naturally do in a given moment if you are in a crowded air port in your finding that everything is very distracting well then that would be a great time to do some interceptive focus meditation whereas if you are really in your head in your looping thoughts about the past and present may be even in obsessive thought well that would be a terrific time an ideal time really to do a short meditation focused on something external to you in both cases whether not your or focus on interceptive bias or extroceptive was you are going against or i should say your pushing back against your default mode network i would argue it is going to be far more effective that is you're going to reduce or shift the activity of that default mode network far more and in a far more beneficial way if you actively try and suppress your bias toward being more interceptive or enter receptive now i think that is immensely beneficial both for the immediate changes that you experience what others have called a state change cause that is what it is and it also can lead to as we refer to earlier more normal plasticity more changes in the brain circuits that under li or default mode network and lead to what are called trait changes and i want to be very clear that i am not the first to make this state verses trait distinction that is a distinction that was raised in a really wonderful book in fact i cannot recommend this book highly enough the book is altered traits science reveals how meditation changes your mind brain and body this is a book by dance golden and a richer davidson d on a terrific work and many writings and many talks at camera about meditation i would say that circa twenty sixteen twenty seventeen this book really captured what i believe to be that the most essential elements of the science of meditation a lot of the history of it as well to day we refocussing on much of what is covered in this book but also a lot of things that have happen happened excuse me since twenty seventeen infant most of the papers that ism going to talk about are papers that were publish after twenty seventeen but again there is a wonderful book where they very clearly distinguish between state changes and trait changes trait changes being the more long lasting ones my read of this book and the literature that follows is again that when you sit down to meditate it is going to be most effective to do that interceptive extrareceptive by suscessmen ask yourself whether or not you are more in your head or outside your head if you will and then to do a meditation practice that runs counter to where you happen to be at that is that pushes you more externally if you are in your head and if your more focus somewhat is going on around you that pushes you more internal now i think most people are familiar with how to do an interceptive blast meditation again that would be setting a time or may be do not been set a time or you just sit or lie down close your eyes focus on that thirdly center behind your forehead or focus on your breathing or your bodily sensations that is typical and often discussed exterreceptive based meditations you pick a focal point outside or beyond the confines of your skin that could be for instance a point on the wall if you are indoors could be a plant it could be a point on the horizon far away what you will find is that your visual system will fatigue a little bit when you concentrate your visual focus at that location i want or remind you that it is perfectly ocean in fact necessary to blink you should blink you can relax your face you can change your expression there is no rule that says that you cannot do those things is not just beaming a particular location in space and holding your eyelids open have been accuse many times of not blinking very often that is for other reasons its part of the way i access a memory about what i want to say i do not use a prompter here accessing from a sort of an internal a image in my head ah that is how my memory works but in any case if you are going to do n extrareceptive bias meditation there is absolutely no reason why you would not look away from that location every once in a while in the same way that if your focused on internal thoughts with your eyes closed and focused on your breathing ever once and well your thoughts will skip away from that breathing or from your third eye center in fact and this is discussed in the book alter traits but by many other people as well one of the key elements of any meditative practice whether not its interceptive we focused or extra receptively focus is that it is really a refocussing practice the more number of timesthat you have to yank yourself back into a tending or perceiving one specific things and other words the more times your mind wanders and you bring it back actually the more effective that practice is again if you can just focus on one location with labor precision in your mind never darts away from that and you have to bring it back will then there is no narrow plasticity nothing needs to change because your nervous sister will effectively know it is performing perfectly your somebody who tries to do meditation you find your mind just wanders just remember every time you scruff yourself and pull yourself back to focusing on some location externally or focus back on your breath or your third center each one of those are just opportunities to do better they are essential to the improvement process think about them as a sending a staircase of refocusing every time you refocus you are going up one more level another stare another stare another stare and i think that will move you away from the kind of judgmental process of thinking ah i cannot focus on anything pretty soon what you will notice is that the refocusing process will happens quickly that you do not even perceive it and again this is something that's borne out in the nor imaging data a lot of people think that they can focus with labor precision but actually what they are better at doing is refocusing more quickly and consistently over time here is a classic study of about this in very experienced mediators that was done in japan where they had people with varying levels of meditation ability som but never meditated others who are really expert mediators with many hundreds if not thousands of hours of meditation under their belt and they have those people listen to twenty tones repeated over and over the same tone they found that the expert mediators could really focus and they do this by brain imaging they could really focus on all twenty tones whereas most people and of a tent or what is called habituate to the tones that by the tenth eleven tone their mind is really going to something else now that is wonderful but that really just tells us the expert mediators have better focus but it turns out that the more modern or imaging studies have shown that they do not have better focus such that their staying in a very narrow trench of focus what their doing is their exiting focus in going back in more quickly more quickly more quickly over and over again rather than think about your ability to focus think about your ability to refocus and the more number of times you've to refocus the better training your getting earlier i mention doing this interceptive bust a extracceptive by as meditation for three minutes why did i say three minutes well three men seems a reasonable number from most people to do consistently your once a day ain in fact there are some studies of one minute meditations and three minute meditations and ten and sixty my laboratory has been studying a five minutes a day meditation and that clearly has benefits but i think it is also clear that by three minutes many of the benefits are starting to arrive and well ism not pointing to any one particular data point here it is very clear that forcing oneself to direct one's perception that is your attention to your internal state or to something external to you is immensely beneficial if you do it consistently and is again especially beneficial if your focusing your attention on the portion of your experience either internal or external to you that is not the one that you would default to in that moment and some people of taken this to the extreme to say that yet you can even just move about your day and then every one's in a while just do a one breath meditation to be honest when i look at the whole of the data it seems as if it does not really matter in order to derive most of the benefits of a meditation practice now ism a big fan of some of the newer meditation as that are out there one in particular that have been using and that i she start using because my my dad is a big fan of it and he does now fairly long meditations he's doing about ten or twenty minutes at least every other day and often every day and he convinced me to check out the waking up a that say arris is put out a i looked at it i think some of it sits behind a payroll but you can access much of it on or least to a trial and try it out without having to get behind that payroll they are not a sponsor of this podcast i should mention but i decide to use the waking up a i think it is terrific and i think one the reasons its terrific is that say includes short descriptions of what meditation is doing in what a specific meditation can do for you just prior to doing that meditation those meditations can be quite brief some of them are a minute long two minutes long summer are longer or even quite a bit longer that a i think includes a variety of meditations that really encompasses am the huge range of possibility that are possible with meditation and that it least by my experience of the waking up a has led to my most consistent meditation practice and of course i would love to get say on the podcast of a guest we could talk about the for of under winnings of the waking up a and his views on everything from meditation to i know he is of big in the discussion about free will and consciousness som the very deep and somewhat abstract discussions really hope to get say on the podcast at a time not too far from now meanwhile we have never met in person but i absolutely a love the waking up a say and i know a my father does as well in i know many of you already use it if you have not tried it already i really do encourage you to check it out i want to talk just briefly about this third my center business because it turns about to be pretty interesting i the third i is actually a name that is been given to another curl structure am or i should s a structure because not strictly hurry and that is the pineal gland a this has an interesting history i promise ism not on taking off on station here that is in relevant to meditation you have a brain of course and on both sides o your brain you tend to have murder symmetric representations of the same things what do i mean by that well you have a prefrontal quartets on the right if a prefrontal quarters on the last and they actually do slightly different things language is sometimes latter lives to one side but in general for every structure the a on one side of the brain you have the same structure on the opposite side of the brain there is one clear exception to that and that is the pineal gland the pineal gland is the gland that makes melatonin which at night when it gets dark secretes maletonan and that melton makes you sleepy helps y fall asleep and not stay a slip de cart rite the philosopher to cart asserted that the pineal was the seat of the soul because it was the one structure in the brain that he saw was not on both sides of the brain it was only one of them and in the middle now i doftknow if this the see of the soul or not ism a not in a position to a make a sentiments that but what do we know about the pineal the pineal as hi mention is of loved in releasing melatonin it does a few other things as well but it is also considered the third eye for a couple of reasons one is that it responds to light although in humans not directly in birds and lizards and snakes they actually either have a thin skull or believe here not two holes in the top of their skull they allow light to go directly in if you look the head of a snake light can go directly in to brain through these holes and activate the panel to suppress melatonin and and control their a wakefulness sleep rhythms in birds they do not have holes in their skull but they very thin skulls and believe here not light can penetrate the thinness of those of the skull an many birds and communicates information about time of day and even time of year and that is translate into hormonal signals such as melton release from the panel and the pineal been called the third eye because it is a light sensitive organ inside the brain in humans the pineal sits deep deep deep to the surface and light cannot get in their in active light can get into your brain unless you are part of a specific experiment where that is the intention or your having nhearaw surgery or something of that sort then you have got serious issues happening that pineal sits deep deep deep near what is called the fourth vertical and it absolutely should not see light directly the idea that the panel is the third eye in humans is not true it just as intrude any time stones as though the pineal is your third eye that is not the third my center that people are referring to when they talk about meditation ow you will see a number of different a forms of art where somebody will a it will be a picture of a face and the eyes will be closes or sometimes open they will be literally a third eye a cyclops eye in the middle of the forehead that has been proposed for many thousands of years to be mustn't quote the seat of our consciousness now that is interesting because that real estate behind the forehead as she turns out to be the prefrontal quarters which we know from lesion studies and stimulation studies if you remove that branearea people become very reflective they are not thinking intentionally they do not become deliberate in fact and this is kind of an eerie result but if you inactivity you turn off the prefrontal quarter and you give somebody the opportunity to play a shooting game for instance their accuracy goes through the roof they become a century a machine they see a stimulus they shoot at they see a stimulusthy they shoot at it their accuracy is exceptional but the re ability to distinguish between enemy and friend completely disappears they become a highly effective motor or shouldst sensory motor machine but there assessment and their judgment about right or wrong completely disappears this is also true for people that have are frontal damage they often will have in appropriate behavior a hard time suppressing behaviors et camera the third i center as the seat of consciousness an our intention is something that make sense generally with what we know about the nurowscins in neurology but there is something more to it that i think is especially important for all of you that goes beyond anything about ancient traditions or panels or birds or snakes in pits in the top of the head and here is what it is the brain itself meaning the brain tissue does not have any sensory neurons what do i mean by that well if i touch the top of my hand i can feel that if i want to sense my heart beat if i work at it i can feel that if i want to sense how i feel internally at the level of my stomach is it full as it empty in my hungry is it ascetic its does at acre as it feel pleasant et camera i can sense that and that is because we have sensory neurons on our skin and in our body et camera we a save sencerenurns in our eyes that let us perceive things et eternally we have no sensor neurons on our brain this is one of the reasons why you can remove the skull and do brain surgery on somebody whose wide away and be poking around an the and they do not need any anesthetic on the brain itself they need ascetic for the incision sight but they do not need anaclitic on the brain because it has no feeling you have emotions but there is no feeling normally we are perceiving and paying attention to what we are sensing either externally sites and sounds again et reception or internally interception touch et camera but by focusing our perception are in and our attention not on our bodily surface a body scan but to a point a couple centimeters are inches behind or forehead we essentially our bringing that attentional that perceptual spotlight to a location in which there is no sensation there is nothing to feel there and when we do that by closing our eyes and focusing on that qotinquot thirdly center which is the prefrontal quarter to be quite honest when we do that something else happens and what happens is when we are not thinking about an perceiving our sensations because there are none there our thoughts and our emotions and our memories through mushroom up they more i better way to put it would be that they guise up and take on more prominence in our perception what i mean by this is that normally ism not thinking about of the contact point between me and this chair but as ism speaking ism contact with the chair and those neurons are firing but if i focus my energy and attention on them there can a fir are the same but more of my perception goes there similarly ism thinking things all the time you are too and am perceiving things all the time and ism remembering things all the time and ism anticipation things all the time about the future but by focussing my attention on the one organ for which i have no sensation that is my brain well then thoughts feelings and memories feelings meaning emotional feelings start to grow in their prominence in my awareness and in my perception and this is why when you sit down to a meditative practice if it is a meditative practice where you close your eyes or your focused on that thirdly center where you are focussed on your brain as opposed to your bodily surpass or something external to you the thoughts seem to come by in waves and they can almost be overwhelming to very hard to as it is often described just sit back and watch your thoughts go by because there are many of them i should the best way to stop thinking is to really focus on something external or to focus on sensation that is less thinking than it is perceiving senses o case do not want thus to get to abstract when people talk aby the third eye center they are not taking about the pineal the talk about present of quarter and when you direct your own attention to the very area of your brain that directs attention there is nothing to sense there the only things that will become present to you or feelings emotions that is thoughts and memories and they will often arrive in what seems to be a very disorganized faction and the reason they arrive in somewhat disorganized fashion is because normally we just do not perceive things that way normally we are splitting our attention our perception that is to multiple things our sensation and our thoughts when we put all of our perception into our thoughts we see how disorganized how wandering they are and how in fact how random and intrusive those can be again random and intrusive and much of what we talked about in that paper earlier the one where they ask people what you doing in what you feeling and how happier how unhappier you are what they discovered was that most people are sort of in their head a lot they are not really present to what they are doing which leads me to the statement that i believe at least passed on the data that paper included that most people have an interceptive by us there focus more on what is going on internally than they are focus somewhat is happening externally there are certainly people who for the opposite is true but i think that this is an issue because we here often about the need to do a meditation practise that allows us to focus inward and that we are getting yanked around by all the stressor of life et camera et camera and we are we are getting yanked around by all the stresses and demands of life but as we do that we tend to be very focused on what is happening with ought the data clearly point to the fact that being mindful in being aware can enhance one's l even of presence and happiness but we can go far are to say that being mindful and aware of what is happening not just with us but external to us in our median anviremen that includes what other people are saying and doing that also can really enhance our sense of well being and happiness least that is what the date a point to let us briefly recap where we have been far were talked a little bit about the brain networks that are activated during meditation which include prefrontal cartel a c c the insula welsh talked about the difference between interception and exterreception and the importance of accessing where you are along that continuum and i should mention of course that you can be right in the middle of that continuum you might sit down to do meditation and find that you are smacdab in the middle of being able to attend to things outside of you but also attending to things inside of you in which case i suggest going a meditation that is either extereceptive bias or interceptive bias but as i mentioned earlier if you find that you are more quintic in your head or in your body well then focus on an extrareceptive bad meditation to build up that said of circuits whereas if you are more extrareceptively focused at any given moment well then i encourage you to do an interoceptively focused meditation practice and as i mentioned earlier there's this issue of how long to do a practice there lot of different at on these but some of the practices we have covered on this pots before when we had guess for instance high lighted the thirteen minute meditation that doctor pennies puke from new york universities laboratory has popularized and they popularized it because they have a wonderful paper the we will provide a link to which shows that a daily thirteen minute meditation which is of the traditional thirdly interoceptively bias focus on breathing and focus on that location directly behind one's forehead or both that meditation done daily for about eight weeks maybe shorter but in that study eight weeks greatly improved mood improved ability to sleep improved cognitive ability and focus memory a huge number of metrics were looked at very specifically that is a terrific one and you may be asking yourself do you need to do the full thirteen minutes could you get away with five minutes or three minutes when my laboratory has shown benefits in stressroduction improvement in sleep et camera with a five minute at a meditation however in thing to establish how long you should meditate i would ask yourself a couple of questions first of all what is a practice that you can do consistently and by consistently that does not necessarily mean every day if you answer the question about consistency honestly and you find that you can only do one meditation session per week well then i would encourage you to go a little bit longer may be ten or fifteen minutes may been thirty minutes again understanding that you are going to after refocus repeatedly throughout that meditation regardless of whether not your focusing on internal perceptions or external perceptions if however you can set aside five or ten or fifteen minutes per day and you can meditate every day ill then i think you have a bit more flexibility in terms of how long you meditate may be its three minutes one day one minute the next day ten minutes the next and on and forth just with exercise the key component is consistency and this is born out in all the data that is covered and altered traits it is also born out in all the recent studies that come out since that book was published consistency is key ask yourself what you can do consistently and also do not necessarily burden yourself with always having to do the same amount or duration of meditation earlier we decided we were going to parse or fine slice the meditation practise and indeed we have bending that we have talked abut interceptive horses ex receptive bus and we have been talking about where you place your perception or your focus another key component of meditation is the pattern of breathing that you embrace in fact the pattern of breathing that you embrace during your meditation practise kin itself be its own form of meditation what do i mean by that well these days we hear a lot about breastwork breastwork has really grown in popularity in the last five ten years and their number reasons for that first of all think we need to credit whimhoff for can we call him i think appropriately the great which you know certainly there were people befoul whim who were doing deliberate breath work and talking about deliberate breath work but it was really about two thousand and fifteen or that whimhoff started to grow in recognition an popularity for a particular style of breathing which in the laboratory we call cyclic preventilation i know there are other names for it that come from ancon traditions he named it or people named after him a whim from off am whimhoff for those of you that do not know is a watchman who is known to hold many world records for deliberate cold exposure including swimming under icebergs long as period of time a buried an ice up to his neck et camera but whose also expert in the use of breathing in particular ways in order to manage and maneuver through those challenges and he started speaking about different patterns of breath work in particular the use of cyclicly preventilation deep deliberate breathing big nails exhales big entails exhales in the laboratory again we can that cyclicly preventilation it is very clear from studies both done on whim specifically but on the general population as well by my lab and other labs that that pattern of syclicye preventilation o deliberately breathing deeply and repetitively typically through the nose out through the mouth generates a lot of a adrenaline or causes a adrenaline release from the brain and body it quoting beats up the body indeed it raises body temperature but deliberation of a adrenaline does a number of things to shift the state of the brain and body that more or less is what whimhoff breathing is although hiphop breathing or some people would all it tumobreathing or cyclic preventilation is not a pattern of breathing typical of most meditations that have been discussed at least not in the research literature o the not to say the cyclic preventilation cannot be incorporated into a meditation practise but ripoff breathing a c syclichyperoventilation tumor is typically considered its own practice ora its own breastwork practise divorced from meditation it might have a meditative component but it is not often discussed as meditation or is part of meditation more typically a meditation practise involves slowing ones breathing and this could be in the form of cyclic breathing of inhale exhale inhale exhale which is cyclic or in some cases doubling up on inhales and then exhaling whale inhale exile inhalehanhale exile or controlling the duration of inhale breathhold exhale breathhold repeat called to breathing where the inhale the hold the exile and the hold are of equivalent durations any number of different breathing patterns slow cyclic breathing box breathing a cadence of three a sic seconds in holding for two seconds and seven seconds out regardless of what cadence of breathing one uses there is a tendency during most meditative practises to slow ones breathing and or control one's breathing in deliberate faction this is essential because when we default our breathing that is when we do not pay attention to how long we are inhaling relative to our exhales when we do not deliberately exhale that is normally we just passively exhale but we actively inhale i repeat that normally when we are not thinking about breathing we deliberately inhale there is a a motor command that sent to inflate belongs and then we passively exhale but in many breastwork practices or meditation practices we actually actively exhale as well we when we do that a number of things happen first of all it forces us into interception why because the diaphragm the muscle that helps in move the long's essentially and create a specific cadence of breathing or depth of breathing as one would with box breathing or deliberately slow breathing well that muscle resides inside of us and when we focus on our breathing more often than not we are not focused on the actual air loathing our naval passages or mouth may be a little bit but more typically we are force to focus or we just default to focusing on the movements of our diaphragm or of our belly or the rising and falling of our chest all that is to say that by deliberately focusing on our breathing we shift to interception breathing and specific patterns of breathing serve a long for the ride in meditation but the reverse can also be said that when we focus on our breathing we shift to interception and away from external events does it mean we cannot still pay attention into external events we can still exterecept but at least some portion of our perception of our attention shifts to interception we of course need to breathe to stay alive now we have to breathe at least every often in order to stay alive of course breathing is part of any meditative practice just its part of any living activity even sleep but if the first component of meditation is to direct our perception in a deliberate way using that prefrontal quarter to a specific location either on the surface of or within our body or external to our body or both but typically one or the other then we can say that the second element of a meditative practice is the pattern of breathing and we can ask ourselves can it and should it be deliberate or not an other s to we just default to however we happen to be breathing or should it be deliberate that is should we be controlling the depth and the cadence and i do believe that based on what we know about the capacity for specific patterns of breathing to shift our brain state that controlling one's pattern of breathing during meditation can be enormously useful and that is true regardless of whether or not one is focusing on interceptive perceptions within our body or exterreceptive perceptions that raises the question how shall we breathe during meditation well there is again no simple one size fits all rule there but there are some general rules of respiration physiology that can help us access and develop a meditation practice that is going to best serve our goals and since this is not an episode all about respiration and we will do one but i simply want to give you the basics of what respiration can do to shift your brain and body state before i do that however i want to give a very specific instruction which is when you sit down to meditate or if your going to o your meditation walking that is fine too i should to say when you are about to begin your meditative practice you need to ask yourself a question do you want to be more relaxed then you are at present or do you want to be more alert then you are at present when you exit the meditation practice do you want to calm down or do you want to become more alert simple question you can decide from session to session you can even switch within a session but just as you need to assess whether r not you are leaning more interoceptively or extra receptively you also need ask yourself do you need to calm down or want to calm down or do you want to be more alert at the end of your meditation session or may be u want to go into a state of deep relaxation and then exit with more alertness the way to do that is very simple using breastwork and specific patterns of breathing and here is the general rule that is supported by all the respiration physiology that i am aware of ism over simplifying here but i am over simplifying intentionally see can simply apply the tool and then as mention before we will do an episode all about respiration physiology in the future essentially if your inhales a longer end or more vigorous than your exhales then you will tend to be more alert or you will shift your brainbody towards a state of more alertness the hi simply based on the way that the nerve circuits the prebotsing your nucleus and the trifacial nuclear that govern respiration physiology and alertness simply the way they work that communicate with brainaireas that release nor a adrenalin nor epinefferan et camera in contrast if you emphasize longer duration end ore more vigorous exhales relative to your inhales you will tend to relax more you attend to calm your nervous system now you might be saying oka i understand what it is to make an inhale longer than my exhale but how do i make it more vigorous what simply means drawing more are into your lungs more quickly then you allow yourself to exhale that air an example of inhale biased breath work would be there is an active emphasis on the inhale and it is a little bit longer than the exhale which is passive conversely if you want to relax then you want to extend your exhales relative to your inhales and you come even make them active exhales t can be inhale exhale that is going to shift your nervous system in a direction of more calm end of course if you would to stay at the level of alertness a c a calmness because those are two sides of the same semester the same continuum if you to be right where your at at the end of your meditation as where you started at least in terms of levels of alertness and calmness well then you would just keep your inhales in your exhales relatively balanced in terms of duration now the introduction of things breath holds with box breathing or wimhoff breathing typically it is twenty five or thirty deep inhale exhales deep inhale exhales and then exhale all your air hold your breath for fifteen to sixty seconds and then repeat and on sometimes some inhales and holds well that is a whole business into itself but forsake of meditation the anything to understand is that if you are going to do a complicated breathing practise it will by design by necessity shift much of your attention to the breathing practice especially if it is not sick if it is not inhales follow exhales simply breathing is where inhales always follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales shy relies on a specific brain center call the prebouhtsinyour complex discovered by jack freedmen at you sale a he was a guest on this podcast previously however if you are doubling up on your inhales to inhales and then an hail a pattern of breathing my laboratory is studied extensively well then that relies on a different brain center the trifacial nucleus the point is that if you are engaging in nonsicklic breathing or you are deliberately emphasizing inhales or exhales or the vigor of inhale and expelled et camera well then some portion of your attention will be devoted to making sure that you follow that breathing practise we are very good at going into picnic breathing practice is by default them our attention can drift to other things interceptive or extereceptive does not matter we can just drift into how our body feels or something we see or here in the room et camera when we are focused on our breathing and the breathing pattern is nonsicklic or complex in some way in that it involves deliberate voluntary commands again from those call top down mechanisms of the prefrontal quarter well that by design require some portion often a significant a portion of our attention to be devoted to the breathing practice itself what does this mean this means that breath work itself can be a form of meditation and meditation can involve breath work but one should know that the more deliberate and unnatural that pattern of breathing is the less you will be able to focus on other things now this is not necessarily a bad thing you can actually leverage's for instance if you are somebody whose very much laughing your own head right we talkie by this earlier you happen to be order your in a moment where you aerially stuck in your hand you one get out of your head well then that meditation practice that you do really should be focus on next receptive by us you shouldreally focus on something external to you and i would encourage you to use a natural sickly pattern of breathing where inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales if however you are finding that your sort of caught in the landscape of things happening around you and you want to ground yourself as it sometimes call that's a loos e language not a scientific language i know there is this practice of grounding and that is the whole thing people always writing to me is is grounding a real thing walking barefoot on the earth and magnetic fields and and gravitational feels gravities real but grounding there is an a lot of science for it to be frank am does feel nice to walk on the ground however but if you are somebody whose and feeling pulled out of yourself a lot or in a moment and you want to bring your awareness into your body and for calm down will then i would encourage you to yes use a deliberate somewhat unnatural or non default pattern of breathing which by definition will force you to attend to what is going on intereceptively yen ism not aware of any place that this has been discussed in detail such as this before if there is a a a research literature on this please let me know my laboratory's been working on the extensively ism always looking for new colleagues and collaborators a we we meaning doctor avid spell whose an expert and hypnosis again who is been e a guessed on the human lampas and my colleague it stay for psychiatry parties are society char of psychiatry world expert and hypnosis he is been on this podcast before we have a active re search program focused on these issues we are very much of the belief that a breastwork practise itself can be meditative a meditation practice can include breathing but the more that that meditate practise focuses on the breathing itself the more interceptive biased it will be now it is very important understand that an interceptive biased breastwork practise we will have a specific effect which is to make you more in perceptively aware and if you think back to earlier in the episode for many people that will be a wonderful thing and something that they are actively seeking or ought to seek because it can help people gain awareness for instance if you know if there stress and there not realizing it till the end of the day there just exhausted more interceptive awareness throughout the day can be very beneficial if however you are somebody who is overly focussed on your bodily sensations will then more exteraceptive awareness is important and this brings us to a yet larger theme but a theme that i think really emphasizes what particular types of meditative practices are going to be best for certain people especially people who are using meditation to combat certain challenges in particular mood base challenges or sleep base challenges or focus base challenges i have enlisted off all the plosive benefits of meditation yet in this episode but they are many many many in fact there are now tens of thousands of scientific studies showing for instances there are known benefits of doing meditation for enhancing sleep there are known benefits of a regular meditation practice for enhancing focus there are known benefits of a regular meditation practice for reducing in lavatory sitokinds even improving outcomes in cants or reducing pain improving mood reducing the symptoms of aged it and clinically diagnose achy and on and on and on and again rather than focus on all those beautiful studies to day which all basely point to the fact that some meditation practise done regularly even of its very brief has tremendous even outside benefits on our health even relative to some drug treatments that is been shown rather than focus on all that have been more focused on what sorts of brain body changes occur when we do a meditation practice and perhaps more importantly what really constitutes a meditation practice we have this thing about a continuum of perception we also now are talking about breathing the there's a other component that i to raise now which we could say is the third major component if the first one that i raise twas interaceptiverses extroceptive bus or continuum second being breathing is it going to be default or deliberate breathing is giving natural cadets or unnatural cadets again know right or wrong it just depends on what your goal is there is a third component this is a component again that has not really been formalized in the literature but that doctor spigolnayar working hard to formalize an through some research and ism through an upcoming review that we will provide links to once its out and the at a separate continuum which is the continuum between interception and dissociation now all of what interception is but most people probably do not know or do not realize what dissociation is often we here about dissociation sometimes called disassociation some people pronounce it dissociation guess what despite being corrected many times for each of those pronunciations i checked with my colleagues who are experts in dissociation or disassociation guess what there the same thing tomato tomato potato potato i am going to say dissociation some people say disassociation i disassociate other people say i dissociate one both of those refer to essentially the same thing dissociation is often talked about in the context of a negative event and indeed dissociation is unfortunately or i should say is adaptively associated with dramatic events in particular violent or sexual drama people report feeling out of body or out of the experience during the experience or during a recollection of the experience dissociation has also been described in terms of people who are in a dramatic accentor they see one killed right in front of them first responders will talk about dissociating when they arrive on a seen i do not want a provide gruesome imagery here cause i know people can be pretty pensive to this but you know chowing up on a i the scene of a car crash and jockeying carnage are incredible damage to to bodies or thissort of thing dissociation lies at the opposite end of a continuum with interception now earlier i said that interception is on the opposite end of a continuum with extereception but it also is on the opposite end of a continuum with dissociation we can provides some better definitions perhaps to make this crystal clear and here i martin reading comment upcoming review i feel comfortable rein from it because of an author on the review but none the less interception refers to a process by which your nervous system meaning your brain and connections with your body senses interprets integrates and regulate signals originating from within the body and thereby provides momentomoment mapping of your internal landscape at both a conscious and unconscious level get that is a lot of words to describe basically the process of perceiving what is happening at the level of the surface of yourciin or inward dissociation can be thought of as the opposite of interception it is a lack of bodily awareness or a removal of one's conscious experience from one's bodily experience and awareness again this is most often talked about in the contacts of something dramatic but really if we think about health and mental health and physical health the optimal place to reside on the continuum between interception and dissociation is somewhere in the middle we do not want to be dissociated from life experiences but we also do not want everything that happens in the world to profoundly impact our heart rated in our breathing would be yanked around by every experience and there are instances in which being yanked around or pulled into an experience is something that we desire in want seeing a move that we want to see or for insane clinical hypnosis or a falling in love a wonderful experiences and sometimes also sad experiences right being able to feel one's feelings depending on life's events is important but being too dissociated or being too feeling that is feeling much in response to everything that happens is also problematic there are certain people for instance that have challenges with what is called narrative distancing that is they see someone in a move getting hit and they almost flinch as if they are getting hit they see some one who scared or happy in a move and they feel scared or happy in a way that seems there along for the ride a little b too much this is important because what it speaks to is the ability for that member way beck to begin the episode that a c see that inter singular quarter and the insula we got a prefrontal quarter that can say hey let us be rational that move that person whose happy or sad that person in your environment whose breaking down crying yes there sad is important to be sympathetic may been empathic towards them but let us not get pulled into the experience much that we lose ourselves and then of course their air is of your brain that are also leaning on and here ism using metaphor but there leaning on the insulanac we and saying hey there somebody the hereabout that is upset ism also going to be upset or somebody i care about as happy ism also going to be happier their starts ism also going to be scared it is a pushball between our recognition that we are each distinct entities end also of course the very healthy desire to be attached to others experiences and the experiences around us why my raising yet another continuum right we already have the one continuum of interceptive enter captive awareness well if we want to think about how meditation can serve our mental health and our ability to focus there is a very particular mental model that we can arrive at that incorporates this interceptive dissociative continuum again if you are extremely interoceptor your feeling everything in your body and those feelings in your body nearly completely account for all of your experience if your that far into the continuum and the dissociative end of things you can see what is going on you can react to what is going on but your bodily response to that is essentially shut down you can either be paralyze shut down icon of no movement or you could still be engaging in behaviors but your dissociated again sadly this is often what victims of drama report that they are able to just go through the motions but jo shut off their motions or their emotions just shut off they are not feeling the elevated heart rat or breathing sometimes they can even be quite scared but they are not even perspiring you showing any signs of autonomic arousal that is fright or stress or panic let us talk about this model of interception and dissociation and then a meditative practice that can be used to try and anchors at the right location or the healthy location along that continuum let us first imagine the ideal mental health state and here i want to acknowledge nobody achieves or at least maintains this mental help state once you do imagine that where you are along this interceptive to dissolve of continuum is a talebearing or yet you represent a sphere that can rollback and forth along the continuum at one end you have pure interception you are just feeling everything at the other en you are completely dissociated well in this one version of the of mental health we take that continuum and we fold up the sides that it looks a v one on one end you have interception the other and you have dissociation i realize a number people listening to this not watching this on motives of the cancel that my hands are now the heel my hands are together the fingers of my hands are apart it looks a v and you are a talebearing your state is a talebearing at the base of that you are in a trench of perfectly balanced interception and dissociation you can feel things you can register what is going on in the outside world but your feelings are not overwhelmed or overtaken by what is happening the outside world you are in a perfect place of being able to make rational decisions and yet still feel your feelings would not that be lovely when that be lovely if we could be that whenever we wanted to and frankly nobody is that all the time more typically the model of mental health and mood and well being and perception of self verses others and internal versus external states is one of more of a you a you shape where at one end we have interception and at the other end we have dissociation and it is kind of you shaped and your state is more or less a talebearing at the base of that you that can it gets push from side to side maybe your your heart races a little bit because of something bad or good and that blaring shifts towards interception will bet more n you notice that your heart is racing or perhaps at any given moment your mind drifts a little bit while watching a move or while talking to your partner or while your child is complaining about something and you are think about something else and that barbering shifts towards the dissolve of state of obit that is a mild form of dissociation and i think most people degree that being mentally healthy would involve this kind of you shaped novelists well where it is kind of can shift back and forth but it is not extreme you are not going from into receptive bias all the way to dissociated in any kind of extreme way the ballbaring stays down you are the base of that you then of course their states that we all frankly go into from time to time where the continuum of interception and dissociation is essentially flat where you are a talebearing at one location or another depending on whether not your watching a move that your very engrossed in or you are in a conversation with or in an activity with your partner or friend et camera that you very engrossed may be matching their state right there number of states you can imagine we are matching one state is actually healthy and good and then there a number of conditions in life and situations in life where being match to some one ease's condition lie your getting yelled at and they are angry that you are getting angry and then pretty soon you are not in the best place along that continuum and i think that for many people they find themselves somewhere along that continuum and a number of practice is including meditation including exercise including getting a good night sleep including therapy including journalling including just doing activities social engagement that you enjoy are designed to sort of bring up the edges of that flat continuum into more of a you or concave shape that that talebearing meaning your state of a awareness and your state of feeling your own feelings verse is paying attention to what it is going on around you is somewhere again bias toward the middle by curling up the edges of that continuum on either end it biases that state toward the middle and then of course there is the extreme that i think almost everybody would agree is more less pathologic which is one in which that continuum is no longer shaped a deep trench a v it is not shaped a you it is not flat with the edges curled up a love bit or even flat it is actually now convex it looks a mountain shape a peak and that little talebearing at the top can either drop all the way to one side of pure interception just feeling beyond any ability to pay attention to anything else just feeling one's feelings being angry being sad being or even happy right being extremely happy or manic that you cannot pay attention to the fact that it is totally out of context you rite in appropriate for what is going on around you or dropping to the other side of the continuum where you are dissociated that you are not engaged with what is going around you you are truly cotunchecked out that shape is one that i think almost all clinicians if not all clinicians and most people would say is pathologic because you are either completely checked out or you are completely absorbed in what is going on within you or around you that mental model that i just created is a simple mental model it is by no means exhaustive but it does incorporate a lot of what we think about when we think about mental health and we talk about the ability to be mentally stable to feel one's feelings but to still be actively engage to what is happening around us and again it is a continuum that stands from interceptive awareness to dissociation where the extremes are pathologic and somewhere in the middle is healthier and then there are practices that by us us toward being in the middle by default what are those practices well we know for sure that being sleep deprived for instance tends to take us away from that trench shape or u shape continuum or even flat continuum and starts to make that continuum more convex it taste tends to make us either feel were completely checked out and exhausted or that we are completely lay bile we are yanked around by whatever experience is happening we are just not able to manage sleep is as i always say the fundamental or foundational layer of mental health physical health and performance because it tends to put us in a healthier place that is when we are getting enough quality sleep consistently it tends to put us in the middle of that continuum sleep deprivation does exactly the opposite it pulls us apart whence they pulls us apart that is not a real term what it does is it tends to make that continuum less concave right less bull shaped and more confects more hill shaped if not a peak mount in shape where it drops us to one side or the other in addition a meditative practice done regularly because it can allow us to become more interreceptively aware or it can allow us to become more extereceptively aware which is really just another form of dissociation again dissociation is in always bad provided not at the extreme a meditative practice can actually teach us to deliberately move along this continuum this something again that has not been discussed a whole lot in the literature it is been discussed i should say in pieces in different literature if you look in the clinical psychiatry literature there is a a wonderful collection of studies and reviews that will say that interceptive awareness is terrific except for the person that is ware of their internal functioning that they are not able to engage in the world similarly you will find a beautiful literature research and clinical literature that will say that dissociation is terrible in the case of roman in fact it can put people in positions of repeating a behavior over and over that is damaging to them but because they can disengage or their dissociated from it that they continue the behavior or dissociation can be very adaptive and beneficial if it allow us people for instance it create some narrative distancing they are not getting pulled indexer argument or if some one screams at them they do not necessarily think that it is their fault they are able to say hey wait you use the prefrontal quartan away just because rope set does not mean that i did something wrong let us look at the the he evidence rationally we in thinking about the positive effects of meditation on mood their two aspects that are important the first on we talked about earlier which is being present to one's ex evidence correlates with increase happiness having your mind wander having your default mode network be one of mind wandering actually is correlated with being more unhappy that was the earlier study that we talked about that study published in science now of course meditation can make us more present but if we do not pay attention to whether or not we are becoming more present to interception or exterreception that is to interception or dissociation and we do not payitention to whether not or bias is one of dissociation verses in terraception we do not know where we are on the continuum well then the meditation actually can make things worse not better in other words of your somebody who has a tremendous amount of interceptive awareness well then meditating on your internal state may not be good and actually the some evidence that it may actually be bad ill give you one little tiny example a talked about this previously the possess but in that very study from when he sezukis lap showing that thirteen minute a meditation is beneficial for focus mood et camera it is also very clear that for a number of people that do that typical third my meditation for thirteen minutes a day if they do that too close to sleep or when they want to go to sleep they have a hard time falling asleep which makes perfect sense because they are becoming more intereceptively aware they are camping up their level of focus a meditation practise typically is a focus and refocus practice and falling asleep involves turning off your thoughts and your focus and focusing purely on sensation and then your thoughts can a fragment and you drift oft to sleep this is why am a big fan of using non sleep deep least or yoganedra we will provide lings to nonslip deep least in yoganedro protocols have talked about them on the podcast before but those protocols are not meditation person they tend to to have people de focus they are anti focus practices whereas meditation tends to be a focus in practice along those lines a meditation practise that is one that is extereceptively bias where you focus on things that are outside your body can be wonderful for somebody who tends to focus too much on their inner landscape and their inner narrative et camera can help get them out of their head and body which can be very beneficial but for people that are not in touch with their emotions are not in touch with how they feel it actually can drive them down the exact path that is wrong for them to day's discussions about meditation and we want to make sure that we are parsing meditation in a rational way that matches than nerd circuitry involved and more importantly for sake of practical purposes that you are asking yourselves the right question are you intereceptively or extreceptively busy do you tend to dissociate or do you tend to for of feel everything in a big way right the have heard this term of you hyper sensitive people or things that sort and yet some of the preclinical terms some of them or not but you need to access this and you alone to assess where you happen to be at on a given day y which will be dictate course by how well you slept life experience et camera this intercepted to dissociy of continuum is one that you need to address prior to any meditative practise and again the solution or the answer of what to do in response to your answer of wether not you are more inward focus or outward focus again is very simple just do the opposite of were your by as lies that is if your tilted towards interception do an exteeceptive focus practise if you are more dissociative in your that sound sort of a pejorative it that sounds bad right but again ti if you are somebody who is more focus on evince outside your body andyou want to gain more interceptive awareness and feeling state if you will well then you want to do a practice that is thirds center practise or breathing focus one of the reasons that many people meditate is that they have heard before or they have experienced that meditation can replace sleep or can reduce one's over all sleep need that is an interesting set of questions and it is one that i dove into the literature to pursue an answer to and i came up with an answer that was a frankly a little bit complicated on the face of it but boils down to some very simple protocols that i think any in all of us can leverage in order to sleep better and maybe even reduce the total amount of sleep that we need something that i think most people would want i ani realize that we all probably should enjoy sleeping i certainly do but that it is hard to get enough sleep and would to be wonderful for instance to be able to get by on a little less sleep and still feel alert and rested first of all i want to point to the recent study and the again this is one that have raised a few times and we will post a link to it am entitled brief daily meditation enhances attention memory mood and emotion regulation in non experienced mediators this is the work again from when sezuki who was a guessed on the subhuman lad podcast who is now the been of arts and sciences at new york university and as run a laboratory focus on memory for a long times a terrific nor scientist and research up and teacher et camera and was a terrific guest on the podcast i keep returning to this paper because they used many measures and they were very thorough and the results were really interesting again this is the thirteen minute a day guided meditation session i should dis mention that the control group in this study listen to a podcast for thirteen minutes that did not am improve attention memory mood emotion regulation am et camera as much as meditation did which is not to say that podcast aren't useful am i will not mention which podcast they use unfortunately it was not the superman ladpodcast of which i to think o least increases understanding of certain i see concepts of science and science base tools you are welcome to look at the paper and see which podcast they used that is a quite a well known podcast a which is an interesting podcast but it did not change the brain in any fundamental way in this thirteen minute session whereas thirteen minutes of daily meditation did and again something i mentioned earlier but very important to re emphasized now is that they mention that if people in the experiment meditated too close to bedtime they had trouble sleeping again which make sense because meditation at least in its most common form in the form used in this paper is a focusing and re focussing exercise falling sleep involves focussing less there are other studies however that have shown or that asserted rather that doing too twenty minute sessions per day of meditation can reduce the need for sleep those results are debated first of all understanding what sleep need is is very individual and determining what people can manage on meaning some people can manage to get by with six hours of sleep but would do better with eight some people would artily manage probably better in terms of focusing an alertness a they slept a littlest less because they might be waking up midway through a sleep cycle if you want to learn more about this you can check out any one of three different episodes that we have done one is master your sleep you find that it superman labor calm everything is time stamped in that episode the other is perfect your sleep and then of course we have done episodes on sleep with expert guess doctor father walker from you see barely all of those at can be found at superman labor calm an all formats through time stamped with that said this assertion that has been made many times over and certainly in the popular press that regular meditation can reduce ones over all sleep need is controversial for the following reason some groups find that indeed that is the case and the interpretation is that the stress reduction that is brought about by regular meditative practice and in this case very regular tends to be one or more typically two twenty minute per day meditation sessions that is quite a lot i think for most people yum you thingabout forty minutes is in that much time over all but very few people will stick to that twice a day twenty minute meditation practice very consistently well the ideas that the stress reduction which is clear and not debated brought about by that type of meditation practice is good at offsetting some of the coatis all increases associated with reduced sleep and leading people to be able to function cognitively physically better on reduce sleep than they would have they not been doing the meditation practice that simple way of putting this is that if people meditate regularly that is reducing stress the reduction and stress is reducing sort is all again costs allies healthy but it should be restricted early part of the day you do not want too many peaks in carts all specially not late in the day by meditating you get the healthy pattern of coatis all release you for of inoculate yourself somewhat against the unhealthy pattern of court is all release and as a consequence either the sleep that people get is deeper and or the total amount of sleep that they need is reduce now lot of people took that result and interpreted is saying well if you cannot sleep than you can just meditate one night you do not sleep or you have trouble sleeping you just meditate the next day and you will be fine certainly that is not supported by the literature however there is a practice and again it is one that have talked about on this podcast many times before but if you have not heard me talked about it this a practice called yeoganedra which literally means yoga sleep it is a practice of doing not much a focus meditation but more of a body scanfocussing on the sensation of the body and actually trying to turn off that prefrontal quartaxar reduce its activity yoganedroscripts can be found on you tore and elsewhere they are paralleled by a similar practice that have talked a lot about called an stator non sleep deepest have put one out into the world a short one that is ten minutes long you can just simply go to future and put in n sit re in my last name supermen there is one there again all of this is completely zero cost yoganedra and n sit are have been shown in a fair number of studies not as many as been done on traditional meditation or issues a thirds centered meditation or mindfulness meditation but have been shown to replenish levels of certain demodulators dopamine and reduce coatis all reduce a stress hormone at least as much and by my read of the literature significantly more than with traditional meditation and there is a nice paper that we will provide a link to which is entitled yoganedra practice shows improvement in sleep in patience with chronic and sonic randomize control trial basically the study looks at as the title suggests people with chronic insomnia although the result certainly carry over or would carry over for people who do not have in sonic the key result i believe in this paper althoughther are many is that duo salivary coatis all reducetatisically significantly after yoganedra what do i mean by that there was a statistically significant reduction in cartes a levels the stress hormone immediately after the yeoganedra practice that we believe would be paralleled by very similar if not equivalent practice of n star and stars a lot yoganedra but removes a lot of the kind of in let just call the sort of mystical language and the intentions it focus is more on the physiology and the body scans there i will not acknowledge that yoganedr has been around for thousands of years and was certainly there before an sit a also one to acknowledge that an this was brought up also in altered traits that sometimes language can be a barrier toward people embracing practices fact this was recognized by john cabal in when he created what he called mindfulness based stress reduction practices or em s are which were simply mindfulness meditation to reduce stress but he called it mb s a mindfulness based stress reduction as a way to bring it into the clinics that would otherwise perhaps be averse to something called mindfulness meditation again this gets more to the sociology and the cultural aspects than it does to any specific utility of one practice first us another here is to take away point if you want to get better at falling in staying a sleep or falling back a sleep if you wake up in the middle of the night or if you are generally challenge with sleep issues an excellent behavior a practice for which there are terrific data meaning data that show that a stresshormon corners all can be significantly reduced as well as certain a transmitters can be replenished as well as and this is key in covered in this paper that i mention a a few moments ago on yognedra that the total amount of sleep that you need can be reduced at least somewhat well then yoganedra or in instar practise done frankly any time of day is going to be beneficial whereas if your goal i believe is to increase your ability to focus to improve your mood and perhaps most importantly to be able to maneuver yourself in a deliberate way along that interceptive extra receptive or interceptive dissociative continuum that we have talked about much and to really shift your default mode network from one of being a mind wanderer to somebody who can focus and who frankly is happier well then a more traditional third eycentere type meditation or a more traditional exteroceptive focused meditation would be beneficial again which one of those you choose either focusing inward or focussing on a point outside of you again should be dictated by whether not you tend to be interreceptively pastor enter deceptively based but you want to get better at sleeping you ant to get better falling asleep and you want to replace sleep that you have lost i put that in quotes that my colleagues matheuwalker a do not a come after me with a i what would you come after we a not probably with an alarm clock and a i do not know am blankets in a pillow or something that sort am in all seriousness it is very clear that replacing sleep that we have lost is in area research that still active on on going but enestiare n yoganedra are very promising if not downright useful for replacing sleep that you have lost certainly the small amount of data that exists now point to the fact that they are not the least of which is a beautiful study published out of skin and via showing that a thirty minute yoganedra a anestyare practice can replenish levels of dopamine which puts people in a position to be more action oriented and focus et camera when they come out of the yoganedra s o certainly very useful practice it is a form of meditation we could call it meditation is but yoganedra and ensnare not typically what people think about when we talk about meditation of course this is an episode about meditation the reason i bring up yoganedra and enestiars that many people meditate to enhance their sleepability to reduce their total amount of sleep need it appears that meditations probably not ideal for that in comparison to yoganedra an anestyare but meditation is excellent if not superb for adjusting the default mode network toward more happiness by being more mindful and present and for placing oneself in that healthy model of interceptive dessociatesive continual we covered a lot of information and i to think that have given you some we decisions to make in developing a meditative practice the most important one of course being what will you do regularly and maybe your somebody who just answers that question by saying look ism not going meditate regularly i just want to do the thing that is can allow me to feel rested when ism tired and is going to allow me to adjust my state of mind when ism not where i want to be for whatever reason too anxious or too exhausted et camera and for those people i would say a practise anestiare yoganedra will be immensely beneficial as will a more traditional form of meditation i also want just remind everybody that an a that guides meditation also with some information and some intention setting such as the waking up a from say hers can be immensely beneficial have certainly found it to be beneficial i no millions of other people have as well encourage you to check that out we talked about determining where you are on these continual of interception an extereception in order to dictate what particular type of meditation practice you should do in a given moment whether not you should focus your vision inward with eyes close or focus your vision an your attention outward being a key component whether not you should do cyclic breathing which will allow your focus to be off your breathing somewhat easier than if you do nonsyclic breathing if your doubling up on it infills or exiles whether not your breathings can be natural or not and of course you need to determine whether not your meditation practise is design to enhance your level of focus or to relax you i would say that if it is design to enhance your level of focus that does not necessarily mean that it will not be relaxing you could do locate and breathing thiamine meditation con be very relaxing and yet it is a focus and refocus practise wresonlimat yyoganedra and an as tare is going to be more along the lines of replenishing yourself replacing sleep that you've lost or maybe even reducing your sleep need on previous podcassive talked about hypnosis an prettier the episode would doctor davits beagle a associate share of psychiatry i do not wan to get into hypnosis now but just understand that hypnosis is distinct from breath work from yoganedra from exist yare en from meditation even though it include some of those components focusing your attention it involves actually directing your visual attention outward an inward to go into the hypnosis and involves some breathing of a particular kind involves a specific imagery et camera but hypnosis is distinct because hypnosis is really design to fix or address a specific problem whereas meditation and stare yoganedra et camera typically or not they can help fix problems such as anxiety sleep issues et camera but they generally or not directed toward a particular line of thinking they can be but typically they are not whereas hypnosis almost always especial in the clinical contacts not stateshypnosis but the clinical contact for which there is a lot of research to show can for instance help with quitting smoking at literally a quadrupling of the effectiveness for smoking cessation with something the reversal then if people just trying go cold turkey or for reducing in sonic or for reducing pain or for any number of things including drama at camera hypnosis is really great at dealing with specific issues and problems and tackling nose meditation tends to be focussed on other things no pone intended i musing some of you are probably wandering where to start or if you are already an avid meditator where to go with all this information for that reason i just one to offer you a particular form of meditation that in corporate all of the features that have talked about up until now in a single meditation practice and it is a meditation practice that for lack of a better name i called s t b or space time bridging and the time component has to do with a very simple fact which is when we focus our attention visual tension or otherwise on things close to her within our body we tend to be fine slicing time you could sort of think of your breath as more or less the second hands on your clock of existence whereas when we tend to focus one things far away from us we tend to parse or carve up time with in bigger bins you have ever seen of a explain flying at a distance it looks it is moving very very slowly if you were right up next to that airoplaying it is probably going five or six under mouths an hour would go by very quickly this is not a coincidence believe it are not how you slice the time domain of your life and your experience has everything to do with your vision and the closer things are the more finely you slice of time the more closely your attention is placed on yourself the more closely use slice up time if you focus your visual attention very far or you think about the other side of the world for instance and you in vision that will then your actually slicing time more broadly i hopefully that make sense fine slicing would be slow motion higher frame rate looking in the distance your actually taking bigger time ben even though things look they are moving more slowly it is because your fidelity your precision of measuring time is actually not as good as as if you are only have the hour's hand on the clock it seems it moves very slowly homely that make sense to you there is a meditation practice that i call space time bridging that in corporate everything that have talked about today it balances interception and extra reception it balances interception and dissociation and it crosses the various time domains that the brain can in compass using vision and it is a very simple meditation it is one that have been doing for years and it is one that restring to do some research on but ism just can a share with you because i think it is actually quite fun and can be quite in formative in fact a people have told me that it can even lead to some interesting insights both during the meditation and be and outside the meditation it is very simple what you do i deal youwould do this outside or at a window but what you do is you essentially close your eyes and i can do the s now i can close my is o do the meditation but it'll describe it you close your eyes and you focus your attention either on your thirdly center your breathing and you try and put one hundred percent of your perceptual awareness on to your breathing or your third eye center for the duration of three breaths canso your one hundred percent or trying to be one hundred percent in interception then you open your eyes you focus on the surface of your body some place i find that a holding out my hand at him arms distance and focussing on the palm of my hand and focussing there visually ism splitting my attention now between my hand and ism also going to pay attention to my breath for the duration of three full nails and emails while also focussing on my hands or your splitting interception next reception as best you can about fifty fifty then you subsequently look at some location in your immediate environment maybe ten fifteen feet away and you focus your attention on that location while also splitting your attention that your still paying attention your breathing you do that for the duration of three breaths but now you are in extreareception and interception then you focus your attention at some distance further away me with a furthest distance you coffee now this is why it is useful to do out of a window or on a balcony or outdoors you focus on the furthest point may be a horizon some furthest point for the duration of three breaths while also paying attention to your breathing and for of imagine a bridge between the two if you if you find it to be challenging to focus on both and then and this is where it can be a little tricky but then what you actually focus on is the fact and this is not an imaginary thing this is a fact that you are a tiny speck on this big ball that is floating out in space right a the earth that is floating out in space and you try in focus on your three breaths while also acknowledging that you are a small body literally on this very seemingly large body the earth but that is floating in a much larger larger passive place the universe and you do that for three breaths and then you close your eyes and you go right back into interception and you might want a and you do that for three breaths you focus on your interception for three breaths and you might want a march through these different locations if you times or back and forth if you but typically i will just do it for one segment at pure interception palm of hand some distance in front of me horizon whole globe universe thing back in to body et camera my is this useful why would this be useful who is it at all interesting or is this just some crazy idea will t the reason it is useful i believe is that it has you deliberately step your awareness your perception through every position along that interceptive extereceptive continuum now i did say to remain connected to as they will say in the yoga classes aware of i guess would be the more scientific a way to state it aware of one's breath but if you wanted you could actually try and put your aware ness completely outside yourself but most people will find that challenging to do if there already paying attention to their breath is just hard to do i find easier to split my awareness from interception to enter reception but by stepping through these different locations and then deliberately placing your perception your weariness back into pure interception what you do as you essentially are practicing or exercising this incredible ability that the human mind has to deliberately place your perception at specific locations along the interceptive extereceptive continuum and i think this is very useful because many of us including myself tend to get locked at one location along that continuum for instance if you are scrolling your phone for a long period of time you may forget about your bodily sensations but you generally forget about other things going on in the world or if your very focus somethings out in the world you often times can forget about your internal sensations and what is going on internally and being functional in work in life in relationship in in all aspects including your ability to fall asleep involve stepping yourself along these different locations which again are notjust physical locations of third is center or your breathing or your hand or horizon those are just stations within space but remember each one of those just by way of how your visual system and the time domain a interlocked with one another sets your mind in a particular time domain and much of what involves being a functional human being involves dynamically adjusting our attention from what we are doing on our computer to a question somebody asks and then back again or from ten messaging to listening to lecture or a podcast or from listening to e lecture a podcast and then going back into a mode of commuting but making that commute either relaxing or may be to work on your commute or connect with family or friends et camera much of the fatigue of life and the i should say the maladaptive behaviors and emotions that show up in life are really not about any set of behaviors a emotions being wrong or right but rather inappropriately match to the space time domain that wherein which again as just fancy nursed speak for saying being present in being mindful is a wonderful by product of a meditation practice but it is but one of those stations along that peacetime continuum the key element here is to step yourself through a practice deliberately that you are flexibly and dynamically able to engage in conversation then disengage and focus or focus and then disengage from the work your focusing on and actually have a conversation or be in the world and move out of that interceptive awareness to one in which you are dynamically engaged with the things around you i realize this might sound a little but vague for that reason i encourage you not to think about it too much but rather to try the practice see if it works for you if it does not that is fine i think it is e good one for people that find that a third my center or breathing focus and perceptive meditation might be enjoyable to them or very beneficial to them but they might want to try something new an other people might find that that tends to put them too much in their own head i think it also ought to be very useful for people that tend to be overly extereceptive more in the dissociative end of the continuum and need to bring in a bit more of interceptive awareness but either cannot do that or uncomfortable doing that because there simply not interested in or comfortable with feeling much of their internal state because that can neither be overwhelming of this just simply not the way they want to feel now as we round up i do on to acknowledge that there are an enormous number of rooms within the house or rather i should say within the castle that is meditation including for instance intention setting and contras and an enormous number of different features of meditation practices that we simply did not have time to go into end or for which the research on is not completely ironed out yet for that reason in future episodes not long from now i am going tore sitting down with experts in meditation that include aura scientists and clinicians but other experts on meditation that certainly reversed in those topics and where they cannot point to specific research studies can certainly point us toward the utility of things montes and intentions as they relate to getting the most out of a meditative practice i eagerly await those conversations and i hope you will join me for those as well if your learning from end or en going this podcast please subscribe to our u tube channel

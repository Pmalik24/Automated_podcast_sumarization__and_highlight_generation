welcome to the ubermanlasciencescience pace to i minder superman and om r professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is eff cavalier eff cavalier holds a master of science and physical therapy and is a certified straight and conditioning s pectiualist he did his training at the university of connecticut stores one of the topside programs in the world in physical therapy and sports medicine i discovered eff cavalier over ten years ago from his online content his online content includes information about how to train for strength how to train for hypertrophy which is muscle growth how to train for endurance as well as how to rehabilitate injuries to avoid muscular in balances nutrition and supplementation have always found his content to be incredibly science paced incredibly clear sometimes surprising and always incredibly actionable it is therefore not surprising that he has one of the largest online platforms for fitness nutrition supplementation and injury rehabilitation eff has also worked with an enormous number of professional athletes and has served as head physical therapists and assistants straincoach for the new york gets again the content that eff cavalier has posted on line has been immensely useful to me over the years that i was absolutely thrilled to get the chance to sit down with him and ask him about everything from how to train in terms of how to split up the body parts that you train across the week how to integrate straight training and endurance training when to stretch how to stretch indeed we talked about nutrition we talk of it about supplementation we talk about how to really avoid creating in balances in muscle and in curl control over muscle one thing that is rally wonderful about eff as he really has an understanding of nachos how muscles and bones and tendons and ligaments work together but how the nervous system interfaces with those we talked abut the mental side of training including when to bring specific concentration to the muscles that your training and when to think more about how to move weights through space and think more about the movements over all ism certain that you will find the conversation that we held to be immensely useful and informative for your fitness practices and also for how you mentally approach fitness in general and how to set up a lifelong fitness practise one that will give you the strength that you desire one that will give you the aesthetic results that you desire one that will set you up for endurance and cardiovascular health basely an overall fitness program i really feel this is where eff cavalier shines above and beyond many of the other pities and fitness called influences that are out there again everything is grounded in science everything is clear and everything is actionable and while we do cover an enormous amount of information during to day's episode if you want to dive even deeper into that information you can go to alley next stop come where you will find some of jiff's programs you can also find him at they next on you tore there you will find videos for instance how to re air or heel from lower back pain something that i actually followed directly long before i ever met get has over thirty two million views and that is not by accident is because the protocols there again are surprising and actionable they relieved my backpack very quickly without surgery someimmensely grateful for that content and it extends into everything from again hypertrophy endurance and straits training and on again it is they next stop calm as the website they necks on you tube and also they necks on instugram the superman ladpodcast is proud to announce that we have partnered with momentous supplements we done that for several reasons first of all the quality of their supplements is exceedingly his second of all we wanted have a location where you could find all of the supplements discussed on the supermen lad podcast in one easy define place you can now find that place at livemomentous do calm slash supermen in addition momentous supplements ship internationally something that a lot of other supplement company simply do not do that is terrific whether not you live in the us or you live abroad right now not all of the supplements that we discussed on the suberin ladpodcast are listed but that catalogue of supplements is being expanded very rapidly and a good number of them that we have talked about some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus and other aspects of mental and physical health are already there again you can find them at libomentousto calm slash supermen before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and sines related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve son delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all f my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without let greens tit get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stop come slash supermen and claim a special offer the will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of data now showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k two is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fie free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and n thing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have take many times before on this pod cast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that you are getting the preparations of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element e dot calm slash huberment and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element e dot calm slash superman and now for my discussion with eff cavalier eff such a pleasure for me to have you here ism glad to be hers amazing give a long time consumer of your content have learned a tremendous amount about fitness both in the wait room cardie musician things that have applied for over a decade for me this is particularly meaning full and my golfer is really to ask a bunch of questions to which ism interested in the answers but also of which i know the audience is really curious about one of your contras is a if you want to look an athlete train an athlete and i think that is something really special that sets aside what you do from what a lot of other very well qualified people do and in terms of the use of waits and resistance whether nod's body weight or waits in the him or poles verses cardie in terms of overall health aesthetics and athleticism is there a way that you could point to the idea that maybe people should be doing your fifty per cent resistance training on fifty per cent cardiac maybe it seventy thirty maybe it is thirty seventy and and here on talking about the typical person who would to maintain or maybeven add some muscle mass nobly in particular areas for most people as was just overall mass a the will talk about that later and people want to maintain a relatively low body fat percentage and been good carry of vascular health what is the sort of contour of a basic programmed that anybody could think about as a starting place o rivals like a sixty forty split which would be leaning tears a way training o strengthen in in the and then either the conditioning aspect the above forty per cent if you look at over a course of a training we akin five days in the him would be a great passing abasing in the him it could e done at home but three days train training on my ends a fridge conditioning to day there i ya two days it is it it is a pretty easy round about way to split that up of course depending upon training goals and as you said the esthetic goals that will shift dramatically but if you wanted to see the benefits of both that is probably the the effect of dose for strain training and the effect of those for conditioning at the barmen level again being of much better performer condition wise can one to more than that and in terms of the duration of those work out what is your suggestion i have been wait training for about thirty years running for about thirty years and mainly for health and have found that if i work hard in the jam er at resistance training for more than sixty minutes or very hard for me to recover star getting coals i it are getting weaker from work out to work out but amazingly at least to me if i keep those work outs to about ten minutes ten minutes of warm up and fifty fives zero minutes for of really hard work for resistance training and i keep the party vascular work about thirty to forty five minutes i feel great and i seem to make some progress at least some place in work out from work out to work out i mean it is does her good numbers cause those ha find numbers that we usually preach we try to keep our work outs to an hour or less if possible not depending upon the split that you are following if you are an a total body split there is just can be more that has to be done in a given about time ism that a are not again if you training primarily for straight that could prolong the work out as along the rest times and between sets but in general when you are not forecast on that one aspect but the over all health picture them you can get the job done in and under an under an hour and again i always say on top of it if you want to look n apply train an apply is you can either training longer you could train garbage cannot do both and i really believe that the folk is for me i have a busy life have lot other things that i do believe or not in it is i i want to go hard and i want go get out and i find that my body also response to that in thing a lotogis bod as respond to that and particularly as you start to get older i think it is the it is the length of the work out that actually causes more problems than the intensity of what you are doing particularly if you are warmed out properly you said have found personally that my warm up has had to become orbit integral part o my my work out than it ever has before i never i can get in the gin when i was twenty and ism going to right over am doing once set two sets them and ism ready to go and i never do another work out warm upset for any the other exercise of you the rest of day ism that is not that is not sure any more and have found that as long as ism willing to sort of give myself a little o warm up the intensities not what bothers me yet it's very much in control of the weights i use an it does not bother me but if i start to go pretty long i start to feel eight ore for to have probe again depending upon age that also place a factor in the length but again i think everybody can achieve on a standard program conachieve the results that they want within an hour terms of splits you mention split and for those who aren't familiar with this a term splits its really a which body parts are you training on which days seems a do not almost everybody follows a weekly work out schedule the body of course does not mot her i a w week i do no resorting that once every seven or is every seven days makes sense physiologically as us the body does not worth them but that istle way life is structured a have seen you discuss three days a week whole body work outs give heard of splits a pushing one day a pulling another day legs another day a day off repeat om there many variations on these what are some general themes tat we can throw out their and in order to avoid the the huge matrices of possibles house of wonderful contact that points us and we will cap but in our caption show notes will link out to some of those they a different ways to design splits but in terms of giving people a logic have had a think about splitting up body parts what is governing the the split what would of the rules in the logic that dictate a split for me the first rules will you stick to it it if you cause there are split i do not i do not particularly full body splits was actually talking to just my about that whether dislike i do not necessarily to have to train everything now of course the virus will come down our muscle group but if you do not to do that and you actually do not look for to your work out because you are dreading having to do everything and feeling may be too fatigued by the time your work outs over or the fact that those gently you take a little bit longer and do not into your schedule i do not care how effect of the split is a split not done is not effective you need to find one that fit make you go in to and all turn adoption a am a pushups legs take you mentioned and that can be done either one cycle through the week noon money once they fridge split or could be twice in a weeks her actually training six times your were you repeat it young pull push legs pull push legs or er yo a however you don't do that with either a day off and between the three days or at the end of six days a and again that actually impacts your schedule give broken that down beforwars n if you put it in between the three days is good because you are giving yourself an extra rest day and between but it starts to shift that day off every week as we wrap around for those goes that were choosing that seven days sexual out of convenience in our heads it starts the mess wit that off say others to just keep your predictably let down a sundae an train six days in a row a but that is hat but that is a a better way tho maybe group similar muscle actions together which i think i i dentally prefer that because if ism going to be training i pulling movements at least the there is a energy between them and i feel a looking to a chief one goal that day a and then i mean quite onerously you go back to the pro split days and they'd though still work effect there is a reason why they work in the past i i think that science shows that there smarter ways to do them these days you can you can come back and hid a related muscle you could do let us that biceps on on day and then come back two days later and yo back realizing again energy between the the exercises the your birds for louvers stimulated again you could figure out ways to make that work but the thing that think is is effect of there is that tends to be one other ones of people the most because they can go in to get their pump they feel good that it is it is pretty solely focus on be muscle group is that o definition of a pro split one of a group that is he said very much gear toward strength an esthetics really mack smiling ye chest day it'll be more more aesthetics than steam ye it your deny the brow r the bronc the evidently i and you know in here i am a since guy and i i could appreciate the benefits of a brosplit especially was again licequet to what to what end you who whose whose go we are retrying to achieve here there is er r ours i mean if if ism applying my standards an my gulls or even athletic ideals but they just want to get in shape then it is perfectly fine to to do it to do a pro split in that instance if you are sticking to it again and your seeing the results which you want to see from it but they are able to you do not really keep their focus on one muscle they get to focus on like ilicalots have people struggle with the the way of can exercise feels until their second or third set but they do not have that proprceptif ability o can o lock in o an exercise spending a few now i set them the same yo exercise but then doing another excise on say muscle group helps in the island a little the better and get more other training yet that reason really interesting i thing important question early on when i started a resistance train which was announce sixteen high school i got touch with and i was learning from mikemencer i feel thou o do winters matters in and mike was very helpful a very very helpful we got to be friendly a li just read his book i a we canst the i of jealous a n i back then knowing or not i you mig paid my western union time thing to to send him some money for the back of and then he got on the phone with me and and my mother of the time was wisest grown man an the house and he gave me a a very straight for and split which was shoulder's arms one day he had be taking two days off and then training legs and n two days off and then chestamack et camera and then the that is a variation of brosplit to where your sort of yet breaking them down that way chest an back or chest e bite ye the worked very well for me i probablywould because of my age i think an give there's the i was untrained i think it largely on train i thing would have a grown on on many different programs but it worked very well for me i eventually just as i made that in every other playthings or arms day off legs day or two off as we it legs right least for me ism not training ta and then not doing much of anything athletic the next day and chestback in repeat and sawn and the reason i found that helpful i almost always recovered between workouts am the the six day a week program of push pul legs push duple legs to me am seems excruciating am from two standpoints one is at least with my recovery abilities lack of recovery billies i cannot imagine coming back feeling fresh the other one is if i if ism in the him more than four days a week i really start to fatigue it about the whole psychological experience of it whereas if ism in the three or four days a week in others if i put a day off in between each work out i really want to be there and i get in there with with a lot of fire am animals ore doing other things on the off days i think that i love that you mention the the split it you will stick to and that you can bring the intensity to because i think o that truly important i sometimes here about two a day training have done to a day training twice in my lifetime both times i got sick two days later that correlation not causation but am is there ever an instance were two a day weight training make sense for the non druggists did am typical recoveryability person i actually i i think it make sense in some scenarios but it does not make sense practically to lot people schedule if you could break down let say you were going to do even a a o you a o some version of of a total body session or may be you are going to do a an upper lower split i you could do an upper work out and do the after chain of the pushing portion of that in one session and then come back in do the pulling session later on at night if you had the opportunity to the thing that you benefit from there is the freshness of focus again something in my head fact is sacrifice but a time you get towards the latter half of whatever work out your in the same point you may before when you start to a porch that fifty minutes an hour you mark you are either losing focus you are losing energy you are losing contract billability ore losing something and if you are relegating whatever it is the pulling portion of that to the end of that work out something suffer that can that if ten realize it's happening that may be you switch em up the next time you do the work out where the pulling portion of the upper work out goes first and then the pushing goes later your least not just continuing that cycle but at the same time if you were able to con split them up you get a chance to con to take a break you can have that freshmen of focus again and you can as you get a better effort and use again i think effort drives tho results if the effort is not compromise than you should be able to do that but systemically is that problem and i think that it is a problem for lot o people's is hard to is her to red the mention up a lot of times dealing the day you now you warm that thing up once as that car in the winter you get a going once your lucky you can nay i drive it the rest of the day but f you put in the marry and try t start the next day it it is it is a problem you know young people can get away the lot more than than older people could have never had a strong recovery question but if i stick to this one day off in between every once in a while two days in row training may be because i have to travel when i want to make sure i get all the work use in nothing i seem to be out i your example of war mind up the car spoken a true east coast a least cost of those of us from the west to er i we e you foot om the least cause in the mid ow us get it and certainly from from rope in terms of the mixing up of cardie vascular training and resistance training a same day different day which one should come first which one l come second if one main goals again everyone listening has different goals a most peopled either maintain or gain some muscle i soft know many people that want to lose muscle maintain or gain some muscle usually in specific locations on their body most people would to be a bit leaner or lot leaner there few people out there theatre either naturally lean or do not want or achy just want a wainwright but assuming that people ne t get lean or put on some muscle r maintained muscle and want to have a healthy heart and a healthy brain which baby requires a health he carry vascular system how would you in corporate carry of vascular work into the over all weekly regiment a again i i think that the yon the barramenmumis probably twice a week in terms of card of vascular if you want to have some semblance of cart of vascular condition but i think most people who actually need it more or want to pursue it more than that are got to need more time to do that a at some point it cannot just be relegated to a day off or a day off from the from the weight training work out at some point it has to occur on the same day in in that case i just to put it if that is you are not your primary gull with you looking more for the just the over all picture of the aesthetics yo mention putting muscle on in certain areas than i would put it at the end of the work out cause you do not want any way compromise the wait training work work out and as we have sort of referenceicable times already t the intensity of those work out is important and we know there is a strength component to those work outs also that is going to you'll at be a helpful stimulus for grove the conditioning the cardie that of done prior to any training as the training work to is likely going to imperial billy to perform at your best unless it is just on for a quick little warm up in the beginning but then it is not sustained long enough really to be of benefit for cart of vascular conditioning i just you will put that tat the end realizing that even if my effort level is lower my output is lower if it is still placing a demand o my cardiac output to get that condition n of fact because ism fatigued is still has that the and of my cardiac output still achieving its goal but it didn'interfere with my mangle of being able to increase my performs in the him to it and interfere of the form of carry vascular training have seen you am do a number of i have to say a very impressive a high intense interval type work bury type work or push ours with with crunches mixed into the and when people coffee our videos to did not describe those in the best way but rather than on the tread mill or out jogging for thirty forty five minutes is that because you prefer higher intensity a higher heart rate type am training or it because you live in cold connection it am and you do not want be out jogging on the roads in the middle winter a wet i think all the above i men those or factors yen from personal level but i think that if if you are if we could bland function across these rounds and not have such a delineation between this is my way training and this is my conditioning but figure out a way to to blend them together i always think that you have get you have got a better opportunity get that more well rounded result and i the kind of mix up that straight condition in work and also some of the footwork the drills tan we have we we have some high expectations for guides to come to our programs to just do some footwork drills they latter she ladders or er line drills or something and you what happens people become intrigued and interested i never haven't tried the since a high school and they become interested in just the challenge of it and as we become almost distracted by the challenge we are now finding our selves conditioning and i always think that is an important part that sometimes you got a draw people in am to get to show them what they might be interested in and from the outputted the effect of it i just think that we you are able to blend some to somebody of still maintain some that strength training into the exercise ss you men so let see do some kine of a push up or or y i mean there is there is a can anaerobe component to that that is going to be helpful a that than rather than just walking or just jogging am not us not to say that that is not an effective means for strict cardiac conditioning it is a s one of the ways that we have had for y centuries to do it but i just think that if we can blend it than it becomes may be a bit more interesting and you get some of those cross over benefits and does not become segmented in terms of what we are trying to do i love the idea of bringing some mental challenge and some desire to improve a skill while conditioning that is not something that a thought of before in it and it is simply cause have overlooked it ut make sense bees my sister who reasonably fit although always trying to get her to do a bit more am shears ask me of what should i take and i i do not believer in supplements some for certain people in certain instances but i keep telling her you notes it behaviors are going to and nutrition are cant have the greatest outside pause effect and she loves things am dance classes and things at am for take boxing these hounds things which make sense that if you can hook somebody on the conditioning aspect of the skill aspect in count trick them into doing more cardie to speak that that is terrific also the narrow scientist in me just has to say forgive me am that any time you are engaging the of the i you sets of motor nouns once in your brain the upper motor runs in the once in your son on court any time your engaging those upper motorcar on which are for deliberate a well controlled action you are doing a great thing for your brain informs to brain long levity am ism now i need to incorporates some actual skills in my training a going back to wait training a bit one of the most important things i learned from you s over the years was that when training to increase muscle size to really think not much about moving weights but more about challenging muscles ye i also heard this from am my friend ben pockolsky who is very well accomplish i he was a bodybuilder now he is in to other aspects of fitness teach is fitness but do not move weight challenge muscles unless you aren't trying to power left or something that sort which ism not immensely helpful but the other thing that i learned from you that i a combine with that was this idea that certain muscles will grow better and get stronger much more easily maybe even will recover better because of our ability to contract them really hard and this i what i call the cavalier test which is of at least if if i could paraphrase the for instance if i can it is always the based isn't let us us let us use the calf for the bicep if you can if you can flex your bicep to the point where it hurts a little bit i almost feels a cramp or a cramp re conflux your calf to the point where it really cramps up a look it almost feels its nodding up that is a pretty good indication that you are going to be able to stimulate that muscle well under load if you are doing the movement properly and that is the feeling tithe aim for each repetition may even throughout the repetition for me this completely transformed my results this was i think it may be five six years ago that i first heard this from you body parts that for me lagged behind that i thought maybe genetically won't in a word for me immediately just started growing i right and i was getting stronger and stronger i though this is really something much that have dedicated a portion of my research along in collaboration with another group to try and understand what is happening in these upper motor runs in the brain that can engage the muscles even more and that it is not just about progressive overload or putting a pump into the muscle that it is really this mine muscle connection is a real thing when it comes to predicting results and that you can get better at it a forgive me for paraphrasing ut you are incredible content around this it made a tremendous difference for me and a number of other people that passed that along to but what can you first o how did you arrive at that because we hear about the mine muscle connection but i really e heard it first from you how did you arrive at this kind of cramp test the cavalier test as all call it a is always word when people named things after themselves other scientist there is now officially the cavalier test is whether or not you can cramp the muscle in the absence of load just i flexing to the point where it hurts a little bit that would be and in a good indication that you could grow that muscle well how did you come up with us i m it just honestly something that that made sense to be because during my it work out even as a as a young kid just starting out i always wanted to know what is at work and oil of you have last at question more to thallic what is it supposed to work a la and i i do not if you have ever notice but when people asked that due h of there there being train by a trainer and the trainer say will just do this do this exercise and they will show you how to do it but then they will say but what is it supposed to wore where am i supposed to feel this right people it dirt just inherently asked that question a lot people will i was one of those that did that and asked the question not because i white was doing but just because i do not know i wanted know what was supposed to be doing the work once you do that and you start to seek that out and cat who the bicep is what supposed to be doing the work that i want to make sure the biceps doing the work right then i would just sort of really like tweak the movement to make it do more work or feel more uncomfortable to get a stronger contraction knowing if that supposed to do the job it was not petiscold ism tho learning awol theefflection of the elbow is the break yells and the be in the bi such reposeful for supernatioi you sort i i learned other components of it but all i want know as to bring my arm up in a curl what is supposed to do the job i would seek out ways to make the happen better and when i was able to do that i could feel the stronger contraction and i just i do not know what i just i was no visionary i just felt i i knew that that was going be better for me if the muscle out trying to grow as being stressed more effectively when i was a attempting to do this a cross if men exercise is i would notice that what i could do potentially to a curl with my arm is up in whee you asked me to fleet my step that position i could not do if i was doing a concentration girl or i could not carry over to a cable curl and that should not really change i cause the function is still largely the same there still elbow flection there still suernatinli why am i not able to do it there and that is wheat sort of cousin to me that you your my muscle connection in not just your mind with one muscle but in every exercise matters in varies from exercise to exercise and even if you do not gain muscle size from doing that although i think it is very hard not to especially for y not used to doing that there there is a turn i to call muscularity which is a different tries the level of sort of resting tone in the muscle that improves dramatically if you can learn how to just start to engage that muscle better the muscularity that resting tone in that muscle it is harder it is more it is more a at attention is test more it its its more alive and that is all driven from being able to connect better oologically with the muscle that you that you are trying to train have talked about a lot inefficiency is really what you are trying to seek in movements when your trying to great i purchase when got when strength is your goal efficiency of the movement is what you looking for you are looking to have muscles tie together and work well efficiently the chest the shoulders at tried to get a bar off of your chest er in a bench press you are not look in to make it a very inefficient yo leverages for your chest to try to grow your chest in a bench press you are trying to let the whole pa time come together for greater output but we you are trying to go in create muscle have purchase or even this muscular that talk about you need the seek ways to make it feel more uncomfortable if you do not feel the discomfort that you are doing something wrong and i struggle to this day on certain muscle groups to still do that even knowing what ism trying to work and knowing with the goal of everything of preaching here it is very difficult for some muscles of certain people to do this on certain muscles but as you mention practice does help and the more you become you will consistent in deliberate with what yore trying to do the more fan of a result you actually get it is a couple of really poor boys to to a self in to further first of all my hunch was always that the muscle groups that grew easy most easily and that i could contract hardest without any a h the first tomemingto the cavalier last got ten out its at we give it a ten out ten scale could just let since isolate those muscles since them grow them easily in there certain by parts i not say which once as does not really matter a that i always felt if i just push ups they would grow in these muscles are far away for any the muscles there us we inside an push ups even though i to thing ism doing pushups correctly you will tell me if i ism not u but some of that i think is genetic in some of that has to do with the sports that i played when i was younger i swam i plate soccer i scape word and then later i boxed and the muscles in solved in the sports were always very easy to engage later when i went into the yet i i guess at perhaps a call to parents having kids do a lot of dynamic activity seems it might be a good idea using is this issue of o muscularity i glad you brought that up there are i have to imagine a large number of listeners who do not want to get bigger they do natant to take up a larger clothing size they do not want to take up more space in fact some of them would to take up less space but they they want that quality that you are describing which is ha often times we you hear more in the here ism starting a bit but i with kindness a you hear from women who haven't weight train the say i do not want get big often sometimes they do but the most most women that have help weight train were talk about wagtrunsay i do nothing gait i want gat tone and i think what they are referring to is this quality that of muscular hungers this idea that at at resting were at close to last or any times on reaches out in crabs a glass that that the muscles almost look their kind of twitching in the skin and yet it is not saran napkin an anomy chart types skin i this thing of muscularity or resting tone you has a histological basis i think it is how readily the nerves i our communicate with the muscles and you are saying that by learning to engage the muscles more actively the resting tone or muscularity can improve have you seen that both in men and women e and and you think this is something that takes am up keep a maintenance or that you do not want you develop that muscle you can justcontaletic coast i think everything it we it requires up keep your lose it i do believe a firmly but i think that it is the the development of the connections can be harder than the finance of the connection as i said i still struggle to the day myself with a unnamed mussegroof sit also you know but no there is just there is there is just certain am ere is that are harder for your brain for whatever reason to jisdevelop that that connection at that type of level to great great that exerstrong contraction but i think that it with proper dedication focus in it it'll go right out and say calves is one there is that it'll i do not nest ta surely have a great connection with and i also obviously must not care much cause i do not put in the time an effort to recreate that connection as i could am i think what might happen is you father could be a struggle there but that with with struggle comes disinterest peru lake tell spirit on the a ism a calf not ism not gong to to anything about it i think if you put that thee the require at for in in the time on re petitions that you will develop that an once you do develop it it is going to stick around a lot longer than it would had you not invested any time into it it all am you are not requiring as much of bat but i mean i i do not know you mention now when you train it is you are you are just the part a hit train now you are going hard your trying to yen really forcibly contract you not just moving the way i say from point a to point be but you are trying to contract the wait through that range am that is of mind set that i try to put into whatever they of doing unless of course ism focus on us strength exercise where ism just trying to lift a greater amount and use all the muscles together but when the goal is in efficiency for hyperchasy i am really trying to create that contraction in adjust part of my training i guess t hat you that for consistency's sake as long as of training is happening as at if i if i get away from training that is not happening t all but even there i probably a another embarrassing admission probably you will mindfully do it throughout the day you've win ho waive my head in certain messages but he my abs or my arm or my shoulders or something ism doing something just a sort of engage to muscles and i do think that some of that sort of name practice actually helps by time you go back into the him you just into keep that you keep that that that connection going well it certainly obeys all the rules of neural last disiteve the the fire together wire together monte which is the word to my calling carl shots a whole true for all aspects of your function including nerve to muscle these flexing throughout the day or the the am deliberate isolation of of contracting a muscle throughout the day is without question engaging your plasticity and if you were do you you were of those reputations you gong to get less engagement of the nerve to muscle connection i can say this with with a with a smile and and with confidence because one of the first things all nor science student's learn is about the borrow muscular junction cause it is it it is a really simple example of ware the more times t he nerve fires and gets the muscle to contract the stronger that connection get receptors are brought there et camera et camera t the whole bunch of mechanisms for topic to another a podcast but u basically that practices throughout the day is makes total sense and works there is no the believing there's no science behind that in terms of yo the application of it you do it when you catch yourself doing it you know right hind the time ye know but i it is deafly som that is easily done discreetly and you you mind up to actually i think in ana resivilia when i i did talk about am growing your arms by just improve youmproving the connection not that that connection itself is applying any load or or you resistance that significant to crew overlook for growth but it is the development of that connection that i then take back with me into the him at a more effect of level that takes every exercise i do there and makes a more effective it is a sharpening the bleed to speak ye certainly obeys the laws of a a nerve to muscle physiology one did just touch on a a couple of things i if the goal is to challenge muscles and one is dividing their body into lets ay three or foray a week split or or maybe up to six how do when a muscles relit ready to be challenged again have heard okay every forty eight hours is protyuencs increase is and then well get into this and then it drops off but frankly if y train o my legs hard i can get stronger from work out to work out or t these better in some way work out to work out a leg work out to leg work out training them once every five to eight days if i train them more often i get worse the whatever that forty eight hour to seven to hour thing is somehow my legs do not obey that ore maybe something else wrong with me but ism sure there anythings else wrong with me but how do you assess recovery at the local level meaning at the level of the muscles is that will tike out soreness and getting better stronger or more repetitions et camera and then the systemic level the level of the nervous system and it'd love o you to tell us about the o the tool that again i learned from you which is afturly using a physical scale because it turns out this is that will let you tell what the tool is but that tool is also actively being used for assessing cognitive decline and cognitive maintenance and cognate function in people with illtimers an do mention i makes to o sense makes to sense i i i u regarding the the the first part of the question you how do you how would you cent of dictate when a muscles recovered i do think that what your experiencing is totally real a that different muscles recover at different race and have always been fascinated by this concept thought about in eternally with mut with my teem but i feel li what we really need the holy grail to to training is going to be when we are able t crack the cod on an individual basis when a muscle is recovered and that is going to dictate its training schedule and the fact that you might have a step that can be train you we we a pulling work out of regular bullet that it car work it forget the split at the momentous may have a yet that is able to be train that can be trained again the next day and then the next day it ay may be see to day off after that in that that can vary from person a person for sure and it can vary from muscle to muscle in that person over the course of time as you mention because the systemic recoveries get in pact all those muscles anyway but let say you are systemically recovering every muscle itself is going to have u a o a recovery and i think what is fascinating is that when you talked about before we to train this weaker we have a the way our mind looks at training wot if that was the case that the beeps that based is a slave to the rest of your trainsplit you're us why does it have to be also at the end of every eighth day or or whatever when it might be son better to something much more frequently and your legs are also being thrown into that masts it mike denser concept for he is the on training one set and be done for fourteen days i mean it there is there is there is such variability between musclegrups in your you are linking them all together o i i think that coming back in using muscle soreness as a guy line for that is is one of the only tools we have in terms of the local level we do not really have you being able to measure let say a p q levels in side of a muscle would be amazing at at a local level to see how how recovered that muscle is but that becomes fairly invasive at least to my knowledge becomes fairly invasive what are our tools i mean i i think that at the basic level these that musical can relate to an easily identify and then use that as a guy in if your training when your really sore a is probably not a great idea and that its probably good indication that that muscles not recovered but at least hearing what you and i are saying here might be a comfort to the person say yet it is possible that is not recovered just because forty eight hours of the recommendation and just because research points to muscle putting this is needing are re stimulation well may be not maybe you are not necessarily there yet you are in that and for that muscle you are not there yet a is all really interesting stop but as far as the the a the systemic you recovery i thing it's a lot of ways you you talk about resting heart rate measured in the morning o at all different kinds of of a you for temperature and things that that might become altered in a state of a non recovery but grip strength is very very much tied to performance and recovery and when out of the gets we used to actually take grip strength measurements is a base line in spring training all a time obviously the baseball player your gripping a bad you picture you are gripping a bollix you grip having good grip strength is important f we you notice ti we had a very weak grip it is just a good focal point of a specialized training component for he courtiers every day with those guys now we do in spring training with you sort of a base line entry level measurement and then we would we would measure it throughout the seas on maybe once every two weeks or three weeks and in in their the idea there was to to manage to yo manage o recover measure the recovery a that us gave away there to to to o to determine over all recovery you are grip straight is pretty highly correlated we have found that wat with one of those scales those old fashioned fathom scales at a the bathe honor of you can get which by the way almost impossible i believe just in our searching for the last scale to put in that visit and we almost could not find on as everything is did it a on event is of lug i the old fashioned dial controls is i ham old mawkin toshes tears ta there a huge mar em an phone n an keep your phones now an thirty years the phone now i we the lot o roaring lot to i wound u a a finding one and it is a great tool for just squeezing the the the a the scale with your hands an seeing what up about put you can get a i think we all can relate to this when you just visa lives imagine the last time you were sick ere the were you ore just try us ye next time you wake up in the morning when you first wake up in the morning you still groggy try squeeze your hand try to make a fist as hard as you can you guess that there angry at your fist because it will not contract is hard as it can you do not have the ability to just create the output and that is because in that state you are still sleepier still fatigue your you are not even awake the the the the whole level of this point well that is the that is still a a actual phenomena that happens that the a a lack of recovery lack of wakefulness or what every one say is is going to lead to a decreased output there when you start the measure that on a daily basis you get a pretty good sense of where you are at and i think when people start to see a drop off of temper san or or or even greater o of their a grip output a you really should skip the him that maybes i do not think there is much your going to do there that is going to be that that beneficial even if it is the day the train legs are whatever day it is i i love this tool it is simple its low cost if you can find such a scale yes you could also find one of those grippers that am and you did in a very non quantitative way a but better would be a scale we can she measure how hard you can squeeze this thing at given time a day i it draws to mind just the old door a science fact when in the world of circadian neurobiology one of the consistent findings is that in the middle of your night time you will the like people up an they will say do this test an the laboratory that use a different apparatus but the sensually the same thing and the mill the night grip strength is very very low and if mid morning grip strength as high and as the body temperature goes up into the afternoon grip strength it higher and high and iron when drops of ten a circadian with and gar temperate you yo on dos tat more or less the same time each day you use it but it i think it is brilliant and i in its simplicity and it is directness to these upper motor her on cause that is really what it is assessing your ability again it is about the ability to contract the muscles hard if you cannot do that you are it thin gat an effective for ye they also i been there certainly are more sophisticated tools to us as a a it that we have a a handgrip tinomometers and we can a we can measure one side at a time to it'll not really i m getting a little bit blinded by the fact that both hands of squeezing into that scale in it'll get breathe left right comparison but even at that level that cut give you a little bit ore detail that that comes of the cost of the pretty expense of the vices but if is listen if you ere an the you the the two hundred three hind boys it cost to have one of those would be well worth the ad an investment well and ism sure some of our listeners were want one to cause they are a lot of a the leaks out there i not reckon distress leaks but you pecker i what is it called again is a handgrip anemometer gripped one in a done no matte i said o o said of with it with the great pastose acted by me in a terrible botched it a west coast version i thank you well will a put that in the shoots also i i think recovery is key we always here about sleep grow when you sleep and incidentally your brain you stimulate learning when you are awake obviously but the reordering of nerd connections happens in sleep this is why sleep is the way to get smarter provided you are also doing the learning part the sleeves away to get strong r find you are also doing the training part you have got some really intros have put out interesting content over the years in terms of a even sleep position i one of the major changes that i made to my sleep behavior is to not have the sheets tucked in at the end of the and it'll tell you this had a profound impact on several things first of all my feet have always been the bane of my existence broke them upon scape wording they i and i notice when it'd on id get shin splints and and then i start to notice that my feet sort of you are the p t there kind of floppy in the yours as if i was pointing my toe slightly all the time at rest if is i and i realize that based on listening to you previously that my sheets were rap tight not hotel tight right right nothing in the hotel be fer and i started ism releasing that the sheets at the end of the bed and i also to our doing some tore alias work i a front of shin's work essentially changed everything my back pain from running my shin splints disappeared my posture improved although i my audience will tell me that it still needs improvement there is five or ten people at once it ultra give out she had chairs and tarmalras i very nice tars i i saw am trying by ism trying there i but this is fascinating right i the position that one sleeps and i id fortunately have never having shoulder issues and of come wood but thin you could just talk talk just a little bit about sleep and sleep position forsake of waking position and movement is this i think is a very unique and very powerful way to think about sleep this part cast has done a lot of episodes about keeping the room cool getting sunlight in your eyes used o ow to get into sleeping but you have talked about physically what positions might be better to sleep into a please please enriches yet i an first of all that you some people's opinions of of that type of content as that you you know you sleep in the cot the position that is most comfortable to you an surely your sleeping great i i understand that we all want of sleep that is the go en we put our had on the pillow as actually fall asleep and wake up in the morning and not know what that will happen unless you had a dream but beyond that there are certainly physical components to sleep that that is why lot of times peoplewake up and say yuan that you can incur pretty serious injuries and sleep people will wake up and have a shoulder that did not bother them at all be how in the next day or even for weeks after because of the one sleep position they put themselves in in a prolonged way and they happen to have a deep sleep even through the discomfort a that can do actually some some some damage it is understandable that the body can incur some strain and stress if your sleeping in the wrong way one the things i say right up the bad is sleeping on your stomach dost does not really have many benefits you are your putting yourself into a position that is depending upon the the the plantation of your your mattress or how many pillars you are using put your easily putting yourselves into a excessive extension a the lumbar pine which for most people is not very good if you are if your dilation a i guess that might be helpful for for revoking the disk but i mean for the most part a your hands are then usually not at your sides but they are up under your arms you have got them into set of interrogation up over elevation in your head it is this not a great position you all some to crank your neck for one sire the other nor to breathe ore you be your face down straighten the pillow i would skip that one and there some people that are total belly sleepers and i and i would just say listen i do not think that is the the most healthful long turn way for you to sleep try to adopt the different position a sleeping on your side off in times is is also brought along with that the legs and need coming up towards the chest prolong inflection leftest were doing enough for that during the does ye won we in right i real really to do about ten hour actor eight hours or some where at night that an it is just is reinforcing you and as we said too you let us say you trained that day you just reinforcing muscle shortening overnight know were were the body is healing and trying do great changes in your body a no other reasons why recommend stretching our static stretching prior to going to bed my people do not really want to do it at that point as it could take ten minutes five sentence pen in on howling muscles you have to stress but now it is good sort of try to establish is longer length temporarily prior to going into a state where yore to be not moving and recovering an in in creating you a changes in the muscle a that kind of i do not say it does not rule out the these sleep provide sleeper could be very very helpful for somebody has append or other other condition again it is not an alley nothing approach but it just somethingthat you need to pay attention to when you are on your back you ere talking about in your feet are wedged underneath a tight sheets at the end of the bed and most of us unless we consciously are pulling them up do not prefer our beds to have only loose sheets at the end of the bed hard to make to the in the morning right it is you are got to one to have the them tight well i am saying as you experience you are going to have o the this ay prolonged plan reflection that is going to likely lead to shorter yo calves over time am because you are lacking all that length for that long period time that you could have if you just loosened up the sheets and allowed your feet to just youon't hang out where they are now the resting position of the ankle hates not in doorsifflections on to be still in some planorfechion but not be driven down and pull down into that position and i think what happens actually people who get uncomfortable that way even in their sleep will shift away from that by training either on to the side or stomach there is deafly an impact of the body position and sleep and figuring have the best way that you can still sleep of course and get your rest but have a mindful towards what is doing to your body and choose the one that is least how abraceip to your body is the way you should go terrific and again it is really helped me and a i big believer based on good since out of stamford and elsewhere that as much as we can be naval breathers and sleep we probable should be i do not know you have done any content to u yet about i taping the mouth shut with some medical take but give it the the benefits of naval breathing and sleep er pretty tremendous but it takes a little bit of training i will do and the training is very simple it is i will piece of medical tape again a topic for another time ism glad you mention stretching i was and ask about stretching a a bit later but let us talk about stretching when is the best time to stretch for particular types of results and maybe you call define some the different types of stretching i you just mention a a little bit of would you call light stretching or i get ism completely i eve here on stretching lemme to say i can think of stretching where i hold the stretch and really trying e lengthen in air quote folks o the p ts jumping all i know what it is but nutrition and the its on line a really they got pitch forks in both hands dictate that is a reason a that's a reason evolution i think i her not nutrition much but the its have become a little but angry these days i see will i always say wit feelings of powerlessness comes aggression very that folks in any in any case they are stretching where ism ism you trying to consciously lengthen again in air quotes the muscle ism not yanking on the limb o bobbing up and down mad you call defend the different types of stretching people maybe give us some rough guide lines about with e nought to do it cold or warm before training after training et camera yet there there is not yes that es a lot of different types of stretching that can get even to yo pone stretching in things that are little bit more a yo bitch but in general h to basic form to stretching or act of stretching and passive stretching m you are you in you your dynamic work and in your passive stretching is done with the goal of trying to create an increase a in a the flexibility of the muscle whether your actually increase in ta length of that muscleman yo more e your doing is increase in the resist their decrease in the resistance of that muscle to one of stay at a certain level of flexibility when we can sort of take the breaks off and allow that muscle to to allow us more range of motion were inherently in increasing flexibility without in silly having to increase the length of that muscle a that is usually done at a time far away from your work out because they have shown where this type of stretching dumb prior to in activity and it could be a a structured activity like lifting or could be a bit less structure competing a sport in i in a spontaneous type away that there is a period of recalibration that is needed after doing this because your disrupting the length echo relationship of the muscle that causes you to not necessarily be able to rely on these give talked about before stored motor antrums in your mind in terms of this is the pattern for how i swing a golf club say am now introducing a little bit of flexibility or ad in flexibility or range because of the stretching i did before it takes may be a whole or to or three to match up again oh this is the this is what is trying to do that gulling than i that i remembered again is not remembering that every component i have to bend by right kickback ten degrees and i have to been my elbow and after your body stores these patterns for motor efficiency in when i have to start matching up that stored pattern with what is feeling knew because of the increased range i can impair a performance and again it can happen even a him work out where you talking about your first second set this set a were it maybe the reprobations are not as big cause o just do youextur sets but in performance if you script your first three around you plan on pugtorin to shot i y your six over after three or you dor done nose i think it matters there a as far as the dynamic your we we relegate that as i mention showed towards the end the day when it is not going to in pack performance but even may be have the additional benefit of creating the the feeling of length or the increase or decrease in resistance to this length a at a time when i know my body is going to try to tend to heal and heel shorter never longer but he shorter if i can introduce a little bit of the extra a length or or decrease resistance to to that length is a better time to do it i think of promotes a a better recovery a if i want to strut a starred interrupt you stretching later in the day a because i a ism entreated by this condo of heel shorter yes part of the healing and recovery process means a shortening in the muscles this is the tensing up in fly yow could you elaborate just a bit on that and then tat tar to break your flow but the ut a an gan nucleus basically know what what been shown as that when when the the repair process muscular pair from less strike training during the day the repair process usually results in a muscle that is slightly shorter rather than increased hin length it insist that it is you muscles prefer the sort of you ratchet their way down into that than that a contraction and then you maintain that that that more comfortable lengtension relationship when you are sleeping it intends to you air on the side of shorter rather longer when ideally we do not really want that we want to maintain is much of that length because with more length we actually have more leverage rite that muscle has more lavish to contract if it was all the way contracted and you really cannot opus we know generate much force in a muscle it is already rationally contracted i think we we want e do something tat we whatever we can whatever little weapons we have an arsenal that could allow us to do this prior to sleep and again as just making it a a conscious choice to do it a time of the day that makes the lo the more sense o dynamic stretching is rally not done for tat purpose of trying to create any type of of feeling of act or or increasing the the pretension length as you said of the muscle but more the readiness of the muscle to perform an increasing yo exploring the ends of that range of motion in a more dynamic ways your not hanging out there in disrupting that lengtentio relationship was just sort of touching the ends of those barriers that when you feel movement again it feels looser it feels more ready and t an obviously the same time warming up blood flow all the benefits we get from just warming up in general yo that is that is the series you providing a much of times but ye leg swings and in yo but kicks in o lunge walking lunch is and all type to touch is to touch is all those kind of drills those active stretching drills or lunging with rotations for the upper body to try to get some of the thoracic fine involve to those of the drills that people will do prior to training that are both excusatory in terms of just the nervous system but also helpful for just the general warm up the body cause the blood flow but from muscle readiness standpoint not impairing the performance while the same time exploring the increased range is cause are the first to touch you do is not time the last touch touch yo me does not include to an touch do touch attempt trip i asshole you know those those are going to improve with each subsequent wet and living does the people actually that you can see those the actual changes from rep one direct seven you just feel ready you feel more hurt and ready to go in your work out the dynamic type of stretching a and i mentioned earlier on bucolic what have had to do the sort of increase my warm up focus i i think that is more of what i try to do these days i try to be a little bit more alert to the fact that your abode yes not ready hat when i was when i was workingman antonym brown i remember he would spend twenty minutes thirty minutes on all dynamic work and have never seen him body spend that long on their dynamic work but he said he just dirham feel right and ready to go unless he did a lot of that and i mean his his dynamic stretching routine would be a work out for most everybody t it is crazy ho how much he did the is proudly her man thing and a you a had the great fortune of working with and improving there there abilities uh but i can only imagine cause have also mention he is pretty strong in the general i you mean thou know and it always amazes me the guides that make it to that level no matter what sport they do they are gifted in everything their right used to make me laugh all the time with the gets because know matter what i ping on you know anything he because of his hand i coronation anything great at jump rope i remember he had not done a lot of jump rope am i i i think jumps from the best things you could do from a conditioning standpoint it is actually fairly interesting is not just u it is not to harsh on the joints depending you even those of holistic to and he was not at the might if you listened to this e can while killing about i i was better at him a than at jump roping whet holy things i could do and then i gave him about five days and he completely blooming out the water to the for i could ever keep up with him any more he made it look effortless it is that is the worthy athlete an some one comes out no matter what they pick up they are good at it and i think that when you see guides this in the can they strange levels tend to be pretty dam good and the and there abilities are coronation there they are everything just tends a her to be good at that level nit sort of made of me why those goes can go pick of a golf club it go so seventy too and in having never my played they are just there just naturally good at whatever they do you've a couple on ism smiling of bit couple really clos friends who did a number of your some several decades in the seal teams and i do not know that they're skill level at everything is high as as you are describing for athletes but they are level competitiveness on i oceans one with one there is no chance that ism going you know it swim pat ever ever he actually goes back and fore sometimes just take up holy ah much i appreciate thank you pat ism in drown yet but he but an addition o that we could lay horse shoes and it is this switch that just slips on he is got a murder t very nice i in general they want be was but but the level combativeness other er on re there's try it for they are try to bet themselves and ism try to bet you that is right of not even in the naif the competition you are not even there i exact o thank you no heels it were worse it is true is it is a remarkable thing ism glad you mention jump roping i used to skip rope for warm up for boxing no an as to we were three three minute rounds or somethinglike that ism but i ism glad you brought it up because ism skipping rope is something that i obviously haws a party of askculy component there is the condition common there is timing and and it is kind of interesting why you can frustrating when you do not get it i h which you on the her if using that a rope i just curious if you just give us a quick a skipping rope one on one you to see people jumping with ism both feet and tells we will link to of any ism if there was one and i missed it you to see people doing hin geese you people easily shuffling i you wont see people doing double dutch what you want et i doing over time all of the above may be not double dutch but all all the above i may i think that that is the cool thing about it right one sweet sort of master the skills for all of us that first jump with the two feet going together is a challenge cause you just got time that rope yon got time you jump and then we get board as we often do as humans we get board what we can do in one to take on new challenges then it becomes one at ta time or than it becomes side to side hops right in all those things are beneficial i believe analogically to enhancing the ability to do the skill as a hole but also just because ism ism such a believer and training in all three plains just doing straight up and down first as now i can you front of plane side side motion and the i can even do small little twists or corkscrews you call em i it requires at differ you no more be better than i do there it requires different analogical patterns to be all e a coordinate that because you are changing the plantation of your body in space it is not just this changing the exercise for changing how my body in terret that exercise because what is happened to my body ins face i i love whatever people find up doing but ism ism amazed there are people i just are to fall in this young woman on his her graham who is a evil give her plug out of this i and a skips or something and see is ridiculous that i longer n mesmerize hat what she can do with the rope it it is is not extremely athletic endeavor believe when it gets to be at that level in the speed in the precision in the yo in in i think one of the goals that you want to be ale to have is to where your feeling as if you're almost effortlessly dancing without a rope where you are just bouncing off o the ball of your foot ism an it is an important skill to learn to whether you go back to run or or even even jag right just you more casual running learning how to land is important one the drills that people should try is to to jump on your heels just stand up pull your toes off the ground right an just jump from your heels and land on your heels you will feel it in your jaw you will holy feel your jaw rattle when you land on your heels there is no shock absorption capabilities through your heels meantime a lot of people land on their heels a lot when they when they run and you are just your body's not built to absorb the forces the ball of your foot could is really built as a spring an in the foot is a to me as the physical therapist the foot is always being on f the most make a you ting i haven bad feet i have flat feet it loos i got flippers if i took my if i took my shoes off that i l a a warn scupiffence there is no there is no adaptability of that foot to the surface only when it is completely cave than flatten that the job of hi of the foot is to be adaptable we there is maybe there is some adaptability t cut floppy but at the same time at some point that critical junction when you are g then step through and you need to build a push off the foot has to actually changes in the mid foot itself to become a rigid levers of they call it you you are going from a mobile adaptor to a rigid lever that rigid lever literally locks up mitarsel joint to become solid that you can push off it with leverage if you lack that capability all those stresses that are supposed to be born by the foot go up into the ankle into the knee into the hip into the low back he learning how to land in in start to train your your body to a to a experience ground reaction forces the right way is critical to all other function in all her disability up the cannachain and jumping rope is one o the best ways to learn how o do that great i i own a jump rope i love doing it in the morning while i get sunlight in my eyes it is a she a a photo call picked up from him pharos mention as listens o my pokcasting om a broken record would get sunlight in your eyes even through cloud cover its just sets your sleep rhythms in your waking rests a you at on and on om but tom as they be kind of warring for people and i want to get them off their phone jumping ropes also disagree when wink up to a jumping rope can be a the cardie work out the fifteen your thirty menu i there there is no that libra that were going by before f no your not you are not necessarily dropping down of the ground doing herpes but i just look at it as a more athletic endeavor because of the coordination involve than just simply walking or a jogging and you it is not much of a a equipment requirement the very men man cost and id even use a rope or or something if you although we even instructuble that you use no rope and just pretend i know it just move the arms truly r ant never get a hit the rope which is good but it the same to say severing if you doing it wrong but less you can you can move through and get the same benefits you the feet aloe it aloe it am i told myself before sitting down with you to day that i was not going to focus on specific exercises because there is such a wealth of incredible content you put out there that people could just put in to you to for elsewhere and and arrive at the proper way to do a chin or a door a for whatever purpose but there is one exercise in one particular motion that it'd to a discuss for a moment because i believe that learning about this cautionary note from you is one of the reasons that have maintained steady training for thirty years w no major injury knock on wood and that is the upright row one thing that whether not be weight train or not i sect of this podcast and sense and we beat this out an i i you you get beef about i o what i we always get beefing a social immediate platform never put out by now i gets tom i get some from it but i i la ism fully prepared to defend myself the but here here is the reason for askingabout this i never really cared much for upright rows it is not an exercise i tended you but a one thing that is apparent in all my colleagues in every child i see in every adult i see is that almost everybody is an inward to rotation now folks think you if you stay i think i learn this from you all if you stand up straightening just point your thumbs out a a thumbs out but you are just point your hands are down your point your thumb straight out i really the would go straight out most people the thumbs in me pointing toward one other dis most people a starting to look somewhere between a a i non human primate and a melted candle i t when to the hips et camera from too much sitting we are all sitting where an inward rotation but i learn from you that the upright road compromises at some important aspects of our shoulder a mechanics an can be ash sort of dangerous movement in some ways ism sure there is a safe way for people to do it but have always made it a point now on the basis of of this advice to a not do upright rows but i was not doing them before but to really strive for am external rotation on thinks bench dips on on a number of different things whenever i can i trying going to external rotation and drive found without looking an idiot walk around my palms facing outward please tell us about internal external rotation i the upright row is one aspect of tat but why this is import not just for weight training but as it terms of posture and mechanician and not looking a a melted candle or partially melt candle i actually love i i ism happy it old bags i love i love the shoulder as a joy i think pity tend o falling love a certain areas in the shoulders one of the cool tries for me hes the foot is but the shoulder has the most mobility in the body of any of any join but it is also got the leaststability for there is always that trade off of mobility in stability your stability comes from certain muscle groups and where the ones that the only muscle group that actually externally rotate the shoulders can be the rotator cuff oke and unless you are devoted to training through external rotation in exercises that our going to extra rotate the shoulder you are not training that function and it is easy for us in everyday life especially those that are not training to not ever really undergo any of those tresses that could be beneficial to interacting what happens freely and naturally which is interrogation we you think about the imbalance created just by nature and how we live our lives interrogation far far far outlays extern rotation you need to address it and the reason why you need you address is because you need to normal lives those by mechanics to the shoulder if you want their long term help and one of the functions of the shoulders to raise our arm up over our head and if we do that from an interlay rotated position we are going to have a higher likelihood of creating stress inside that joint funny thing is i talked about before my my it brethren can be somewhat aka angry these days all no what happen but for the angry they want they want a discredit the existence of something a shoulder in pigment which i do not know how i m certain studied we both we all read studies than we we studies will say one thing one day potentially conflict entirely in a different direction some studies will point to the non existence off a shoulder in pigment meanwhile we have thankfully a digital motion ex raise that will literally show the impingement occur in real time in real function and as one of the limitations them off on a tangent here but those types of ex rage of that type of fluoroscopy that we have nowadays gives us such insight that we never have before as we are taking static ex rays of some one lying down on a table when i want to see what happens when the actually raise my arm up over my head in function and they in the tools now existed do that we see that that the problems occurring because in order to get normal mechanics in free up the joint maximally inside you need to entering rota as you raise the arm up if your muscles are not firing in they're not necessarily o as strong as the intern rotation by us that pulls them in you are alscang for trouble every time you do that will this exercise is literally putting you in elevation an interrogation and if you were to walk into a it office and some one said i think he is got in pigment will you diagnose him there is a test cause a hawkings kenned tests and i would put you in the position i know we are not visible o this point through the podcast but it'll put you in this position here where i have your arm elevated and your hand pretty much under your chin pushing down ward on that to create that internal shoulder rotation pretty much the exact position that were in when we are holding a bar in in an upright row some will say able just do not go high goodly up to the level of the chest but you are still in this interlay rotated position the the thing that i think frustrates me the most about the exercise as that i have an alternative and the alternative does the same thing in terns of helping the muscles grow by simply fixing the by mechanics of the exercise but just allowing the hands to go higher than the elbows instead of the elbows being higher than the hand which drives you in toe interrogation if the elbow is lower than the hand the hand being higher here ism an extern rotation and i could do something called a high pull and still get the same abduction of the arm and still get the same benefits of the shoulders the debts in the traps without having to undergo any of the stresses that would come from the somewhat awkward movement of an upright row and for those listening i will put a link to a short clip of what this looks but basing what eff is doing and tell me if ism describing as a incorrectly correctly eff as a taking your two thumbs and pointing behind you and i right and yon si always up kind of near the chin and pointing behind you go headed that way somebody directing the air playing y ask em back what back e a i feel what they call that i think it is called some foreign is the action of where they direct the plans i som the the flags or whatever someone of course tell me ism wrong about that to which is why i say these things because i i being told what the what the correct answer is a in any case so this replaces that the upright row and an pro does number of other important things s well yet wall it again u this to night i wen without naming names or programmed in that when i got involved and and when got involved in in a aptly next ti first started oo a on line i presence there was a very very very popular a programmed that was out there that i just for fun i wanted a has a tithe e nutty things we do but i wanted a value weight the the work out structure and i went and i looked at every rep over a course of a week and there are something eight hundred and ninety repetitions are something done a and zero of them were dedicated sexton rotation the shoulder you think about that me get it was ho very popular program that was done by a lot of people there is no there was no focus at all no dedicated focus towards creating a balance to an action that is predominantly remember is not just because we sit with that posture but the fact that are chess can internally rote a last can into rota there is muscle other big muscles that participate in things that we do every day that will further entirely rotate the shoulder the only weapons we have for sexton rotation are those little rotiticuff muscles and three of them actually three of the fore and the job is ti sort of actively and consciously train them to really the boring exercise is right you have seen them with the band you you anchor a band to a poll you stand with the band in the opposite hand fits anchor to the pole my left side i got the band of my right side you see people where they can a rotate their hand towards the back mankind you're saying but at a lower elevation taking the back of my hand to try n to point it to some behind me a well that that is that it is one the ways to train the muscles it is just of one function of the shoulder external rotation of the shoulder and you need to do it and again it is not that if somebody was doing more extra rotation work could they absorb the upright row better probably because as they elevated the arm they probably have a little bit more of a contribution from the rotter cuff that to what one of the functions is the centra lives the head of the humorous inside of the glenoid the of the capsid as it rises up it stays central as a post of migrating up a because the destroy likes to pull up if the rotate cuff has some ability to canter it the upward pull of the dell then it can maintain a more healthy relationship with over heboitso just realizing that that that that function's only game through doing these exercises i we we would private deli keep more time there but the to tit the upright row might be better absorbed by that person cause they have a with more straight but again why because if you haven't exercise that does the same shame for what you are trying to do muscularly to build the muscles that it effects why will not you just do it where you can still see exon actually pick up more repetitions of extern rotation you new we your getting none of the harm all the benefits i see zero reason to ever do the upright row the people will argue there's the way they argue that have done this for thirty years and have never heart myself and i always say yet yet i listen the goddess did not hurt yourself ever even if you its sort of the championship game you know you might play the game of your life but if you lose you lost and when you get into the end of tether the record books your till lost even if you have the game your life you lost i do not care you do i for thirty years no pain is still doing it in there is no pain ism giving you an option that is going to give you the same results an the exercise at your seeking that is why you are doing the exercise without the possibility of having tithe the bad outcome come from it i get of tat you defensive vote the movement i feel it is why would to do that now it makes it makes us being able to train for a long period of time and feel good i a proud to say you know and i do not have the kind of you excelled we do not have a lot of impressive athletes in our family prefer and then there you of som fit individual some less fit individuals but i really believe is of putting in the work consistently over time and the the more the more often you can wake up not in pain the better i and the think that being an external rotation as offense possibles good this actually a good friend who is a yoga teacher told me this also problem with the bogies lot all the downward dogs up for those listening a toucan think of inward rotation as thumbs down just think it thus down annotation is not bad but less thumbs down wore thumbs up ti external rotation for for those just listening maybe they gives a o visual the more exercise you can do in external rotation o the better it seems on average i it'd love to chat with you just o a little bit more about to mechanics i and i and this is a personal thing that i that again your contact really help all for me one is i thought i had lower back pain to i had static a badly that on a few trips i a work trips years ago when i was doing wot more in national travel i mean s hard to stand up sometime on you like excruciating pain i do not want to take medication i want you back surgery in the end turns out it was not a back injury at all i and one of the things that help fix it was this just learning about this thing called the medial glue and you i at of video it is said fix back pain and then you quite actually see that some back pain is not really about the back at all and am and have me do an exercise when allowed me to try an exercise where i i lay on my side an such should pointing my my toe down the top toe down almost pointing toe down and then would slowly lift the the law up while pointing the toe down i maybe i got it e eager then en holding that and there is a there is a muscle that surest at the top of the glue find of peaks out everyone sin a while you can feel it there with your thumb which is i think it you had push back on it a a bit crying that mind muscle link again and and there with propereception the actual feeling of a muscle literally with it with a him we know for the based on the normal circuits for movement that that enhances the contractile ability of muscle if you touch your bye a you you literally can contract it more more strongly in this makes total sense based on a nor muscular physiology have me do that repeatedly assist our doing that in my hotel room and the pain started to disappear and then it came back again the afternoon i did it again in the afters this is something i did for three or four days and lone behold a backpacks gone i handed this off to my father because he me has a slightly lower right shoulder i think that our gate is probably thrown off by this is origan at i inner who knows he handed off to somebody young it turns out that we do not suffer from backpack and if a now i do not fromranyphing because i i was doing this exercise which i think is helping my low an my medial glutetwo reasons why raise this one an lofty eyes have the right side sciatica can people to keep the wall at theirs one idea were left idea static a there are a lot of people male and female who think they have back pain when they do not each he at back pain and the other thing is that is about a general question about my mechanics or steaming about my macaws i had of a feeling that a lot of what people think is back paint er knead pain or neckpain or head each folder in is actually a the consequence of something that is happening above or below that sight of pain i and this is a whole landscape of of stuff relay to it an and and recovery an and pain management but maybe you just a educate us a bit on this and why this works what is the medial glue why did it make my called back pain disappear and how should people think about pain and i uses a away to get into but deeper discussion about pain and recovery sure the the this is defining a i big cornucopia it stuff here but i and this my love first of all that idea that's it it is my proudest visual the i have an the reason being is that i is helped many people we we get to the comments on avid every day a i do not know m if you's got now thirty som my million or is the you will link to it the others bonus and in why sly was a it was a little bit of an after thought medal in terms of this its a it is origin i think that that they maybe jest a s having some problems or something town we below back pain and and i showed i and it help right away on like o we can make of it on it cause that is this will help people no not not everybody if you have a real this problems like on to help because your not changing the structural problem that is there but as you said lot people do not no and and even discs yous e om a lot of m not operative you would want to try these things first a as far as what you sort of experience sometimes has that glue tedious rely tightens down in that says again from for by mechanics up and down the cannot chain it can actually press on the static nerve and give you what they cause suitosiatica ne aware it it i your i your you are making it up it is not your not feeling that pain over that same sic distribution but it is not cause from a disk is not cause from something mechanical there it is caused by the fact that this glue tedious has has posture to become a problem for you or weak because you do not train it and you need to address it unlike not unlike any other muscle in the body there are common trigger points in common areas where the muscle will become tightened or painful or spasm and you can basically apply pressure to these areas to and then sort of thread that muscle through the pressure by pushing down through there and then contracting the muscle which is why you go through that action of y we i thing we call a tottabber but stabbing down and lifting up as cabin down on tit the taking that that glue medius through its function that basically kind of working underneath the downward pressure of the finger and that tends to help you to almost a need out what might be the that trigger point and that is why people can see immediate relief there because once the trigger point let us go a it feels and that is the good the comments are in that vita my got i that i could not walk have not my ho tell floor i did this and in fixed and meanwhile then it could come back because your body is what i being more this is is how ice been join a engrain to be might come back with them when you do another round of it an another round of it and then finally astessisara ism not going to any more count eases up than you can relieve yourself of those of those trigger points you do that up and down the back there is other people that get that in that sort of inside their shoulder blade at that same type of cramping in another area a but once that takes place will then the job that i think people have is become educated that you the glue medius is different than the glue maximum you their functions are are different yen you half to work on not just extending the hip but all abduction of the hip e to rotation of the hip same thing isn't in the shoulder and this actually said ways nicely into what into the whole concert tog abulic the body is a mirror image the hip is the shoulder right the ankle is the wrist the foot is the hand the that they funk thence is the elbows the two since joins they function that way well with the shoulder you have got that mobility that comes from having all that freedom of motion but the stability is lacking well the something with the hip you have got mobility but if you do not fully stabilize it by training all the muscles of the hip and if you do not strength in the external rotation of the hip then you you have your you arguing to have issues it is not bind the canyon a work the same way if you think of the body is a series of you bands you pulling in different directions at different levels of tension you are being pulled into one direction of the other just by the balance of tension from one weak area to one dominantly tight area and you need to make sure that you can sort of balances out in order to eliminate some of the adaptations and compensations that happen what i say when we look it sort of the the a the the body is a whole most often wherever you are feeling the pain is absolutely not to plan there is not blame it is somewhere above were below as you hinted that you are talking about the the knew of my my favorite example of it whenever you have knee pain tell tenant it is which i i i have for ever eve had yo bad bat cases of told to nice where squatting is very difficult for me it is not the knee the knee is the knee is literally a hinge joint that that there is minor rotation capabilities of debut it is a hinge joint and it is being impacted by the hip in the ankle and in the foot as i said before how critical the foot is if you thought of of the knee being the the middle of a train track where the fever down your thigh and your shin down below your knee where the train track would happen if the foot collapse is at the bottom a of a sudden that train track on the bottom gets worked just a little bit well whose gan to feel that the most the are where its working which is at the knee the stresses are can be felt there meanwhile the problems the foot or the problem is the ankle people that are chronic ankle strainers you are almost always going to wine up having back pain because the ankle sprain causes weakness and maladaptations in the ankle that then gets connected through the chain because now one side distort the ankle on the shin now the knee is trying to maintain it is ably to hinge smoothly it works on the fever to do that hell the fevers now inside the hip join pulling on the pelvis and the pelvis is tat a wax it is really it is really is fastening it is one my favorite things about how the body works is how it interconnected it is and how one little thing somewhere cases deprecations somewhere else and the easiest way to find out what your problem is is to say a cay i know where my system is but y got to find someone who can help me find the source somewhere else because it is going to be usually either above or below mostly usually below cause it usually translates up the connate chain but usually is gan to be below on where the real source is up people with low back pain usually have hip issues weakness is tightness is flexibility o issues it is almost always below w get to really high performance athletics though it it almost works the other way where we have pictures who cannot a me i always fastening by guides that have a a mommy john issues sealing their elbow right pictures if you cannot externally rotate the shoulder a we taught about again the ability get your shoulder back and exhortation won your arm has to get to a certain position for release of the baseball and if it cannot get there you cannot extrovert to the shoulder to get there then the elbow has to sort of work more in order to allow the arm to get back further and it will try to take some of that motion from a joints us not rely again another hint another history really capable doing that stretch a stress that media elbow ligament to get a little bit further back because the shoulders not work and and that just ultimately place ta star in the elbow when you see guy that has a pain that floats around a picture that floats around or arm all that is is sort of this balance of compensation once his shoulder elbowstour curtain then he cannot do the get the rain the o the range from the elbow he tries tho dig able it further back and text station and then the return cuff gets inflame and then he feels that is inflame i the by the way of during that time period take some the strain out the elbows to the bow feels better then he decides o can now i got the extra rotation but i get too much of that i star strain in the elbow again and then keeps going throw the cycle your body is very smart and it is good a compensate every single time is going to find the conversation but there is no guarantee to that conversation does not leave you with a wholehost of other issues let's fascinating in another lifetime i would gone a ben a pet although it sounds the community of among he's to lines at to it it listen the her we are tvereopple but it is likes scientists and her scientistic and getting pretty intense battles in coming from the academic community not t the reticent is different on line because i was say you mighthinking person people would probably behave of it it a only your hand in said fellow ye take your hand an say fellow and and and there is also it luck you it'll just be very direct about this there a lot of people on line for whom they are only content is pointing out the a misunderstandings or alleged flaws of other people toe's that it were it is the bulk of their identyas we to me a sort of a sad existence but there is always more to gain by thing about what is possible what is new and what is good but to each their own de miss or win i me question questioning what is out there is help sure and almost great it actually pars conversation a but as you say some people's existence is solely to fine things to ye layabout and and not actually with the gold being to advance anything but rather just to yet in the world of science being skeptical but not mystical is is encouraged but i was say that the longer that somebody is in a career path it certainly in science for medicine and they realize how hard it is to you a to do very studies once they publish a few studies generally they the sort of a get a a better understanding of how how the various things are done in any case am a another along the lines of a pain and pain relief and misunderstandings about the origins of pain in the body a one of the great a tools that i a picked up from your content which is benefit i known a huge number of peoples i think i used to hold a weights sometimes in the in the tips of my fingers as host in the meat of the palm of my hands and i had elbow pane and laws thought that i felt it most ontrysep exercises and pushing exercise and i thought i was doing those exercise as wrong turns out i toward the end of my pull ups or my based work i was letting the weight or the bar drifting my finger tips and the mere am shift to making sure that my knuckles were well over the bar or that the weight was really in the meat of my palms has completely ameliorated that for reasons that you point out and maybeyou could share with us why that is am yet this kind of finger pull exercise you usually were some us pull my finger its a metals or monte school jo until this s a push your er i writ a y the the this is passing that that this is a because it just shows again how intricate the body is and how response over over response if it can be to something little and yow what you are talking about is that when you grip a bar where there it be through a curl or whether been this is mostly pulling exercises because the tendency for the bars can be to fall out of your hand not with e pushing exercise where its country you you are our pushing your and into the bars on he bench press si a that bar can drift just by gravity we went doing this thing or fatigue of the the hand grip strength constant to drift further away towards the the distal digits right through those through those last couple knuckles that we have on our hands and though our hand can still hold it there a the muscles are not equipped to handle those types of loads and that can started a very i i long u say light but it can start it dumbbell wight forty pounds thirty pounds yo even twenty five pounds or some depending upon the over all strength levels but then we used tart to apply it to something your body weight with a chin up i possess natural for the bard of somewhat kind of float down towards your finger tips in it actually is a little easier to perform the exercise with that sort of false grip little hook grip at the end because you are not get engaged the forearms into the exercise you not r start pulling down but at the same time while it could help you to per form them better by getting the back more activated if you have weakness in these muscles cause not is not a thing that happens that it it is not one of those upright road tight things where i think the is hat happening to everybody this is happening to people that haves in gerent weakness is in this in this a in in this these muscles you or or having done enough of the gripping in the for in in the meat of the hand for long enough but it starts to put that stress on these muscles tare i equip to do this and it to handle this an it starts to is particularly on that forth finger which is part of the muscle we call the f ts o flexile a tore that it is just too much for to handle an that comes all the way down an meets right at the medial else round that spot that you can say feels some of the life thing you right in the middle in that mettle elbow and in medial epicondolitus or they call it gaffer's elbow it is something that a lot of us deal within the him it is one of the most common and inflammatory conditions people get from the him and it all comes from this positioning of the dumbbell or barbell or hand on a pull a bar overtime the easiest thing to do is just grip deeper that what you are doing is you are using one more leverage from the palm to in capsule ate the bar or the dumbbell would've an you are not putting that pressure really distill right on that last rich it because that is where the that acts muscle is most strained you you are just almost delimiting that from the equation and in in it is one was exercises that the load can exceed its capacity pretty quickly that real t it maybe its only cable f handling thirty pounds and then we you are doing a chin up any goes in it drift far that it is now ya say your two hundred pound guy you have got and say a hundred pounds through one arm in a hundred pounds this is simple simplified mat that overly is offset by other muscles but hundred pounds tho one arm hundred pounds there a hundred pounds off of a muscle it can handle thirty is not in to take many repetitions to strain it and you are going to feel that maybe by the time that sets over or certainly by the time that work outs over the next day you wake up you have got that notable staving pain whenever some one feels that you the best thing would be to determine ora what exercise whet i doing that were pulling and where the bar could have drifted deeper the into the further from the me to my palm into my fingers an figure out a way that deepen that grip when that happens though the best thing to do would most of these inflammatory conditions is not do any of that stuff for a little while not ever just for a little while there is always things that you can do around it ism not saying ever do i say do not go to the him or do not find something you can do but ism saying the particular exercise that you feel the pain on while you are doing it never smart idea to do that exercise when it is in flailed if you ere doing exercise and it hurts you polish into the exercise because another you yo reason to for the very build of exercise there there is many other options that you can do that will train similar muscles ore even the same motion and not cause that stress i mean a cable a cable curl would be much easier to do that on then let us say a chin up when you do not have the control over the weight you do by moving a pin on a stack i think that that that is a common thing that people find in the best thing to do is just figure out how green how deeper you griping tat baring your to find that all my got any realize that because it was just even though you o much started that in a g an position in a it drift away as you go ya i the think theta a ways happening me and am very conscious of this now again for me it is i have not had is else pan at all that is gree enough t very fortune again demo gratitude too never i thought of some roll in my elbow epically a and o thought it maybe tennis all by in play tennis and a there you go m other aspects of recovery in her variables for recovery a i think i you and i both put out content about the use of cold and i think we can sumriseit by saying yet does seem cold water immersion immediately after i perchaffer your strain t work outs might be prom but a cold showers plan to atom what abut heat do you do you personally use heat and cold a son's hot the you hot bats a hot compress is you and by you i mean you personally and and affects that you coach for people that you coach what your thoughts on the use of heat and wore for a we i think it might just be inherited practice from the days of utraindards of of a sense the babe ruth but we we in baseball we used a lot of cold following performance just because the the idea would be there there is some especially pictures and there is some inflammation a that is abnormal o the arm is not really design to do what they do especially at the at the speed that they move it and everything else we would use you ice as a pretty standard practice after that a but not now lot a heat in when you use lot a heat in of course from the recovery to er the the healing aspect that actually becomes rather a personal preference they have found now a after let say the first twelve to twenty four hours where you really trying to control inflammation of what might be an injury but then it then it can kind of shift to personal preference because the he can bring blood to the area also and hen the gotta the the cold has its sort of anti a inflammatory effects select there is that there is a balance between which one's working better for you there sale no standard any more for heat or cold in that way but from a standpoint of post o work out healthy states a i have not use much heat or cold in terms of what we do w you my cover the topic of the cold showers and to try to dispel the width of the a even people saying that there is trying to stocstron releases and in all kinds of stuff that listen we here all kinds of things cause people wat i think the idea just turning the water cold and being in it for thirty seconds and then all the sudden magically growing three times your size is intriguing to of people and they and that is why they ask these questions cane like ill be a he lot easier than i to pier in training hard but i got always fascinated by some of the stuff that that you talk about fact we start a talk about some of the stuff in terms of cooling and what it can do on performance and that's there there is some untapped territory there that i think you are you are finding out about at who we fun would be to bring the cool it technology from stamper this is crag he at my collie crew heller s a rabbit tampers one really important in a amazing work in this area but then i moved on to some other things he is also working on bouncing german he works on a number of other really important topics a sing is often do a but i have a access to the schoolmate technology no relationship to the company by the way wed love to come out to your facility and and a we can do the blind a ripe studies and blue blocker exactly and i and see how that goes i in in with somebody advance as advanced trained to you i the that is pry best in to a content for the future i ye i think heat and collar are kind of staples in the peaty world an night does see my people use them ism slightly differently but they are they are kind of the maker new treats of of recovery there along along a sleep i i would i do have a question about precision of record keeping do you keep a training journal it you recommend people keep training journals are you nauradically fixed to cadets of movement and are you looking at the you have a buzz er going off for night when it is ninety seconds rest as it ninety seconds rest i confess have my slow work outs and my faster work outs i and they scale with when ism training heavier with longer rest or whether not maybe midway through a work out or shift over to doing higher repetition lower rest this this kind of a mi tuna crude way of o keeping time but ism not you do not will be just a con a watch the clock but ism not nauradically five to the buzzer nor am i on social media during my work outs which is that she way to really improve workhouse's to just not be on social media i cannot claim them not guilty of that sometimes i am on social media ut sometimes on trying to post something the that's different is er it is er an it is terrestion but i been i am i ism not ism not a necessarily a chain to some sort of protocol in terms of how i do i think by this wo been doing this a long time annotoly is it some that have done for a long time but it it is a passion of mys an they are really enjoy i probably inherently have the ability to stick to these these a guy lines an terms of rest time a to now what i lifted yo know even six months ago on a lift and an an how it fell without journalling it but i recognize the value it has to a lot of people goes back to that whole my muscle connection idea tax we talked about in the beginning there is a lack of wariness for all aspects of training it specially maybe it is not your r interests lovely and we are talking you and i from a a a position of interest this is what we do we we enjoy just how our bodies work in understanding how they work some people do not care the this want the end result but journalling in keeping track of that raises a awareness to realize all mi got i i have been on the a integrand for last seven minutes and it'll suppose to be back at my next set and ninety seconds there is a training effect of that an ice you you if your training for metabolic overload you have blown that opportunity because you have yo your rest time was very a was very important to that pro to call working as it should if you are training for strength may be the extra few minutes does not matter much when you get back and the mar you might find i mean you might find that it is a better response for your body to rest even longer than you have been told free four minutes five minutes and that way may be at helps but i think that anything you can do to increase your awareness of your performance and also give yourself some objective goal whenever we have an objective goal as lories your was she obtain it when you are just there to get a pump an you are just there to lift how you feel that day you have to be incredibly discipline in all other aspects of your work out in order to make that effective and i ad have done that too have actually been able to do that too but i gan the level of repetitions have accumulated over the course of my life in the in the amount that it that i you'll read about this stuffing ism i think ism able to get away with that but but i think more often than not what ism doing is not journalling but turn at curling in my head exactly what i think people should be doing in that is getting a specific effect from what you are trying to do it is not haphazard you want to get a specific effect just any other experiment that you down you do not experiment on your own body with your own ways which to me is one the most empowering thing someone can ever do when they get bitten by the bug for you exercising and in training and a ilea to house wore training ins rather than exercise as a purpose behind it for when they get bit n by that training bug and they start to see actual changes and results you powering that is was we cannot cannot we cannot really control that many things in our life unfortunately ans there is some things that happen to us that we really wish never happen and those are not something that we can do anything about but this is one thing that we can do our best town cannot avoid disease entirely we cannot predictor in a die we cannot yo do those things but we can certainly decide to show into the him that day and get a work out in or go for run or do something and by doing that you are giving yourself i think the better chance of a higher call your life anything you can do to increase your awareness of it and keep you on track with that is ism adoring fully could not a gree more i could not agree more the there is a topaz it of a dreaded topic what i thinks an important one in that is the topic of nutrition and rather they gan into specific meal programs which yo would take take hours and en probably would not even manage to scratch the surface even with ours i we could talk about principles around nutrition water sort of the schemes that you think people should keep in mind i wanting about how to eat generally and are training and post training are two particularly sensitive times for most or times to people want to know all to about yo what should they eat before training or can they train fast age which shouldthey eat afterwards but fiction general what eating ere some some axioms of of of nutrition that that really hold and i ask us i of because not because the is a lot of debate about this but because been around this face a long time an and you seem what works for you obviously but for other people to what tends to work what tends not to work and em ow shall we think about nutrition i mean it you you've touched oat bit but hem nutrition can be a touchy subject for people and in i understand where that comes from my have talked about before the there is a dogmatic tendency to to nutrition and there is a reason for because it is an area that people struggle with more than anything else and the reason why people struggle with nutrition is because the commitment is extremely high you could start to work out for gram in actually get to the him three to five times a week that is five hours based on how you and i were discussing it before well what about the other twenty three hours of each of those days there is opportunity to eat in correctly or unhealthily every one of those hours people wake up in the mild and lie to go eat you like there are there are things that you can do that can cause amazing amounts of damage o to your longevity in the twenty three hours not the one hour the twenty three hours when people finally figure out of away to make that work for them it is very passionate and i understand their passion i do have put out my approach my approach is have always been sort of a low sugar low work fat guy have made the mistake of going no fat years ago and i paid for it i was liking college and you back in the day we are the same age we read all the magazines and our that was what we have have it er not then we were we were reading magazines and the recommend path was to go low fat o it helps you to become i pol colonic very easily because the density of the cut calories yon a gram of fat verses a gram of carbohydrates of proline is nine verses for for the carves an proline if you are cutting out grams of fat on a daily basis you are quickly cutting out calories that allows you to get leaner well of course as everything i mean i if little is good than a lot is better i would cut all of them out or almost all of them and at the age of twenty to twenty one like standing at a a stop i up it university connecticut waiting for the tram to come and bring me to campus and i could not even open my eyes because the light was blinding to me it was normal sunlight it was blinded to me the fool sensitivity i had learning later on after a few more courses that i took there and biology you know how how r necessary fat was for the development of healthy a sells i i realize what was going on o nothing at other stuff skin was bad hair was fallen out all kinds of stuffs i i i think that the approach to decreasing fat is not excessive you because again how calorically dance it could be in having lower sugar i don ism o a firm believer and sugar is really pretty toxic and o something that we would all do better getting rid of a lot of it o that is the best approach for i believe again in my opinion personally for the over all big picture because though the people can take exclusionary approaches to nutrition in taking cars out or eating only fats and proteins or again ism not saying it does not work for you and if it is the first thing that actually allowed you to gain control of you nutrition to the point rectally see resultant got to a healthier weight then i always say then do it then do it but just make sure something you can do forever and does not bring upon other repercussions but i think that non exclusionary approaches to diets are the the most sustainable for the rest of your life and when i and all ism interested in from a patrician standpoints something as sustainable when i preach what i preach up been down this since i was fifteen fourteen yo people styli has he get ripped has yo we i have been doing this for fort since for how many years thirty thirty years threaten clinic low sugar ye thirty years you know and in the beginning it was a slow ship i had to make wheres i went from the worst die in the whole world i was even when was fourteen years all my breakfast was i thought about the common times but enemies i would eat enemies do not us and in those long road emote outer of ye an from en took the whole out of the dona ye a why would you why would you defeat the mittleona to o the drum the drum dona there i o i would i cannot dotting my i do not sugar very much over the years have lost my appetite for sugar i have dog by the engrain as i can legally smell and tit us the frosting and to me now it is discussing about then it might have been appetite would probably have really good information on this but my ability to actually remember i knowtheyve said smell is very invoking of memories have it there is a smell is unlike the other senses as there is a redirect long literally from our sense of smell to the memory centers of the brain it does not have to go through any intermediate stationtha my ability to actually recall exact taste of all the stuff that was to love is enough to satisfy me to not to not engage in those things now is crazy that is i i almost get my fill to remembering cause these strong senses of a memory of what it was as odd is to taste look at that is got i had it that an was yet a well that is that is we know the demodulator there that is opening your ability get the the doping release from the thought of somebody not or people when they get that opening release i cause is a a triggering of the desire from morn or my people thin of opening is pleasure downing it that there is a book great book called the molecule of more i did not write the book unfortunately but some one else did and it is a great book and it is really bout dope mean we think it is about pleasure but it establishes rang still you are able to satisfy that and it it is a very adapt o thing for you because you are indeed very lean ye and that is one of your kind of hall mark things and you as a professional who does this in the public space that is important when people are out there going out getting lean or i look at them an you it may be you need to do the protocols a it is a huge advantage but ye i think that am it sounds you cultivated practices around avoiding certain things yes yet i mean but not you avoiding certain things that i think are easily avoided if you realize that the in think to we have enough science and literature out there to prove that the the altered path is a better path o me i feel tiki if i was just doing it because i want to be lean am not quite sure it would have held for long no and we have a guess that a whose episode has been recorded for this podcast who runs and eating disorder clinic at the university pennsylvania medical school study's been seeing disorders and erect e a o sexy and and he will go on record and be city and he will go on record saying that these very highly palatable process high sugar foods of the sort that were talking about am do not uts and forth that they are actually dangerous write that there are elements of the way that they engage normal circuitry has nor o surgeon that reshape the brain in dangerous ways and those are his words and i take aneles s yea a is enemies i i think not s moments i a father coming o with what we do not they cannot catch us an sure a in any case a to in terms of what you do eat howdy structure that am in terms of when you look down at a plate you done these escribe this before by the it is just a beautifully simple description cause i think love people do not want to gallery canting in all this and body how should people think about what to eat yet i have what while call plate method and insist it just simple cause it works for me a and and again if you are struggling with a with real eating issues these these mechanisms become i midday less effective because your having may be aver mostly trigger eating and you cannot stop at one plate i mean that you can get the plate right but f the portions are out o control plate i plate has a dementinality oil wo multiple plates a li a second third plate fly right then all these things can be challenge but what i what i say is a when you have your plate then you just simply look at it as a a a clock right and a if you just make a nine twenty on the clock one arm goes over to the nine an one of the arms goes over to twenty well then you are basically you can to take the the second largest portion of that which in you make the line towards twelve o'clock to and the largest portions going to be your fibrin carbohydrates that is the the thing of the green vegetables i whether be brolly or brusselsprouts sir asparagus or youknow you picture pick your favorites those of the ones that give us alow that my for newtrane we need there the ones that are generally yo except it as more healthy a and they are all so in to probe the fiber that is going to be both beneficial n turns of its in pact on insolent and all just through filling you up right and then i take the next largest portion of that and i devote that words proline at ain't really important especially for anybody active a the more active you are the more you embark on trying to build muscle you are going to need to have prating every meal i have that and again you o were talking cleaner sources of protein but it's you will never find boiled chicken on my plate i ditch those days when i was sixteen or fifteen or sixteen i realized after reading those finable to magazines that maybe the low fat things stuck for too long but the are the no fat things sick for too long but the boiled chicken and in a a a steam brock we thing that ended quickly for me cause ever ism i can to eat this for ever it'll have some sort of fish or chicken and but they'd it will be it will be cooked in a way that is that is you just got maybe some sauconeters got some maybes tomato saw it is anything just just make a lobe more payable interesting without blowing the value of the meal and then that last portions where i put my starry carbohydrates and again that is the part that some people a exclude them entirely cause are not healthy er they do not work for you or the not the on beneficial long term for me it is been a godsend and and i do think ism most people my body craves those carbohydrates i choose things sweep potatoes which is my favor it you or it'll have a rase sir it'll have pasta i a mammalians i pasta and i will have those things of not excluding them but i do not put them in the portions you would generally find a my wife and i will go out an d will go the restaurant sometimes because we travel a quite a bit or used to lease with baseball to there is a cheesecake facture of where you went and i love cheesecake factory but the way they structure meals is it is all rice on the bottom and all the chicken on top and i mean it is a plateful of rights that you would not find me make a plate that way it'll got to just devote that portion on the plate to the struck carbohydrate and it gives me a little bit more responsibility an terns o portion control cause those are the foods a again probably you do not been driven that are most easily over eaten i always asked the question haw was lost time to eight ten chicken breast at a meal you are getting sick of it after maybe two or three but you could eat a whole hull lot of carbohydrates starchy carbohydrates because the there just satisfying and i think those triggers as you said to want more that is what happens right you just keep you even the you refueling full you want more a and that is the biggest danger to carbohydrate if you can develop some sort of is a plan around them am then you can still enjoy them if you cannot develop that discipline a for whatever reason than maybe they do become something to have to work yourself around or or a adopted to for being style and as i said ism never to the point where ism not trying to be dogmatic an my approach ism always trying to say this is how i do it and ism and ism a believer in it just everyone ease's believer in their method but ism open to the idea that something that works for you and gets you to a a healthier went an a sustain ability that is good that is it is good for me you on provided does not introintroduce other other issues gets something one can do consistently that is only i picked up from you a over the years what can you do consistently and for me that also meant what when and how can i eat what can i eat consistently that will also allow me to be alert after lunch can ashen get some work on ye a for eat i to train fasted in the morning but i do not do any long turn fasting just happens that ism fine doing a watering cabin in the morning and a training in the morning and then that you might first meal afterwards it just but i get arbitrates at night mi age in are rioters sort i i think carpidrates are wonderful i just do not eat them an excess to me it i i feel when what you describe as a very rational literally balance to preach a an obvious see there will be variations for people whoa dealing with o cecity or diabetes or i have got friends there on the the pure carnivore thing have friends that a vegan and i it is always impressive to me when somebody can a stick to anything consistently he's i except when there's ticking to just poor behavior r isn't there is nothing impressive about that awe think that that is very helpful i because i think there is for the typical listener of this podcast eater the online content that people see the battles are very confusing the there distracting i just people really think all that there is a right way in a wrong way and it is it sounds the way that one can am eat consistently over time that is healthy am certainly fewer process in sugary foods i thing almost w everybody else ye most everyone agrees on that right i i think it is at it is it is a it is salary manipulation through some other method i even even intimate fasting liking he said i that can be it is it is for people that are grazers if you are a grazer and your real problem is portion control over the course of the day but you can respond to a rule that says no you are eating between here and here that you can obey that rule well you are not going to real the graze during the times that you might be doing additional damage a sure there is there is there is other hormonal benefits that people will talk about from that approach but from a longevity standpoint and habit forming standpoint if it is fixing the habit that you are breaking too often by eating throughout whenever you feel you walk by food am it is good the loin at works and again the its it is it is the a people can will tell you you can probably eat whatever you want at eat as long as you are eating within those that window but i think them m responsible people who practitioners of that will say no you still want avoid process sugar and in things that a and that is the mechanism of eating not really a diet right but it is it is i think that people i i hate a i hate to be as as as basic as as it sounds with have what is for the exact reason that if it is that twenty three hour day phenomenon that is you said you are impressed it is impressive you now it is hard to control all of our behaviors in food being one of the hardest thing o a biggest temptations for people you'll learn how to control that for long and then do it day after day after day a whatever that mechanism is that works for you it is is impressive in i in an am panama ism ism a believer in it i think that is the that is that is how i feel i fill it people need to be able to be given some rains to be able to the defend a works for them well i love to eat in one of the beauties of way training as i feel i can eat plenty for my age and ism not as lean as you are but ism am a happy with ceramal a always do better he cheer a shag of getting better a problem as am meeting cleaner a as i all have on a cook for me now and we no help and we like have that i hae that and we healthy food and were very fortune i do not think we have any package food in our home we must tattoo making sour crowd at home i do not make it as she makes it well we my wife actually she she a turn me on to a tipitactl shared with with the whole channel which was you can you can go to a we have a to leopards around our or big pegrociou store chain around us and they have a cater in department and the other often use for catering bi parties an yo big tubs of o of girl chicken but really good great chicken again not the boiled chicken but your big tubs of see potatoes and we will there will get bunch of those and shall go over a shall get that shall sort of arrange ye of them on plates and put the plates in and ism o cay with repetitive eating i think more people or probably icy with repetiveng than they think i think that wen you actually break down how many different breakfast variety i vexations you hat three to to r havesomeem like i think when people do this more variety for dinner probably but you even there you probably t five different types of dinners to knower the course of a week er a month well if you have that ability to identify the things that you and again no plan is get a work if your eating stuffy do not it is nocking work for ever nothing will you have to really enjoy were your resting as long as these these a variations of this meal or something you really enjoy in there are limitinversions of them the reproduce ability of that is simple it well take some time but if your fortune enough in our case to have somebody who can prepare it for you now that is even par out of the equation and it is it is it is it it just makes it very simple but i do think wen you tally up all the costs of medical care that that's that a spit ked by having poor nutrition and you then off set that by what it might cost you to invest in a faster strategy this catering trick or whatever it might be you be best off figure out a way that may be replicate some of your money the preparing this because how how for is there long turn health an in longevity if you can figure out your nutrition issues of every one listen to socks can figure out their nutrition issues this whole for be different that is what o largest sources of disease and in pain and discomfort because people really struggle nutrition and is it it is a huge problem n in he of you see it isn't epidemic in the canary om very very serious ism also a lot of poly processfudes are a more expensive than healthy when you really right rake i down a even not even the better source i high quality flows are riot there on par less than a the process foods for sure a i but couple other questions as it relates a to training a because i think that one one thing that a lot of people wonder about may be we could do this an kind of a true false a method a forsake just to get through some of these o if at right it least at exactly am men and women should train differently the science of it will say false a the and again not not to generalize but count of the point you touched on earlier to day i do find that casually interested women in training well migrate more toward certain types of fitness kick boxing dancing low rest circuit i ye ye ye and and i think again whatever t is that you are going to engage in regularly it is what you should do physiologically know and i think if if if we can get more women to feel more comfortable in the him performing the same exercises the same a in receiving the same strain training benefits in working on progressive overload and the and we hit the holy grail but i think that it is a it is a a big bridge that has to be tapped still because a there is just some reality to listen that there are very my wife it is a per example this leave living a very complicated busy life a we have two young boys there their twins and her her attention and focus is there and it is she she does not do this for a living i do and if she can get a decent work out and she is happy but she is not necessarily working on her dead lift pair and i think that that would help her and serve her in the long term to work on increasing her her plane's and different lifts in building her strength progressively but you know in her life right now it is not necessarily in the cards to have the time the focus on that would you then discourage this other thing that she might find interesting some a boxing what there there is a little a i remember the bran but one of those punishable boxing a stand up things eland she enjoys it and i anything to get to get you moving is going to be preferable but do not think that necessarily physiologically the the difference you stare wait train pretty young yum until i nest around we know with my brother cause you was older in out for yours older sauce kin nesting around a waits probably tell or thirteen with the five pound don't of yet you hear that a young kid shouldn't work out with the weights i do not know the going a standard is now they say you shuts down long bone growth or a growth plates sh at this sort of thing i you got to young boys honorable kits by the way ye i wanted that when the things that is is very a heart worming is to see it you are in great shave icy extremely bright your craft you love your craft i you work wit jess who o will talk about us well am this go which is great that there is a comerotter e there and the having great teen mates start of a business r or to work out t is just makes better let us be honest ism grateful to have great tea mates for the pockets and my lab of course as well but to see your boys an your dogs and get the whole picture you knows its a ism sure it has at a lot of o contours in complex that we do not know about in should not know about but it is a beautiful picture and e will they wait train have seen the videos of i wonder both of them can from the bars is and naturals all telling yo i do not wonder where they get i do not in know i do not even encourage t i not give you the dad who sit in there a say let us go somewhere ya we are two days were i look in nothing to do that but they they have a natural interest in the him they to sometimes to be out with daddy the come out there and i i of the two of us my wife and i will be the one who has a little bit more of a longer lease to let them explore things cause i was a a done me at times to and figured out best through the mistakes i injury e got did not norsince we call that one travel learn her now what o these guides be masters of one to learning because o no they'll go grab yet the the bars of my the handles of my jammer then there at lower level tor them and there is shining around or do not pull ups to at naturally coach nothing from me am will walk up to a get live bar stand over an naturally never saw me do it stands over there viscous risky a tries to pull its there is at there is a deafly an inclination to liking the him and i will fully support that but of course you know body it will be good for quest i what at you think is reasonable for is to start exploring a non body weight a yo think around thirteen i thing about thirteen once purity i think it say to start to am cause there is much i even say for people that a later an age who are just starting out learn with your nobody i first us plenty of resistance to be had by learning how to command your body in space if you have never train before you going to get very stimulated by doing lunging and reverse dungeon even learning some appropriate caption around movement through space pull ups chin ups both to chimps o challenging for even people have had twenty thirty years of experience in the him there is a lot of stimulus to be had by body way and jumping straight to dumbbells or barbells is actually doing yourself at to service you can learn better command of your body in space we go back to the bigger lives a you are going to have at easier time sort of progressively loading them in building up that foundation of strength ism not saying that you have to become a master calostacs apply before you can touch of barbell that's not even true ism just saying there is much capacity kids ore to be doing this anyway really just if you look at general play they are jumping thy are lunging they are living they are pulling i that is what they do an know a why i do not know where the avoidingsof structure training is for younger kids again pro bi their using bodywaight may be a you less holistic movements for something that you things tare in the er or certainly overloaded movements a i think we than courage kids to do more there is a lot of a obsidian an kids on the rise also and that is incredibly the disconcerting to me i think in i and i hope it does not come from the advice of some that say will wait until your older to start doing something that is a way worse trained off can then then engaging something smart now we see get kicked out of the house when wing your kid totally my mom kick us out i o o i ta huge pack of boys a live on my street but we get kicked out side i we live long y r not about in the i no tell of i there re video games of course but we were were kicked out of the house we had ti first to escape wording soccer and then we we would find our trouble i a am post training nutrition were the same age a years ago i sort of neurotic about the idea that i had to unjust a certain amount of carbohydrates approaching within two hours than it was ninety minutes of training i confess i get if i train hard sometime by the resistance training not the running but the resistance training you sixty to ninety minutes later really hungry but they're been was when i just skin then the hunger passes in the later i eat i eat more i mighty twice as much later o of that tat us the wast sometimes cat calls go but what are your thoughts an terms of the the nutrition sins the train the training related effects of a the post training meal is it something that you try to to get is it something you think people should pay attention to a that that science is actually probably been the the one that is change the most in my lifetime honestly because i i i gain were the same age and i was falling for the saying a trap you were i would really efolkistily ism isms ism risking speeding tickets driving home from the him no we get i gotten in the colic window you know i i did all the i really did yo but a thankfully that is been sort of defunct an in your body it is not just rushing through these certain periods of time to you to lives the new tries in our bodysurf able to partition them and use them over along much greater duration up to now there saying y of three to four hours after training five hours up to train you gun still see the untie benefits of of replenishment all that is just i think there is a consistency element to it am that just utilizing a postwar out window or a postwar out meal even of its within two hours or one out is just in gaining the habit of saying ligand i just did this activity and now want a replenish some of what i lost the energy that i used to perform the other the exercise that i did and just getting into the routine knowing that the the engine is ultimately fed by what we put in it and the concept of replenishing the fuel lost is still a concept that i think again different in mechanism but still in porting in terms of fueling you over all performance the other the the rework out period of time gives us a chance to actually have a longer window because of that if those neutrino er are obtained rework out it is not their going in that hour that you trained there is still there in available for your body use you i think it is important to get one of the two we don't writer at least make sure you are your consistently of it a having one or the two or you might risk going through all these periods of of having no nutrition to support your efforts not only we work outspotentially supper and turns to the output but then you are also not providing your boding any ability to capitalize on on a and opportunity to feet it and refuel and recover i ism not very dogmatic about what specifically to to eat free or post won't work out but i do think you should have propene a surrounding your your training whether that be head of time or after procaine could be a little bit hard to digest for some people if you do that rework out in then your finding your work out snogging because you do not feel good tan sonly you put that after your meal but this whole concept of the urgency of time as thankfully been removed an we can just learn to eat a little bit more a to responsibly in drive more responsibly were not know trying to rush home from the gimme risk yon killing people on the way i i think i think it is a but i think it is great because i think that that was something that just show cases of belief that people had for long that has since been proving to be not that important and there is it there is a there is a tip of the cap towards research in a good way where's er i i think we could all agree that this is not necessarily true any more am and look to yourself and say oh my got i did that off i i bit thatlont of fin a thinker but a but then realize that can't we could always make a change and the good thing about nutrition is those changes can happen the very next time you go toe owing you will such to see the benefits of that ism a ism ism not a beg believer in that strict approach to are or post work out am in even as far as rework out supplements a lo people do not take a lo people do not hem thay'n't take them they do not they are not necessarily even being used as the nutritive side of the rework out they are just more new use to fuel the work out om stop for me it is a water in of some form of canine ye i mean it is it whatever you know again i think it is important i do thing is important to maintain a high level about put if your rework inetrician requires a stimuli nor to help you do that or if you rework nutrition is causing you to have a harder time the train because your feeling full or stomach take or something else than n that that is not achieving what u trying to do the ultimate got is to still be able perform at the highest level whatever you nutrition is require til li is still do that that is my the most important factor of all of it right i love the very clear and rational preach do not invest anything right before your work out or near your work out that is going to make your work out worse an even can it is simple and yet you do not hear that because i think people think o they must have a rework at they must have a put again i oven if there the the benefits that are to be had from whatever being suggested is going to be easily offset by the fact that you cannot perform at an out put capable of driving any change that that would pi promustngait the fact that their know there is no you are not out weighing those benefits of whatever untruth to reproach tug but ens to struggling for your work out o for me the best rework out is a good night sleep hydration caffeine music come they work formerly works and the pop where i do i do find i get quite hungry in one you quite a bit moron and fellas a natural response the body's going to in most people want to do that and i think it should be get i work out as you again lot of my postings on sister gram will happen at ten o'clock at night ten thirty at nine eleven a night as i am actually training there and that is for ism taking those little breaks in between satstactually film or post something but like i then go inside at dinner ism eating at eleven o'clock at night no it is not necessarily ideal on that recommending that's a tool for anybody i think it dispels one thing have never been a believer and can it carves after six no i makes in o sense to me you are last on all the new all the sine of metabolism that have seen rinses i think as long as you can serve napping i talk to mat walker one of the great sleep researchers wrote why we sleep et veteran an as is don't carcass about sleep tremendous research r public communicator about sleep en he said your naps are fine provided they do not interrupt your ability to sleep well at night right simple o me when sleep from eight to nine p m and then go to bed at midnight and not a problem other you all take a thirty minute nap after lunch and they cannot sleep at night i something witcaffines one different because not would argue the architecture of sleep can be disrupted et camera but you can eat dinner late e a carbohydrate sleep i should need arbitrates at night in order to be able to sleep whenever have done a low carbohydrate type regimen in the evening i have a hark time falling sleep on is to alert hands i eat arbitrates in it an evening to restore licagin but all s o in order to make sure that i can fall see i i actually can k again ovosslyt's alreadylate at night by time we don eating but i could fall asleep within five ten minutes of finishing my meal yo because i i i do think that they have that same effect on me u but ism never by to ism not bothered by the feeling of fullness ism not ism no unable to sleep because of feeling a fullness am but i do i i do the fact that i i feel as if ism at least replenishing what was lost through my hard training and i do to back it up with a a dinner i do not need to eat smaller amount some people cannot have that mu i will say after a hard leg work out i do not have the same appetite that i do after less say an upper body work out it can really destruct my my whole feeling of o of well be you want to eat less after outran your legs i do yet a well i ism the opposite i no cause i just feel i could eel sick to my stomach ye you are clearly training hardihave seenouati want you do train very until yet yew ye i i ma support i may not think that again it is that trade off between if you are not going to train for a long period of time i then you are gin to want a train harder and again i i actually feel contrary to what people might think as you age you are better off training harder for shorter period of time am need it it is always within the the realm of of of safe training man i think that is what i i to thing this i bring to the table an approach that smarter i can train harder not doing the dumb things i did when i was a kid am an with that know trade off being a harder trainer i i think i it the results that i want because ism able to really push it and then back off and and again that tithe meal feels a almost a physiological reward for the hard effort i put in the him knowing that ism rustle replenishing and and an setting the stage for the next day to be another successful day of training net wore may be not can time bye a times a week i i train but yet i i i think that it is i is a lot less it is a it is a lot i could say butts lot less scientific then we want a make it and as it seems to be coming back often times the thing that works for you is really the most important thing because ultimately getting your ask and there in doing what you do is is really the thing that provides the best benefit absolutely in can there's many things that i would say a hole march said eff cavalier but one one of them is certainly consistency you make it happen you're another huge i ma consistency really is the the determinate and i and i know that that is the hardest part for people that and why people tend to look for the short cut cause consistency of the part that ye that becomes the biggest challenge but am if you could find it lessen if you could find the woman of yo through what ism an trying o encourage here as i if you could find the nutrition approach if you could find the training approach if you could trot find the training split if you could try all those things that encourage you to want to go the him you are locked in at the point where o that you actually look forward going in doing o i look i i love it i look for a timing it is it is actually this morning who went aby a one of our tee mention the podcast i i got work out and half way through is turn when i said ism never figure out why that feels good but it feels good i just i really enjoy it and it let us and i love to eat and it less me eat and i love the way t makes yo feel afterward i do not understand this concept of not in going the him cardiac a little different i i always loathe the first ten or twenty minutes of get dog i mildly loath the middle third and by the end i think this is the greatesthing ever on only down all right a demand then that feeling evaporates the the next time i corse any remember either began exactly i i a i think if people could if if if we had one gift we could give to everybody would be the love of fitness for if they could be bestowed the love of fitness o would change the entire world but i think when you hear things this that he that will work and that will work too and that this will work to you rather than the dogmatic one way only approach a which could become discouraging for people a then i think it becomes all it up lifting have never tried that have actually never tried a total by splitter never tried he know that style of eating it becomes encouraging my my why explore and the you might finally get locked in have really this and then you are often run let us a what i enjoy about your content i we would be remiss if we did not am disbriefly discuss a jess am one of the great pleasures from me and in watching your content and learning from it over the ears as that you took on a you decide to enter somebody am jess and there is a there some poking for back and forth between the two of you which is very amusing but have to say it inspired me to do something a early on developing this podcast as i have a a young in turn who am has helped me with some of the research and he is a butting he is interest in science he is about to go off to college but he els got really into fitness we watch the it he as of you guise he was helping me get the instragram content out early on and one thing that as just it was such a pleasure to be able to pass along knowledge and and of course ism learning from him the uses is always the way it work i learn what i teaching we learn from students a but it is been great to see vessels progress that is amazing getting meet him in person a just now and and i he is he has grown he is changed physically and and i think that you mention a love of fitness i think that in it one of the best ways to be consistent is to take on the responsibility of teaching others one s one has proficiency and i think am may you just tell us a lot about how that is going how was jess doing and am were were where does he see o more work where's he thriving a ism impressed by the progress will we have be physically we can have is we see thethethe change s in the list of things to work on or is is immense is long for him to contain i prove but no act in reality jess the story of jess was that i do jess prior a starting even atlas acts and admire i fact to think the anything is the very first video that was ever posted on my channel was o video that he shot as i do not know a thirteen year old or something and i think he you just filmed this first second i was over there to yo to training a members of the family a he then off went off the college when in to film realize he had much a greener pastures that the next instead of a become the next to corsair something and he decided to come a work with me an and you've the expectations in the beginning were just to edividios or just to a you help with serious aspects of of my day to day that i do not think i was you equipped table handle and grow the business any more am then you know look it by by virtue of being in that environment there is an interest i think if i worked in the him i might become interested in working out and though not in is not a commercial him its sitting right behind my office how a window am there became an interest in onion to work out a little bit and it was not even an intentional experiment yet to put jess there i just to thought that he is a very likable person he has a very funny personality he is also the every man he know in some ways as ism sure maybe you experience sometimes ism the guy that thirst comes naturally for me is what people will say this is what you do for a living than this is what you there is at there is an element of disconnect in terms of the relate ability because i do do this for a living i cannot deny that i do work with professional athlete see there is a level of interest in this above i beyond but for him hes just the kid who wants to train maybe if he trolls out of bed before eleven i m a and does not have a date on fridge night but that is the guiverybody can relate to and watching him transform am and i love the fact that even the interests level ya a was up and down lie it was not consistent for him because he was part interested and the may be not is for three months and that interested in a and i never pushed it on him as this is again this was no orchestrate experiment for me it was just if you want to do this than do this and also from a standpoint am lending my help er expert time to him i said with my son it'll not get is force on him but id's will not do that anybody i do not think that that is o vegan spark that desire for long term y adoption he got more interested hes started a learn more about it he watches videos that were filming he films of vets that were filming and he is learning through what ism saying he is becoming more of a student of the field and i i have to say his knowledge in the field has grown with the the growth of his physique and he is put in the practice of the things that i say hes pain practice somethings he hears other places and he wins of yow improving as he goes and he wants of starting to love this he yow never thought he would am but it is great to see anybody grow and whether that be physically or the be emotionally o r the be just and in their career its great to see somebody go o and i i to tease him a funny admission here there are times when the jabs that will throw at him are something that we might know ahead of time what ism going to say to him a people will say you are mean to him i cannot believe it your get abusive an id honestly we laugh after it is over it is good for good t course but but h re tougher than he looks as what you say he is government looks blank i looks pen life i he is got the big beard hes a he is looks more manly than i o i cannot grow beard lido not i mean believe he is the he is tolly ala and i quickly becoming the second the second star of this show but he is deafly a a contributed and people enjoy his presence for sure e i certainly do and i think that a you you point out he is a kind of a proxy and a templet for for everybody we can relate to him yes ism even not train for many years that it it is been a struggle and youtrough graduate school stock you know it made it happen one way or another but with more or less attention and i admittedly through wit you know waxing waning levels of a motivation although a youunfortunate that do enjoy it what i think is nice about it to is that it is it it is a realistic expectation that we said i think you another as your your show casing what the journey actually looks and he is been on the journey for again you devotedly for let say to last were an a half but on the journey for five years if i could make the gains that he did starting when ice train started training at they fourteen fifteen and your stand his be twenty you are going to have the strength levels he does the physique that he does the knowledge the you have gain that seems the blink of an eye now looking back at forty six years old in holy colic i think it took me to went years so fifteen twenty years he ought to just even start to get into a groove for him to do it at in a period of five years it does not seem long work there is people that will criticize his journey always to taken long it soli ti such an instant gratification ye other people seek luckily that is the minority most people are this is amazing ah but i think that it becomes very uplifting because not only is relatable but the journey it is real and people kin and people can appreciate that this is what will happen if you actual putting consistent handwork and you will watch him transform go back andwatch o videos you look it we to oftentimes throw back the videos where he appeared as smaller chest but also shy messy arms cross head down not making y contact with the camera to where now he is got his own sets and intros its it is it is it is funny because the confidence with with the growth of physique came confidence to which is great slept said pretty soon i be his world in world thetic in as the say well on behalf of myself and all the listeners i really want to thank you a first of all for the discussion to day i learn an immense amount even though i thought i w your contain well i still learn in fence amount many things we could deploy from when to stretch how to stretch the skipping robe a huge but nutrition dot ago he culled training regimens and what i love about all this non that you have given us is that there is a there is a backbone of logic and in some consistent themes indeed about consistency and but that the the logical backbone i think is wet we will enable people to really show up to the table and stay there ah for training consistently over time as you said the gift of fitness is an immense skiff i cannot thank you enough i i know you incredibly busy human being with kids and dogs and an a marriage and managers as was ism happy as it will make a work as i really give n watching step for a while and i really i love the science of it a the way you think ah and it is he know i ism is very fortunate this it will do well i feel very

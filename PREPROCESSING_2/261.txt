from w be easy chico it is this america life our glasses off this week ism show call there is this guy who is been on our show a few times now kick loosen he is this extraordinary person in his early twenties he went to a rock and rand rebuilding projects and beluga for essay idea after the invasion he saw that a rocks who worked for the us military were being threatened and killed because of it and were not getting asylum in the us and he was outraged hes single handed launch to campaign which changed us lawn thus and for years after he champion these cases saving thousands of people's lives it was beyond difficult extraordinary stressful job and did decompress kick took up fly fishing which his were today story actually starts it has nothing to do with a rock or refuges begins on a river in new mexico flyfishing just in case you do not know you are using the special lure that looks an insect ass the fly clothes on the water kick makes his own flies out things rabbit fir taking parts of one kind of animal using it to imitate another kind in order to catch a hard time kicks on the river with this guide guy am spencer sign as his back in two thousand eleven and at one point spencer reaches down to fetch something out of his tackle box ins kick and i caught this really colorful flash really beautiful looking fly and asked him what it was and he he pulls this thing out and it is its hit is a salmon fly that is it is used to catch salmon kick had only ever seen trout flies which are kind of brown or gray but this thing was intricately tied together with bird feathers and silvery thread may be an inch and a half long and of a moth sized peacock an impressionists version of an insect were a dream about an insect and it is got these enrolled and canary yellow and ruby colored strips from feathers of of these exotic birds may be it ten or twelve species in total and there arranged in this really or name pattern were the booklets in the barbule boy connect this gets really n party yet but had never see anything it it is a beautiful piece of art and he then said to me goes will you think that is crazy should hereabout this kid who just broke into the brutish museum of natural history to steel hundreds of these exotic birds for their feathers which he sold to victoria salmon fly tires cause he wanted to buy a new golden flute an actual flute a musical instrument made of gold and a as soon as he said that in ow it's not ism not over dramatizes in the moment i was in the middle of a cast when he was tell me this and i just kind of froze i was this is the craziest sentence give have heard kick started plying spencer with questions on the spot he wanted to know everything they went back to spender's place that night and looked up the kid's profile on face book his name win wrist r i s t and even that did not seem a real name to me it seemed some nineteenth century he is one of these vice train boxers win had broken into the museum two years earlier an two thousand nine was a branch of button's natural history must in a little town called than kick starts goggling around to read everything he can find out about the case but there was not much just a few articles in the brutish press that covered the basics which work win wrist was from new york originally was in onion studying music is exceptionally talent at a flat he was only twenty when he told the birds two hundred ninety nine of them and not just any did birds there were from one of the most i portent collections and scientific history and also their feathers would fetch about a million dollars if he took them apart and sold them to salmon fly tires which you did some of them and he was caught the place arrested him and yet somehow you was now walking around free conditioning for orchestras in rope and a huge number of the birds were still an accounted for kick wanted to understand how this happened that a twenty year old lowest with no particular experience in museum larceny made off with some of the most precious specimens in the world and my wandered where the missing birds were dirk's guide spencer told him if you really want to find this specimens you should get yourself to the twenty first annual international fly tying symposium was in summer sent new jersey a the double tree homeland conferment center but a hundred people were there if you been to any trayshow you can picture it sort of a maze of booths selling all kinds of fly tying supplies hook's thread feathers and you by whole birds there too i i went to into one guy's booth an he had do a pretty large box just full of parakeet heads and the all of their beaks were kind of open they were chirping at the moment o i will not go to gory there but them were you about to say at the moment of their death yes gas is say at the moment of very decapitate but there are bits of birds everywhere the my with the parakeet heads was busily tying a fly and a hook clamped in a little vice and attached the feathers with thread wrapping it around the shaft all of these spectators were gathered around him he was a side walk magician doing a trick kick post is a customer at first but the guy could tell he was not serious about buying anything kick finally came clean and said to him that was thinking of writing something about that museum nice and he looks up from his fly and he said i do not think you won a wrist that story and i i said no why and he goes because were a small titi community in you do not want to piss us off and i what i was just let momentarily stunned but in in my mind i was holycalis is of is what would happen if you pissed them off i do not known like pull this card but i feel my time in folia has calibrated my threat perception of a indifferently pul ye maund a do to the bunch of feathers pinch between his fingers does not constitute a threat to me that is threat had the exact opposite effect on kick than he intend it and something kick in for kick at this play could sometimes does when he gets an idea an his hent to me it was just a very clear flare fire if he was trying to turn me away from the story it was just it was he had just filled my taco it was you it was e pay more attention to this this is crazy it is crazy the stuff kick found out i cannot turn away once you start hearing all the it tails not just about the highest and rest but where the birds came from and the whole serial sub culture of salmon flying what kick calls the feather underground sometimes characterized by shady dealings and obsession kick interviewed more than fifty fly tires and discovered things that the people investigating the case did not find out and that is our show to day the story of what may be the latest feather keeper in history expect hi drama and ornithology instar was o o o o oo on o asked one the specimens e quirk warning let this episode content threw swearwords that win unbend for the podcast version you can find virgin with beeps at our website this america life tot word the birds had we n still i said the were valuable some of them were collected in the mid eighteen hundreds by one of the greatest scientific explorers of his time a man named altered mussels walls he was another drawing and a peer of drawing altered palace spent nearly a decade thrashing through the malayarca pelage capturing in preparing animal specimens and shipping them back to inland he lived in tiny huts his flesh regularly invaded by bugs and about four years in he contracted malaria an figurate would just hunker down in his shack to sweet it out and while he is yet in the middle of this fever he has a eureka moment and figures out evolution through natural selection completely on his own he is have got it i figured it out and this is before drawing came up with it but this is the kicker he sits down and he writes this paper meant for publication and he puts it an envelope en he mails to charges day who had never publish anything on this yet drawing had figured it out too at that point but he had been too scared to put it out there these specimens were as important as drawings finches which by the way or also at the train museum their early evidence of evolutionary theory and specimens these can inform scientists about everything from climate change to the way we perceive color scientists are still using them altered palace himself once wrote that each species each bird is an individual letter building the words and sentences that described the deep history of our planet if we allow these letters to disappear that history disappears with them he also wrote that it is probably best if people from the west never sea birds these in their original habitat anal their beauty and glory because they just plunder them in ruin everything he had no idea how right he would turn out to be not long after there was an industrialized slaughter all over the world and it was in in the name of woman's fashion this was back when women were a lot of hats and anyone who was anyone were hats with a lot of feathers on them from parrots egrets sprays designers in the guess in rope could not get enough of the stuff whole species were decimated by the fashion in the say you see hats decorated with in tiger birds in the nineteenth century this was the gushy bag if you could only afford to robin that was one thing but if you could afford a bird of paradise and were talking about the whole bird being mounted with outstretched wings and and immenian sometimes these hats had several different birds mounted on them holy cry and it i and it is mum i mean that it is funny but it is it was how they demonstrated their own perch in society some women had many birds on their hats that they had squat just in order to fit into their carriages gaudy and inconvenient meanwhile the gentlemen of the draw were also sort of using feathers as accessories salmon flies were hats for goes this was also round the time that all these exclusive fishing clubs were popping up on the coasts of inland in scotland and each club had its own special patented salmon fly and the flies themselves had all these name s there absurd there the exordium the jack shot the dream's ranger can i i just wanted to just i just a give people a sense of o case o this is the recipe for the first fly that summon fly that win ever tied it is called the dirham ranger this is a recipe from the eighteen forties and the colored recipe yes the tale calls for feathers from the india crow which is the red rough fruit crow that is all over south america the but requires two turns of black ostrich hurl am the throat has light blue hacked usually from the eating ah which is from central america the wings have a pair of long jungle cock feathers with double pipits on both sides it goes on that the thee sir from the bird called a chatterer the horns or blue caw i was a part of course back then when you wanted these feathers you went down to the local plume merchant or in parts of plumier and you paid real money run the you're nineteen hundred certain snowy egret feathers were more expensive than gold for me all i cap fixating on was that this is this is all bullet has there is no reason why a salmon should care about any of this they do not i mean you you could tie a chocolate wrapper to a hook and catch salmon oh all of these little subtle tees of which sub species did you use for the cheek of the feather they do not even see any of that that that didn't matter to victoria salmon flytires back theme and these days the community tying this kind of fly still tries to do it according to the same classical recipes in these one hundred year old manuals except now they do not even fish with them they are just for show he's feathers from the same species arranged the same exact way the fixation is on historical authenticity a fly ting version are civil worry in acting but because we have murdered many birds for many reasons over the years a lot of the most coveted species are now endangered or protected there is a species of eating that is just completely i legal to to buy in sallets the eating acuate and they they completely ones over this stuff i have been struggling to find another hobby who is adherents are quickly driven to break international laws hen to do the art i mean you do not get into the dark side of knitting of course not every salmon flyte is breaking the law but some of them openly flout the rules ore just ignore them violators can be fine thousands of dollars there was a post on the main web form for this hobby classic flying dot come that some up the slavish addiction to certain feathers one guy said there is something a fly tied with the old materials and someone else responded have met this something ism haunted by it constantly now it is a drug nothing else matters nothing else compares when it touches my fingers i feel the history am taken back to a time when fish were as big as logs fresh from the sea reds yellows and shades of blues they are texture and color an that power to push you to do your best here was nothing else that compares to that power a to the flourish er gone to to talk o the win rest the e smelled him every now and then o wet the force of three years asking for an interview win always said no it was to to raw and then finely you agreed gave kick a week's notice kick and his wife marmoset fluted duzuldwarf where win was living playing in an onsondl which is the music you are hearing writ know but marijiose was worried they did not know the sky you broken into a museum after all who knew what he was capable of he was dangerous and they were meeting him at their hotel room they hired a german body guard who sat out in the hallway during the right hour interview they need not have bothered win well tall was not imposing even in his black peacoat he was friendly dark him though they are very different dirk's gosh carboy amidwesternness and twin's living in a rarefied world of flutes and feathers in rope we asked win if we could air parts of their interview on the show and he said no you will not hear his voice but a lot of what we know about how he came to be in the museum that night come straight from him he grow up in a quiet town in new york state south of albino uncut a sort of hairy potter with thick wirehair glasses bit of an endorse kid home schooled along with his younger brother and even back then he was shaping up to be a great musician twin's parents were both journalists and when win was about ten his dad was researching his story for discover magazine about the physics of fly casting win happened to watch an instructional video on how to tie flies using the specific kind of feather called a hack o able let us to the hackle around the base of the way that it floats lower in the surface and perhaps looks a may fly a rest and the feather is transformed it it suddenly the hook had a thousand little legs sticking out in every different direction now it looks a lick a senate yes and for whatever reason ten year old twin's brain was just frozen by this seen something ordinary transform into something extraordinary that was amazing to him win told kick that he and his brother watched that part of the idiom eight times and soon he was rummaging through the courage in the basemen looking for a hook and thread anything he could find to treat himself he plucked the feathers from his moms down pillow his dad seeing all of this finally brought win to a tackleshop got him a vice and some hooks and other materials he could start tying flies for real trout flies to begin with the ugly ones twin's brother got into a two they took classes spent hours hunkered over their creations an this kind of fuzzy trains before too long there were winning fly tying competitions and going to conventions and it was at one of those conventions were win laid eyes on his first summon fly it was at the booth of a prominent fly tyrant named toward muzzeroll or muzzy for short and once again little twin's mind just froze it was the same reaction kick hat that day on the water total be puzzlement and he is kind of own and in and he starts talking to muzzy and then before it he is arranging for private lessons with muzzy to learn how to do this this new type of fly tin new to win and i think he was fourteen when he went up to main one summer and and got lessons i think it was eight or twelve hour days fer muzzy proceeded to walk om through not just the the techniques but the history of this art form during that firstatorial with muzzy though where win tied the dirham ranger they used substitute feathers or subs meaning no rewrought fruit crow no black ostrich real instead used died chicken feathers or whatever and muzzy he been tying flies longer than win had been alive could tell right away that win was a natural a prodigy and at the end of that session that first session when muzzy saying good by he gives win an envelope and n in hush tone said this is what it is all about win opens the envelope and inside is a hundred and fifty or two hundred dollars worth of exotic bird feathers from the redraw fruit crow and from eating i think now mummy's stuff was legal and it was a gesture to this young akoliht almost a work your way up to these things when you get good enough her try using one of these redraw fruit cry feathers in that is when win caught the bug all he wanted to use in his flies were exotic bird feathers from then on he started doing cures for his neighbors gathering firewood just for little extra feather money he soon grew into a master fly tire which by the way means an expert mimicker able too consistently and perfectly hue to the same classic recipes again and again ut the was always this one limitation as to what he could accomplish as good as win got and and m he was heralded as the future of fly tine by fly tire magazine which i subscribed to all to he out he was completely embraced by this community by his sixteenth birthday think when he was a lenient already but as good as he was he was a sixteen year old who was not really flush with cash and whenever there was these occasional e bay auctions of of the species that he wanted he always got outbid by these wealthier older fly tires who had disposal income and he is devotion to this art form was kind of always to fined by a longing for what he did not have these other guides would say the i will it is a good fly but i no talk to me when he gets i real eating that is not enough fool that good no especially to a kid win has the specific way of talking perhaps cultivated from living in rope for many years and on the topic of using substitute feathers instead of the real thing he told kick the knowledge of its falsity eats at you in a way edit was a popper munition gazing through a shop window at a shiny musical instrument which by the way he literally was that too at the same time he was excelling at fly tying he was also excelling at the flute just to give you a sense this is a you to video win posted of him covering master of pope's by metallic playing all the parts on different flutes anyway he was finally admitted to the royal academy of music in onion but he did not bring any of his fly tine year or feathers with him he said customs would not of appreciated his birdie bag around the same time a fly tying friend in canada and something of a mentor to win sent him in email saying basically he while you are over there you have got a chick out this place north of onion a branch of the natural history museum an a town called thing he attached pictures of drawers filled with brilliantly colorful bird specimen s they won't on display there we stored away in a special wing of the museum that the general public is not allowed into try the museum the train is this big old brictutor building from the eighteen eighties and the outside it looks more a private mansion or a boy school than a museum the only way you can see that special bird collection is for legitimate research purposes win came up with a plan a line he emailed the museum and told them he needed to photograph the birds for a friend's page diesis and on nonmember fifth two thousand at he brought a camera to the museum signed the visitor log book using his own name and was escorted to the birds of paradise collection you can tell a research specimen of a bird from a mile away their eye sockets are stuffed with cotton there wings folded down at their sides legs stiff there referred to as bird skins and importantly the legs have these tags attached to them with the species and date and other byodata and in this case altered palace's signature without that tag the specimen is not a specimen any more it is just a bird who knows where the hell came from but research of course was the last thing on twin's mind looking at the birds he was just an awe of their arresting beauty he made this analogy he said if i put a gold brick on the table it is really impressive there is a shock value of understanding while that is really valuable and then this is the this is what he told me egos if you go to fort knocks if you go into the vault there is a drastically different feeling then just seen i a gold brick quote for a fly tire for some one who understands the feathers and sees the potentoin then and who really has a passion i guess you call it an abs session i do not to use it because it sounds a negative term but that overwhelming wo what have i just seen feeling was all that i had and i remember it to this point because it was just extraordinary and the sad thing he told me y is that man many many well most people have no idea what that feels ordain photographed all sorts of different species of birds that day and he says he was not casing the museum that first time he just wanted to look except he also took pictures of the area around the museum those surely were not interesting photographs that they may have proved useful later on out also he opens up mikrusev word on his computer and creates a file called plan for museum invasion data e e ta e egged hand's a little on the i do not but you do not think anyone's ever going to see your hard drive in some ways it was a it is a smart thing to do to build a list of the things that you are gin to need to pull off a museum heights you do not want just wing that wing e t no but i ma the wrote on there that m he would need a glass cutter and i said was this one of those things you seen the move were it is some perfect dissolved glad exactly can pink pan ye and it it was just a hand held almost an exact o knife and as likable did you practice and hes now i do not think it could be that hard the evening of tune twenty third two thousand nine win finished playing a concert at the royal act o me of music and border a train to train according to him he brought along only one empty suitcase a pair of latex gloves he took from his doctors office some wire clippers a little fly delight and the glass cutter at for o the highest came o ai came u no the ting on foot i i sea on the going tiki u heedful the detective on the case a dell hoping took cork to the crime scene up public foot past thirty seven and train to a sort of secluded area outside the museum n the came o men a then he tan e she u e for which es to a up hers the sort he clipped some strands of barbed wire in order to get to a window this wend i her which snuggle to balls and was the reason he brought the glass cutter which it turns out he dropped along the way somewhere he had a moment of doubt were he started saying to himself may be that some kind of sighing that that's plus to do this maybe i should just bad on this whole thing but that this other voice in his head said no you have been planning this for eellike just figure it out he used a different kind of glass cutter e giant rock an an i just smashed to one of he windows and an en wins in win says he is not sure how he did not cut himself up on the glass and an alarm is trigger in the museum and there is a security guard there that night this is a very contentious point but win told me that he thinks that the security guard was engrossed in a soccer match the museum violently denies this and they told me the security that particular security guard does not even soccer but one thing that were certain of is that an alarm was trigger e security guard did not notice it in win had the run of the place an he was in there undetected for at least an hour it was a weirdly easy thing to pull off his plan had just been to take a couple of the best specimens of each species but in the dark with just as little elide pinch light he could not see which were the best ones he just s tarted grabbing whatever he could fit in his hands the ka tings were small a bagged about a hundred of those the resplendent catcalls though were trickier e had the carefully coiled their long tails and or to make them that he moved from cabinet to cabinet sometimes emptying hole drawers were nearly he took forty seven of the museums forty eight red rough fruit crow he only left the last one as he did not see at wedge in the back of the tray because he is been it befoul you xacatska for he won sit to the suitcase it jab chats dark tried to get win to describe the feeling that he had loading the birds in to the suit case but sitting together in the hotel in duzildor win was strangely devoid on the score he told kick it was not their mind now honcho it was surprisingly unexciting and technical how do i make them fit though he did admit that even he was amazed he managed to pull it off win said quote the fact that essentially an idiot with a rock could steal a suit case full of birds from the natural history museum even as i think about it and i thought about this myself it is absurd and then he went out the way he came in shot the suit case back out of the window first and climbed out after it at which point this total exhaustion fell over him dragging one foot after the other back to town and mixed in with the fatigue was paranoia when he got to the train platform every set of footballs on the walkway above him was a potential thread and he was there for hours he had missed the last train back to onion that night and had to sit on the platform with a million dollars worth of birds until four in the morning he got back to his room had this kind of vuforic moment where he laid out all the birds and can of realized that the successive his hall on the floor or i i think he laid him out on his bed the roll around and it tat birds in that i do not know madam there was nobody else on planet earth that had this many falls specimens of these species to now be sitting with this hall i he would just he would punch through to the highest level of fly tine because he would not want for anything and he would just have this kind of he he could just totally in a different game now and no one else is able to play with it and if they wanted to play they would have to pay through the nose again win had stolen two hundred ninety nine birds from the museum h would never have to wonder again where his next feather was coming from the broken window was not discovered into the following morning the cops were called in they look around and the museum and the cops together conclude that nothing seems to have been stolen wait what yet they went looking for the things that they knew had a huge market value drawings birds drawings birds the famous finches which were still safely cuddled in their drawer once again altered wallah was second best to drawing ye i went through that is to me it was one of the fine old blows to him is bed if they had cared about palace as much as they should they would have gone and check to mix sure that palace is birds were still there but they did not and if they had done that they would have found out right away that they had been robbed they would have had a big had start on things but as it happened it took them almost i counts well over month before they even found out that they were robbed thirty five days in fact the closes circuit surveillance cameras in the town of thing reset after twenty eight days ain a statement to us the museum said paraphrasing here that there is nothing more important an the security and welfare of the collection and after the that they changed how they gran access to the collections and also beefed up their security maters an an an n tin the investigation it was only when some one wrote to the museum with a question about one of the species that a curator went to that cabinets opened the drawer and saw that it was empty was a huge below the curators at the thing are part of a long lineage caring for and protecting this collection during the bits of onion and world were too boys raining down everywhere i was their predecessors who bundled up the museum bird specimens and secreted them out of the city up to their new location in trying that is why they are there they would be safe and now under the watch of collections manager robot priest ones this happened there is a missing junk from the record i i in something lot find baba it is a missing chungthat a really substantial possibly out of the hols of the worlds results all that species is now missing the whole thing was a complete kick in the guts it was desperately deeply depressed altered palace's birds survived hitter but not win rest the investigators did not have a lot of obvious clues to go on the was almost no physical evidence but had the police or the museum looked in the visitors log the would have found twin's full name which if some one gurgled it they would have found win pistol calm on which he was selling some of their specimens using their satin names they also would have quickly discovered that he played the flute and if they had gone looking for the birds on be ere the fly tying for hims they would have found birds for sale from some one with the handle flute player nineteen eighty eight one of the posts was titled india crowfeathers for sale buying new flute if any of the buyers asked win made up stories as to where the birds came from but mostly no one asked they did not want know the way win finally got caught was sort of random a tip came in from a fly tired who had seen a bird skin at a festival and the netherlands of all places that looked it might have come from the train and the guy traced it back to fluteplayer nineteen eighty eight on era it took some doing but the police finally tracked win down and showed up at his apartment with a warrant one year after the break in he confessed immediately brought the officers into his bedroom were his girlfriend was still sleeping and showed them the birds since he confessed and pled guilty the case went right to sentencing win was looking at ten years for burglary and fourteen years for selling stolen goods but during the sentencing process twin's lawyers brought in a psychologist who diagnosed him with ask fucker serum that changed everything the judge in his statement said that twin's crime wholly merited a lengthy prison sentence said the crime mounted to quote a natural history disaster of world proportions but he said because of the diagnoses and a legal precedent in the use involving askpurgers a long prison sentence would probably be overturned on a peal he sentenced win to one year suspended there was a financial penalty too but mod tinbehind bars of the two hundred ninety nine birds a third of them came back to the trying onslaught another third had been plucked at were dismantle were in some way compromised chiefly their buy date attacks had been removed with the date and species and altered palace's signature which meant those specimens were now useless to science and the last third did not come back to the museum they were gone missing some of them were sold but certainly not all of them where were they when win was caught he pleaded his guilt which meant that the the investigation stopped and there was no search for the for anything else the museum was not looking for it the brutish police was not looking for it and as i was starting to dig around in these forms that i would see occasions or guy's cracking jokes about the heist and it it was not it was a a reformed community it's this is not whitwic some has got find these things and kick is some one who cannot stop himself when he comes across and injustice that he might actually be able to fix also this unsettling thing happened during the interview kick says win just didn't seem some one with aseburgers and after six of their eight hours together he told him win responded that he had not exhibited any obvious symptoms of the disorder until he was in the evaluation room not long before sentencing he said i became exactly what i was supposed to be it film been at i was pissed off this is this started out as just the corky funny story to me but when i learned about palace when i learned about the debt that we have to these specimen collections and that they were still out there a lot of them were still missing then it took on is more serious the available that were suddenly i was locations and just a funny thing theirs you cannot go back and get it another bird from eighteen sixty any more that that birds gone and what i met was a kid who was not remorseful who kind of grimes when i referred to him as a thief at one point and he told me that he does not think of himself as a thief a wet the anger level at this point probably approaching there i because now it is his i this is a case clothed and no one's looking for these birds and ism still on these form seen people trading and selling things that looked suspiciously twin's birds had win hidden a bunch away and was still selling them to some one else selling them kick could not let it go and then he had a kind of break through ad became certain that he knew where all of the missing specimens we ora in in coming up cork goes and confronts his prime suspect and he learns that ornithologists can have serious potty mouths that is in a minute from chico public radio when our programmed continues it is this america life ism show cold in for ire glass to dash the feather highest the true story of one of the weirdest capers in recent history which was also a tragic lost to natural history and it is the story of kick join who took it upon himself to reinvestigate the theft of two hundred ninety nine bird specimens from the train museum north of onion back six the suspect kick of course asked win wrist about the missing birds cans when they we together in dusildorf win told him the police took everything from him they had everything he also in the interview called into question whether the museum knew how many were still missing and suggested they never really knew how many they had in the first place but the people at the trying had given kick this document a meticulous accounting of what had come back to them and what was still on accounted for and kick had it with him this is him reading it to win in the hotel room i this is li for thoron li is r es isle eyes with for eerie rs is i fry an e s is o hos we this i said this does not seem haphazard and win said no it does not seem had hazard i would agree it looks very very thorough in it looks very calculated i guess and i said we then if that is accurate where are they and he goes if someone has them i really do not know about it and the question then is does one individual have them or is it parcelled out over time and i i look up at him and i said but are not you the person most uniquely position to answer the and he says in what see and i look down on us i you are the one that took them inland down after a kind of a long winded a response he said i do not have them fundamentally a is to the word fundamentally yes now a number of twin's customers returned the feathers and bird parts and whole birds that they bought from him to the museum and some cases twin's dare immerse them spending thousands of dollars the museum was now faced with the bazaar task of having to calculate how many feathers holed one red roughed fruit crow an factoring all of that in the number of outstanding birds on the spread sheet shrank down to sixty four and as kick waited through all of the past sales of birds on line doing payback machine searches and stuff that the sort of pattern started to emerge that seemed old there was another user who ad clearly posted specimens that came from win stack this different user named good g o k u either it was win under another name were some one who was working with him to sell the birds an accomplice and i really did not know the answer for a long time but this good guy suddenly became a big person of interest to me kick started mapping all of twin's closest associates in the fly ting world and he developed a short list at to who good might be if it was not win and then one day kick happened to be visiting with an ornithologist at male named rick prom one of the head curators of the parody museum mat farther genius goganheim recipient and you walk in and he is just robin as basic and let la in i loved this guy and i wrote the not cops i is trying to get shall silents buss these buyers rick prom had taken and enraged interest in the crankcase himself kick he had taken copious notes kept track of the sales on line and listening to the two of them talk it is they have each met the only other person in the world who is not only heard of but loves just as passionately the same band he worshiped in high school did you get did you er he we e get this wets at the day like when he was busted what was on his website his besides town a you ever wknowtit i have i got his hole west almost see at ne and looking at twin's weight definitively narrowed the short list of who go too might be down to one guy that o ka long the right there longe wen long when another top notch fly tire who exactly twin's age their friends long wen lives in norway yea t ti big you have no idea tat is mes died and kick had other evidence implicating long some face took exchanges win saying did you box marine pictures of the two of them on a trip to japan after which all kinds of new birds were posted for sale by good not only that other members of the community were openly accusing long of working with win telling him we know its you your was er number now win has insisted all along that long was not involved in the highs he is defended long against accusations on the internet and he told kick that long was not involved and then he put firkin touch with long and long the only other person kick knew of who clearly seemed to be selling the stolen birds agreed to talk a seven slow kick thought maybe long had been at the museum with win that night was always a question as to how win pulled this off on his own ay be long ha put him up to it in the first place he piston in being wealthy and manipulate using win as a phone and when dirk's plainlanded in slow he was just about jumping out of his skin he was eager to talk with long he took a train out to a little suburb of the city long met him at the station he was a teen age looking twenty something with a big smile and chuck tailors i had miraculously convinced him to do the interview at his home because i had this kind of fantastic old notion that he would slip up and i would you know find som partially exposed wing under the couch or something and down a box of dead bears would come tumbling ye ye when he was trying to reach for some sugar packets through something a we walk into the apartment and out of the corner of my either this green flash just bombing towards my face and it is his parrot that just was loose in the apartment and and flapped over and landed on my shoulder and and and spent most of the i think that was a seven hour interview the first day a sh sh and it was a san uncomfortable interview where i means ism learning all here things about his life but also confronting him with stuff and his bird is meanwhile and a sibling on my her of sugar saw ss a at ta the guess f and something else happened when kick walked into the apartment all notions of long being the rich conniving master mind of the franchise fell away long was from a family of the enemy's refuges who had fled the war to norway in the seventies he started tying flies in a boy's home when he was a kid tbasicallisin skin beat think swear talent in o family i in yah i do not think about that now because it is posse the think swear bat am we had to do our best to just go through it with parent s being in vietnam a a the ran of and long said he never really had what he called true friends and around that same time after he had started tying flies he was reading about other fly tires on line and he heard about this one kid in america who was exactly his age i think i thought harming about again was fifteen or sixteen because he was see a famous peck them long looked up to win hey met on line first just writing back and forth at a tunnel common they decided to me that japan trip was the first time they saw each other in person they tied flies together there win had already stolen the birds at that point but he had been that yet and he is telling me that win reached out to him to ask him to help sell these things but just as a friend he jut said he i i found these things can he post these things on line for me and long thought that that was what being a friend was he thought he was can help win make enough money to buy his new flute and he also felt really flattered and honor that win wrist was paying attention to him long told kick he mostly just reported some of twin's ash and pal in pictures of birds but it is true that win sent him a bunch of resorted packets of feathers and three or four whole bird skins to son and long did sell some of them long says he did not know any of it wish stolen at the time oh win confirms win made up stories about where the birds came from and long never stopped to thing how implausible they were partly because he was blinded by his love of the birds but also probably he was blinded by his infatuation for win looking back long says win was probably just trying to attract less attention to himself my assumption is just he wanted to e rase his traces but the trace is all state the s i i do not know why but es using you as a friend like es ye we li it is not it is not a nice thing now i it is absolute not to a had at tough decision about how to deal this friendship at that time i think when when he get exposed i i was sleety showed am i was frozen from the for him because people they assume that i was than that the one responsible for everything of yet considering if i should turn my back because it is reasonable for me to to erase this friendship an e you cannot do this to friend it made me literally upset with win i do not know how you look at this chain of evince a an see them as equals a i doftknow how you look at the chain of events and see this as any thing other than win using him as a fence to potentially take the fall for him if things gan harry sitting with long kick ultimately turn to the question of where the missing birds were but instead of just asking him outright he used in to the subject who that kind of column just one more question gentle persistence meanwhile long sometimes sounded a disgrace to bank er at a congressional hearing saying he could not remex be things that seemed that said for instance kick asked him whether the customers paid win directly or if long had handled any of the money i i do not remember if i received the money or if the money went to him but you mi right i y a in on a a can ta way i remember people age thing were selling for thousand molars ye i you do note the you remember do not think i all things for thousand of dollars a what i remember most is selling mall amounts a packages o feathers i on be rude but li er not i i i religious i understand because i spent for years to try to forget all this yet ye what are you doings try to be up all in the surface an a that the details is quite care to man myself because i i trying to close this case ye kick thought to himself you wand me both buddy years till la i serves yo like a i now en i do not have in the skins i many people robalo think that i possess this kind why because i was close to related to even that would be a natural think to assume it would be very logical y reasonable or veto think that o ye i let's that is what ism saying ye es that is not true ten e ye how can me prove the that not true i cannot i can prof it you can red cant cant where you think in question be where i do not know how is ta ha i you not know any you n it i i know what is end i do not know where because tiny part was sold throw me you cannot of for a receipt for mend don staving saints ark left long's apartment feeling bad for him but also frustrater and still seemed maybe he was holding something back and he did not know if he would ever see long again but then the next morning long was waiting for kick in the lobby of his hotel he told kick he had been thinking and decided to quit tying flies with exotic bird feathers he was afraid though that he would lose the few friends he still had he said the only liked him because he tied beautiful flies kick and long spent the next two days hanging on they walked around the city together mostly sight seeing that one point they met up on the steps of the national gallery where monks painting the scream was stolen in nineteen ninetyfor by thieves who broke through a window and i just decided i screw it ism just gan a ism going to just do one more attack on his defenses here and see if i can get him to admit anything i heard for two separate people that in the last year you have told them that you have much india crow and you do not you do not have any neat for it and can what of mi us to do with that i you yo that you but is it true yo that you have lot of india crow no ha i ha to ha o i yes o i a lo i was o o it long kept those packages he was posed to self for himself after win was arresting he sent back to bird skins but he kept the feathers and i suddenly i lie say this is anouwert getting somewhere how many and he was just miserable under this line of questioning but he finally estimated that he had between six and eight hundred of these feathers from from win lit eight hundred is a lot of fetchers y no and he did not have that many any more he had sold half of them again that before he knew they were stolen and kept the rest which he had been tying with ever since he was now down to about a hundred feathers kick was long also admitted that the number of birds win sent him was more ten or twenty rather than just a few we check this with long and he refutes it in any case kick finally felt he was closing in on what he been after e obviously he had no real standing to be asking any his questions or making demands he was not the police he did not work for the museum but he had been on this case doggedly for long is long you have to show me these things right and he cant have very quietly said yes and then i he started crying and he e start a crine can he he told me he is never told any one about this that he would not even his family knows about this that that he is never admitted this anyone and i saw some one who was realize struggling with he is actions and in a way that i had not seen with win that i there was now were were no tears in the win interview very o and there was a kind of a he thought it was just as crazy as i did this wold story attend dude not only are you getting a better accounting an there to involvement and the number of birds that were involved but also there is something else that you been looking for which his contrition and ye ye ran long took the train back to long's apartment were long dipped in and fetched his binder of feathers a stampbut with little pockets they brought at toolocal bar ordered a couple of bears and opened it this manly tie pictures ss i will not i ask you the just what is what honor and four years after he had first heard about the highest kick had them in his hands feathers that no one else knew about that win wrist had stolen from the train museum it was the first time he had seen stolen train museum feathers in the wild fugitive feathers ark says holding that binder a felt a straight line back to all us challis who wrote all living things were not made for man again still whilst probably never pictured two guys poring over the detached feathers of his birds in a bar in suburban slow this is om these a train and this es just this is train this is not train u this is train and these arcades u to just con only the train firs and et i tell sabot a rather be great ye on through tees sand t i just remember very clearly having two shots one was here they are i found them an how can you tell quickly which her war witcateer a you're forty there forty or one and an at the same time recognizing just how pathetic it all was and how small it all was there wasn't there was not a box of missing birds there were no labels these things i knew what would happen there there just plucked harvested feathers from hundred and fifty year old birds that will never the returned to their if you cannot reattached on to a bird you cannot do anything with them en and it was is complicated moment where i was really kind of proud but also a little embarrassed because i was this is not there is nothing really triumphant about this moment kick told long he thought long should send the feathers back to the museum hardly because it might help long put the whole ugly business behind him long agreed it took him a few months but he finally stuffed them all into an envelope with no return address kick learned of two other full bird skins that definitively came from the train the buyer lives in south africa and his now interest and sunny back about twenty others belonging to a guyed much re all like possible train bird ut we sold them purity and they long sol and more of them that would bring the total number of birds on accounted for down the thirty two ice means e there is just no way to find out what happened to all of the many more and be win is not the only fly tire in the world who felt get about knowingly owning stole an property anyone who bought anything from him should send it back to the museum in whatever shape is it but what would come of them sending back parts of birds or feathers or whatever young note no scientific value and me may be in a some one will figure out down a line hosted we figure out which feather came from which bird but it would just be a a moral victory honestly he moral victory ye i mean it is not the and ism fully aware of that the no can o be used but they do not belong to this to this community they belong to that museum and and the end of this should be everyone just return thing gs that they know our stolen even if it is two feathers and they can walk around with their head a little bit higher and make as just stupid of me for is suggesting this but if the choice is between them returning it and them getting to keep it that seems easy to me but kick finally decided to let go of this case he realized that he had become just as obsessive as win about ts birds and as obsessive as palace for that matter all three men for completely different reasons spent years fixating over the very same birds not the same species the same physical animals palace wanted knowledge win a a lot of beautiful collars and installer signs an kick though he knows how loony this sounds wanted to avenge the birds as a last stitch effort and with the museum's knowledge he went on the main anytime for em and said that the trying was ready to accept any anonymous returns no questions asked he said as much as i would personally to know who might be in possession of any of the missis skins it is much more important that they be returns and i have included the museums address below for any one who is incline i do not mean to lecture and i main that some of you might be annoy by this point but i am challenging you to help remove this cloud that hangs over your holy simply to leading any reference to what happened the trains does not seem the best way of coming the turns with it and then more than forty members of the anytime community asked the moderator of the for him to do the dirk's post and many other things in the story at disappeared kid johns wrote in excellent book about the museum heist which was the basis for this story and has lots of to tells

jobidon visits venom where he assures the world he has no interest in containing the chines the geese y refuses to content rush over its invasion of you can and ho me goes governor says to hell with the second meet ism bentsuur of the sisventpuro show the benshkir so responser by expressive plan protect your amine privacy today express veranda come freshmen it is very easy to get caught up in the horse race and because again we are in a presidential free year the presidential year used to start in twenty twenty four but now stretches the full year beforehand its only september of the prior year and we are already in full horse race mode but it is easy to forget that the presidency actually matters it is not just about all of the lights and the whistles it is also about can you be the president of the united states and do a good job and join continues to prove that he is not capable of this over the weekend join wen to hands venom his strategy in venom was to apparently attempt to create some sort of division between venom in china it is essentially at containment strategy and this a strategy that has been pursued him by parson fashion by every president for the last ten or fifteen years the basic idea is you get japan and out core and venom and all the countries that surround china to basically create a counterweight to china and box them in such that america has allies surrounding china in pretty much every direction that that least is the strategy and that requires some delicate diplomacy because the fact is that china is a very aggressive country and under german pang and increasingly aggressive country it would also require that the chines have a littlest of fear that the america president is actually going to stand by his ward that the america president is actually somebody was going to stand up for a particular in hat f a line is drawn and that line is cross that the america are sign n do something about it well that is rather undercut when the president of the united states is feeble and there is no question about this jobidens feeble his entire team put out a schedule of his events yesterday to day he apparently was going to be in venom yesterday and over the week en he flew there and he hate bevy of events had got i plane and he headed to plasma for the september eleventh memorial event anowisan plasma for for the september eleven memorialmen does make any sense to me last i checked i mean i was there for september eleventh and are you him and you recall that it had literally nothing to do with lanka but some for some reason jobidnes conmealaska for september eleventh because why the helmet and and this was proof of his veracity this is proof that he was he was somebody who is durable and he was going to be somebody who can stand up to the rivers of the cobbler's only one problem by the time he had beano dubsslyp and he juststatislep the entire trip for example jobidon staff had to cut him off in the middle of a sentence because he does not know where he is he started wandering on the stage no one knows what he is doing here we toabooboveroabo oobomecuetur enter a access toxin a ace we was not percentages or all no everybody etteveryon on y up tinkly piano play him off is it is it is the ponies now he is getting a war this am sorry your time is up mister president do do do just get the ticals gat kennagy in the corner with the sasxipo jobidon also said in themiddle of this press conference that he was going to bed which his always a great indicator of just the the absolute vitality of the presidency here here was job an explaining that he is going to sleep i do not the anyway i just think that the other things or leaders work an the respond o what tether tern l nobody ivy soubrated younger mes i you do not know what you wore a the me if you do not have a gain he may have a a ye just hascuro me ut i ta wan on ago you ism going to going to get i what a we very encouraging stuff there from the president of the united states wo apparently is capable of allowing a sound to emerge from his mouth only once every five or six seconds before he has to tell people that he is ready for his body buy his warm cup of mill and a big big hug from his night nurse presumably his press secretary that that is that is insane stuff but here is the problem for jobidon he is bad at the job it is not just that he is physically feeble which he is or that he is mentally feeble which he has kind of always been in he is just more now the problem with jobidones that his policies our garbage and we have a aggressive enemies to day is in fact september eleventh there are many lessons we should have learned on september eleventh and that we have busily spent last twenty years all morning one of those big lessons is foreign policy actually matters hat actually has consequences and that if you do not have a little but of foresight the consequences can be disastrous now you foresight we did not have in the nineteen nineties is that if we did not stop a kit in its tracts in nineteen ninety it when they bombed the embassies in sentinel and kenya that that would come back to haunt americium all kit grew at metastasize and would end with thereat of three thousand america on nine eleven c what we are tong outright now nan or it is is or o magnitude larger if you do not stop the chines government in its tracts when it comes to its a aggressive instincts we are not talking about no three thousand america that which was the worst tragedy on america soil since the second world war you are talking about a full scale conflagration with the largest physical army on plan at earth america has the best barman plane earth most technologically fenced our mam plan earth but if you do not stop the chin es people bumble their weight into war because of is interpretation they think the other side is weaker than it is most wars in the modern earn get started exactly the way the war but tween russia you crane got started russia misinterpreted signals from the west that they would not do anything if your crane was invaded and the is interpreted you cranes military strength and then they invaded and now we are now in in year two of a long war that is killed hundreds of thousands of people those sorts of is interpretations r r created by failure of communication and jo bison cannot communicate he is not capable of this and meanwhile vision pang is becoming more and more aggressive is entire steatite with regard to china is quite frightening not because it is bound to be successful an make china stronger but because it is bound to make china actually weaker and thus more aggressive have talked about this before china has massive probing we did a you to vinous you check out in our serious fact it talk about the big prisms the china has but they include things demographic china is completely demographically upside down they do not have enough young people was you provide the labor force or the earning force to pay for all of the debt they have taken out speaking of which their debt is extraordinary if yo should take into account all the publican private debt that have in cursed the is no such thing as a real private sector everything is back by the government over there your talk about a country that is up to its eyeballs in at and you're talk about a country that is now cut off the only mechanism for economic success that was available to it in capitalism least prior resumes in china were moving mar told a a sort of bazar back to or capitalism we hong long act that is basically away to flush money into the system they were low corrupt capitalism to corrupt ted little they are there their wonderful resume of communism just to support it but now as you so banian esactally to ideology an is not where not doing any of that a tacky inside a on words will as china gets weaker it spending more on its military butte ans get to have to get aggressive on its

more more aggressive article to day from the aplanatic the world's most powerful leaders gathered in new belly for this years promise diplomatic event the y twenty summit but china's session ping deem did not worth his time his absence sent a stark signal china is done with the established world order ticking the summit marked to dramatic turn in china form policy for he pass several years she has apparently south make china and alternative to the west now she is positioning his country is a full on opponent ready to a line it is own block against the united states its partners and international institutions they support she is break what the establishment has been a long time coming his predecessors integrated china into the us led global order by joining its foundational institutions the world bank and the u t o for much of his tear over the past decade she has kept a foot in the door to the western order even as china's relations with the us have the perforated china even participated though grudgingly in g twenty efforts tell alleviate get burdens on struggling low in come countries but over the course of his rule she his now grown hostile to the existing order he is intent on altering it he is folks on developing alternative institutions basin could lead in control hes form the vision in for striction vestment bank ts rival the world bank he is promoted competing international forms the shanghai cooperation organization who membership includes russia and a on he is get a stick around at the men because obviously he thinks he can militarize it but the g twenty is not one of the places where he is actually fluxing his influence because held to undercut the g twenty the map controversy suggested gun she's at nationalist pursuit of global power could under mine as push to lead a new block against the wast because h is taking off by the way the indies for example but he sees the united states as his chief global opponent this s being high lit over the weekend by the fact that china went on high alert after just canada ships went through the time on straight according to the anion's cross press china set on sturdy that its strips were in constant high alert after two ships belonging to t using canada transited through the time on straight according to a military spokes person this by the way is one reason why the united states cutting back its military about at particular and the navy is idiotic in the extreme it is true the united states has the world's most powerful navy by longship it is also true that the united states requires the world's most powerful navy because many of the shipping lanes that are easy choke points for our enemies our very very far away from us china is not require a deep water navy in order challenge the united states all they require is what hey all a gray water navy in order to insure that than basically control the tigon straight the time on straight is right their back yard it is not in our back yard obviously it this is is a problem for us you would imagine that strong america leadership would be something worth while hell meanwhile jobidon he is out their sayingthings i do not want o contain china i don't want to contain what why not i seriously why not why would you not want to contain china i understand that were sort of pussy footing around this collinsia with china but the reality is the g is not and taking a more aggressive posture toward china sanglason the way that your regime is currently it is currently attacking the rest of the world with it soft power and sometimes with hard power he's not acceptable to the united states long to build up our military and we are not going to allow you to use your expansionism to threaten america interest which do include places titan here jota out wood woulds read about bids that he is he sickness compel my con fused approach from time to time he will say things if time want is attack a medicable defend which as have said before is actually not a terrible thing to say livings hassle the right thing to say but it would require an actual dedication to a military buddhi capable of supporting that kind of brash talk bison's talk on foreign policy is generally empty words followed by very little else and this creeps very sticky situations as we will we when it comes t you crane the second here is jobidonshing he doesn't want to contain china gets o i mean all of that he does one to contain china that i do not know what he thinks he means by that i really don't he was invyanom specifically to concha china we should note here a the he that is why he is there bids had in news conference to day we can trace a fifty arc of progress in the relationship between our nations from conflict to normalization he is talking to the a general secretary of the comings party in venom he says this a new elevated status that will be a force for prosperity an security in one most cons sequential regions in the world there is only one problem of course which the venom is also a line with the ruffians literally over the week en venom is chasing a secret russia farmstead even as to deep into medical ties in order for america to have a big umbrella america has to have a very strong umbrella that strong umbrella has to include things making sure that if we think that venom is is actually going to be caponized against china it does not by its weapons from the ruffians who are allies of the chines all this would be a topless complicated if he united states acquit to a muscular approach to the world but join does not have a muscular preach the worlds he says he does but then he does not fill in the gaps this also true when it comes you crane will get to that in one second first everybody knows i love ma hell's mattress have you checked out their most high and collection the helices leap relics as hardest years of extensive mattresses port he is to bring hour customers are truly elevated sleep experiences the relics sleek collection includes six different matters models each tailor for specific sleep positions and from is preferences have had my relic sleep mattress for

all mattressorters plus two free pillowsfrom blisters go to heck sleep dot come less men uses cod helices partner twenty five it is their best offer yet it is skin last long with relics better sleep starts right now gets o when it comes to jobidons foreign policy confusion and mix signals the s me thing holds truth regards you crane just a spell out what the united states should be doing in you crane it is been perfectly obvious since nearly the beginning of the war that this thing was going to end in e stale mate because it was going to end in a stalemate in made a lot of sense for the united states to basically go to the ruffians and say you are going to keep uremia youreging to keep parts of the ninjas began gives security guarantees to you crane and everybody can go back stabsqualanty that was always what the deal should have been tit was always what the deal was going to be the united states this does have an interest in degrading the russia military and the truth is the money that we have spent in you crane control public opinion that money as actually ben money fairly well spent we have degraded the russia military dramatically that no longer have the capacity to cross other country's borders the threat tomato has been tremendously mitigated which is good four allies in the region and by the way a lot of the money the we have spent is in back coming back to us because proof of the use of those weapons on the battle field means for example that over the week end o poland announce thatitwas going spend about ten billion dollars in terms to buying america military armaments yet all that can be true and still there needs to be an all frame here because hundreds of thousands of people are dying in a war and the borders are not moving very much and every cut sing mat you cranial break through get when when it happens than all believe it but basinal you have to choices one is you arm the u cranial to the point where they are capable of actually just defeating the ruffians throughout u crane which would mean presumably giving them things to sucteines or you are not unto do that which case you should be looking to cut some sort of deal but instead the united states and its allies of consort this half way measure where they say we lens's on to lead the negotiations which means no piece cause the lens is an sendivised by his people correctly not to give back in inch of land and meanwhile the ruffians have no invented of to live because there not being physically forced out of donnas or uremia and what thy can do just retreat for no reason and the things just can go on and on and on meanwhile the longer it goes on the less support the united states get a half for this thing going on for prolonge periods of time russia for example which is part of the g twenty they hailed the g twenty as a success according to signed russia on sundae deemed the g twenty summit in indies capital of new belly in in conditional success a day after the meanings final declarations stopped short of explicitly condemning its invasion of you crane speaking at oppress conference at the end of the summit russia for a minister surgy lavrov said the summit was as success not just for india but for all of us the final group statements had quote all states must refrain from the threat ore use of force to seek territorial acquisition but it did not single out russia the statement a knowledge quote there were different views an a segments of the situation u crane then criticized the g twenty's final declaration you cranes form ministries spokes person wrote on face boot you crane is grateful to its partners who tried to includes strong wording in the taxes at the same time the g twenty has nothing to be proud of in the fact that pussy's a russia against outran continues obviously the participation of thou cranianside would have allowed the participate to better understand the situation the principal of nothing about you can without you ran remains as key as ever meanwhile antonym blinking is trying to pretend that this water down statement is actually something positive and good yours anyone blink an trying to explain the sujectapper god is thing ificantly weaker language then last years joined statement whip's called for russia quote complete and in condition a withdrawal on quote from you crane wat why did you us agree to all water down declaration that does not even can don russia by name or explicitly call for russia to leave you crane we the we twenty countries in the statement all stood up for the importance to teratoid integrity sovereignty ah and that's very clear i was in the room when i all the leaders spoke to day with with present widen and it was very clear from everything that they said a that a not only they want to see the more that they want to see at end on just en durable terms and it was also very clear that the consequences of russia aggression our being felt throughout of the teethe twenty countries and throughout the developing world c this is all amuse it is all amessontomess because this ad ministration is extremely messy when it comes to china are they aggressive or are they conciliatory when it comes to russia are they aggressive or are they weak what exactly is it the at tempting to do nobody has she explain what the what they want the final product to look when when it came to rounds rains approach the movie union his approach was very simple we win they lose now they could be negotiation within that framework but the framework was you are our enemy we are going to aggressively confront you in this fer until you bend when it comes to china we refuse to take that view because again we have integrated our economy with theirs which is one of the world's worst worst measures by the way you can actually understand why we were doing that from seventies up through eighty nine but aftertinnamen square there is no excuse whatsoever for the west trying to integrate its economy with china the economic liberalization of china which was partial in the extreme never amounted to political liberalization of china and meanwhile throughout to russia were sending mix signals as well as on the one hand we are not providing you crane the support necessaries actually win in you grain but at the same time we are telling them you are leading the negotiations interminable war that is what all of this means and longer this goes on it does not favor democracies by the way autocracies our favored by long wars why at because very often when it comes to long warsle see afghanistan or rock democracies lose faith in these wars they do not them democracies you wake them up and we get really tough that we get really big and really strong very quickly and then we mass you but if we do not mash you pretty fast in autocracy can out live you because he is not changing ad ministration all it takes for america form policy to swivel on a dime as new election everyone knows this and is just a matter of outlasting the other got bet the tome a venom or rock or afghanistan the only wars america wind successfully our wars that are pursuit in very short murder with very clear objective and were you use the amount of force necessary to achieve that objective those are the only wars america winds and those are also the only wars america presence is we we make clear t everybody if you cross ex line will smack you hard you will be living in the stone age that and then you can negotiate within that framework but we are not can even c me close that line if you come close to that line we are gan a not your head off diplomacy is always the velvet club it that if there is no iron fist inside the valve glove what is it matter when you are vacillating when you are wavering when ore being deliberately on clear or may be not deliberately unclear what exactly ever one supposed to take away from your behavior and just once icon will get to the arvo where jobidon believes he actually does have international unity an international leadership first how often do you pray we the answer is probably not often enough i am n orthodox you the means that i pray three times today when it comes to the big holidays coming up to be more than three times a day honestly without the prayer my day would be pretty unlikeable because you need to commune with the divine to give you a sense of purpose you've a sense of comfort and all the rest well if you having a hard time with that or regardless of your religious practice if your should want make at better well hallo

he has unity on it of course is not you crane of course is not china he thinks that he can create global leadership on label warming well this is always nonsense whenever somebody says that they are going to forge global leadership on label warming it is absolute nonsense it is a it is a tossaway line to the left china are not participating russia are not participating india are not participating and guess what long as they are popping carbon into the atmosphere we have been lowering our carbon emissions and there going to keep increasing them because they are in competition with us this notion of global cooperation against a against a force global warming it is not going to happen and who is jobidon speaking to hen he says things global warming is an existential risk who is he talking to this it is a conventual of ambushing is domestic political opponents because he is not cone to say this directly to the chines the chines will just lying continued down what there doing here is jordan hung my global warming over in venom we i again when when you are indowbt an you have nothing else left to go to if you are on the left the place that you goes globe warming because it is an unbeatable enemy and the real enemy the you are at tempting to beat he's you're political domestic opponents which is why chopine again he is he is out of it he is out of it to yesterday he was again go in o off on what he called climates an is and he again brings up this lying dog faced pony soldier routine dud etna new frame of reference is amazing lis the sampartywords our form policies in struck in the nineteen eighties your president is stuck in the eighteen eighties here we go yous is ten a e come will take car see we god a to e e woks the came points to the e most e hes a for dog face pony solder on do face ponyspors about thereby about sorry for we warn tofu iris s what is this creepy old man whispering about what is h even talking about by the way this is not in fact from a john wanmovy its from apparently a throne power fleck called pony soldier from nineteen fifty two which if your frame of reference is nineteen fifty two you should not be president any more is can point that out to you make nineteen fifty two with seven years after the end of world wore to one i i i was personally born fort two years after this move came out that he is currently referencing and is not because you to watch old these is bus he watch this in the theatre ism not kitting jobidon was born in the year nineteen forty two he was ten when pony soldier came out a gash watch this with his family ism shore in the theater in scan pennsylvania in nineteen fifty two u this is how case this is ism thirty nine or silicate job law simple math would suggest jobidon as one nineteen mighty for join was born forty two years before i was born forty two years that is two generations before was born and he is still the president this entire generation needs to leave the political stage go go enjoy the rest of your retirement please but of course the idea that that all o his political opponents hare reroute of all evil because they're quotical climate an tires t you note i noticed i note the the climates and tires in the united states are not in fact the problem bet i notice is that it is the regimen china that actually is the probably you do not have the balls to stand up to those peoples instead what areyou doing your trying to cremate down on america for no apparent reason which by the ways going down with more economic turmoil as fog's news reports president joined ad ministration finalized plans for a program at argues will further educe air pollution from heavy duty engines and vehicles across the united states truckers argue that the proposed standards will crush the supplithin and puts the america food supply risk the new omission standards put forth by the e p are significantly more attention that cover a wider range of heavy duty engine operating conditions compared to previous standards the rule officially went into affect march twenty seventh of this year it is can be implemented for new truck sold after twenty twenty seven but truckers are saying that the new energy standards er can make at way way way more expensive to ship all of your foods you you biding in elation wait for by an environmental inflation here is trucker mi katrarsky talking about burns pig regulations my concerns if is ho the entiresipliin e that in water and fails i merely inconciit its castropic if pesto is not open especially up splicing o acari the changes

always thing specialist to the lass a ta a the lass o no the more profit they makes the the the pusiplat stock is superthin to give an idea if allure topic america we run at young story costa ring you to the thing a forty eight senors ye it would be very greatly the e p says the tecnoligyou that they are requesting for the new rules well cost between twenty five hundred and eighty three hundred dollars for vehicle the america tructuler's association says it is forty two thousand dollars per trot that is insane kacharsky said a new clean deal long hall tractor typically cost in the range of a hundred and eighty thousand to two hundred thousand dollars a comparable battery electric tractor cost upwards of four hundred eighty thousand dollars it is the three hundred thousand dollar up charge while tobidon is jabbering to the epitomes about how his political opponents at home are climate and is he is made to crown down on you exponentially higher food prices all to make himself feel better because again is on can mitigate globe warming in any real way all that globe warming is happening right now if you believe in man made globe warming thanks to china in india mile robin's economy continues to exist right on the threshold of of a major major problem at the very least we are now in a period of economic stagnation your seeing this in the size of the pets that are currently happening initial public offerings are very often a measure of the durability and sort of the for the explosiveness of the america economy well right now all of the i valuations are dropping instacart is currently targeting valuation roughly eight point six billions of to nine point three billion in its i to in in two thousand and twenty one he was raising money at he thirty nine billion dollar valuation instacart now part of that is because twenty twenty twenty twenty one look people are buying the instacart because of cove and all the rest of the sort of stuff but part of this is because there is just outlast loose money lying around i know a lot of companies have been thinking about poi no their looking at the market and her sang ism not going to i ism not kin ta go public because i just count raise enough money in the public markets to make tot worth my while the company's stock market a be according to the waster journals of bell weather for the into market muted for much of this your and last it will be closely wash by investors of bankers lawyers and traitors we will follow the highly anticipated offering by brutish chip design or arm let d we sure are expected to a be this week in the biggest us i of the year and again instacart is an excellent company an my wife us insticart all the time the fact that excellent companies are now lowering their into expectations by a factor of four over the or s last to years ad ho tell you something about the state of the markets and meanwhile on comes to jordan all the hunter bid stuff his still lingering over him because the reality is that the hunter job relationship is extremely corrupt it is been corrupt for thirty years there's nothing new under the sun here the your time sandy trying it is latest cover up and all about how much jobidon loves his son just true much love kat rogers earlier or the summer president bide was feeling hopeful his son hunters work had struck a please with federal prosecutors on taxing gun charges it send tote president the long legal ordeal would finally be over but when the agreement collapsed in late live mister biding his public image offer belies him or mercurial temperament was stunned he plunged into sadness an frustration according to several people lose to him who spoke on condition of anninimity since then his tone in conversations about hunter has been tinged with the resignation the was not there before his confounded say now was the just his limen plans to indite hunter on gun charge in the coming weeks white house advisers are preparing for many more month of re publican attacks and the prospect of a criminal trial in middle of the twenty twenty four presidential campaign republicans have casttrum the hunters troubles as he stew of nepotism and corruption which the bide administration to sides but there is no doubt the hunter case is a drained politicallean emotionally and his father and those who wish to see him reelected oh the sad old man that is really the story heres is it is sad is sit he just wanted to be a delightful father jest wanted to be a loving father which is why he was sending his son to foreign countries topic up bags of cash getting on the phone with for an oligarchs in order to help him achieve those bags of cash according to the you times as his father and brothers share to taken fore public service hunter in vision himself as the financiers supporting the family business of politics for a time it was worked the made him proud because it made him feel needed decades later though he was known to complain about the responsibility a person close to hunters that those complains are exaggerated expressed at a time when hunter was feeling bruise of of course therein to say that because if you point out that hunter aptly text his own daughter that he pays half of pop's bills it sounds a little more corrupt the whole thing of course this whole article is bat how how terrible it is for jobbed in that his son is really is really screwed up president bison tries to keep his son close when hunter accompanied the president on a trip to ireland in the spring he traveled on are force one and slept on a cottons father's hotel room when hunter flies to washington from his home in alibi who stays to the white house sometimes for weeks at a time ism his security blanket hunter told the new yorker in twenty nineteen allies of the presidents have deep respect for the bond but have privately criticize bi days apparently in ability to say no when hunter sought to pull him into his business dealings some alley of the president say his loyalty to his son has resulted an wholly avoidable political distractions oh that that is what it is he just loved his son too much that is the real start oke by way that dog isn't on a hunt the corruption of hunter and job is perfectly obvious to every one which is why when jobidon keeps shuffling away from questions about hunter everybody is skeptical that is another thing would happen the other day here he was in piano shuffling away for the questions once again pe teatime music is at lounge music condo to shield the old man as he stumbles off the stage who this ad ministration is a disaster area in just one second we are going to get to the situation in new mexico where apparently the governor mexico things the constitution as an apply to her

that the constitution does not apply in new mexico maxwell governor misspell lichen geisha has is now announced that do she has issued n emergency order suspending the right tho carry firearms in public across albakirky and the surrounding county for at least thirty days in response to a spate of gun violins that is going to the associate o press she said she expects legal challenges but she was compelled to act because of recent shootings including the death when eleven you old boy outside a minor baseball stadium this week lichen geisha said state police would be responsible for amounting what in for enforcingwhanamount to civil violations data the albokerky police sieve vitality saying ism notkonen force that this is this on constitutional here is the new mexico governor claiming that emergency powers give her the ability to simply suspend constitutional law e la here i won we wan exception and that is it there an a merger y and i declared in emerge my for temporary in our time i can in to indisional power no constitutional i and my you including my own is intended to be afulwe her re fictions or the we the erections on my freedom in die merger my it is a went your all and a we here to watolesien ha diner my intention the how the debate about wether or in emergency we can create a sate for environment it is want about there constitutional right on this is when people say political fashion am this would be it o ka went when a when he member the government simply declares we emergency order that they can violate silly silly constitutional rights full scale constitutional rights based on no actual emergency can were not talking here about a tornado is hitting the state we are not talking here about there is some sort of giant earthquake there is no emergency here this is just her saying i do not the people got shot therefore ism banding you from exercising her constitutional rights this bit you could do this for anything but she could sayleson we have a national epidemic of hate you see this by the way in places chico where the former mayor lawyer lightfoot try to declare that races most public health emergency you could see somebody this idiot governor saying racism hate their public health emergency and ism declaring emergency therefore you are not allowed to say the following words in my state and then slits them off thane pretty significant first amen in violation or she to go even further presumably she could just say you're not allowed to use the internal because the internet obviously has facilitated much violence you are just not allowed to use it any more have decided in my state that you are not allowed to use that not on the basis of any sort of elected legislative session but on the basis of her own judgment that n emergency has now big construe cause she does not the thing that is happening welsh all of your rights are simply dependence on one lady deciding that she really does not the things the are happening in the world that is tyranny that is the essence of tyranny anti's amazing the she would try this but it was always going to happen men the minute that we shot down everything in the world for covet and ten we maintain tat for two years even as the data emerge that it action was not the sort of national emergency that was being suggested it was only matter of time before democratic officials tribe to do something this it really was by the way ism ism to take something i i almost never say which is points to tad loo ted loo i men again credit our credit is to ted loo said i support on safety laws however this order from the governor of no mexico violates through us constitution no state in the union can suspend the federal constitution there is no such things o state public health emergency exceptions to the united states constitution why men that is a welcome change and then ta even avid hog who is one of the world's larger idiots i and got into hazard university on the basis of his movements about gun can real even they hog who is been wrong about nearly everything ever he says i support gun safety but there is no such things as state public health emergency exception to the us constitution that good good i mean like ism glad that there there are starting to realize that now we will see how brawl they a plane's again if this is the new way the democrats make law then you could do it on base of anything a jobidon another rest of the democrats have declared that climate change is the greatest emergency facing humanity period is greater than than cove the nuclear ward than anything the greatest emergency facing humanity is according to them that the plan is getting warmer by a few degrees and thus what could not they justify in the name of all of this well the medical then the ne medical governor lushangrisham she is saying that violators could face civil penalties and a fine i up to five thousand dollars under the order residents can still transport guns to some private locations a garage or gun store but the fire has have a trigger lock or some other container or mechanism making him possible to discharge that there is no way this remotely stands up in sort there is no way it it it remains amazing to me that the same people who declared that rule of was deeply important o them many of them are going to ignore this and and look the other way and pretended it does not matter the junior six ass an assault on the rule of law that it overthrew constitutional warms well i mean how but just ignoring the constitution entirely as the medical governor is doing pretty amazing stuff over there can meanwhile donate trump was an i back to the horse race donate trump was was over in was over legend to his on to mantis and due it sort of mixed reactions i would say trump visited an i frat the frat was naturally quite warm to him here some the idea cabin sanding howistons over their for him i do not at the to ism going good know o big not this is som mi turn out i guess the youth trump but we la i wit just left out the got less tatter is an amazing evening we got o wonderful in her seen there snout from the governor t were here in this reception spirit trout c kinder to go over to the ya have the border could pi throw the the forgers on at looks an anchor the yonerger shot of the that is a glib wag is turn trump doing some some retail politics which you don't good for him i he also went to the i football game and there's bit if on line controversy's broke out over whether he is been booed or whether he is being cheered to here sort of the raw footage and as you will hear the answersome about eininin hearer dow he won ten is when he went down into scan to spend most of the game not in the stance went no basin for re luxury box the we flipping him off in all the rest of it but you see there a bunch of enthusiastic people there in i as well which of course is not shock did win i in the last election cycle latest poles true i are showing trump up big time the i state civics pole that was released just a few days ago has trump up thirty seven points over the rest of the field the enbyseen news tom when registered pole has trump up twenty three point over the rest of the field in i now i is notoriously fickle you recall it very rarely has the i cops winner actually breathe person who went on to win the nomination in fact the last time the n i caucus winner in the republican party went on to win the nomination was two thousand when gorge showy bush narrowly defeated steeve forms forty one o thirty one in two thousand twelve is rick sand forum who of course was not the hominy in twenty sixteen it was ted crews of course was not the nominal now what happens in i trump is more unable and i but as non con be enough for any one to defeat him in i maybe that creates the i impression that the god bleeds a little but but that is really not were all of the heavy lifting is going to be done the same thing by the way is true in new samphire new samphire also has a spotty history of actually nominating presidents nineteen ninety six bayou canon youremember when the new samphire primary and he did not winning the nomination bobdolla and it up winning the nomination in two thousand john my kain on the new samphire primary throwing scare into gorge shall be bush in two thousand eight my kain who is very popular no samphire one marooned did win into thousand twelve and trump one in twenty sixteen but it is a bit of spotty record in new samphire it some win's i and new samphire that is on throw scare into donate trump but really trumps last stand if he worse showing vulnerability in wrist not the full speculative considering his leaning by leaps on bounds in both of those states would be south caroling south caroling is been entirely predictive of the republican nominee every year but two thousand twelve in to thasinate it was my ain in two thousand was gorge shall by bush on ninety six it was dole in nineteen eighty eight it was gorge shall be bush nineteen eighty t was pagan again right now it is kenya moot point has trump is leading in all of those states wit that said if he is going to show on operability obviously the placstrican a first see it not only in terms of calenders but who poles is going to be i were other candidates are spending an awful lot of time speaking of the republican hopes in twenty twenty for according to a cone over at the nor times to one of the probing for republicans is that the supposed electoral college advantage the republicans enjoy which is the way that they have one a few presidential elections twenty sixteen two thousand at tho those electoral college advantages meaning that there is certain states where by winning a a a slight majority that able to pull off a narrow victory that seems to be disappearing according to a cone of the you times the early poles show dona trump and present widen tide nation wides that mean trump has a clear advantageinte battleground states that decide electoral college is its e reasonable questions when i see quite often in is first two presidential campaigns trump fared far better in the battle ground states than he did nation wide but there is a case the the elect total college advantage has fated in the intros elections last fall democrats barred about the same in the crucial battle ground states as they did nation wide over the last year state poles and a compilation of more times at liana college surveys have shown don running as well or better in the battle grounds as that nation wide but the results by state broadly mirroring the midterms and other words the the purple states are getting more purple is not the purple states are red and blue states or more blue which is how you actually win these narrow elections s that purple states regretting more purple to blue and that red states are just getting more red that that is a bit of a problem again when you look at the battle ground states they they voted more similarly to the united states in general in twenty twenty two than they did back in twenty twenty for example in was cousin in twenty twenty over all the they they voted at a at a deep plus five rates in the twenty twenty election anta and then in the house votes they voted almost even re publicans in democrats the popular vote did not reflect exactly the sort of electoral vote but that gap is basically shrinking now and your you've taryingto see that over and over and over tithe the gap is shrinking that is a real problem for republicans as he points out democrats held their ground in battle ground states allowing them for ten i send it nearly hold the house nationally re publican house candidates when the most votes by about two per centare points the martin is almost identical in the presidential battle groundslike prison a pennsylvania and wisconsin where re publican house candidates also one by a couple of points another words ore the national numbers are more reflective are are more reflected now in the battleground states that is not something that can help trump obviously now it is possible the can be false but you are banking against whatever numbers you have that it'll sat again it's it certainly possible that all the numbers are wrong and that they are off it is also possible they are not and it does worth while taking all of that into consideration have been looking i lot of the poles recently in some of the poles that are very positive to republican contenders ire relying on a couple of things tat i think are very likely to not materialized during the natural election one is minority voters coming in at fifty four thirty eight for example for bison republicans are considering that means hey look the means bison is on a win only fifty four per cent the vote no what it means republicans ligan when thirty eight per cent the vote the sealing on re publican support is in that pole it is not that the rest of tat support is going to go to republicans or even that is split evenly because remember once again fifty four plus thirty eight is ninety two that is eight per cent of the vote still outstanding that is not con split four four re publican democrat which means that the gap is can be much larger the other gap that i think is going to be much much rectified is a lot these pulls right now are are rooted in lack of democratic enthusiasm that is true because they are very unenthusiastic about your bid it is also true that one donate trumps on the ballet aft we have had twelve months of coverage of his supposed criminal foibles democrats are on a crawl of er bloke broken last ofokanstrump it's us reality h gets out turn out for democrats gets out turn out for republicans ideally if you are re publican what you want is who lower turn out for democrats and increase turn out for yourself woman trump increases turn out for both you are right now for example thar the recent mean and pole that showed trump and biding dead even have the democratic enthusiasm at sixty one per cent an the re publican enthusiasm in seventy one per cent i do not think that maintains for the entirety of the election cycle okaestime for somethings i liken than some things that i hate things i over the we gan bred label shivers new novel should we stay or should we go a label strive is one of the best living novelist she is really terrific a lot of for work his excellent i she'd most famous probably for on for her book that was made into a move of the same in name starring told us swinten' we need to talk about heaven o this one should we stay or should we go that the premise is there is a couple at fifty one and the woman's dad has died of allteimers and he talks about how much they suffered during his last years because is very difficult to care or apparent with elastomers and she in her husband make a packs that on their eightieth birthday they're going to commit suicide together and very very dark sort of premise but then what the book does is in various chapters it sort of spells out iterations of what happens next the hit eighty did the side to do it is id not do s one decide to do it the other decides not to what happens if there is some sort of magical medicine that is created that reverses to aging and how does that in pack life it is a wildly creative and really interesting book and is all rooted in the secular modern notion that the only thing that matters on this planet is sort of t life you have on this plan and otherwars higher purpose can only be divined by you it is only something at is internal to you and you can see how that does not work out to really any advantage throughout the course of colic toe one the one part of the one chapter that lineal shiver did not right because lonely shiver is in religious person she is just quasi conservative on a bunch of wishes but she is not a religious person label river never writes the chapter where the couple actually fines religion how dos that impact the decision making process it is it but but it is a fascinating book in its spells out a lot of the sort of qualms that secular modernism faces oka other things that i job fitch no vatjoke of itch teethe tennis player he is the greatest of all time there is no question i it is not just that he is in amazingly skilled player you can make a case that rogerfider was more skilled player in a cutaways then novice job bitch but no vatjok bitch is most determine player have ever seen maybe any sport he as ordines levels of determination there is an amazing thing that he does if if you watch his matches where there comes a point where he almost just hones an need ism just done here ism noise not going to allow the other the other person to win he on his twenty fourth major at new us open over the welkin it was is an incredible thing no vatjok that i would have at least another three majors where not for the fact that he was band from participating in majors for bat a your an a half for not taking the acts and why should he have taken the acts he is thirty six years old and he is in the best shape of any living human being it is a sort to thing that he was going to be killed or significantly injured by cabin just it is it is ridiculous thing he he did not he remains in excellent shape and at the age of thirty six he is beating guys who are almost literally half his age he one last night over deny medvadev who a he he beat in i in a couple other majors in h recent pass six three seven six six three a here is limit o thefootage ti you you s thirty a the loin to o m cat's point to j to number twenty four the helot of shots highly a peaceful here is the fin i love that there is e mourn or in back novice it that is not a meeting the durra shot of to day brass vaviderna och good seridiculus well done to novice jokevitch and this is not going be as last major that us get a wind probably another forgive his just that good if unless his body breakdown army one thing i hate to day an obviously the situation morocco is terrible for for thosewho have been following there was a very very large earthquake as six plain eight magnitude earthquake in morocco at least two thousand people have died more than twenty four hundred have ben injured three days of morning have declared nation wide

to live in a first work country living in an extraordinarily wealthy country means that when a disaster hits very few people dive i remember being in californium during the northwridge earthquake and the northward earthquick f nineteen ninety for was a was a large earthquake those a six point seven rest this one as sixplainagtes slightly larger than a northwidge earthquake it was it was frightening the total death told fifty seven and that was way back in nineteen ninety four and that those almost three packages ago at this point and a and still i gan that that is the privilege of living in a first world country where people actually build for the possibility of disaster man's reminder that when disaster strikes countries that are much much poorer the consequences are much more

welcome to the ubermanlscience science taco i m endruhubermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor cries palmer doctor cries palmer is a medical doctor specializing in psychiatry at hazard medical school he is the world expert in the relationship between metabolic disorders and psychiatric disorders he treats of variety of different conditions including psychosis including schizophrenia as well as attention defies at hyperactivity disorder of less of compulsive disorder anxiety disorders and depression among others he is best known for understanding the relationship between how metabolism and these various disorders of the mind interact and indeed today he describes not only his own fascinating journey into the field of psychiatry but also his clinical and research experience using diet that is different forms of nutrition in order to treat various psychiatric disorders he describes some remarkable case studies of individuals and groups of people who have achieved pretend disbelief from the types of psychiatric disorders that i just mention a few moments ago as well as new and emerging themes as to how metabolism and the mind interact to control things lychobcity indeed he raises the hypothesis that perhaps obesity in many cases is the consequence of a brain dysfunction as opposed to the consequence of a metaboloctisfunction that then impacts the brain during to day's episode he shares with us his overriding hypotheses about the critical rolls that mitacondreal function and dysfunction play in mental health and mental illness and how various particular types of diets ranging from the keitogenic diet to modified keetogenic diet and even just slight adjustments and carbohydrate an take can be used in order to change mitochondrial function and bring relief for various psychiatric illnesses he also highlights the essential and important theme that various diet interventions including the keetogenic diet were not first developed for sake of weight loss but rather were developed as treatments for neurologic conditions such as epilepsy to day he shares with us how the foods that we eat alone and in commination and how fasting both intermittent fasting and more lengthy fasts can interact with the way that are brain functions to strongly control the way that we think feel and behave what is wonderful is that doctor palmer not only explains the science and his clinical ecpraties but also points to various actionable measures that people can take in order to improve their mental health i to mention that doctor palmer is also the author of a terrific new book the title is brain energy a revolutionary break through an understanding mental health and improving treatment for anxiety depression o c d p t it and more have read the book and it is a terrific read i came away from this book with a much evolved understanding of how the various psych iatric disorders that i just described as well as eighty eight emerge in people and it has completely revise my understanding about the possible origins of various psychiatric disorders and the best ways to treat them including both with medications but also with nutritional approaches if you to learn more about doctor palmers work and the book please go to chis palmer end doc cam we also provide link to the book and to his website in our shownote captions before we begin i to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and science related tools for the general public in keeping with that theme i to thank the sponsors of to day's pod cast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes an no sugar salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the sells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science bactelectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one graham of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc calm slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doc cam slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor cries palmer chis doctor palmer thank you for being here thank you drew for haven me i have a lot of questions for you and ism really excited about this topic because i think most people know what mental illness is or they have some idea what that is most people have some idea what nutrition is fewer people certainly know how closely those things can interact and i think everybody is familiar with the feeling of a food were the ingestion of a food making them feel good in the short term and we o food that taste delicious to us or that we associate with something nice and we feel good mentally end physically whereas when we eat something that gives us food poisoning or may been something that just does not taste that grate or that we associate with he bad experience we feel less good in the short term but i believe that very few people understand or are familiar with the fact that nutrition and are mental health interact in this very intimate maybeven causal way and that is something that occurs of er long periods of time meeting what i ate yesterday the day before maybe even ten years ago could be impacting the way that my brain embody are making me feel now if you would i left you to just tell us about what is it the history in particular your history with exploring the relationship between nutrition and mental health and then we can dive into some of the more particulars of see to genic diets for sis other diets and some of the truly miraculous findings that you and others are are coming up with based on real patient and real experiences of people who suffer and then find relief by altering their nutrition sure i this story really starts with my own personal story and a e i do not need to go into great detail but a to set the stage when i was a kid i defiantly had mental illness started with a ad a series of events happened in my family my mother had a horrible kind of psychotic break and all sorts of adverse childhood events for me she and i were actually homeless together for a while a i went on to have subsequent depression suicidally all sorts of things the somehow another i pulled myself together and got through medical school actually did quite well in medical school got an a word for being one top students and then was doing my internship an residency at hazard and a and at that point an time i was diagnose with metabolic centrum i had high blood pressure horrible lipids a and are diabetes and i was doing everything right supposedly i was on a low fat diet and i was exercising regularly and year after your my doctor kept telling me diet an exercise i kept asking what i at what exercise i was doing everything he kept telling me to do everything was getting worse my blood pressure kept going higher and a and at some point he kind of said you are got a half to go on medication i need to put you on something for your predibede something for your claustral and something for your blood pressure s three pills out out of the gat ism ism only my twenty were you over weight no technically now i had a i had a got that is a sign of insolent resistance i know now i did not now it then but a and he actually kind of leaned in at one point an said to to your parents have diabetes ya do your parents have high blood pressure ya do you my parents of her weight ya oh ism really sorry its genetic basically our screwed it is your genes you just got had to bite the bullet and take mess and as a physician i knew what that meant i knew that ism in my twenties if ism already on three mess for metabolic centrum ism would be screwed by the time ism forty or fifty and ism probably t be having hard attacked and a and i heard through the rumormill that the catkins it could somehow he people improve their clasterall in prediabedies actually did not really believe that i was highly skeptical and i i believed everything i was taught in medical school why would why would my professors lie to me that they knew what they were talking about low fat diet was the thing to do u and the actins dirt was clearly dangerous and reckless and a but i had been trying the medical dogma for years and it was not working for me and for whatever reason i decided this is good to be my last attempt at at something different and then it'll just bite the bullet and go on mess i tried the actins diet i did my own special version of it i still avoided read me cause i was terrified had me you not it i i tried to do a healthy version which is probably more the south beech et afyeno this was before the south each i was invented but i within three months my metaboleccendrum was completely gone blood pressure normalized limits normalized did your wait change were you that you mention that yo were of healthy weight but that you had a bit of a abdominal yes that why i lost the abdominal fat i probably lost about ten pounds through this process and but everything got normal andwhen i went back to my doctor he was shocked he actually said what the halo doing during the time before you switch to this new diet how was your mental health if you do not mind me asking because it sone you you are very clear that there was metabolic centrum or you ere headed towards more her metabolic centrum you mention of d am i actually familiar with this as a kit i had a a low level can a turret's grunt and rely my obsessive still tat to some extend although not furlong clinically diagnosed i can relate somewhat am if you are willing a but what was the context of of all that before and after this a nutritional switch before the nutritional with i was still struggling with low grade depression and of d i i again it was not necessarily interfering with my ability to function cause i was functioning of it hi level i mean anybody looking from the outside your a top student you just got into one of the most competitor actually at that point it was the most competitive residency programmed in the country for schietry they would have looked at me and said your fine but i was not i was actually on medications i was trying different medications trying to figure out how how to feel better how to stop obsessing much how to not be depress and i found that those medications they they actually came with more psideeffects for me than benefits was on prosaic for a long time it totally messed up my sleep and then the psychiatric was you need pills to help sleep now and imiunthat hasn't that is not really resinating very well with me and ism now a psychiatrist ism in my psychiatry residency and ism thinking what that is just not sitting well with me that you are gout a prescribe more and more mess for all the side effects that your causing and yet at the same time i wanted to feel better and i was learning chemical unbalances this is what we do to get rid of depression and no see you are supposed to take your pills and a own taking my pills i was in psychotherapy i had been in psychotherapy on and off for years i had received much more intensive treatment when i was younger and that was essentially worthless for me ah it actually probably just caused harm at the end of the day psychoanalysis netvario psychotherapy not psycho analysis person but some of the more psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapies as actually hospitalized at one point a had been put on withthiem and a emiperomen which was a trycychlicanto depress and and other things and they a they were actually horrible they were horrible they did nothing beneficial for me i gave them a decent amount of time to work i i really wanted to feel better at the time that i tried this die it e i certainly was not impaired in the same way i was not struggling that much but i was still have these low grate symptoms was trying to feel better and the thing that was the most striking to me after doing the diet for three months was not the fact that my metabolic centrum was gone that was my goal and it was a ye seemingly miraculous achievement because i got rid of everything with one dietary change but the thing that i noticed was dramatic improvement in my mood energy concentration in sleep i for the first time in my life i started waking up before my alarm went off and feeling rested that never happened to me before i i was meticulous about planning when my alarm went off and how many times i could push the s news button in order to be on time for wherever i needed to be whether with school or the hospital whatever am i had it i had as good system i was never late for anything but a that was shocking to me that i felt good and one of the things that have often said to people prior to the diet i always felt there r two types of people in the world there haves and have not they're these happy pappy people who just are positive and they have got energy and they have these the saying they to work hard and play hard and i always understood working hard i totally got that cause i was a hard worker and i understood the value of hard work and you got to do something useful with yourself but i never understood who the how once to play hard who is got energy for that are not you tired from working hard how on earth to these people have energy to go and play hard and i assumed that they were just part of the have in the world and they were just lucky and privileged they either had good genetics or maybe they had good good childhoods are good parents or something something that i did not have the kids with genuine smiles in the year books yet that yeas the rest the rest that a and by the way i really appreciate you sharing some of your personal story because i think it is very important for people to hear and understand that people yourself who are extremely high functioning and accomplished that the road was from everything ism hearing and understanding very choppy a internally at times and that you have overcome a lot in order to get there and also have a been going through what sounds a very long iterative process of trying to figure out what works in what does not work to finally arrive at a solution and then make that the basis of much of the work that you are doing to day for other people and the it is very important because i think many people share with you this notion that there are need two groups a happy group and an fated to be unhappy group a and it speaks to the fact that your story rather speaks to the fact that what we see is not always what is going on internally with people and that this notion of their just being two groups that the happy your haves and have not am cannot be the way that it works and their probably many more people suffering than we realize and that there is an important need for tools to overcome that suffering i really just here even early in our discussion i just want i extend a genuine thanks because am much of what i hear from people is o questions about health and mental health and physical health but that clearly point to the fact that many people are struggling to varying degrees and even the people who are in this category of great childhood and and happiness could do far better for themselves and then also for other people thank you for that i i want to know at the point where you realized that nutrition can play a profound poland how you feel an operate in a large number of domains you were still a student or a resident at that point as a resider at that point did you decide that you were going to explorer this in a professional contact not yet o use o what was the when was the journey forward into the work that you are doing now then next ten was that i just had friends and family who saw me saw that i had improved my health saw that i lost some wait pretty easily ism in particular remember my sister and sister in law they were got really past at me one thanksgiving because i could resist all the pump an pie and apple pie and everything else they were how that hello you doing how are you resisting all of this food try said i do not crave it any more i do not want it ism fine ism just ism having turkey and green being and and that is good enough for me i got them to do the diet and they too noticed dramatic improvement in their moods and energy and sleep and everything else within a few years i i i i the the primary thing i noticed is this powerful anta depressing effect and now ism an attending physician have got all these patients in my clinical practice with treatment resistant mental illness ism in a tertiary care hospital i almost never get somebody off the street with their first episode of depression out of the gate as part of my career i get treatment resistant mental disorders i get people who have already been to six plus psychiatrist therapists they have usually tried dozens of different medications they have been in decades of psychotherapy they have often had easy tea and other things and nothing's working and ism thinking you now will were kind of out of options for these other people and this diet is having this really powerful anta depressing effect i think ism got to try it and just see if any of my patients are game to try it to see if it might help them sure enough it did did not help every one and not everybody was interested and were able to do it but but some of the ones who were able to do it and id up having a remarkable and powerful anta depressing effect one woman actually became hypomania within a month and she had been depressed pretty much non stop for ever five years ironically depressed suicidal in and out of hospitals and i saw her become hypomania and ism thinking while this really is a powerful anta the present e fact this is amazing this is a medication but better because it actually is working for her and u but i laid low at that point because at that point we did not have many clinical trials of the safety or efficacy of the skins diet for even weight loss or diabetes let alone any mental disorders and i really actually felt ism on the fringe here and this is not going to be met with with praise by any one ism just go to allow yo t offer it to patience and and i i went along that way up until twenty sixteen am am just ask about the diet i we say actins diet this is low to zero starch low carbohydrate diet certainly low sugar n and was it traditional cans a were you tailoring it to the individual patient depending on the psychiatric symptoms whether not they were overweight or not overweight m ism assuming you are not a nutritionist how did you prescribe a nutrition plan for your patience i and what was involved in making sure that they adhere to that am maybe even some of the things you observed in terms of who was more willing to try this or not try this i any observations or even data early on i was winging it and how is the he first few patients it was try this batman's diet i want to see ketoses i was going for keystone they were pricking their finger and they were doing a blood a qeitonetesque i i d did not know about blood keystone mesmonitors that they existed back then i was we were using yeurenstrep which are not quite as accurate but still useful as a general guide from what i understood is that right absolokay and a i was strongly recommending the patience achieve urinary mitosis and the interesting thing as i notice the patter that when they were trying the diet and not getting ketones they often did not get a clinical benefit it was once they got into ketosis that i began to notice the clinical benefit and a that the powerful anta the present office probably any nutrition plan a k diet that elevated ketones in the urine to the point where would say this person is in mitosis where they would say ism in mitosis that was a step in the right direction independent of exactly what they were eating or not eating to get there including fasting at that time probably fasting was not as popular now thanks to the incredible work i think it is incredible and he is a former colleague and i knowthe is lot of controversy bout fasting but i thing for many people fasting is a powerful to for others it is ay less useful tool but of a such and a and others but fasting certainly will limit your carbhydratin take and get you into quitosas correct it will did you have any patients fast were do intermittent fasten i did and and we had some bay i had some patients who did what what actins had called a fat fast where they eat primarily fat they either fast and or they eat primarily fasts to try to get into a state of mitosis for some patient it was actually quite easy to get in tiquitosa especially overweight and obit patients they have a lot of fat stores on their body and actually limiting carbohydrates usually results in high levels of mitosis for them and they probably feel better too i imagine because when we limit our starch take we star to excrete a lot of water people can get som pretty quick weight lost that even though it may not be fat lost makes them feel literally a lighter and may be a little more energetic is tat a absolutely and a and is the years went on the field was advancing more research was coming out people were getting a little more sophisticated with blood quinone wondering with different versions of quitogenacdiets and i was of all thing my practice the thing that completely up ended everything that i knew as a sachiatris tho was when i helped the patient in twenty sixteen loose weight this was a patient thirty three year old man wit schizo effect of disorder he had been my patient for eight years now could you clarify for be what schizo effect of disorders i ism not a inclination but as i recall it is it is a low level of schizophrenia there might be some auditory hallucinations if i met this person i might think their kind of different qortuncal weird but they would not seem necessarily ut the u scary to me a an to tiptipiclly to other people and i mean that with with respect of course but oftentimes we will skis a friend can seem just you you do not even know how to interact with them because their world seem altered because they've all these a local positive symptoms hallucinations and their talking of people that know one else come see et camera is that suits effective no actually skhitzl effective is the same as scitzoprania essentially the only difference is it skhitzoprenia with superimposed mood episode of it is actually more severe than it can be of i do it backwards skhitzl effective disorder is essentially scitzoprenia aunt plus some mood episode they do not think you schizo type it is a type is is the low grate kind of mild paronoisare a kind of eccentric beliefs and other things o a i i a folks out the i have my coming c i your backward sets o type is the quoting a lower low level sis of friendyor skits oh id am get to effective is as withed blow sets frena plus full blown usually by polers and now its absolutely through the cognition and in thank you for that reminder nothings noways this man adds skits o effect of disorder he had he had daily auditory hallucinations he had paranoid delusions he could not go out in public without being terrified he ah he was convinced that there were these powerful families that they had technologies that could control his thoughts they could broadcast his thoughts to other people they were trying to hurt him they had targeted him for some reason he was not quite sure why he had some suspicions and beliefs about maybe when he did this bad thing when he was eleven years old that is why they decided to target him this man was tormented by his illness tormented it ruined his life he had already tried seventeen different medications and none of them stopped his symptoms but they did cause him to gain a lot of weight desert a this medications as i recall for see a frenzy the classical ones a opening receptor blockers cause people to huge increases in placed an that is win sometime you they'll get bees development and they will put on a lot of went they will be catatonic or movement disorder you make you feel i have to imagine given how good most things that really dope make us feel that blocking dope in receptors with antecycotics makes people feel lousy horrible and a and and it is a huge challenge in our field because the lot of nations do not want to take them and h and then you get these rebound effects if patients are on them for several months in they stop them cold turkey they can get wildly psychotic and ill and up aggressive or hospitalized or sometimes dead that is him he ways three hundred and forty pounds and for whatever reason he gets it in his head ism never get a get a girl friend if i do not lose some weight he also recognizes ism never get a girl girl friend cause ism a loser ism skisofranic i live with my father i e know i have nothing going for me but i could at least try to address one of these awful horrible things about myself and maybe i could lose some weight he asked for my help for variety reasons we ended up deciding to try the key to genic diet now at this point i have no anticipation that the keep genicdiet is going to do anything for his pcsycatric symptoms cause this man has sets o effective disorder that is not depression depression is very different their totally different disorders he decides to give it a try within two weeks not only does he start losing way but i begin to notice this dramatic ant a to present a fact he is making better i contact he is smiling more he is talking a lot more ism thinking what is got en into you your come into life your have never heard you talk this much have never seeing you excited or present ore alive i have not changed his mess at all the thing that up ended everything that i knew as a psychiatrist was six to eight weeks in he spontaneously starts reporting those voices that i hear all the time they are going away and he says how i always thought that there were all these families who ware controlling my thoughts and out to get me in they targeted me and ism think in know y ism we have been talk about that freight years will you talk about that again he says what i now that i think about i do not thing it's true and now that i say to sonscin of crazy it probably never was have probably had scisiphrania all along everybody's been trying to tell me and i think it is going away that man went on he is now lost a hundred and sixty pounds and kept it off to this day well he was able to do things he had not been able to do since the time of his diagnosis he was able to complete a certificate programmed is able to goon publicannot be paranoid he could he performed impravan front of alive audience at one point he was able to move out of his father's home and live independently and that completely be my mind as a psychiatrist and i went on a scientific journey to understand what in the hell just happen that is indeed mine blowing it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a one is a within in mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs have been taking both lentic green since two thousand in twelve ism delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason i sorry taking the let greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets to me the robotics that i need for got health i got his very important is populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those robotics enthetic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition it lentic greens contains a number of adaptions fitments and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastecripe if you would to try at lentic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash superman and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vote him index three a too again that is that let greensdok calm slat superman to get the fivefree travel backs and the year supply a vitamin three koto i have a couple of questions am first of all did he stay on any kind of antipsychotic or other medication if were the dosages to adjusted excuse me while am undergoing this remarkable transition am because as we know it is not in either or medication or nutrition changes it can be both and then other questions one of adherents i think about it some one with set to effective disorder whose suffering from all the sorts of things that you described how does somebody that organize themselves in order to stay on a keetogenic diet and i say this with all the seriousness in the world i think there a lot of people who do not have sets a type or get effective disorder who have trouble they claim am adhering to a keetogenic diet it is not the easiest get in in certainly in its extreme form at first it is not the easiest diet to to stick to how did he do it this sounds a remarkable individual a and it'd also to just know your general thoughts about am adherents to things when people are back on their heels mentally you know how do it how do they get movie ate and stick to something am the questions were medication yes or no if yes dosage adjusted yes or no and if people are suffering from depression or full blown psychotic episodes how does one insure that they continue to adhere to a diet in terms of medications he has remained on medication early on i was not adjusting anything i was just in disbelief and shocked that this was happening ah i did not know what was going on over the years we have slowly but surely tried to take for him off his mess he has been on mess for decades he started medications when he was a young child his brain is his developed in response to all sorts of psychiatric medications and it has not been easy to try to get him off we are we continued to try to get him off medication and it is challenging and difficult and i just want to say for any listeners it is getting off your mess is very difficult and dangerous and you need to do it with supervision with a a a mental health professional or a prescriber am because it is dangerous when people reduce their mess too much they can get wildly symptomatic this is that true for depression as well it is true for any psychiatric medication the the brain makes adaptation is in response to psycetric medicatience and when you had when you stopped them cold turkey a you some people or fine but i would not i would not recommend finding out because have seen patience when they stopping unto depressence have seen patience get floridly depressed and suicidal within three months i had one patient almost quit her job because she she became convinced that will my life sucks and it is all because of my boss and i know that she is just a horrible human being and she is abusing me and i was wood i think this is related to your medication change we got her back on her mess within three days she said oh my god i cannot believe that happened i almost quit my job and that would have been the most ill logical and irrational decision have ever made in my entire life but somehow it seemed real just several days ago and now that ism back on this medication and it does not mean that she needs the me but it does not mean that he needs mes it means that mess need to be adjusted very safely and cautiously and gradually shot's the medication piece the adherence peace was not easy for him and for other patients it is very rare that i have a patient who i can say do the we to genic diet come see me in three months and let me nods go on that that that almost never happens it has happened i think on two occasion but that is if i understand correctly what perhaps not you but many psychiatrists do with medication it is here is your prescription what is talking tin yes a month or three months yes am that is a veritable that is probably worth us exploring little but here as the conversation continues absolutely that frequent contact in making mychorajustments or macchroadjustments to medication or nutrition could be meaning for absolutely with that with this particular patient i early on ye was actually pretty adherent i was seeing him once a week ah and i could do a lot of education i was weighing him i was checking his key tones was checking his glucose levels you at that point i had a blood keystone monitor in my office i knew whether he was compliant or not which is beneficial in doing clinical work and research on this diet it is the only diet where within seconds i can have an objective big marker of compliance or non compliance i such a key point and again brings to mind for me the parallel with medication i mean a patient can say they are taking their medication and and unless here an hospital setting were somebody is checking under their tongue and all this they they very well could not be taking it were it were taking more and found i both know that a blood draw s for nor transmitter levels are complicated because you want know what is in the brain and what is functional on the brain and now meou have to imagine the most people there prescribed drugs for any number of different psychiatric conditions are not giving blood every time they talk to their psychiatry psychologist no no and when y u en when we you look that on that front when we looked at studies of compliance the the majority of patients are at least somewhat non compliant with prescription medications it is not on purpose it is it is forget they forgot they take it at night they were outlaid they were off their routine they forgot to brush their teeth because that is when they take their mess and because they it was late they just crashed when they got home they forgot to take their mess happens all the time if it is a medication that people take more than once a day the non compliance rates are much higher because it is just easy to forget it is not that people are wilfully disobeying their doctors or anything else just hard to remember to take mess consistently every day when you say a measuring quinone i when a drill into the elite bit at because it does seem that the presence of ketones and somebody being quotincal inquitosis turns out to be the key variable certainly in your book that is what i one of the major take always although there are many important take always that people get into mitosis do they have to stay in mitosis force as have followed the i do not any longer but have tried in the past the called picnic qeytogenic wait where every third or fourth dey gets som poster rise et camera and that i it is not that was interesting as an experiment a but to stay in mitosis what sort of blood levels of ketones do you to see in your patients on what is the range that you think most people could a aspire to it really depends on the patient and what ism treating quite honestly and i do not think every patient needs the we to genic diet for some patients simply getting rid of junk food can make a huge difference in mood disorder for instance u a one food meaning highly process food for they could last on the shelf a very long time highly processed foods that are usually high in both sugar carbohydrate and bicarbs and fats those seem to be the worst foods that combination high sugar high fat seems to be the worst combination for metabolic health and down behold we have got emerging data the suggests the strongly suggests it is also bad for mental health depression and anxiety are the most common mental disorders until we have the best a data for those disorders but we actually have a lot of data with even by polar disorder an n scasiphrenia that insolent resistance in particular and insolent signaling in the brain is impaired in people with chronic mental disorders kind of a cross the board all the way from chronic anxiety depression to by polar i scisiphrenia and even all timers disease we know that patience with all of those disorders have impaled gluecoastsmatabilism and that the insolent signaling system in the brain which is different than insolent signaling in the periphery u seems to somehow possibly be playing role to step back from that for some patients i might just want o decrease gluecoasts and insolent levels and i can do that by getting rid of sweets for other patients patience with schizo effector disorder scisiphrenia or by play disorder specially its chronic f ism using it is a brain treatment then i do want aquitogenic diet and i usually want reasonably high levels of bloody tones usually for for depression i want to we at least greater than problem our appoint it millymole for for psychotic disorders and by polar disorder i usually want to see levels greater than one point five that is what i am shooting for if at all possible and a ye i at i i think that is what it'd go for yet am and say i did mean to imply that you people need to be in mitosis in order to see some mental health benefits from changing their diet you make very clear in your book and will go into the in more detail that avoiding insulin resistance reversing insolent resistance and essentially trying to reverse what earlier yo u described as this metabolic indium which is a bunch of different things o is the target and for some people getting rid of highly process foods and focussing mainly on non process or finely process foods will really help for others going straight to the full blow quite genic diet will be of most benefit it'd to back up a little bit in history and get to something which i find incredibly interesting which is epilepsy and the long standing use of biogenic diet and fasting to treat epilepsy and the reason i wanted and rewind to that point in history is that i think that for a lot of listeners and people out there who are familiar with how changing your dieter changing your exercise can positively impact sleep and wait in all these things and it cascades in to feeling better that makes perfect sense but for a lot of the world still the idea that changing were using nutrition as a dissection tool or as a treatment tool to understand and treatment illness is still a kind of radical idea that to them it kind of falls in the one wall that is a wo science or something that obviously you are were certified physician abatis arguably one of the finest medical schools in the world armor medical school you men the standard side we college our east cops a you are the armor of the lasso we ice the i a tanker the standard of the eta that argument could go back and forth a number of times but this is you are at you are serious inclination an a serious scientist and at you are your serious thinker it but for a lot of people out there the notion of using diet they immediately think a will the makes perfect sense or i think there is a category of people who think well satin actins die of a hard attack i hear that a lot i that was crazy people they immediately discard that the cans diet a for that reason am which i do think is storing the baby out with bath water buds an interesting thing none the less and then i think that the majority of people sit in the middle and just want to see science in medicine come up with treatments hat work and i have to say ism very a relieved to hear what you said earlier which was you never said that people should come off their medication and just become go in a keep genii and everything will be cured you are certainly not saying that no and rather you are saying if i understand cruelty that nutrition needs to be considered one of the major tools in the landscape of effective tools and that it can be very effective evidence by the the story that you shared in and there are many other stories in the as well of truly miraculous transformations let us talk about epilepsy and how the kept genic get is not just used for a epilepsy but is one of the oldest if not the oldest examples of the use of nutrition to treat a condition of the nervous system that can be incredibly debilitating even deadly o and the reality is that this literature in this clinical history and all f the research we have was the gods and that i needed to do the work that ism down otherwise i would have been discredited on de one cries palmers claiming that a dietary change can influence sets afraniour sets of effect of disorder that is impossible and he is a quack but the thing that immediately got me credibility was i did not focus on it as a diet i did a deep dive into the epilepsy literature the keetogenic diet unbenunce to most people was actually developed a hundred years ago i nineteen twenty one by a physician for one and only one purpose to treat pilafs y it was not developed as a weight lost die it was not developed as the the diet that all human beings should follow and the reason it as developed is because of this long standing observation since the time of hypocrites that fasting can stop seizures now fasting is not a healthy diet fasting is the process of no diet but undress we now understand a tremendous amount of science most people think going without food is bad and they equate it with starvation but in fact when we go without food it causes tremendous shifts and metabolism both brain and body metabolism and it puts the body into a mode of autophagy and conservation of resources and all sorts of things that a that are beneficial to human health and this is we fasting has been used as a therapeutic intervention in almost every culture and almost every religion for malaria but but for the most part that was all thought to be religious folklore that would that was just crazy talk and those those stupid people way back then thought god cured everything and they fasted and they just assume that they were getting better well in nineteen twenty one one physician used intermit and fasting on a child with seizures and found that oh on behold this religious folklore the has to it actually worked the problem with fasting is that you can only fast for long before you starve to death and that is not a very effect of treatment and this child was investing water correct yes is a for elimination food elimination no special diet it was it but the problem with fasting for epilepsy is that as soon as people start eating and normal diet again their seizures usually come right back oftentimes with a vengeance and it can be a good short term intervention ah the if the fasting can take a few days cause it in take a few days to get mitosis and then you can get some relief from chronic seizures but it is not a good long term treatment because again people will starve to death as soon as they start eating seizures come back it was actually doctor mussels wilder at the male clinic who developed the keetogenic diet with one and only one purpose he wanted to see can we medic the fasting state using this special diet to see if it might stop seizures long term and lo and behold it worked it ah early results were extraordinarily positive fifty percent of patience who use the erogenic diet became seizure are and another thirty five per cent have a fifty per cent our greater reduction in their seizure frequency about eight y five per cent efficacy rate sorry to interrupted i didn't been to do that there the it was it just for pediatric epilepsier for adult epilepsy is well back in the nineteen twenties we did not have many anti epilepsy treatments and t a lot of adults were struggling as well they were using it on anybody who would do the diet ism by the nineteen fifties farmersutacles were coming out we had many more anti convulsant treatments and there is no question they work for a lot of people that is great and taking a pill is much easier than doing this diet the diet pretty much fell out of favor and nobody was using it from the nineteen fifties to about the seventies but lo and behold even to this day people with epilepsy about thirty per cent do not respond to the current treatments that we have available thirty per cent will have treatment resistant epilepsy which means at continue to have seizures no matter how many anti convulsant her taking even if they have had brain surgery it just does not stop their seizures and in the nineteen seventies the keetogenicdit was resurrected at john's hoping for these treatment resisting cases and low and behold it works not for all of them but it works and bout a bout one third become seizure free and these are people whole tried everything and nothings workings to one third become seizure fry another third get a clinical benefit meaning of fifty per cent or greater reduction in their seizure frequency and the other third it does not seem to work it is not always clear if that is because of non compliance or if that is because it the the diets just not working but about a third a third a third seizure freedom production in seizures or it just does not work ism and the realities that the god send for me is that we have decades of our science research on the erogenic diet in what it is doing to the brain we know that the erogenic die is influencing her transmitter levels in particular glutamate gala a denizens it changes calcium channel regulation ah an calcium levels which is really important in the function of cells ah it changes get expression it it reduces brain inflammation it changes the got microfilm in their out got microfilm's a huge topic right now and there are some researchers who argue that is the primary benefit of the biogenic diet its changing the got microfilm in beneficial ways of it is doing a lot of things it obviously improves insolent resistance a lowers glucose levels lowers insolent levels which improves insolent signaling the key for my research that have outline the real magic is that this diet stimulates two processes that relate to mitacontria it is swim late a process called mytophogy which is getting rid of old and defect of mitochondria and replacing them with new ones and it also stimulates a process called mitochondrial biogenesis which means that after people have done the biogenic diet for a while months or years many of their sells in their bodies and brains we will have more mitochondria and those mitochondria will be healthier and i believe that is the reason the keitogenic diet is such a powerful treatment not only for epilepsy but also for people with chronic mental disorders would you man listening off a few of the mental disorders a and i note a this is not meant to be inside ball but we should distinguish between psychiatric disorders and neurological a symptoms and diseases that the fields of psychiatry neurology hopefully some day will disemerge but for instance typically of somebody is presenting with something the looks alshimers dementia they will talk to a neurologist whereas of somebody is presenting with symptoms skis a frena by poof the thoughcho psychiatric but if you would not mind a wearing a duel hat could you just quickly list off some of the neurologic inpsycheatric disorders for which keytogenic were list you say neutrician changes have been shown to improve symptoms significantly and the may we can dive into a couple of these as well as get more deeply into these too very interesting aspects of mitochondrial function and repair and turn over ye the the field in terms of nutritional psychiatry the brownfield and its in its infancy is the real answer if you're looking for randomize controlled trials documenting efficacy in large numbers of patients with these disorders we do not have them they're under way now but we do not have them yet we we do have ore a case studies we have a lot of mechanistic om science papers by some of the leading neuroscientist and psychiatrists in the world and neurologists in the world am kind of outlining this is everything we know that the keytogenic diets doing these are the problems in the brains of people with these chronic mental or neurological disorders we know that they should work but but the disorders range from chronic depression to we have got we have got a trial under way for petiasty we have got one actually decent pilot trial from the national institutes of health for the keitogenic did for aldol use disorder of all things and we can go into that a little more we have got a couple of pilot trials of the erogenic diet for all timerstisys we have got and those arandomis controlled trials we have got case studies of the cryogenic diet for chronic depression by polar disorder in scisohrenia the largest study that we have got in that mental health sphere is a pilot study of thirty one patients admitted to a french hospital the twenty eight of those patients w we able to do the diet and stay on the diet a ten per cent off the bat non compliant could not do the get we need to include that but of the twenty eight patient who were able to do and these were twenty right patients with treatment resistant mental disorders chronic depression by polar in scysophrenia of the patients who were able to do the kitoganic diet hundred per cent had at least sum improvement en symptoms forty six percent had remission of illness remission of illness that does not happen with current treatments and sixty four per cent i think were discharged on last medicine then they went into the hospital on it was not that the the the people were prescribing more medicine and that is why it was they were being discharged on let medication we have got at least again lot of that the hard course scientists are get u ay show us the random is controlled trials or with hundreds of patients and we have got five random control trials under way now a funded primarily through philanthropy i can tell you that we have talked about that one index patient but at pinpoint i have now treated dozens of patients and have heard from hundreds of patients who have been treated by other clinicians researchers or have just heard from patients from around the world who have shared stories of complete remission of long chronic mental disorders bypepolar disorder in schizophrenia off of psychiatric me some of them not all of them but some of them are able to get off all psychiatric mess and remain in remission again i think i did not say this before but it is really important to mention for people who might be unfamiliar with the mental field and its connection with epilepsy the reason that is it such an important connection is that we use epilepsy treatments in psychiatric patients every day in tends of millions of people a lot of people do not know this but ism a list off some names that a lot of your listeners may have heard of and they probably know them as psychiatric drugs but intact these are epilepsy drugs delicate tagritaled lamictol topomacx fronton or gapopentin value clonopan panic these all medications that stop seizures in many of them were developed initially for seizures but we and the mental halthfield quickly steel them and start using them in tends of millions of people even if there off label s that means we do not have research studies documenting that they are effective but we go had not use hem any way because the reality is far too many patients are not getting better with the f ti approve treatments that we do have to offer psychiatrists are just winging in some cases and we are just throwing whatever we can at them and we absolutely include epilepsy treatments in many ways using the biogenic diet as a treatment for serious mental disorders it is nothing new at all it is an established evidence base treatment for epilepsy we use evidence base treatments for epilepsy across the board for a wide range of mental disorders and in many ways that is all ism doing with the biogenic diet it just happens to be a diet i love it i love it and i should say i love it because we had a guest on here early days of the podcast ychollegue of mine at stamford is a bioengineer in a psychiatric phenomenal scientists and pcycatris am called diceroff when the laser prize and so on and of for than he made of really important point which should have been obvious to me but was not am until he said it which was youknow that the psychiatric has tools just the surgeon has tools but the tools are language and observing behavior om the those of the direction tools for what going on in some one's brain and then as a narrow scientists a you know ism familiar with the nor transmitters an demodulators and he mentioned that yo an her these tools of of you altering brain chemistry which are of the sorts of drugs u just list at of for ant at pressing or intycycotics the fall into these major bins of adjusting dopameanor adjusting ceretonan or some combination of dopamine ceremony and epinaperan denizen and on and on and on and it seems to me it is a it is an incredible field but that the feel is still very much in its infancy that it was not but a hundred years ago that people were measuring bumps on the head as a way to piano seen a phrenology and that there is still much to learn and when i hear you say adjusting nutrition or putting people into erogenic state or even just eliminating highly process food sugars et camera taking care of metabolic centrum and then observing tremendous relief in a clinical syndrome of were symptoms rather of psychiatric disorders it makes perfect sense to me it is yet another direction tool and i a tool for altering brain chemistry i think that if i think about the landscaped the sorsociology out there of again it it seem to be these bins a third of people sing of course that you no died in exercise and social connection and limiting stress that that is the good stuff that is the stuff that we know really works and then about thirty people are unclear and then a third of people think well if it is not a proscription drug than it just has no place in medicine and hopefully that is changing am and certainly the work that your doing is is can be important in in that at that transition and i think we will see i to talk about a my topology and might a condo you genesis i think a most people learn that the might a conure are the energy am factories of cells and that indeed they are mas a euro scientist what i know about them is that they are present everywhere anurans not just in the call sell body but you can find mite conure and in the further little bits of anurans and anurans can be quite big a very large in fact meters long or more in some cases and some species including us penny how tall somebody is can be many meters or several meters rather a and the mightacondrea do ell a lot of stuff besides just produce energy cause i think people here might a contra energy and thy think a these patients felt better they lost weigh they have more energy and than they are doing better but here we are talking about remission of auditory hallucinations people feeling a suit suicidal and then changing their died an feeling life is something they can deal with an maybe even function extremely well and et camera may we you just talk that might a century for a moment and then talk about these two major effects what are some of the other things that might a conure a important for a i anurans and a and maybe other cells of the brain because as a axis point for all this i think you'll be great if people could learn will a might a condo biology ya no it i guess the first thing that it'll say is that this field is one of the most cutting age fields in medicine right now am twenty years ago or i think the majority of research scientists thought of mitacondrea as nothing more than little batteries they they take food in oxygen and turn it t in to eight p p and that is really important ya we get that but there there just little batteries that is all they are a and one of the reasons that this work is important is i it is because it combines cutting at research in that metabolic field an the aging field and we can start to part with the mental health and neurological health field mitochondria one one scientists gave me this analogy said if you think of the cell as a computer a lot of people think of mitaconre as the power could that computer cause they are providing the power and they are in fact the power could that computer but actually their real function is the motherboard of that computer mtaconra are d directing and locating resources throughout a cell that is their primary function and then they happen to be power houses as well and to to give some clear examples mitacondrea play a direct role in the production and release and regulation of some really k narrow transmitters including ceratonan dopamine gloomy askialcoline those who pretty powerful narrow transmitter i would call those i would consider those the a negulisted more than the but a the primary colors of hero transmission yes any one of those in excess or deficiency is going to have profound negative effects on a nervous system or it is goon alter the way that people in animals feel think move you member et camera and as parts o mitacondre are providing both some of the building blocks if you will for some of those molecules their part of the crebscitric acid cycle some the some the intermediate products actually go into making those narrow transmitters much more importantly mitochondria provide the energy for the production of those narrow transmitters and fascinatingly mitacondr are directly related to the release of narrow transmitters a t p alone is not enough there been some research studies thou actually found that mitacondrea move a long the membrane of the snaps to release baches of vehicles of narrow transmitters and that if the mitacondr are remove from the snaps and researchers flood that cell with a t p near transmitters usually are not getting release mitacondrea are doing other things we do not entirely even understand what all their doing are how their doing it but their doing other things than just providing the power another really important example is that mitacndrea are actually the primary regulators of epigenatics if you look at any one factor one study actually found hat the responsible for the expression of about sixty per cent of the genes in a cell and and mitconre do this through a lot of ways that had been known for years and sometimes decade mitacondre are directly related to the levels of reactive oxygen species in a cell they are managing calcium regulation in cells a and we know that those things play a role an epigenesis expression we know the levels of a p p a d p or a m p also play a role am and mitacondre are doing those things but it turns out mitacondre actually doing much more sophisticated things than even those in terms of gene expression mitacondrea at least play a roll in all of the aspects of the human stress response on when humans are stressed either physically or psychologically a there are several things that happen a increase cordusall increase a adrenalin nor adrenalin a inflammation and gene expression in particular in the hippocampus occur with the stress response and one group of researchers actually genetically modified mitacndrea in four different ways and found that all of the stress response all those four buckets of the stress response were impacted in one way or another implying that mitacondrea are somehow playing a roll in those in turns of it their rolling codes all we know that mitacondra actually have the ends i required for the synthesis of steroid hormones that includes codes all estrogen testosterone and progesterone some names it may be everybody's heard of and a that means that if mitaconrea are in short supply or dysfunctional the production of those hormones may become deregulated am mitacondrea play a direct roll in inflammation and they turn the inflammatory system both on or they latest play a role and turning the inflammatory system both on and off think back bell quote the exact study and author but one paper an cell actually identified mitaconrea as the key regulator in turning certain in inflammatory cells off and that when you inhibit mitacondreal function those cells do not turn off that mitacondrea levels of reactiboxygen species are a hey signaling process to turn the inflammatory sell process off another study found that macrophages macrophages are an important mine cell the play a rollanhealing if you cut yourself your your body will get you will send inflammation that way and a and send a micelles that way to try to heal your skin and macrophages play a important role in that healing one group of researchers tried to figure out how do macrophages know to switch between the different phases of wound healing cause macrophages do different things in the different phases of wound healing and the conclusion of all f their research was that its mitaconrea mitacondrea are sending the essential signals that change the state of the macrophages to induce these different phases of wound eating have just talked about negro transmitters hormones biogenetic expression in inflammation for anybody familiar with the mental had field they know these are some of the key variables that researchers have been struggling with for decades trying to figure out how do these fit together we know that all of the those buckets can be disrupted in people with mental disorders and our field has struggled to understand but how do they fit together how can we make sense of this disruption and i believe once you understand the science of mitochondria you can actually connect all of the dots of the mental illness puzzle superinteresting little subceller a goodbye these mitacondre are i i a i come from a field where people are often divided into lumpers and splitters and a ism somewhere between am for those we do not know lumpers are people they to make things really simple lists of no more than three functions or dividing brain areas into no more than three splitters of people the to subdivide into a ton of detail a there is a history of scientists being splitters in order to be able the name things after t themselves because a there is more territory to go around if your splitting than if you are lunching am but we are doing neither here what what ism hearing is that migtaconrea in addition to being important sources of energy production and output cells which of course they are am probably have other rules and that maybes maybe some day wet we call mitacondra will actually be two or three different will subseller organ ells there may be little bits in there there controlingene expression and will bits in there that are controlling nor translate production at least for now that the name is mitacondrea and thank you by the way for am illustrating some of the other things that they do because am in the landscape of science education oftentimes people think get energy production that's be a picture or cartoon it a core flexing its muscles people got energy mtacondre a mighty mitacondret little thing oh they are just sort of a dumb job portion of the cell right they are not doing anything sophisticated and everything you listed off is that they are doing many sophisticated intricate things within cells i think how things are captured in disguise actually has not in pact and not just on the general public but on ethical field and on the science fields and when that is more science biology but now that a everyone is well aware that might country a doing a large number very important things in a very regulated way let us talk about mytophogy a few years ago because a a noble prize as given for autophogy sometimes called autophagi look people yon say t either way people know awfully what it means is more important which is the gobbling up of one's own cells that are dead or injured and this idea of autophagy of sells a a being eaten up were within a system nervous system or of the system has come up again and again i actually was not aware that mytophagy could be such an important lever tell us about mytophogy which i have to resume is the intentional were not gobbling up of mtacondrea presume we to replace them with newer healthier my contra camera it is and in in many ways mytophogy is a subset of autophyte but it is it is got its own name because it is specific to mitochondria there do appear to be some unique regulators of mytophogy compared to autophogy more broadly mitacondrea actually are playing a a roll in autophagy itself and this makes sense because one of he the global picture of autophogi is stimulated by fasting states or fasting mimicking states when your body senses that you do not have enough food it actually honkers down and starts to recycle dead old parts in this kind of carefully orchestrated way and it take some delisosoms that get degraded and then those degradation products get used for either energy or to build new things autopsies always occurring at a low level but you can really hyper stimulate the process through fasting carry restriction fasting mimicking diets other things and this is why fasting and fast carry restriction is kind of such tottopics in the medical field now as because we they been shown toe induce longevity and we think it is probably through that process that your your stimulating the body to kind of become lean and conservative in terms of its plication of resources and the body does not just destroy the healthiest tissue along with the old dead stop it has these processes that identify the old and defective parts first and they go first and that is what is beautiful about the thing and that is why fasting is important my topology we now plays a really important roll because a there is this term called mytacondrial dysfunction which some researchers are actually wanting to get rid of and move away from because as you just said mytacondri do many different things and different mitochondria even within the same cell may very well be specializing in different tasks and mite country from one sell to another are sometimes doing very different things not all mitacondrea can produce cortusall that specific specific cells where those genes are getting turned on it is not all mitacondrea are producing cortical just the ones in ourdremal glad for instance are producing cortusall but there is this term mitacondral dysfunction and it's long been known for decades that mitaconrial dysfunction is associated with everything that ails us essentially om in the nineteen fifties we had a theory of aging there was based on creative oxygen species and that essentially and that is where all the inflammation is bad for you comes from and where all the om noise about antioxidants less in the nine weasels it contains any oxygen's not say in theoxydents are bad but they are certainly not the be all end all of health they are not but that is exactly where that research came from is that researchers were narrowing in on these reactive oxygen species are highly highly correlated with all of the diseases of aging and poor health outcomes turns out they are also highly highly correlated with all chronic mental disorders interestingly and researchers use the antioxygens to see if will maybe if we can stop somehow tame these reactive oxygen species will improve health outcomes does not seem to work be the nineteen seventies our understanding of mitaconrea and the role in the promotion of reactive oxygen species expanded and that led to the mitochondrial theory of aging in the nineteen seventies we had this mitochondrial theory of aging base primarily and exclusively on reactive oxygen species fast forward a couple of decades that was disproven because we now know reactive oxygen species are not all bad they actually serve a signaling process their a normal part of human functioning and cellular function they are not all bad but we still know high levels of reactive oxygen species are bad for you fast forward to just i think maybe last year with this expanded role of all the different things mitacondrea are doing avid sin car a published a pate paper in one of the cell journals i think a saying that oh mitaconria are actually the unified link of everything that we know about aging mitochondria are the cause or defective mitacnria or defective mitochondrial function mitacondrual dysfunction is possibly the unifying cause of aging in all f the aging related disorders my tophegy is trying to address all that is trying to stalemate this is bad we do not want defective mitacondrea and how can we get rid of old ones or defective ones and and replace them with new ones and i think the most powerful signal and tool that we have right now is in fact related to diet is carry restriction that is the oldest truest kind of best proven way to prevent aging in a wide variety of animal species fasting and intermittent fast thing and again you can only do those things for long and then fasting mimicking diets ism can also stimulate this process of my topology before we talk about medicondria you genesis if and i certainly except the idea that mitochondria are extremely important in physical health and mental health that is a for me is as a straightforward a conclusion at this point bacon what you have said whatever it elsewhere et camera and if varies diets including keep genie including fasting reducing sugar and take et camera can assist in myticondrial function and mytophogy and that is at least one of the levers by which diet can positively impact mental health and physical health can we conclude that there is something special about low blood gluecoasts in the brain right i mean that the the sort of common pathway of all those things fasting autogenesis refer some people may be they may be some people manage have great insolent managements o just removing sweets re fine sugars brings down their bloodlucos level substantially they do not need to go on a kit genitive in order to relieve a low level depression or something that seems the the common theme here is that glucose levels in the brain need to be reduced which for me is surprising because neuron's love gluecoasts i mean that there are some really nice studies one that i can think of a recently those publishing nuronge if you just of et the tuning of a neuron how well a neuron in the brain represent some visual image in the environment in terms at here we can just generalize and saying more action potentials more electrical signals from the neuron generally correlates with better high fidelity representation it is sort of you if everyone is time some one says shout and the some one shouts the groans the one responding to the order and these nurses just when there is high glue coast they are faithful representatives of what is out there in the world but then when you fast in animal they become less faithful representatives of what is out there and yet when have done intermit fasting and i do a kind of modified version of it my mental clarity is far better than when have had ta bimbo of post probably for other reasons relates a ceratonan and trip to fan and i think it for the typical listener not there a to main it is got to be a little confusing right we here neuron's love glucose they live on glucose and here we are saying let us deprive them of some glucose or let us just bring glucose levels down or let us switch the fuel source of the brain from glucose to ketones and now the brain really works the way it is suppose to this raises a little bit of a just story question why would it be the case that neuron's love glucose and yet if there is too much glues around they become sick am and of course with any a why would it be story as i was say i was not consulted the the design phase and ism going to presume that you were not consulted the designs in either and that if any of us say the we are that we are probably the patient that need evaluation i think there's a name for that right there is delusion right of a throw of my first a correct clinical assessment of myself how do i get my head around this right you have got me sold on motacondrea not that i needed to be sold but that is an easy yes yes absolute yes the idea that i can impact mental health in physichov yes absolutely by way of mitacondrea at least in part great but then neuron's love glucose what is going on or what do you think is going on i am not convince that glucose is the real story glucose may in fact to be a symptom we know that we know the parts of the brain yew there is a there been a couple of studies that just came out in the last coup of weeks i think documenting the actually astrosites in thepathalames play a key roll in glucose regulation throughout the body and a and it appears to be a metabolic roll which in my mind implies that the mytaconrea in those atrocities are probably playing a key roll because we know mytacondria play a key roll in sensing glucose's levels they play a key roll in the release of insulin from the pancreas but mtacondria in the brain is also playing a roll in kind of balancing how much glucose is around and it is it is a difficult question because i think in some cases high glucose's levels are actually a symptom of metabolic dysfunction somewhere in the body or brain and when i think about what does that mean in my mind most of the evidence currently is pointing to mydacondual dysfunction somewhere in the body or brainthat is the most likely cause of not deregulation of glucose levels am but we know that if you consume mass of amounts of junk food sugar and other things that you can get deregulation of glucose levels the the conundrum though is that that is not a universal response and what about the typical person have never really junk food that much maybe is a kid i can recall it liking candy but i was a sandwich for lunch person for a long time and as have changed that out for salad and a maybe a small piece of meet with my salad or something that i feel far better during the day far more alert but i do eat carbohydrates i eat churches typically at night but i tend to do some very hard training at some point during the day i imagine i have some age to repack oh get that is me i only mention that because i not in mitosis as far as i know have not the muss you brought the the strips i have not a have he blood glucose ten to day am what about the the typical person whose an minor war eating am some rice impost post salads you have people theatre that are eating not junk food massive amounts of sugar but have bloodglucosits an kind of moderate range do you think and here feel free to speculate do you think that those people might feel far better or even a little bit better if they were in a lower luck state and i ask is because o i think there are a lot of people other who suffer from full blown depression but there also a lot of people who suffer from moodiness and feeling not great some clinical depression burn out it is what i would call it ye and i run just feeling some days are great in than other days they feel lousy for reasons they do not understand am and those make for less dramatic case studies and yet i have to assume that that description will nets of a large fraction of the general public the the way that i kind of break this field and in probably getting too nerdy right now but i kind of break this field into cause what is the actual rule cause and what are effective treatments and i really see them is too separate things simp just because the key to jenacdiah is an effective treatment does not imply that the cause of the problem was eating carbohydrates and i think that is a really important distinction there are many people who disagree with me on that there is no doubt about it and eve nobody's heard people say sugar is the cause of everything that ails you our cars are the cause of everything that ails if everybody does all carburetor acetonic die and then they go to it must be sugar that was the cause i do not see it as clearly black and white is that the gallery restriction biogenic get carbohydrate restriction are inducing metabolic changes in the brain and body and regardless of what the person was eating they are inducing metabolic changes that can be really beneficial to brain health let me let me just give a clear black and white example of this and then i and then i can speak to the broader topic that you brought up about just a general population the easy example of the biogenic diet being in effect intervention for somebody who was not following a bad diet is an infant with epilepsy there are lots of infants who have uncontrollable seizures they are drinking breast milk to the best of our knowledge that is the primary most beneficial food source and infant could be consuming now some might say we maybe the mothers doing now what whatever i i do not by that the mothers breast milk is in fact the the the optimal food source for that infant and yet that infant is still seizing if we put that infant on a biogenic diet a lot of those infants seizures will stop it does not mean that the cause of the infant seizures was a bad diet but it means a dietary intervention can change brain metabolism and improve symptoms in that person going to your broader question about adults modern day the real answer yet there was just this conference in onion the royal college of obesity medicine or something that i a that is not the name but is something along this line the conclusion of that conference that invited the greatest minds and obesity medicine the overarching conclusion of that conference was we do not know what causes obesity it is really impart that we sit with that we do not know what causes obesity they do not think access color can take beyond once daily metabolic needs is causing obesity some will argue that but and and some will say yes it is all energy balance but why do we have an epidemic of obesity well that is a that is the angazilian duller quean and junk some will say is all the junk food but we have junk food in the nineteen seventies when i was growing up i grew up on coolly and twinkles and dingdongs and hook and oh ism reign rematching the madmen series now i love that series in a rematching it and i i have not snog one who worked on that series they research everything for the props and the costumes every but right down to diet if you look at the the diet was terrible was mostly yes there was a lot of excessive amounts of drinking and cigarette smoking but the diets were terrible it was prepackage foods it was frozen dinners eking that really came to prominence in the seventies and eighties a but even in the fifties and o from what have been reading even in the thirties and forties at people were not eating grass fed meat and brazil nuts with a little bit of richly rabbi on the side besom not the typical intake a something something out there or may be multiple things or at play to increase o cecity and at the end of the day i believe some will call the speculative but i actually think we have got a tremendous amount of evidence that continues to point in this direction i believe that might accondrea are the key to the city epidemic that there is something in our environments that is either our food environmental talks and stress levels corselet not getting adequate sunlight whatever you want a speculate on all all of the boy all of those things are known to impart mitochondrial function and if if if parts of your brain that really metabolism and that really eating behaviors are not metabolically healthy it means that they will not stop you from eating or it means that your metabolism will not rise to the challenge of tendons because some people can eat tan donuts and go on thing thin and healthy although i truly agreabthough i would am just to say that it seems to me that compared to when i was growing up and again have not run the statistics there are fewer in fewer of those individuals around now just as when i was growing up it was one or two kids in class that were quite over weight and then there were some that were mildly over weight but most were of healthy weight nowadays that is dramatically altered the landscape is dramatically altered in the other direction am it is rare when i encounter one of those can eat anything tight people i know one he is atuallyad employ at stamford he is on our mediate at stamford and an whisky i when i take him to launch us the meson is a early seventy and eat can eat and a his incredibly lean he exercises a little bit but he is one of these mutants that just can eat and eat and eat and he is lean and he is vital l and hes it is it is wild am and he is an expensive lunch i a what those people are seem rare and even those kids are now seem rare they are getting increasingly rare and and that that leads me to think it may be epigenatic factors in the womenvironment that kids are actually coming out predisposed to city let me ask you about that because i had a note here to ask this later but am going to interruption now in order to capture this moment my understanding is that well as everyone knows we inherit done we get genes from both of our parents an they mix although they're incredible data from gathering blocks lab at hazard and other showing that we actually have entire regions of our brain that carry a durians that are of purely of mams or of dad's done depending on the rain region this is a wild finding and but it is accurate in this is actually been known about in in terms of heritability disease at camera maternal done data from mam genes from our mother not to place o blame o mothers at all my understanding is that the mtacondrial dona come exclusively through the maternal side is that true it is a great question and have been ask this before and ya psychiatrists are known for blaming mothers and some might say that ism trying to red that hole exclave mothers again the a the data of the data ism not trying to blame mothers your mothers play in essential role in in everything am what if if it is true that mitacondreare the lynch pin of all this and maternal dona is what determines the mitacondral done i think it is an important place to it is an important question and the answer is unequivocally now that is not the way it work well then vindications over any one that was asserting the and let me explain it mitacondrea have thirty six genes unto themselves thirteen of those genes code for some of the mitacondril machinery of making high t p in the other thirty six play rolls in am epigenatic regulation play rolls and whole body metabolism and other things but that is what you are inheriting from your mam is the mitochondria and those thirty six genes for the most part but the majority of propenes that make up mitochondria over i think thirteen hundred genes that make up mitaonra are actually encoded in the nuclear dona and you inheritacopy from both your mother and your father the majority of people who have mitochondrial defects or mite rare mitochondrial diseases actually could inherit them from either mam or dad because it can be a defect in am the nuclear genes that code for propenes that make up mitochondria the much bigger issue when when i talk about mitochondrial dysfunction being a primary driver of mental illness metabolic illness it is not that people inherit a defective mitochondrion or mitochondria from mam and then that just ruins their life forever that is actually not the way it works the beautiful thing about this theory is that it connects all of the risk factors that we already no play a role in mental health but also metabolic health sleep disruption impairs mitochondria and mitacondral function stress highlovells of stress and drama impair mitochondrial function drug an alcohol use alcohol back tobacco definitely in terms of the smoke and a meriwana t h c in particular all impart mitochondrial function t h c directly or or the the smoke a t h c direct y those studies have been done and it they mitacondre actually have c b one receptors right on them and a and various researchers a couple of studies from nature actually documented this that that the mitacondrual c b one receptors are primary a kind of primary points of the influence of meriwana on human behaviors and effects om because when they remove c b one receptors an animalmadels these changes do not happen the c b one receptors om we got some large studies of adolescence who use the lot of marijuana and the arias where the mitacondrea have the greatest numbers of c b one receptors are tries of their brains that actually are atrophied or shrunk compared to normal healthy controls that means their brain tissues aging prematurely its shrinking prematurely but the c b one receptors on mitacondre also seem to play a role in the memory temperament that can be induced from it from a t h c and they also play a role in a the kind of lack of motivation the behavioral motivational state a from t h c now again for people who want to chalk that is what they are looking for they do not want to remember anything the they do not want to think they they they will not be spastout they want a relax that is great but it is important that they know that they are actually harming the mitochondria in their brain cells and that although there is always an opportunity to reparamitacondra and always an opportunity to stimulate maticondrial by agents as to you can get at back but if you keep doing it chronically your probably not helping your over all mental or matabolichal ism glad you brought up t s we did not episode on mambas we also did one on alcohol probably lost some friends am from that one i mend when you look at the data it is very clear up and ism not arguing that people dislike the effects of these compounds when they take them a but it is clear that least to me based on the data that regardless of what people have read about red wine that not drinking any alcoholic going to be healthier than drinking alcohol that the thresholds for alcohol ingestion before people start to negatively impact their health as about one or two per week and then t h s because of the very hi concentrations of t h that air present in a lot of products now raping and smoking team s and even edibles that it it can be problematic you mention adolescence that you not predisposition of brain atrophy psychos s et camera in any case am because you mentioned alcohol because it is a commonly used a substance a i heard you give a talk in which i think i have this right in which a alcohol can disrupt the way that the brain uses fuels of all kinds which may disrupt one's response to alcohol make aldol seem a more a a rewarding to those that drink aldols drinking aldol makes aldol more rewarding to the brains alcohol you drinkers a but that it also might alter glucose metabolism that easily alcohol is not good for our brains a it did n have that correct you do have that coractoca a what happens if you take an alcoholic were somebody that just drinks u to tofourenights a week a couple of drinks which i think is pretty common out there am and you put them on a meet genic die as that experiment been done that experiment has been done and a by an it led by none other than a woman name nor vocal who is one of the leading para scientists a an addiction researchers in the world she is the director of the national institute of drugabusts she has been hot on the trail of metabolic abnormalities in the brains of people with alcohol use disorder which i will just refer to as alcoholics because i thought everybody knows it as am she has been hot on this trail for many many years and a and as you said it turns out that am the reward pathways in particular are metabolically compromised in alcoholics and the metabolic compromise essentially in epochal means they are not getting enough fuel from glue coasts the interesting thing is that when people drink alcohol your liver converts alcohol into a molecule called agitate that agitate travels up to the brain and fuels brain cells in particular some of these reward pathway sells more than others and a chronic alcoholics have this chronic deprivation of energy in these cells and norovalco and other researches that national institutes of hell a did a study in which they they set out to see if we can change this brain metabolic problem in alcoholics will that effect clinical symptoms of alcoholism and will it do anything it is clinically useful and they actually did a pilot randomize controlled trial admitted alcoholics to a detox unit half of the patients got a e to genic diet the other half got the standard america diet then everybody else the all of em got the same detox protocol the patients who got the key to genic diet required fewer benzol days of penes for their demons despite that they had fewer withdraw symptoms from the alcohol they reported fewer cravings for alcohol and the researchers did brain scans which showed improved brain metabolism in these key fairies that they were looking at and their brains showed reduce levels of narrow inflammation which was also something they were really interested in and that one study says to us this even though most people would think alcoholism has nothing to do with diet alcohols just drink in too much it is a matter of will power or its somebody who is addictive they have got in addictive personality in is if's that simple easy you come out of the womb within addictive personality and those people are novelty seekers in their impulsive and they have no patients they have no discipline they cannot sustain any kind of rewarding experience or child who drama there tad dew there is a yes story there which e there very well maybe but and there may be and but what that research study strongly suggest send again yes maybe we need larger controlled trials but this is one of the leading nail scientists in the world whose hot on this trail this is what she believes and this is what i believe is it if we can correct the brain metabolic defects from chronic alcohol use we might be able to help people be sober and give them a fighting chance or give them an edge up or pull a lever that we can use in their favor for their benefit heirs one cautioned all f this research that i really do one a highlight in son ism going to get hatemale from all the kept community took a i mare not if me i admire you for going but nutrition at all because ant i i one talks about nutrition you are can get hapemale from sodium the the cave at to all of this is that as part of the research that those ism researches were doing they actually wanted to see what will happen to alcohol levels if an animal consumes alcohol while on are to genic diet s they did not do this in humans yet this is a fairly easy study to do ism hoping somebody will do the study soon but they they instead put rats half of a on a standard diet and half of a money to genic get and then they expose them to the exact same amount of alcohol the rats who were on the key to genic diet had a fivefold increase in blood alcohol levels fivefold increase meaning they drank more or n always metabolized if wasn't a stabilized differently they the rats all got the same amount of alcohol for people out there whore keytojenik chuckling but we are not alkali please alkali please do something about it cause it detrimental but i guys is this mean that they can drink less in order to get the effect of a pals that thirst people are seen cheap dates cheap date is what you call that a you only need a half a drink instead of three drinks i would think the kept community with thank you for this unless they somehow have a stake in the a the alcohol industry the the reason that i the reason that i put it is a caution is that if anybody is struggling with alcoholism and thanks hey i need an drop i need to leave her tools because ism really struggling to give the stuff of i just find myself going back and if you are telling me my brain metabolism is nessstop and this might help it ism all in favor of that and yes that is what the researchers are pursuing and that is what ism saying with the following cave you that if you relapse while on a qetogjenic diet you better not drink the same amount of alcohol that you think you can drink i to be deadly it it could be deadly and and orbit could be really you deadly to you or some one else because ism fortunately a lot of times when people drink they get behind the wheel and they think that they can handle to drinks safely and they they think well i i can go out for dinner and have two glasses of wine and drive home safely i know myself if you go to a keytojenic diet please do not drive with the same two drinks because it means your blood alcohol level if it is any if it models anything that wee found in the rat study your blood alcohol levels may be five times higher than they would normally be and that means you are really wasted ah and you are probably not safe to be driving from the same as true for drink yon an empty stomach cried ye not it is a very important pointing that thank you for raising that mi hear this again about mitochondria about blood glucose i you mention asteroids in for those of you a for that earlier assercises a anon neuron cell type in the brain a gleoseltype that my posiceodbises or was unknown for a popularizing the modern science of of plea which include exercises and it'd be emissive i did not say that they do they are consider the the cells that hold everything together in the rain and are kind of passive observers but they do many things actively their they i think now people appreciate the exercises as it least as important as the anurans and certainly for disease they are often implicated in wording off of disease et camera everything that you are telling me about the fact that the brain can regulate things that are happening in the body metabolism et camera organ health obesity et camera to me is a neuroscientist that is not surprising all of it just screams hypothalamus hypothalamus hypothalamus cuss here you are telling me it is regulating these bail functions metabolism it is regulating how much we crave things and of course hypothalamus is involved in motivation increasing there others to others the bring to of course but i would imagine that some one ought too has mapped out where the the receptors for all this business are in the brain and and and i guess that raises the question of when one goes on a keetogenic or low blood glucose diet or fast has anyone observe changes in the brain as anyone ta now imaging of humans and their brains a under conditions of investing one diet or another whether not their psychiatric suffering from a psychiatric disorder or not i would think that i would think that is where that the gold is we do have some of those studies and they the when you do in narimaging study you can measure a lot of different things one thing with a pet scan you can measure glucoastsmantabilism a a research or stepped contain is doing that research in particular in all timers disease patience i end all summers these models but in humans and that is because we know that i again a a a common finding and patient with all summer's disease is this glucose hypoement cabalism some people are attributing it to insolent signaling and parament and some people are calling at type three diabetes the end of the day i think the clearest signal that we have is that sells are not getting enough energy from gluecoasts as a fuel source that is something that i think i can confidently say that is backed by numerous research studies there is debate in the research field about whether that primary a primary driver of the illness i happen to believe it is and i if you ask the question will we would calls not be getting enough fuel from glucose it the focus on mytachonreacaus they're the ones producing the fuel from that glucose o you somehow you have to implicate mytichondrea in that process one way or another am others will say no that is just you knowiside effect of whatever causing all gamers disease but stephenkunane has done studies where he even gives quinone supplements is ore liquid ketone esters ya ketone esters or ketone salts and it has actually found that these brain metabolism deficits can be corrected at least short term by giving a quinone supplement is this am in the contact of people also in getting som carbohydrate is i i confess i have tried the qeitogenic diet i probably did it wrong this was years ago and then the ciclaqeitogenic it but in the last year or have started using liquid quinone esters but i and i do eat some carbohydrates each day usually in proportion to how much high intensity exercise ism doing those liquid ketone esters for me at least subjectively i feel greatly increase my energy levels of my ability to focus mentally and they improve my sleep this is my observation tracking some data but just again subjectively in this example are you talking about people taking quinone esters or ketone salts on a backdrop of a biogenic diet or on the backdrop of a more typical diet he is done both he is done he is done studies where patients are not doing anything special with the diets o there eating whatever they normally eat absolutely non qeitogenik giving them a ketone salt or ester and then noticing immediate and direct changes in the metabolism of these metabolically compromised brain calls by as measured by pet imaging these are not household pets by the way i sarryat we have to apeityour positronomission tomography not that although am sure that there people out there who have their dogs ore cats are whatever there bat kangaroos whatever you might own on eitojgenidits oke absolutely he is actually moved further he is done a pilot trial an the nursing home actually where he did not put the patients on a kept genicdiet he simply reduced carbohydrate consumption at breakfast and lunch they still got the same dinner as every one else and simply reducing carbohydrate consumption at breakfast and lunch resulted in cognitive improvement and in statistically significant way in some of those subjects i love that result ism sorry i jobs have to pilot was i am a huge believer in in directing carbohydrates to specific portions of the day when one needs to be less focus an alert and yet can replenished glikagen limiting car liberates most of the time during the day for me has been a game changer in terms of maintaining alertness et camera ism not aware that i have naturally concave the climb but then again i people round me my argue let me let me say you are drew supermen there is no way you tither lee did know me is relogti impairment were all screwed have plenty of flaws and embarkments and well over three thousand documented by people very close to me a but this is very interesting i think in the contacts of everything we bee talking about because could it be that supplementing with liquid ketones or prescribing liquikeytones to people who are challenged with a disorders or things of that sort could be beneficial even if they are not willing or able to adhere to a key to genicdiet that is the million dollar question right now and we do not have good trial data to say yes or now my speculation my my hunch having tried that clinically with patients is it does not seem to work it is not the same thing my the bigger reason for my feeling confident in saying that is that we have had keystone salts and esters available for over a decade now we have tens of thousands of children in adolescents who are following a strict ridiculously strict we tojenacdiet to control their epilepsy those kids with love to be off the key to genicdiet their parents with love to have them off regain don or detach no ice r there is not one case report of any child controlling his or her seizers using examens ketones without also doing the my togenicdiet i just find it hard to believe that at least some of those people have not tried it out to see i do know some patients with by polar disorder and even skisafrenniak who are doing extraordinarily well on keytogenicdiet they have tried to switch off the keytojencdie using ecxagenis ketones their symptoms came back and they they found that it just was not effective again those are anecdotes my scientific speculation about why is is because the key to genic diet is actually not necessarily about ketones themselves ketones are one of a moltifacided story there and when people do a key tojenicdiet there also improving their lowering gluecoasts levels their improve in insolent signaling they are camping up mitacondril by genesis in particular in the liver because mitacondre actually make ketones that is where they are made and their primarily made in deliver mtaondria when somebody is on in a fasting state or on a keytogenic diet their liver mitochondria go through the roof because they are being called the action it is hay bodies in starvation mod get to work and the mitacondra youth the all senses we need more mitaconria to process fat to turn it into keystone that those ketones can get up to the brain and keep the brain fuel because fatiacis cannot fuel the brain only ketones can now my sense is that an the got mi opium changes and everything the changes in hormones if you are eating a lot of doughnuts and drinking a bottle of ketones the doughnuts are going to prevent your body from lowering glucose levels your still go to have the high glucose levels from the doughnuts your still go to probably have the impaled insolent signaling you probably still going to possibly have some inflammation from the inflammatory effects of that food u and and just drinking ketones alone will not be enough i think i think for people who are metabolically healthy it'll include you in that i think ketones can play a really beneficial roll no doubt i think exogenous ketones may in fact prove invaluable in clinical use for patients who maybe cannot follow a super strict key to genicdiet but maybe could do a low carbide and then given the research happening with alcohol use disorder i could imagine a situation here is the million dollar know a tip whoever ants to go out and get this if it actually turns out to be true i could imagine a her scenario where we use accagenous ketones with alcoholics and that every time they have a severe craving for alcohol they drink ketones instead which sort of taste alcohol the keytonesters i when i take them they i drink them straight son ones tho but them in seller and not a big drinkers ti mat i might have an call drink every once in a while i just do not ever care it a tissue every may be think twenty twenty was the last time drink call obvious my not to representative example but the ketones taste good to me and they obviously do not get drunk they s they do seem to u flick on my alertness pretty quickly the and i my understanding is that they are the brains preferred fuel source meaning they are going to be the first fuel s used by the brain in when there say buffalo of fuels available there is glucose in my bloodstream there is circulating liquid ketones that ketones would be used first or preferentially is that true i think it is a complex question mean some some research that we have suggest that there are brain areas or brain cells that require glucose and cannot use ketones one hundred percent of the brain cannot be fueled with ketones as far as we can tell there are some areas that require glucose and that probably the reason we have gluconeogenesis to keep the body going and keep the bringing no better what but when ketones are available especially if ketones are high the way i think about it is not that ketones are the preferred fuel source and glucoasts goes to the wayside but the way i think about it is that you have a range of cells with varying degrees of metabolic health and some of those cells are going to be extraordinarily healthy with appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria and those cells are probably going to continue to use glucose's of fuel source but if stones happen to be there sir they will use that too why not but the real money is metabolically compromised tissues whether its brain cells a other tissues that but we are talking about the brain if you have got metabolically compromised brain cells cause it is not across the board with all timers brainpans there are specific regions that are more metabolically compromised than others and that is why we see patterns of atrophy in specific brain regions is because those regions are dysfunctional metabolically for whatever recent and we can get into why that might be but but my sense is that if you have gotametabolically compromise cell that cell is sending out a distress signal that cell is calling resources from the body feed me give me something and if it cannot use glucose effectively it is good a suck up those ketones and then start running on all cylinders or closer to it and and that that process is critical because what it means is that if that if that hallways barely getting by on sixty per cent of its real city my requirement it means that it does not have enough energy for maintenance and repair functions as soon as you give that cell a hundred per cent energy or close to it o you en if you get it up to ninety per cent of its preferred energy amount i it can start to repair its elf i mean that is the beauty of the human body and living organisms is that they have a priority lest of what they are got to do and and if they if that sell senses that there are defective molecules the defective prolines in this all that need to be replace i once hat gets enough fuel it will start repairing itself and doing that work i makes sense thank you for that clarification is talk about alsheimers and agerela connive decline generally i know many people out there are just terrified of losing their memory for the obvious reasons memory sets contact et camera and many people have relatives that suffer from alshemers are other forms of dementia have heard that the qeitogenic diet and diets it can be very effective for helping to offset some of the symptoms of alsheimers and truly connive decline in fact even have a friend i will not out by institution who is the chair of cardiology who contacted me of all people am asking whether not i was aware of any studies or whether not a knew of anybody who had benefited from qeitogenic diet for alsheimers and i why do not you ask one of your colleagues in neurology but his response was really interesting he said there is there many books out there for the general public there lot of online discussions about this there are lot of assertions about this in some animal studies but the again these are his words there are very few if any controlled clinical trials exploring the role of the biogenic diet for the treatment or reversal of alsheimers an truly connive decline ism hoping that statement was incorrect or soon will be incorrect because those trials are on going but he said yet that the people ware most popular for telling us about the important role and positive role of of being in mitosis for alsheimers for some reason they just will not do a clinical trial and that is been frustrating to the community this is a very educated very accomplished person whose a physician of a heart medicine as opposed to only something else i really to the brain but what is the story there and and for goodness sake why are not their clinical trials on qeitogenicdiet and alsheimers i i do not expect you to have the to be responsible for that fact but gut goodness i i would think this would be the obvious thing for an i among study section but not for these sorts of experiments why is not money just avalanching into this area based on all the anecdotal evidence but people or talking about we have got a couple of small pilot clinical trials the best one was a randomize controlled trial i think it only included twenty six subject something that u randomized to twelve weeks of a low fat diet ten week wash out twelve weeks of queitojanac diet some of the participants got quite first and then low fat other participants got low fat can quite and that trial actually found that when patients were in quitosas they had statistically significant improvement in activities of daily living and quality of life and they did have improvement in cognitive function but it did not reach statistical significance that improvement did not we have got other trials we have got several animal models showing that the qutojanac diet can improve big markers of all timers disease in allshimers models it can reduce places and tangles can even improve cognitive impairment in animal models we have got and we have got a couple of other small pilot trials of qeitojenacda inhuman showing that in improve big markers compared to say the low fat diet or the america heart association get we have got those i think one of the biggest challenges that ills share openly in this is ism somebody whose pretty passionate about this research and i believe it has a lot of potential m but john's hoping researchers attempted to do exactly this kind of a study a all timers patient qeitogjenacdiet verses the i think amebic america academy of aging or something that diet as the control diet which presumably has starches in there you think that is ta see very probably lots a it lots the isholeaos is last whole gran sand potatoes and they spent i believe over three years they screened over thirteen hundred particle thirteen hundred people who expressed interest the end of the day i think they only got twenty seven people to enroll and only fourteen of those people completed the study while despite that what they found was that the subjects who achieved mitosis had cognitive improvement but people on study section or get a look at a study that and say even if the science is there if you cannot get people to do this diet why would we spend money on researchers trying to get people to do the diet i should mention study section is this a close a more panels of forty or people they there many of these panels a different a a different divisions of the national institutes tot health use different panels and then grants are valuated and in a very small a because of the size of the federal budget for research a very small a a percentage usually about ten per cent of these studies are funded the rest do not generally do not end of happening a that is very informative a what you just described as very informative because a now it make sense to me that there is no conspiracy it is not big farm i do not think is trying to suppress trials of of a keetogenic diets on alshimers because i would imagine the first thing that farmer we want to do is to see that study done they did not have to and then the moment they would it was done if it showed a plosive effect they probably want to isolate the molecule and wrapt up in something that people take right just i do not this there is any active suppression by farm i think farmer would probably be cheering from the sidelines because they could capitalize on it because ultimately to studies are done by scientists but the treatments are generally doled out by fantastical companies were and ere physicians i do not believethere is a conspiracy there that is very interesting and kind of amazing given our discussion of earlier which is that you had a patient that was having sets a irenic symptoms who mange to stay on this diet is there something special about alshimers patients and people they delay connive decline presume their very dependent on others to to cook for them and shop for them think that this is a almost perfect controlled environment for getting the study done i think that is the key issue again i got patients i get patients with by polar disorders ketsaphrenia extraordinarily impaired people to do this diet and stay with it but it is because ism providing a weekly session for them and and i imagine this study did not provide that kind of intents of support i think in the pilot trial that i describe to you they actually got i think over ninety percent compliance with the different dietary interventions some of it is go to be dependent on the research group and does the research group understand that this is not you s not prescribing a pill here take this pill an take it every day and come back in three weeks and even then we do not know for sprat the patient took the pill every do we just assume they took the pill every day and studies say they probably did not but i think when we think about a dietary intervention we see end to think about more intend of support and an education and that support could be a health wellness coach it could be a dietitian it could be education of the family it might even be providing them with dietary meals it may be for six months we actually provide them with photogenic meals once a week put him in your freezer you machree warm when needed to make this diet as ease and durable as possible because if we can get people to do the i if we can get them through the first couple of months most people can learn how to do this diet more importantly an did not mention this before but the number one reason i am successful at getting patients to stay on this diet for years is because of the consequences to them when they go off of it that is the reason i can get schisopranic patients than by polar patients to do this diet whereas other people cannot get and every day human being to do it for weight loss because the weight lost patient does not experience devastating tormenting symptoms when they break the diet oftentimes they are rewarded they they eat something they really enjoy and they get a little bit of a opening rush from it and they en there off to the races are ism get oh have already cheated it'll cheat again it'll get back on it some day and they never get around to it my patients when they go off the diet they start hallucinating with i forty eight or twenty four forty eight hours and they quickly realize that was a really stupid thing to do that piece of cake was not at all worth the torment that i am experiencing now they get back on the diet i suspect with all timers disease we might notice something similar these people some of these people have very mild symptom maybe they will not have that kind of a reinforcement negative reinforcing kind of experience but i think some of them will some of them recognize that they are impaired cognitively and if this diet could help them remember better if this diet could help them function better and again this of the pilot trial showed as activities of daily living that means these people are able to go to the bathroom on their own able to get themselves dress whereas they needed help with those things before those are actually really important things to both the patient and the care giver and and if they go off the diet and then quickly revert into a more symptomatic state that might be reinforcing enough for them to figure out away to do the diet on their own and if we think about if this really is an effective intervention and yes we need longer trials larger trials all that cause there are there are plenty of stories in the medical field where pilot trials looked really spectacular and promising and then larger trials just failed to show the benefits i believe based on all the science of metabolism atacondria glucose hypomatabolism all of that i believe the science makes this an obvious treatment that has real potential me ow people will call me bias the fine i got my bias do not based on clinical observation and extensive clinical observation at that i think biases that are simply because a we want to feel ascertain er believe something a are worth the are worth creteeking but a bias based on observation here i should mention that most of what we know about human memory was sparked by one nation the famous h m who think was in living in hazard medical a in one of the hospitals around there many hospitals on logwood campus but am one patient in the reason we associate the hippocampus with memory is because we knew that h ms hippocampus was damaged intentionally damage for epilepsy treatment i this idea that everything has to be randomized clinical trial to me is crazy ism an of course that is a gold standard and its essential but there is much information in text books medical text books in particular that are gleaned from single patient pa studies or from three patient a our stimulation in the brain or something of that sort to me i ism still perplexed as to a why the why there is this a insistence on only one form of evidence a of clearly what you are doing the important work that you are doing clinically and in the research side and and in public communication is is assisting this i have a question about were more of a statement slash question about the key tonic diet they town everything that if we have talked about seems to me that the key to gene diet for weight loss is a very interesting aspect of the diet as is intermitting fasting for weight loss even though it might just be by way of cleric restriction that occurs with fasting but that in some ways the the effects of the key tog and a diet on weight loss are a bit of a decoy for most people that is where their mind goes this person lost amount of weight maybe that made them feel better maybe that i should made them under weight i think you have talked about it for some people that can a hug bring them under weight but ism glad that we got the chance to dive into the description of key to genidiet for epilepsy because it really is a medical intervention that has a side effect of weight lot or could be used to treat city and induce suit loss but it is really about far more than that and that raises a question for me which is we been talking about the we tonic diet as one thing but have heard you a disgustthis before where just as a physician will prescribe different dose dosage ranges of a given drug you can prescribe different dosage ranges of a nutritional plan a diet is not one thing it is not necessarily zero carbon hydrates or a hundred grams or fifty grams it depends on the patient and a lot of other factors have heard you list off vary sins classic kept may be could just briefly tell us what that typically is use i think most people think et you means eating a lot of meat and not carbohydrates but might not be that fasting and then some of the other a you mention cabins earlier we do not have to go into each of these in detail and i knowing your book you talk about not just the science and clinical background but also some actionable steps that people could consider they can refer there of for more detail but for somebody who lets ay is depressed thither have had some rounds of depression may be their own intend presence may be not and they want to try something this obviously this has to be done in concert with a a physician observing all this but what is the can typical thing that you probe with first just with a drug you might probe with twenty telegrams of a drug what is your typical pro initial dietary intervention probe terrible languaging i realize in ism am am am criticizing myself for that but i think people get the idea the the real answer is that i i do not have a one size fit is all recommendation for any persons the first thing that ism you assess with the patient is what symptoms are they having what is their current diet and what are they willing to do i try to meat them where they are at ism i if somebody an i want a point now you mention the all meat version of this diet which is often referred to as the carnivore diet any controversial there is no out that exists and for some people some people swear by it they were they have tried other versions of editor genicdiets and only when they went to a kin of or diet did they get benefits but there are vegetarian ensign versions of the we tonic diet in my mind this is not at all about the diet wars of animal source forces plants source foods it is about in during a state of ketosis which is mimicking the fasting state that is what it is about and you can do that by not eating anything by fasting and or intermittent fasting and you get your result no diet is keyed is a key tonic diet it is not about the foods or the types of foods that your eating it is about inducing a state of mitosis the first variable ism go to look to when i recommend this and are prescribed this is the persons current weight if if somebody is of or verses somebody whose thin and get of use different dietary strategies for those two situations and theorist patient they have tons of fat stores on their body already usually it is a goal of theirs to tap into some of those and they would to lose see weight if they are get a try key to panic diet for brain health anyway and ism got to use that that person really the diet is carbohydrate restriction and tot usually is a sufficient intervention both simple carbohydrates meaning sugars and fructose also fructose definitely no added sugars essentially you can have added natural sweeteners step are monk for you might use artificial sweeteners it'd probably years after of doing this it'd probably recommend steer away from them if you can because they think they tend to stimulate cravings for his care foods i if you can kind o get through a couple of weeks without at sweet things your cravings for those will go down and it will make the diet easier and a little more sustainable but let us say you can have your artificial sweetness if thus what you really want some get to say less than twenty grams of cars a day for those people they can have all the proline they want they can have vegetables and they can have all the fat they want but ism not get to push fat on those people and i get to tell them eat a lot of fat at the same time because i want to use the fat on their body as the fat source at least early on are you encouraging healthy fats monad saury fats all of oilers m encouraging people to eat we less butter a et camera i i i tend to i tend to encourage i gain a wide range of fats and it is get to depend on the person a lot of times people come to me with very specific ideas but ism get attend to encourage aloft oil avocados not which are usually considered even by the america hart association healthy sources of fat the more controversial thing are things like cocoanut oil or cocoanut cream which the america heart association might say is not a healthy fat i kind of disagree with that and do not think it is unhealthy at all actually and when you look at the epidemiological studies of saturated fat causing heart disease are using adverse outcomes at best it maybe increases your risk ten to fifteen per cent at best o much coconut oil can people in jest anyway before they either developed dare no job tat or ours or get tired of cocoanut oil at anyway a your point is taken a but they can eat meat if they meat rage eggs or if they do not to meat news they could eat sardines or things that sort i man personally cans i came it with the i only the word sorry have nothing get's the actual fish but am that is just me but obvious my be we have i i say this because people have different preferences right yes only a stake but ism not gan eat aseity and ism got to go with that and again there are vegan sources of protein the people can eat and pay and other things ism that is the obese person is car restriction is the primary initial faze the thin person is good a need to eat a to of fat because they do not have a lot of fat stores on their body and if i want them in key toss clinical mitosis ism get to have to feed them fat that is the person than ism go to say make sure you get in avocados olive oil butter maybe the clean heavy cream have cream is delicious that is a delicious way to get your fats and and a have one patient who just drinks it straight to just try to get it in other i get it i ice never had a appetite for sweets i a i absolutely love savory fatyiand i when i was an ice school i was i was since i was able to do this but i i used to drink half an half ism some hones a wake up in mill a night and drink it just cause it date good it does nice good if they are on a meet genic at ism got to push om away from half and half in toward heavy whipping cream and a and you can whip that up you can freeze it it turns in to ice cream you can add vanilla you can add coco powder you can add all sorts of things and you are off to the races with shakes and ice cream and moose and all sets of things that you can have ism with any of these patients the beauty of this diet is i have objective bile markers ism get to have them measuring ketones and ism going to adjust the i at base on the state of mitosis and or the clinical benefits that ism looking for if it is an average person who is not currently under psychiatric care not taking prescription medicines but is saying ism burned out ism exhausted i want some of that brain energy the drew dobermans talking i i heat he talks about feeling i want some of that ism probably actually got to recommend the photo call you describe which is let us see if we can just carborstrict for a while i and see if that produces clinical benefit have one he is not even a patient just o somebody who read my block i did not tell him anything and he came away from it saying he was ready to start an anti depress a an anti decrescent for his anxiety at chronic anxiety trying meditation was trying all sorts of things nothing nothing those things were not enough he was ready to go on prescription medicine he read an early copy of the book he took it upon himself without consulting with me to restrict carbohydrates alone he did not go kit genic he is a vegetarian he restricted cars within three weeks said i do not need prescription medicine i cannot believe how much better i feel and all i did was cut out some of the high cared foods and might diet i think for some people it can be that simple for people with serious mental disorders if they are chronically depressed if thereon lots of prescription mess if there disabled by their symptoms and certainly if you are by polar or havskis afriendia or something those of the people i really do want them to work with a medical professional because mess mad need to be adjusted they really need o they need a real shot at this diet it is it is not weight loss went lost everybody wings it and either your successful or you are not you look on the intranet or you read a book or you do even the colleague that you mention he is prowlages reading who knows whether it is credible information or not om and just winging it and seeing whether it works or not for people with serious mental disorders i want you to treat it ye have epilepsy i cause you do have a serious brain disorder it impairing your ability to function in the world it is impairing your health and happiness you deserve a competent medical treatment and we have that we have a hundred year evidence base we have got dietitians who know this the back of their hand they can monster your level of mitosis they can help they can help look for vitamin and nutrient deficiencies that can be a consequence of the diet and make sure that you are not developing those they can help tweak the diet if needed they can give you ideas if you are getting word with eggs every morning they can give you ideas for what else you might have and if your using it to treat a serious disorder i think you need serious help couple of them questions the more detailed but m i think a lot of people have a some their mind is it ever the case that a you will prescribe somebody the keeper genic diet in conjunction with interment and fasting e keetobod eat between the hours of whatever eleven a m and eight p m or something that that is the first question absolutely a and have one patient with type diabetes and chronic depression and he will try to follow the ktojenic diet and sometimes his blood sluggers are still very high and sometimes i will ask him to do either intermit and fasting or even a three or four day water fast and it is shocking when he does a three or four day water fast now the first day or two feels crap i just say up front do not do it if you got an important meeting or business trip or any do not because is just consuming water this is just consuming water no black coffee i usually tell him he can have plain black coffee or tea but a you have mercy i have a tiny outs of berth mercy but i but when he does it his blood sugars plume in a good way his blood sugars are normalizing but the last time he did it he actually got to seven days at one point and he said i feel great i want to keep going i cannot believe that ism not hungry but i am not hungry at all i do not missfood at all and its seven days i kind of cut the for ice now now where not wad you got eat why find it really interesting that the intermanfascion corse controversial at some level but a as to weather or not it is just beneficial by way of clock restriction because it is one way to the chief clerk restriction whether not has additional benefits but ism very interested in that neural side of it and it does seem that the fasted state can start to take on its own rewarding properties where people get do a mean release not for meeting as most everyone does but from abstaining from food now this can be pathologic in in the sort of example of interecianaurosa which is we both know as the most deadly psychiatric illness but for non anterecic i a thing it is interesting to note that eventually not eating can have its own rewarding properties to it that are not just relay to weight loss but in the short from feeling another words feeling really good by way of abstaining from eating yes ne well an that is actually it it raises an important rest that i have not mentioned yet but it least in psychiatric patients but even in some patients who just use the see to diet for weight loss i have seen definite hypomania lowlands these are people that are not sleeping very much the are they also getting kind of the delusional thinking they are going to run for president now that the distinction between hypomania and mania mania you might become psychotic and delusional mania by definition is problematic it is causing a problem in someway or another and if your if you have psychotic symptoms is settling called mania full blow mania hypomania for better or worse it is something every human being probably craves it is it is feeling extraordinarily good it is getting by on let sleep but you do not need to sleep who need sleep have got things to do i am my brain is running on all cylinders i feel creative there been lots of famous people through the ages who have been by pol or been probably by polar and some of their most productive periods of time whether it is art or creating scientific models or have you were probably during hypomania episodes s what you do in that case i man i ism obsessed with getting sufficient quality sleep et a a repeating theme an a podcast don't know many of my social media post and i always recommend behavioral tools first then a exercise viewing sunlight et camera they appropriate times avoiding late night artificial light exposure et camera and occasionally a for people who are doing all that and still struggle it sleep supplementation one of the things that have seen some dato on that for people who are following a low cargo hydrate diet that in inositol and particular can be helpful for getting into sleep proudly because it is a bit of an as a bit of an anti anxiety effect but presently there are other things out there to the magnesium will generally do that a hot bath will do that too for that matter but when you telling about his people who are going wat a day and a half without sleep or they just you do not two hours of sleep a night i have the worst case i saw was actually a mental health professional who did not recognize that initially he went six months with two to four hours of sleep every night because they were on a keitojenic a you as on a kept genic diet was getting by on two to four hours of sleep every night did not initially recognize that this was a problem he was feeling grant he was feeling that quite high and he was actually waking up and at four a am going for ten to twenty mile runs most days he finally stopped the key to genic diet after about six months because he said i cannot maintain my wait i in a sori demands to drop what you i was busting there some social media personalities to a associated with nutrition that might be hypomania it'll let you do the clinical a evaluation what is somebody do in that case i i do not know that i have ever been hypomania manic but as i mention early unless have done a very high intensity work out early in the day and i need to replenish cargo hydrates i typically eat meet fruit and vegetables throughout the day minimaamounts of fruit but sum and then at night i switch over to mainly carbohydrate it really helps me sleep it replenish his likagein stores i sleep really well wake up the next morning repeat and of course is goes against the lot of the dogma that oh your not speck carbides late in the day and this what works for me and and i do it for somebody this a mental health professional who was hypomania would going off the key to jenicdiet entirely be the best idea or could it be that adjusting when they eat their carbohydrates would be advantageous in order to make sure that they the alerting greater in the day may be not hypomania but then ah we are cold have for to eight hours night sleep i suppose you are do to four hours night which is really very little it is yet can't cannot be healthy it is not healthy you men you can do it if you will great i imagine that the brain is suffering it is and in the body is suffering and you are friends of families the body is repairing itself with sleep and it let's am that if it is somebody whose is not not a nation they are not a mental health nation they are not using the mutagenic diet is mental health treatment they're simply doing it for whatever ism i actually start with everything you have just outline let us start with behavioral measures first and the first intervention is education you need at least six hours of sleep a night period end of story that is non negotiable if you are not getting at least six hours of sleep a night we need to consider this a problem figure out away to get six hours of sleep for some people that is enough just the education they they do not get out of bed at three a m it might take him an hour to fall back to sleep they fall back to sleep for most people if you can get three nights of decent sleep in a row the hypomania goes away it it it it dot is the way to extinguish it and and then they still go on feeling a high from it they feel great they they their brain feels good ism in terms of memory concentration motivation all other things but they are not hypomania any more ism and then i might use supplements melatonin others others that you mention magnesium ins a big one and for for some i will recommend exactly what you are doing eat some carbohydrates in the evening before you are going to bed ism either have them at dinner and then wait a few hours before your go to go to bed or have em right before you go to go to bed just to try to calm your body down and i get it going for when ism using this is a clinical intervention especially with patients with serious mental illness ism i actually want them in a state of mitosis long terms ism not to do the carbohydrate inter mention and could try all the other ones but if they still cannot sleep even with supplements over the counter supplements then ism probably go to go with prescription sleeping medicines as at temporary stop gap to try to get them three to seven days of decent sleep that usually break the hypomania cycle and then they stay on the myogenic diet because it ends up resulting in all of these other improvements that have describe they if they can there illness consometimes going to full remission u is it logos trazidone as a first first lone prescription i would not use trauzid and i it actually specifically avoid traszidoniust because its an anta to present and there already hypomania and i certainly do not want o push that further as long as its somebody without a history of a diction ism good to use o encodes peen i or either commonly called the zee medicines for sleep zulpidam or ambient or something that at happen to the opioid pathway gab gab gala habit i ism probably i usually start with something at of an or clonopan or something that i probably out van cause it shorter acting and again ism only looking to use at short term i let them know that up from we are looking for three to seven days of decent sleep and then we're get ta try to get them off that medicine and usually people are off to the races and can sustain it while a question about forms u many of a the human labparcatliceners will ask anytime we are talking about something exercise or drug treatment or or behavioral trundle say what about the menstrual cycle how is that impacted by this and how does this impact how does the menstrual cycle impact its efficacy et camera carbohydrates a an colonic restriction have been implicated in different interact are known to interact with the indicant system what do you do if you have a patient who it is depressed or could have psychotic symptoms but let us go it depression was that is probably bit more a familiar to most people and then there on a carbohydrate or full qeitogenic diet but their menstrual cycle cease how do you deal with those adjustments and i guess we could expand this conversation is say what about man futility also because sub colonic diets seem to jimmy understanding is that u submaintenance colonic diets the wait lost diets we will improve testosterone estergenratios in male the er obese but for some one that is not obtest to go on a subcoloric diet that it can start to impair testosterone levels and and probably not make render them infertile but i certainly adjust that whole access what about interactions between lei mitosis diets et camera and the indicant system the real answers i do not think anybody knows and there is not o one size fits all answer cause have seen have seen examples and i unaware of science to back up polar opposite conclusions the first general observation that it'll make i know many couples husbands and wives boy friends and girl friends a ruder sexual couples who have tried the myogenic diet to lose weight together and in all the baby nan almost universally the men have a much easier time with it than the women it is it is not across the board but i know many examples where the women say i could not tolerate that diet it it did not make me feel better it actually made me feel worse and i think in those cases it probably does relate to hormones ism aware of animal models of amice in particular keytogenic diet in mouse models one research or shared with me the thing that was striking is that the female mice never got pregnant on the keytogenic diet whereas the mice on the standard diet were just have a babies right and left and it was just shocking the difference on the surface it makes sense the erogenic i is mimicking the fasting state women who are trying to re produce should not be fasting if your body is in a fasting state it probably does not want to expend resources metabolic resources calories nutrients and other things to creating a baby because your very life is being threatened by quorum quote fasting or starvation that even though the keytogenic diet is a sustainable non starvation diet were really using that diet to trick the body in to thinking that it is in a fasting or starvation state and just from a kind of evolutionary stance it makes sense that woman's bodies may actually have significant changes in hormonal status to prevent pregnancy because a woman should not be having a baby when she is starving to death i know of examples of women who are the opposite though who have benefited dramatically and tremendously from the keytogeni diet have put scan friend a bi pull or disorder intoful remission and i do actually know of one case at least one case a woman infertile she and her husband had been trying for three years no pregnancy she went kept within four months she was pregnant how do i make sense of that i do not know and unfortunate i do not think we really have good control data on what does the erogenic diet do to male hormonal systems what does the keytogenicdiet you a female oriental systems bi clearly i think changes are happening and i it i do not i do not have a way protect tat at least if somebody else has great insights i welcome them but i have not seen them published it is a terrific answer because when things are all over the place and by direction all depending on one circumstance or the other think it it screams for controlled studies and and more descriptions of case studies and an anecdotal data to i think it is at it is an excellent answer it also a calls to mind the important a public service announcement that because of these by directional effects that you describe please do not use fasting or the sector gene die as a reliable form of contract yes please dot i have a final question which relate to something that is very much u starting to get buzz now and maybe more for people that hang out in the twitter space or the nutrition space but there is a new class of drugs that i think initially were developed to treat diabetes but are now being evaluated for their efficacy to treat o bit and these are the semiglutide drugs that are involved in u they taping to these glucagon related a peel p one pathways and as as a a story that we have talked about little bit on the podcast before but many people i imagine probably have not heard that conversation i would simply to know what you think about these drugs u they obviously a just the way that glucose island are managing energy both in the body in the brain and can produce weight loss the that to me when i look at the data ye it is impressive but a good a good logical shift in diet an exercise could achieve similar weight losspita lot peoples will not do that the question i have is what a your thoughts on semiglutide and other go p i think i migrate said we el t before use me keep pe one u related compounds and do you ever prescribe these in conjunction with these dietary shifts because m it seems to me they would fall right in with the u catalogue of other reproaches that you have available the real answers i am not at all an expert on these medications but what your thoughts about them i mean that they seem to be weight loss drugs not unlike the fence drugs of the nineties that than and because a few people did not handle them well they are and in a we had phanphan and even before that in the nineteen fifties and sixties and seventies deadpan empedome am phantasy mothers little helper was yes was the treatment of choice for women across the united states to keep their slim figures a and we created attic and a all sorts of problems but they were widely used in probably millions of women because they work because they kill appetite they kill appetite am that my over all thoughts are this there is zerodout in my mind that the obesity epidemic is a threat to human health and potentially the human species if it keeps going at the rate its going it is a threat to our species we have to figure out what on earth is happening and what can we do about it these medications in early studies are highly effective over a a year or two dad's promising i am worried though that we are not attacking the rule cause of obesity and if we are not if if the rule cause of obesity ends a being some kind of poisoning of the metabolic machinery in the brain or body and i would argue that probably relates to midacondreal health and mdacondrial function i have every reason to believe that taking a medication that helps you lose a may not be a dressing that problem and therefore may not be addressing all of the negative health consequences of what we call obesity i actually it will obesity in and of itself we know the excess fat can become inflammatory and can cause problems in it of itself but i actually see obesity is a symptom i see obesity as a symptom of metabolic derangement in the body or brain and that is why people become ones and a if we are really going to get anywhere we need to identify what is using that metabolic derangement using a symptomatic treatment a feel ye one it medication to the best of my knowledge is not addressing that door problem and we are just ignoring it may be all be wrong and may be these will be the wonder drug that save the human species and everybody will be thin and healthy forever and ever ism not hopeful was wee never we have had many promising drugs come along thence extra and other things we have had ma my promising drugs i and at the end of the day when you try to muck with human metabolism using a single process molecule man made i cannot think of even one example where it is where it is been great for large numbers of people i mean certainly manor fracturing insolent is life saving for people with type one diabetes that would be an example but giving mass of doses of insolent to people with type two diabetes actually as a downward spiral i would much rather see people with type diabetes control their diabetes through get and life style and that might be acetogonac diet or lo carbide or exercise or good sleep or all of the other thing all of it it'd much rather see that because when people try to control their typo diabetes with a molecule even though it is a natural molecule insolent we know that that results an really poor health consequences results an higher rates of carry vascular dies higherates of mental disorders higherates of premature mortality do i think girl pe one molecules are get to be different no i do not have any reason to think they are going to be that would be by two cense but will see i will tell i will tell meanwhile i want to thank you for doing what is without question pioneering work i may not ism again ism not a cognition but have been around this space long enough to know that indeed there there are no wonder drugs i there are drugs that certainly can help alleviate symptoms and om some individuals but that life style and and the case of your work in particular in the discussion today diet and the quydoganicdie in particular i it is clear can have incredible effects miraculous effects in some individuals and plosive effects in others that might not be of the same magnitude but none the less or are extremely important i be awful myself and listeners and and certainly just behalf of everybody out there because at everyone does need to be concerned about mental health issues whether not they have them and in their family themselves or otherwise because the impact everybody creepy wont to thank you for doing the work that your doing because it really is pioneering and it is brave and i can see now base on our discussion why it would work you have given us a lot of hints in to t e underling mechanisms that suggest as to why it would work and you have given us given us examples as to how it has work in patience that you have work with and this field is expanding fast i think this is an area of psychiatry and medicine in general meaning behavior of nutritional interventions that is expanding very fast thank you for being brave and for taking this on and doing it in such a structured way and for communicating it here to day and with the general public through your book in your online presence we will certainly point people in the direction of those valuable resources thank much located thank you drew for being brave and having me and in a pleasure and for a great

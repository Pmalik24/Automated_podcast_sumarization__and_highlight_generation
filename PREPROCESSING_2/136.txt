jobidon's disastrousaftanistand policy left millions under the rule of the halibut and got thirteen america soldiers killed but the mediate care no gets hammered for telling the truth about gender and more charges are on their way for dona trump i venture this is the benchbarro so tho a shosponserbak's press we pen thousands of my listers have already secured the number gotta join them express plans come freshman yesterdayand ashcan demo californium the families thirteen service members who are murdered in a terrorist attack at coble air port in two thousident twenty one held a press conference along with the senior member of the house for affairs committed congressmen deal is from orange county hell they they appeared at eskandito city hall an they called on the bidnadministration to give them to answers and informed the public as to how their loved ones actually died in this terrorist blast this is still the single most egregious act i have ever seen up president undertake the cowardly pusillanimous and disgusting pull out from afghanistan i that any plan whatsoever the complete collapse ofafganistan to the talisman the millions people left behind the hundreds to thousands america were left behind in enemy hands the green card holders were not able to get out the translators were left to be murdered the people falling from wheal wells america soldiers being blown up at the air port because proper security was not actually guaranteed it was faceless it was ridiculous in jobidon has never paid the political price for it jobidon's approvalrating dumped into the forties that pointed as never quite recover but he has never played a red political price for it simply because in two thousand and twenty too the election became all about various senate candidates whore hand chosen by his political opponents but the real story of jobidon's presidency is not about the economy it is not even bout hunterbido the real story of jobidon's presidency is incalpslated in the arrogant the egotism the disgusting self involvement of the president of the united states in presiding over the greatest for policy disaster of my lifetime and then just blithely talking it away it really is disgusting and the way that this person who was perceived as warm and generated fuzzy and cub leave the guy who nuzzles small children for no reason that any one can comprehend the fact that this person was cold and calculating not just about the the running away from a twenty year commitments and the sacrifice of a country to the talisman not just that he was cold and calculating about that but that he really did not care what happens the people who got left behind including america soldiers could not be more evident and that was certainly evident from the testimony of the gold star family members and wonder soldiers who actually were at this press conference yesterday and the media did not pay this any where sort of attention they would of if the president of the united sate edonald j trump because again it under scores what nonperson joined jobidon is not a good person jobidon is the kind of person who ignores o four year old grand child four four years if he thinks it is politically beneficial for hm to do jobidon is the kind of person who is entire career has lied about others is the kind of person who slander e a man who is involved in a car crash with his wife in which his wife and one of his children were killed and he slandered that person as a drunk driver for thirty years that is the ten er person the jobidon is jobidon is a person who cares first and foremost about himself and that is perfectly obvious in the way that he treated these gold star family members remember in two thousand fifteens o thousand sixteen when dona trump was running for president of the united states the first time he got into a widely publicized spat with kaiser con whose gold star family member who was actually a speaker at the democratic national convention talking about how much he disliked donate trumpet all the rest and how dona trump was a resist and his xenophobe an all and all of this and dona trump went at him and is became a major issue of contention in the two thousand sixteen election campaign jobidon is currently but he is not candidate he is currently the present of the united states hots the president of the united states when thirteen america service members were murdered in cobble and the treatment of these gold star family members was it egregious and disgusting and the media do not care they do not care these gold star family members are of no consequence to them no one knows their names now one gives them coverage these are not people who up nose on the nightly news an i can see interviews with wounded soldiers those wounded soldiers don't get interviews with them if there is a a a peculiar belief that dona trumpets on something really really but your member during the trump presidency supposedly he did not pay proper image at normally they did not go out on to the beech or something cause it was raining and this widely reported by jeffrey golberig at the elanticat any real support and it turns out the story really had nothing to it where is jeffrey golfer in the aplanatic on this is let us get into some the things the gold star family members actively said at this californium press conference yesterday pang tribute to the victims of the afghanistan terror attack to coin life e thirteen america service members a coup what was only couple o years ago here is the mother of falling marine colonel hunter lope who read the names of the dead you service members in afghanistan yesterday i a tit er clean a honored those injured and those that made at home for mage die the they be need by speaking tear stasargean utter r sargeannan old we sergeant loony bigardo stasargean ruin now jobidon he will not mention these people's names he mention them a couple of years go a now it he never heard of them again and if dona trumpet president and this were the sort of press conference that were being held by the families of dead soldiers it would be frump page news all over the country i remember because in the two thousand four election campanimald enough to remember that one i remember the attempts to paint gorge dew bush as responsible for the death of america soldiers an becimlic a real major political issue for gorge holy bush again the rule is when a re publican is president a n troops are either put in danger or not even in danger proper homages in paid to the graves of soldiers this a major political story when a democrat is present we just pretended does not exist because the mainstrou senior dedicated t the proposition the democrats do not have to care about people this democrats after all are peace loving people been sure they pressed over many of america biggest wars but they are the most peace loving people there are the people who we should give all sorts of faith and credence to even as they participate and again what is the blackest spot on america foreign police record certainly of my lifetime e get to more of what the gold star family members and wounded soldiers had to say about yobidin and his personal interactions with them and this is not a good man folks l get it that in a second first company is looking out for you

move my head my arson i i do not haven't arm he says oh i mi con understands out and then goes over to reach for my fingers is about and into my fingers are showing unlike grab my fingers does not say does not greet me anything just that is what happen to grab my fingers and a was i got cat that is weird and me know almost immediately starts talking about how their son serve in the military does not say anything about what happened stars talking about how the sun send in the military and a mama mister slide sh is furious at this point and he leans over me and he is this close to my face an he is what d you want i do you want i said what you want i said what he said what what d you want s i confusion is cabana is felt on my friends dine next to mean i i just want to be myself and he is i hun mama's furiousisi he said he just wants to be himself he is wants to be him says wants to me me and yes oh over and they just continued to talk about everything but what just happened jobidon most self centered man in the universe again that this is his go to is in tragic circumstance he goes right to his son bobidon's death which at the beginning you understand but when he is blows that well hundreds of time to this point and he is done in the most inappropriate possible circumstances at that point becomes a political parlor trick at that point he is pulling at that card out of a garlic a rabbit and it is gross and it is disgusting wo bourdon died of brain cancer bourdon did not die because he died as member of the military that jobidon has tried to suggest that his son bosdath which is tragic and terrible his somehow the equivalent of people being blown up in combat and in fact this was his go to card during the afganistantabocel is that because his sonsdied of cancer apparently he did not have to pursue policies thought not an america soldiers blown up in afghanistan if that gold stardom shirt race talked about how jobidon had in voted a beau and suggested that to had died in circumstances similar to ism her own son whet he approached me his words to me where my why my wife will and i know how you feel we lost tar tine as well an brought him how in a five japed coffin my heart started beating foster my started shaking knowing that there is tan died from cancer and they were able to be by his side also wondering how coming ad honestly vary be harmless to say he knew how i felt a little over twenty four dollars and lightning a my sunset just vile just vile by the way the rule and he just just for those who ever have to visit a house of morning the rule is shot up that is legitimate la run you visit a house of morning is to shut your face because you do not know how that person feels even if you have gone through something similar and by the way this is not similar but jobidon an't care about these folks in it that this this whole caring gramps routine is a lie he is a corrupt politician he has been for forty years he is never held the real job outside of the federal government and he is going around telling people who just lost family members wo were blown up that he knows how they feel because he had a son who died of cancer in circumstances entirely unrelated to his military service gold star father demon whole re called for the immediate resignation of jobidon and tony blank and all the people who presided over afcannistan n ut without good cause in closing ism calling out secretary blink secretary button general silly general mckenzy lieutenant colonel whited who can not give the order to the snipers the take out the calmer before he gent is vest an ultimately the president do it orstontit bet don't ask man admit your mistakes learn from them that this does not happen ever ever again you all need to resign immediately i point out at this point literally known loss their job no one lost their job over thatganniston taboccloe which is insane it is crazy no one lost their job i repeat again and just the second organ go through just for quick review the time lane of all the lies that jobidon told the the consistent gaslatting of the america people the attempts to paint the pull out from afghanistan as to set as a success well america were left behind afghans were falling from wheel wells and america were being blown up in cobble it is still that the fact that this president is treed with any modicum of respect after what happen afghanistan is absolute be on me understand in in politics we have a memory about five seconds long i get it but i just to point out that the entirety of america political discourse is currently centered about canary six that two thousand twenty one how much of america discourse is around august of to thousand twenty one which was later and i was actually significantly more tactful to america foreign policy is significantly more under minding of america moral the pull out from afghanistan the put from afghanistan again the singlemost disastrous foreign policy decision and and plan of my lifetime has been completely white washed by the america media and the people who suffer during that blown continue to suffer to day because of it have been completely silenced by the mediate or ignored wallet to more on that unjust one second first let us talk about getting better employes we have some pretty great employes here at daily wire but let us say that you have an

stubborn ass and not only is he an ask and a fool but he is a bad person he is a bad person you knew all this he would make any plans and then again when things went wrong he did not care by august eighteenth is but to this about eight days before the bombing that killed thirteen america service members you say knock on would nobody's tide it is all going grate it is all going great sure it is

prove it this is the great moral ex emplarver age this the person brought honor back to the wite house this one this one the fact that the media have again basically shoved this entire incident back

holding the trips before a was temericans or n you strain this he ha tens of that first of all i think it t irresponsible to the america are stranded they are not we are committed to bringing america to want come how home we are in touch with them the atone the attest the me the any way that we can possibly reach america to get them home if they want to return his medical stranding is the bin houses of thiol the this san o was having fans i am just calling out for staying that we are stranding america an at gangsta when i sat when we have been very clear that we are not leaving america to want to return home we are going to bring them home and i think that is important for the america public to hear and understand o a that leading now has a show on annas en be we again no one lost their job everyone failed upward here the bobbing of course took place on august twenty sixth the administration was openly saying at this point that they were relying on the turban movie security the airport which is legend ematelye the worst idea in human history here is som general keen mckenzi he of sent come saying that they relying on the talisman for security at the airport where the bobbing took place do you still trust the turban and is it possible the day let this ha do not pesto whether out they letter have it i do not know i do not thinkers anything anything to convince me that they let it happen es ta whether not trust they messed that is non as soy just ta word i use very carefully you care say before it is not what they say is what they do they have a practical reason for wanting us to get out of your by the thirty first of arrest an as that they want r claim they wonder clam the air feel the we we want to get out by that they two of the the hostile to i shall we share a common purpose we share common purpose with the t loan were told by this disgusting administration on the bodies came back on jobidon he was in a rush he had things to do i mean we runs a antilock were on you recall that as they took the bodies off the plans jobidon was looking at his watch join was looking at his watch a just a vile man on august twenty sixth according to essay today eleven marines one nasty hospital foreman and an army soldier were killed and boys and gunfire home cars international and part iris ka claimed responsibility it also kill a hundred sixty nine afghans bison said during remarks the america service demise to gave their lives they we heroes heroes who've been engaged in dangerous self like mission to save the lives of others by met with service of family members and intended his first to dignified at transfer as president it'd be the transfer of the bodies an tom he a checked his watch apparently three separate tons during the ceremony associated pressphotos taken tenants part cordon checking his watch at during the ceremony another photo from our chossprons press described a petty also shows bite glancing at his watch as well andovidio from weasand shoed bison checking his watch once near the end of the dignified a transfers ceremony again deeply important for the president to know what time it is during the dignified transfer sermons get his hand over his heart and his eyes on his watch this is a person who truly truly cares because after all he has o a clary success and just a couple of days laterthit is exactly what he was doing ho here a national television had said the whole thing had been a wonderful success for his administration this is august thirty first last night in call the united states ended twenty years ward n aft history the longest ward america history the completed one of the biggest earless in history with more than one hundred and twenty thousand people o evacuated t safety that number is word than double but most expert were possible no nation no nation has ever done anything it in all history the only the united states at the capacity the will visited to do it we did it to day the extraordinary success of this piston was due to the incredible skill bravely and selfless courage a none faced military in our diplomats and entellus is professions never forget how this man send against the america people answer afghan allies and against soldiers another families we we should not be forgetting that by the way just as a camera to all of us after the bombing jobidon then proceeded to drone randomly a an entire family in afghanistan according to the her tins almost everything senor defense officials asserted in the hours and then days an than weeks after eight and august twenty nine tronstrik trout to be false the explore explosives the military claim we loaded in the trunk of it toots ad and struck by the drown hellfire missile were water bottles assecondtary explosion the courtyard and intensely popular to coble mere neighborhood where the attack too place was a propane or stank according it to officials the purpose no threat at all they blew up a car in order to demon strait jobidon was strong tough leader and u they just killed ten civilians for no reason one of them was apparently somebody who worked with can translators that is who jobidon is that is what america should be focused on going into the twenty twenty four election and that is why these families will never see the light of day on national news that is why these goldstone family members yo will not hear their names a get n a n at certainly not outside a conservator media it is why the names the soldiers will not be household names you will here endlessly about canary six where no one was actually killed except for harshly habit one of the rioters you'll her endlessly about it you will not here a damns work from now until the election from the main stremedia about the tobakle of the fganistample out that ended with the least thirteen america service memberstead hundreds of america left behind thousands afghan allies left behind and thirty eight million people under the tender mercies of the tarlatan you will never her about it because that under scores exactly what jobidon is which is a person absolutely unfit for the presidency and that is leaving aside the fact that he is physically unfit for the presidency yesterday he continued to wand round aimlessly the a morally been sighted nearly tomenshure ridden old man as the president of the united states here he was yesterday wandering around you there is some sort of ceremony at thewhite house for the until astray and at once again here he is just wandering around aimlessly where is he oh where's pop tog everybody a clapping for him earn peso what is even happening right now because this is a this is who he is by the way when you don't talk about jobidon and his corruption leaving aside all the hunter bison corruption which is still going to haunt the rest of his campaign we should point out at this point that jobidin and the f be and lawnforcemen officials crammed censorship down on the america people in the early years of his administration including on the daily wire we now know that the f be under the auspices of jobidon was doing that sort of stuff the members the f a were cracking town on the jobidon hunter widen laptop story during the election cycle itself these are the conditions under which we labor to have a fair election in this country under a condition of censorship where the biggest stories get downplay smaller stories get up played and certain stories get buried absolutely completely there is a reason why job never feels the necessity to answer questionsand that is because nobody the mediactually wants to ask him a tough question yesterday he was a back from his vacation he spent pretty much half his presidency at this point in rehuboth beach delftware where he a sits on a beach doing nothing and a ignored questions from the press obviously but regulator e got a lean forward because if he if he stands upright for even a hot second he will be on his but in a matter of of moments u even envy my news of this point is recognizing that his brand as tarnish and it should be tarnished wot president robin's bran is a family orient to public servants has be a signature political asset tat for more than fifty years has helped him whin the argument that when judge up against the alternative rather than the almighty he stacks up pretty well but the burnish on bison's brand is being tested never before a had of a close twenty twenty four election some of the president's democratic allies are worried about potential fall out from a confluence a family drama that is milden public view and from re publican attacks that cut at the beterocho bides long time political appeal the go delight house is investigating the extent of mine's roll in helping his unbidden hunter burn millions of dollars from form business interest during his time as vice president in the matter of much more personal nature licit biding recently acknowledge for the first time that he has a seventh grand child navy on robbers o four years daughter of hunter bison and again his all leaving aside the fact that the man does not care about any thing that is not in his immediate purview he is he truly is a bad man and we should remember that because again the attempt by the mediate a paint him as some sort of genteel elderly fellow is far from the reality of whoso bison is that it it beggars the imagination of in just one secondwill gets at latest cultural hurt of the day i know is can be somebody who i never heard of in one second in

surrounding campaign finance gorge's recon law is a powerful tool for wills the statecraft is modally aft her a federal statue which was designs help take down the mafia under but the federal and gorge's recolor prosecutors show there is an organization of people who commit crimes together on our according basis members can be prosecuted for crimes at the group committed together this is supposedly the way that wills is probliygan go about it the recon statute lends itself well to the georgia investigation cause trump allies around the country try to range of tactics to keep in power according to legal experts and re freshman to fencer an atlantes says it gives prosecutors lots of choices far as venues at least a very long complicated tries that weredown defense attorneys critics of the real laws had lows the government to joined to finds of little connection to each other into a single prosecutions when motherworts rude committed a crime now we rap in john eastern a now we rap in trump and then we just rapidly up with the to wills says that she likes the redo sort of stuffs as i think goners are very very intelligent they want to know what happened they will not make an accurate decision aboutsomon's life and recon is a tool that allows of prosecutors office and on forcemeats tell the whole stories we are awaiting presumably racket hearing charges guns trump coming in georgia meanwhile doll trump is as you out imagine again i understand it he is distracted with the legalcases as he will be all the way up until the election instead of talking bat of kennistan and giving being a bad person instead what organaget is lot to talk about blacksmith and may be some sideswipes at ta saint bitch my call yesterday doll trump when after blacksmith at one of his rallies the range hackman is i derange in in to tiki the in tafasio si taco i shaman is some thenerong in i die somebody a wonder i bi a to say in would not manner would not man tisgasan make they gave me a make gay this is going to be the campaign and by the way even if he is right this is stilgangto be the campaign he he did take some time off yesterday from doing that to sideswipemach my conallfor a reason i cannot to certain considering my call has been one of his less local critics overtime a he got broad mac call did at an evens and at doll trump then said i agree boo retire retire retire boo now let us make something very clear doll trump's chief achievement as president of the united states was putting threeconsert of justice on the supreme court there's only one man he asked the thank for that is michmc coal bitch my coal is the reason that dona trump has judicial legacy at all it was much my call not doll trump who stopped merit garland the cogent to turn general the croup to turning general from being on the supreme sort in the first place as bitch my call who be finally insured the break cabana got on the court was miss my call who insured the conservatives entered the supreme court of the united states as dona true victim and that is how dona trump treats his friends this again we can run this campaign is a gong making i have some doubts i have some doubts meanwhile the media doing their best to a take out the only plausible rival to dona trump at this point on to cantus yesterday they went after to mantis because to cantus did not interview with end s the basis claim correctly the democrat's not abortion to be legal through a mine months and dosheburns tried to facchack him saying that into is representation of what happening just one point three present of abortions happening twenty one weeks are higher which still is twelve thousand abortions a year but yes democrat's openly admits that they are in favor of abortion up till point of birth this is particularly true in new york where literally the empire state building was lit up pink after a piece of legislation signed by androquomo the legalized abortion trough all mine months in the state of new york the that the simple fact is that that wants is right on that dis matte the meteor still going after him it sort of too pronged attack on the one hand there trying to undermine him with the bays by suggesting that he said the election is was all on the up and up in twenty twenty which is not what he said what he actually said is that donaltrump lost but that there plenty of factrstackt against dona trump that is true and then there trying to claim that he is lying about abortion which again is true understand the tactic here for the media the medias tactic is build up jobidon ignore his problems a tack trump a tax to mantis that is that is the made strategy already now to the things that i and things that i hate to day things that i the is actually some sad news willing freed infamous director he died yesterday at the age of eighty seven he is most famous for films the acerbest and sorcerer i think that his best move is actually one that that nobody thinks t his best move which is rules o engagement the french connection when a munch fosters including best picture obviously ism soccer was a remake of another great french rum call wages of fear but dome rules engagement is my personal favorite because it is natural guts he take on what the war on terror actually looks in was made in two thousand before the actual war on terror here is a a little of the preview for rules of engagement serving mommy my ones o samiel o jacks will e outer ploy i i rid rulesngageen the r antethery cur the i a peaceful crow that is not ti iron to is drive prevented me from measuring fur the evinces f the poms the move is tremendous it is ben kangsley ask an ambassador in an unnamed arab country and the em the embassy is being overrun and marines are sent to in to protect the evacuation and there is firing from the crowd and the marine's fire on the crowd and sexual jackpot's the person in charge and they bring him up on charge of human rights violations and massoccurring civilian supposedly and mommy why jone'sis the lawyer who has to defend him it is a really good films to really gutsy film about what actually tends to happen in the middle east and the intermingling of civilian and terrorist targets it is it is a really ballsy film honestly totally work the watch great cast everybody from guy perks to tommyly ones samiel jacks to bend kingly is terrific in it superunderrated film go checked out to day rules of engagement again that is willing freed can who passed away yesterday a time for some things that i hate shortly after the her times decided that it is no longer races to singsong called kill the beer the person who is singing that the had of a group called afar in south africa he then came on wat hi go know know i was petty serious about that he says never be afraid to kill killing his revolutionary here he was yo e ki e to the i boy i e k i e ki e plus ism presumably that sort of genital language is totally of music nurtures down playing kill the beer as it don't just an old rebellion song juries mama apparently it is totally find what he is saying when uses geisha to language cause obviously he is a man of the left and of the racial left and that is the thing really matters in the end organ meanwhile the media are out in full skills defense of pagan repine who be the us woman national sockersteam ability to move on in the world cup again ism i gan pretend i care very much about that note ism ism not beside i never cared about women soccer nor will i ever care about women soccer and it just it is not its not going to happen but pagan repent is ism a nasty person mat may pagan repent is the kind of person who kneels for the national anthem while benefiting more richly and pretty much anybody in human history from america freedoms and liberalism it is totally incredible that a person who is truly as privileged as pagan reopen who makes lots of money for playing sport no one has ever cared about or watched and pretending to be a rebel in a culture that celebrates her that she is champion by the by the establishment it really is making lot of people were you knowhow this woman's national soccrateam which his boy dotted the national anthem and that champion people making reason talking about terrible in racist america is ism glad they lost ism and i feel it i get it ism ism there man because when you rot for the team if the team does not i america if the team says america bad i do not the team it is pretty much as simple as that tit is not everybody on teams certainly main repent an the people whoa most vaporized by he media well now the me ya are very angry that people are an kind o totalling over the fact that main ripieno and her team are out n that she is one who really blew it the washington post canst buckler says it is america first unless the us woman's national teams involved this the highest from of alighting it was not america first for the team the team did

must hate america ha no the do to hates america that is why i do not towards in it's ridiculous but says canvas buckler they waited four long years for this stocking up on antiquated ammunition preparing their muskets for he most pointless fight why notice your within about it when pagan open the lion hearted heroine for one side and wok traitor for the other miss the target on her penalty kick or enemies prepared to take long rain shots from across the globe there is a thousand year culture war with no and insight and no purpose beyond stirring the pot o we declared the culture war did we and now she is the one who is kneeling for the national anthem con mincing her fellow teammates so do wining about an on existent pagan and then proclaiming the choose of victim in society the turns her in to hon most prominent people in america and has for getting metals from the president of the united states we declared the care witch's my favoritething honestly the the left is constantly playing the game that older siblings play withe younger siblings where they grab the younger sibling's arm hit their younger sibling with their on uncle stop hitting yourself stop hitting this is what they do it is it is total alighting you start the culture war and you declare the culture war and then when we notice it and we say no we do not these people a got was i hate america why are you starting a culture war all conservatives been doing for my entire lifetime is saying things the were group for all of human history with regard to the culture war literally all human history male female child foundational building point of all societies no that is a culture war position boys are norms oh it is a massive culture or position wo men and women should be treated individually in the market place no om that is a culture war it is amazing that you she things the are perfectly obvious two plus to equals forth a that is a culture war hat's a cult works there people to throw ay it is not and until five seconds gleverlone thought you plus to as for but now that is now become up an absolute hallmark of of thinking that is that is best and terrible and patriarch this coons hays if for a women we can ignore the throbbing migrant and mental fatigue caused by the victories and take this bottom feeder conversation if this value we are surmised gust women lost to sweet not because they could not score gold through under an twenty minutes but because the players around to america us ow li they lost this honer say we lost were just saying were happy they lost because they are anti america dow be why you cur i they lost and are not again i do notary about women soccer a good high school boys teem could beat the living hell out of the woman's national sockartine they did the under fifteen football club of galls beat the women sorting five to under something but says this colonies the exited the world cop in the round of sixteen because the majority of starters were tootsy protesting the military to out the lyrics of the starspangle banner before marches it was shocking most of the one players are new to the team and into the liberal verses concern of conflict that grips the nation their supposedly to proudly represent they are not part of the cord that one the programs forthworld cup in twenty nineteen while also carrying the burden of calling out it is own federation and fighting institute realized general discrimination through it all that seems lightning rod of a spokes person reopen wanted to smoke on any social and cultural matter she could find for her rainbow pride for a rightness that at times remained on the grassduring the national anthem for gut reaction about potentially accepting an invitation be honored by the former one time president ism not going to the effing white house reopen became the representative of the national team and the rights enemy of the state again she declared these positions and we said we did not them and she was the person you touted as the most important soceraplayer in human history better than final messy and more important to future rule prosperity in peace than goody this was you guys following the loss elegy valise a former man's national team player carnfox annalist and well now provocateur called the seem polorizingan unlikable to a portion of america that is true but they seem

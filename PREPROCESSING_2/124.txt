fisticuffs abound as non trump republicans fight each other in the first republican debate and we grate all the participants and from this to counter program at that debate with tucker carbon have been turn this is bentubero so tody showsponserbackspressve plan you a web his bribing seen an sold to advertisers no neither get expressly plan right out expressive plans come lash ben whenever there is a big debate the big question that people have his to one and who lost but to understand who one and who lost you first have to discuss what the metrics are for winning and losing because you can win in lobate and it can mean very little or you can lose i debate and can endure a campaign the question for each of the candidates on the station last night's first republican debate was what is the goal in order understand what the goal was for each candidate n the we can grade them in terms of how they achieve their goals we can also grade them in arms of what we personally thought of them in terms of truth honesty policy in order to gray them on that basis we first have to can assess the state of the race going into the debate and to understand where the race was going into the debate you first have t understand that the republican party is not actually a cohesive thing the conservative moment at this point is not a cohesive moment there is an anti left umbrella under the anti left umbrella there are several groups inside the republican party wive seen people divide these groups six ways if your ate con of the network times have seen them divided a couple of ways they are not divided however into two groups one the consumptions going into the republican primaries by a lot of politicoes is that there basically two groups the pro trumps and the anti trumps maybe three the pro trumps the anti trumps and the like warm trumps that is not really accurate in reality in this re publican primary i believe that there are four lanes right now they are four lanes and the question is can you occupy multiple of those lanes and be the top person and multiple of those lanes our can have to do that in order to challenge president trump who is running away with the primaries right now by forty points nationally and he is winning yes still in iwis he is winning in new samphire and every other state in order to understand where the race stood and what people were trying to accomplish on the stage last night we first have to look at where people stand in the race right now i put together this chart to serve explain the various land and where the candidates stood befoul last nights debate they are basically four lanes in this republican primary way number one are people who absolutely love president trump the trumpets and it is thirty five percent of the republican party the love him it is rider i he is their guy you twenty five per cent of the topee they be the traditional grope bates beg the pagan conservatives people who believe in the three legged stool of conservatism social conservatism physical conservatism in small government free trade and four polish hawkishness i bey the traditional geometer third group ut be the liberal wine its be then never trumpets the cries crispy one and then finally have the trumpet mason these are people at twenty percent o the party who trump ten that they they am relic is policies that lotus god president but they understand their serious concerns about his presidential run whether it is the indictment whether it is his hazard habits on truth show l whether it is is commentary weather it is it is the toxicity he has with suburban whatever it is he is or people who a lot of what trumpet did who man even him personally but they also are not totally sold the trump is the guy for went twenty four that dislike twenty per cent of the party let us go through each of these candidates and where they stood going into debates last nights to bate onto mantis is currently in second place in the national polling with the trumpets he earns a b his the way that i waited the sort of stuffs everybody's on an a two f scale trump gets an a plus in the trump category because he is trump and it is the trump category cat's an alas he is only person gets an plan any category ka but everybody else on an a to f scale and ais worth for o be is worth three as he is worth two at he is worth one in f is worth zero and then we waited tit out according to the size of these particular groups on to mantis among trumpets going in to the a bate he is a a b they the got they think he is fine he is solid but his not trump among traditional get pe types the mantis is current at a b among members of t called liberal wing this or of never trumpside the mantis is not a d and long the trumpet mason crowd he is at a b those the people who love trump but you now they could see sumpody else which means that he is at a b an three categories and a d in one other the van grum a swampy has an a with trumpets no tat is great for him in the sense that the trump people really really him i mean a lot for him being vice president or a cabinet secretary but he ai'tgon to beat trump among thetrumpers he is got an a among the trumpets is got the d among the traditional go p because he takes lot o hederadox's positions and seems to shift with the wind based on who is asking him questions whether it is nine eleven conspiracies or whether it is o crane or whether climes change get the liberal wing which hates the age they never trumping he is got an f with them and then among the trumpet mason he is got an a right now this is where momentum's been flowing true to mantis two the vague is that in the trumpet jasonawing the people who trump but they could we somebody else the take has been doing well to those people's gowan a with those people san he is got an a with the trumpets an the trumpet mason and he is failing with the traditional get p and the and the left wing of the party mike pens has an f in two categories the trumpet trumpet sent they hate him and among the traditional go p he is got a b because again the tuitional grope conga likes trump and if trumpery's tum pens he's got a b and among the never the never trumpets that she do not penis on poly but they that trump hates him n ten got a b with them nickel hale among those four groups she is got a d with the trumpets they don't er cause he is run against trump among the traditional go p she does well she is got an a going in probably among t never trampling the party she is got a b they kind the kind of her that do not love her but they they kind of her and among the trumpet mason she has a b a they they ut there use or not superfine of nickel hale they think that she is quortaquite a no conn all the rest of it ka him shot he's basically in the race for no reason ut him shot very nice my no mat gnat is on movement to know nothing among trumpets he is a s or a d among original gets a c liberal wing's a c trmpedjasens he is a c easily he we all i we all name's fine eh and then cries christy he is an f hung trumpets he is to a de among the tuitional grope who do not him because the way that he treated barokobama and all the rest he is got an f with the trumpetjacent was i hate is guts and among the never trumpet he is got an a he is got one lane and then you got true trump himself as an a plus with the trumpets he is got an a with tetrumpetjasen man's got a b with traditional grope it is only the never trumpets who hate him everybody else either love's the guy or likes the guide varying degrees in order for any candidate to defeat dona trump in order for that to happen the only way that that is going t happen his if we con solid the other three non trump wings of the party lets say the our bandit n you into be dona trump and on trump right now has the trumpets locked up r ait is thirty five percent of the party and you need to get i let tain a two person race which it is not which is art of the problem what is have wanted to consoling s you their at sixty five per cent of the party is up for grabs well you would certainly need pick up the never trampling a not twenty per cent of the party and then you need to win probably eighty per cent of the tuitional grope in you get a lot of those people to believe the dona trump is not the guy which means you need to win them over with sort of traditional goop positions restart all the rest and then you would still have to win half of the trumpejacent and have to take all of the ever trampling it's twenty per cent if take twenty o the twenty five per cent for the tuitional goop and he'd still have to win half the trumpedjacen that is a very up hill road now the only candidate who is scoring at all among all three of those groups the only candidates who are scoring at all among those three groups the trumpet mason he liberal wing and the traditional grope are hale an to mantis the others are doing well and one of the categories to mantis campaign initially seems fairly well position for this possible challenge right he see he might be getting in a with the tuitional hope among never trumpets who's a b and among the trumpetjacent he is at an a there is a possibility he might have ben able to consolidate the ant had trumforces it that really has not happen which is why he is been losing momentum because right now he seems he is the second choice for everybody among traditional geometers he is a bee rater a supposed to nickel hale who is an a among the trumpedjacent he is at to b as supposed to the vague who said an a and among the ever trumping he ranks behind right now christy and hale and pence probably an when you look at the national g p as of these candidate's going into the race way y s is dona trump way out in trump wit a three point three when you give a weighted average here and when you look at ronisantis he is it when you have awaited t aggregate rather you get three point three for for for trump when you look at to mantas he is a two point six be take just trailing him at two point for five if nickel galiot two point one five if shot at one point six five pence o one point three o five christian one point o five not does not explain the entiretinamic of the race because momentum as will cuss his really about can you win one of these lanes one the ways you generate momentum is by winning one of lanes than building on that right now a take is doing really well the trump adjason which is why he is building on that and seems to have momentum christy he seems to have momentum because he has him momentum with the never trampling of the party valley had de use is to bate to git momentum but this defines where the caniditar going into the race to sat sparsely just wants to hold study that is his goal hold study as we as we look at that sharp by the way ism ana explain in just a second what everybody's goal is going into the debate by looking at that chart first let us talk about the fact that your self it is in temper need of replacement a as you have yourself along er longspur battery life basically to grad since now you cannot coloutside for five minutes that the thing dying well all those sins this is why you should check out puretalk why well be was you can up grate to a new five g damson gallery from portal for free get a free five g damson galley today

do not hate your got go check him out right now and when you do he can upgrade that new five g samstong at gallowses from puretalk forgery that is pretor to come slash is pure oke to go back to this chart in order to under stand what everybody's goals for debate number one are if youlokgat this char what you see again to mantis is in second place but he is kind of stagnant with all the with all of these groups rest he is in second place in all of these groups in three groups he is got a bee and mong whenever trumpery's got a bee his original plan was he was going to score a bee with the trumpets and then he was going to score to a with pretty much everybody else tat was going o be the thous can be the idea that is not happen right now because to mantis was in a slide his goal for this debate and because he is in second place was just to avoid the spotlight actually his goal is to live another day he did not want last night to be a red wedding then he the time when he just completely collapsed on the stage as well see i think the he largely accomplished that for take coal is to continue to gain attention to be a lightning rod that was his goal on the stage and he is doing really well with the trump adjason he knows he is going to do nothing with never trumpets and he news not kin do inching with traditional people which again is why he is not really running for president he is running for donned drums vice president or for a cabin a position or for sent position he knows to taking it away from trump and that was not his goal last night his goal last night was basically to grade to satin with the trump adjason by gaining momentum with those people and he may have accomplish asked last night for it pence pence really knows that he does have a shot at the residence he but t he feels that he has to on because he has to preserve his legacy as a person who stood up to the predations of dona trump between nonmember in canary and as he sort of traditional old line republican politician how you do last night he basically achieve his goal nickel haply hergoall was i need a lane and i need t actually shows some momentum in a lane nick halers will see actually out performed last night and she actually achieve troll him scout he is a quicksotic figure i notum why he is in the race is not his moment ism not sure he has a moment he is incredibly soft spoken he is not aggressive he seems a very nice person but he does not have any teeth and there is no goal for him to achieve and he succeeded in not achieving a gold i suppose but i feel timscottascan be one o the first people out of the race and for chis crispy the entire goal last night was to the bake lock down one lane my lock down that never trump lane and i think crispy may achieve that goal last nah meanwhile trumpechieve his goal which was stairway gollatchye last night i thing actually everybody kind of achieved their goal but he effects in terms of momentum ire going to be the question belong t get to that in just one second the effect what actually happen vethemomentum in order to explore that question as to who has momentum coming out of thedebate we were we arguing to have t actually jump into the debate it en get to the fun part hake ism about you the summer heartening sot flora it's really really hot outside but there is something you should not be sweating this summer that is the price of meat thanks to good rangers yon half your price can be locked in for two years you might be thinking a price lock guarantee on meat yes it is amazing it is a making because again these prices are going ups why not locked that in good ranchers is the only meet company locking in your price with here industry first price lock guarantee since twenty twenty one the benhelping people combat the inflation of the mettle as well as the mystery of it as well it turns out over eighty five per can of all grasped beef is imported from oversees to not only is tore bout me to pensive offends low form quality is well but when you subscribe to god ranchers you aregettng a guarantee price an a trusted one hundred per cent america first for favorite cuts toucan save on your beef chicken in pork by locking in your price today every single stake house quality cut is individually rapped in flash frozen to make a meal time easy hat on over to good ranchrstacom use mood ben for thirty buxoffanybox that is prummockood ben at good ranchers doctor again good ransherstot combat is america meat delivered good ranchers doctor they make me a coshstick when hi got tells unbelievable there meat is that good i think for everybody else it does not keep cocker check in out right nowt good rancherstot come mess my good ben for thirtyboks off anybody oke as we jump into the actual debate ism n explained you how i analyzed this debate the way that i analyze this particular debate is going to be my own subjective belief because every debate is a groshmon i tea the old crrisolophone there's a thousand perspectives on what somebody says the take might stay something and i fighting man he is being wildly dishonest and then there i be peoples he abut yes punching somebody again every debate is a matter of perspective ism going to critic debate par ticipancs through a couple of different prisms that i think should still be important even if they seem increasingly non important in everyday political life ay ism going to great them base on is what they're thing true are they being a decent person one my my grades of decency generally is i do not attacks that are false i do not them i thin very n arak somebody should attack somebody based on what they have done it'd only you should just launch specious attacks on people as a general rule i understand that well in a very aggressive time and a lot o people take a egression on stage performed of aggression as well if he is doing it there then hall definitely do it to jobidon but does that make you a good person i feel you could actually launch well timed and well celebrated attacks on people and still take on join maybe it maybe ism just shooting in the dark but that is how i grade people but again i understand that y perspective not the only perspective which is why as we go on here ism going to explain how each lane is grating people in this actual debate ism also going to grate people based on there actual policy performance which means inherent advantage to people who actually have governed a state or done thing as supposed you just said a thing now again ism not sure this matter is in re publican primary any more it certainly has not mattered since present in trump i mean when when president trump became the nominee he literally had no governing record he not ben in politics at all gan ism using metrics that may be outdated but again i get to do it is myth my metrics are generally this what there thing true are they being a decent person is what they are saying a reflection of actual policy winds on the ground for example cumin a grade people better if they do something ant i woke i suppose you just saying something ante i woke ism also going to great people based on the actual policy conservatism of of what they are saying i do i think that there actually right or not it is that that is how i typically grade these things now does that mean that my grades ire going to somehow going to be reflective of the momentum in the race i thing absolutely not again ism if ire going to place myself on this chart of trumpet's traditional grope liberal wane trumpet mason ism ism somewhere between trump adjacent and traditional get pee probably ism certainly not never trump chis christy liberal wing of the party and ism certainly not in the i will vote for trump i walk over broken last vote for true ism the people who think trumped t a pretty good job over all i though that hid the first three years was president ho got som big policy wonsbut i was also very very in comfortable as yo all thou with a lot of his metric many of things that he said his habit of tweeting that think was counter productive his own presidency his his is activities better nonmember and canary of two thousand and twenty one all that his behavior sense all that stuff makes me in comfortable with many of the things trump did but also warm toward his performance in the first three years of as presidency get see the first three ears he last year i think was was rather disastrous on all runs thin covet was a disaster i think his handling o belie was really bad i thin that we blew out the budget like they we lot of problems even amongst those problem there ware winds s for example the abrahamicorts but again i wont m my o prospective clear on base's clear how to analyze what ism saying as common be up front notes with you on that sort of stuff lo people wont organ go through the debate in detail right you i do want o thank fox news they backed off their position yesterday that the had expressed clearly to us at they were not going to a low shows ours actually cover the date by playing more than three combined minutes of the debate i was rather livid about it yesterday fox news did get in touch with us they did let us know that was oka if we played as maneclipseis wanted from thedebate it is fairy use actually but good for them one give them credit for that yoga let us jump in to the debate a that bate opens and everybody sort of gives there little into rondo mantis who is the you going into this the front runner of the second tear rich there is only there is only one person in the top here rand that is trump was there the person who is i the second here leading this thing was to mantis the basis goal as i say was it basically emerge alive did i mantis emerge alive yet mean he did that really easily actually here as on to basis into jo began back to his baseman and reverse america to clstandin we must reverse bine atomic that middle class families have a chance o succeed again we cannot succeed as a country if you are working hard and you cannot for grocery's a car or new home while under bine can make hundreds of thousands of dollars on louse canings that is wrong en this is fine rite down the line solid stuff from rontisansis and that thou describes a performance last night fine solid like these are adjectives that come to mine then we have abate a take has womantom because in that trump adjacent lane which is not huge lane butts there he is doing really well he is out performing because he is going everywhere he saying anything he is slipping his positions in or to say anything i here was eyes a bates into and very energetic as we will see he is gin n get knocked by chis crispy for ripping from mama there is something to the idea here that awake is a very studied person i mean he is a very smart i and evade basically has taken in political in formation over the course of last fifteen years and he is now and have re turning it in awake form and you get some times is lines that they come out of a bate that obviously up from somebody else to here here is a vacant his into firs format just address a question that is on everybody's mind at hon to nine throw the had is the skite with a funny last name and what the heck's doing in the middle of this debate stage it'll tell have not a politician great you are right about that ism about to pioneer my parents came to this country with no money forty years ago i have gone on to found mufti billion dollar companies i did not while marrying my wife a poor raising our two sons following our faith in god that is the america drain and i am genuinely worried that that america dream but we will not exist for our two sons and they're generation unless we do something about it and i do think rid is going to take an outsider because for a long time we have professional politicians of the re publican party who have been running from something now wins our moment to start running to something oo gases look of the sort of stuff and i think this really platituding us but i also understand that it is very energetic i we pick was extremely energetic on the stage last night and he is made for the enter me he knows how to speak inter net on the enter net he sort of emotive big hand nothing excitement he was all energy last night which made him lightning rod as we will see get to more on this in just one second first your crave to nice barbecue mum with the family see go to the story gat all the groceries invitee family over

formed last night i shoots kind of surprise here she was last night w i do not care about polls what i care about the fact was that no one has telling the america people the truth the truth is that mind did not do this to us a republicans did this to us too when they pass that to pi to groan dole cost to moa to they at us with ninety million people on medicine forty two million people on foodstancs no one has told you had effect that it'll tell you he effect that they need to stop that standing they need to stop the borrowing it'll get points for truth here i understand that the new republican party says we should never talk about riflemen programs ever again reality thosen't time programs con bankrupt us those a real and sown nickel hale says that it may be unpopular it also happens to be right s o in my book saying things that are on popular but true tens to when you points for me nickel hale i think got yo did well last night meanwhile mike pence had a hard task last night head that simultaneously brag about his record is part of thetrumpence ad ministration and then is we will we to fend his behavior on canary secs here was last night o credibly crowd of the record of the trumpets administration wen forsworn years we revealed our military we revived or come an we on less america and or two and we point of three conservatives to the supreme court the gave the america people and we be gan gas all of that as you can see from the crowd all that is perfectly fund ha then the real debaybroke out the real debate was that a lot of people on stage were annoyed with the take the reason lot if people on save runway of the take there is a pretty god reason he is obviously not running for president n he is not he is running to replace the guy he says the best president was we will see of the twenty first century he is running without criticizing that person he is running by attacking literally everyone else on the stage an he is saying things very very confidently that he was saying the opposite of five minutes ago now does any of that really matter in terms of momentum in particular lanes no and maybethe way thou rave o take is that he's really aggressive i get it i totally understand he is really energetic he he is magnetic on the scream i mean he he passes what roger that the roger ails us roger bailsmen who would watch even determined whether somebody was good navy the way he would do it as he put on the mu but and if you watched last night there is no question that if you turned on the mu button the take was the center of attention there is just no question about it he also drew all the fire because all f the people on the stage who have actually spent their life doing politics are annoyed that a thirty eight your old guy with no political record and a long history of comments that actually contravene his own comments to day he's showing up and calling them names that they were not real fond of that last night and a take played right in to it ran me the take really went for it this is the partner again i think there is can be a gap between some of the stuff that i think about what take said an make be at the crowd thinks about what the take said clip eight this is the one were where romaswamme really decide the take really again i know a take i awake i can our vessels friend of the vie i think these attacks are pretty dishonest here is ism here is the take basically just attacking everybody on stage with with a hatchet i sort of fun a bike for once that can cause he invoke me back let us now that who has got in their memories three prepared slogans out of the way we can at to have real discussion now o not not recalling by gaily where can ask e fun tonight and the reality is you have a bunch of people professional politicians superpact puppets following slogans handed over to them by their four hundred fate superpacts last week the real choice we far in this primary is this do you want o superman puppet or do you want a patriot who speaks the truth do you wanting or do you want revolution the is at an this the partner my skinstarts ta in a rival but because i do not know what he is talking about i honesty got do not now a he is talking about when he says superpack puppet i room know what he is talkingabout is the fact that rondisant is is superpack accidentally released some sort of debate plan that is not how superpacks work superpacks do not control the candidate the questions why the candidate controls the superpack is when he says every one else on the stage is a puppet it is what what that deeplyked when i get to the decency point this is it just because people disagree with you in are on the same stages not mean the they are corrupt or evil and i do not that line of attack on a personal level i do not that lint now is an effective line of tack sure it can me an effective line o attack but t seems to me that if you ought if you call somebody corrupt if you suggest that there superpack owns them if you suggest that they are reproduced while you you are doing this all spontaneously which is not true oh eh i but should be real about this when when pen says to the take right there is that a are caplin the answers yes of course to free can line clearly to prekthin camp if you think that that beaked and prep for theta bate you are you are idiotic i mean everyone preps for to bate of course because it abate in fro a national audience in yous woke up in the morning world out of badness man of just figures this thing out on the of course not ha burin any case that that sort of attack that the take launch then prompted everybody to fire on him in response and the rest of the night was essentially just the hate taking in in coming now that is a makes idea right he wants that by o people coming out the bate were we to a lot in coming firefight that it must to hurt him ut with whom the question is with whom he launches this and then just to make sure that everybody gets the message that he wants to fight he does it again clip tan he then suggest that every single person on the stage is bought and paid for be as republicans have the only person of the stage who is in boughten paid morsel i can say this that climate chain in that for w a he at all bit a booze from the audience there but again everybody on the stage is bought and paid for except for you it is just it is tiresome it really is i really dis tit on a moral level i did not one trumped in twenty fifteen twenty sixteen idling or omasuammy's doing it in twenty twenty three it is is not my bad is not my back and there some peoplewho love this sort thing i do not it i do not think it is moral to assume that everybody who disagrees with you is doing because they have been bought and paid for i things ugly does it achieve the purpose sure by the way there are politicians who our boughten paid for jo bison is a politician who when he was the center of dellawere was bought and paid for by em planet a can name the people ho bought paid for him here is thing if your on to say somebody is bought paid for you then have to explain who bought them and paid for them it'd almost confused by this particular line of attack on climate change just for a second who bought an paid for ronde artist on climate change was it the sera club what the hell is he talking about ifvyregt a picking the rap on republicans is that there supposedly is what the left says bought and paid for bi the coax to be protracting an he being bought paper by the oil industry who buys it and pays for republicans ism climate change it is also worth noting here that five months ago a take was asked about climate change and he said i actually actually climate change is man mad the rest of the peutebut again this it this is him trolling and i understandingour next cuter beat it'd do it everyday and thou thistle is an expert in a culture this the thing you can admire what he is doing on sort of a political level at the same time thayofre looking at this long ism not trade is morals wo simply suggest without any evidence whatsoever that every one who disagrees with you is some sort of corrupt tool of the shat we establishment without to finding corruption tool or establishment but as you see the already wanted which is to be the lightning rod i chis christy who cannot help himself and if there is a pie to be thrown chis christy well for go even eating it in order to throw it christy then when after the vacant i will say that that wrist crispy does have a particular sot of skills when it comes to just rocking people on stages that you would each if he says n you wretch people on the stage and he was out of peat last night and i and his hit on romaswammy here actually is pretty well well based i to enough already to night of a guy who saudi we by sit in one of these tho batesprad who stood in the middle of the stage who said what is a skinny guy with an id last thin doing up here who's force mama and ism afraid we are deal with the save type bamasure s o gat then the take smacks christy back this this to be him up for it this in o smacking om i hit that smack i do not is recalls everybody on the stage a a corruption the the thing i do is christy says something through about romasuammy this henna dissing smoke with here is where christy says something true about romasuammy which is basically you sound is though you just took a bunch of slogans you threw them into a catchy peatier what him out with vague and then we take comes back and and by the way you are ripping people off which is true i can when the take says what is a skinny guy with we are last name doing up here that is literally quote from borockabaman to thousand for at is literally a line from borockaba he is not wrong i will say that that crispy does have a long institutional memory and he is caponized insult machine that was correct but i will say roman way's response is just as correct by which is if you are going to in votebarockabama it was you who is hugging him coming off the plane during hurricane sandy and two thousand twelve andyou are helping him out the national lection this gan to bad him up for actually these fisticuffs fine and meanwhile him scout was trying to callhim everybody down than this is why shot has no cause if you are the find the room is eyes count we all just be friends well over in the cobble is pummeling the crap out of each other that that isn't going o where here is him shot a you boggy are you cousin back absolutely nowhere is to the america people deserve is a the bate about the issue t effect their lives going back and forth being childish is not helpful to the america people to the did o on taste i gate me me that that that and that a sort of the reaction a s to last night was he can't disappeared into the wall paper hours he he was not much of a factor in the debate at all of cain just one second we will get to some actual clarifying questions on policy another for couple of them last night it was not all fisticuffs well gets that momentarily first are you tired of feeling in comfortable in your underwear and lounge

there were a couple of issues that came up there a coulisses that fox absorb did not cover they did not cover the giant gender issue they din cover that at all they would not cover critical race theory in any real serious way they they kind of touch on emigration but they made it secondary two things climate change which was very odd but they did get to abortion there is am honest to god interesting debates about abortion dug burghal and that is him the elimination you he of dug burghamall all day to day dugburgham who is the governor of north to coat i believe yes that yes nor to coat dugburgham them out for his eyebrows and being a man in dug burghal he to he made the bear statement the when it comes to abortion la the tenth a men meant prevails and a lot o people can knocked him around for that there is an interesting debate however between nick hale and might pence particularly on abortion there's inky hale pointing out quite rationally and i think with a night toward the general election the when it comes to national abortion law your shit to pass things before you sign them let us be honest with the america people and say it will take fifty can at lots it will take a majority of the house when order to do that let us find consented cannot we all agree that we should band mate charm abortions cannot we all agree that we so incorrect to doctor cannot we all agree that doctors and nurses you do not believe in abortion should not have to perform them again i i this i this a perfectly fine general election take might pence took the strongest line with regard to abortion here he was last night after i gave my life to jess crime as my lord savior open up the book and i read before i formed you in the mom i knew you and see i set before you life and de blessings a curse is not choose life and i do from that women on the cause of life had to be my cause an it'd been a champion for life in the confess o champion for life is governor and is vice prison him and out to be honest we the advice your my friend but a consentisis the opposite of leadership and that is an interesting sort of debate a consensus is is the opposite f leadership i only is particularly true i mean sometimes consensus is actually built through leadership however with that sat it is an interesting and fastening i it completely went in noticed right the the side show then continued what is it what is interesting as then we got into the section of the debate where everybody sort of tried to lock down their positions it sin now the first hour the made is not establishing you position that the position establish by the various candidates in the first hour of the debate was as we suggest in their lanes and and a and basically in orientation for pedicular goes for o mantis it was maintain your presence do not lose ground stay where you are for van it was become a lightning rod and own that trump adjacent lane that we talked about for nice hailed was on the traditional get pe lane and that was the dynamic that sort of permeated the rest of the debate for example rondassent son crime his entire campaign and this is this is why i give to mantis additional cretin give people for our rantings as i live in florin have watched him do it de basis entire campaign is you want a thing done i did not in flora maybe show to it nationally that is his entire campaign it may not be enough because we live in a period where a lot people do not seem to care what people actually do in arms of governing the i mean people could say they could u say things now be amazing hero is to rondassans is talking about crime there is one guy and this entire country that is ever done anything about that me when we had two of these e district turtles and florid elected with sorts finding who said they would not do their job i removed i from their post they are as it at we are ghetto go after all of these people because they are curating the quality of life and they are victimizing innocent people in every corner of this country in it will stop when i get into office s o get his entire sampan last night was ism bust governor in america it'll do it nationally that is fine did a mean momentum as we will discussing a second maybe not gat meanwhile we got into the most polarizing questions of the night these all surrounded trump and you can very clearly see who is aiming for which lane an there is a a question those asked as to who'd support trump even if he ended up being convicted in sort as very awkward moment because the only present the take was the kid in school who had the answer before anyone else he is in the front rubbing this is sort of a makes personality also because the supersmart i but the cake's entire personality is basely the kid in bodily you and tat you might not want o hang out youknow that he is smart i here is a take who jumps out of his seat basically runs around the room with his hand up screaming everybody else a little but slower ism the gun here here is the question you all saw to pledge to support the eventual republican domino if former present trump is convicted in a court of law would you still support him as your party's shore please raise your hand if you would and then then then viscous time when we may hand up here all day long hell if you go back to that clip is actually fascinating to see the order in which people raise their hands a something to this right and do and franklin kana shock that some of the candidate tend thought about this question being asked beforehand because we all know thing a support trump it these thenominy obviously except rash hutchinson ho known cares about but you look a that if you'll get the order o the hands go up in the take as i say is superbest off the gun quit is wet era on the trigger here the next couple of hands they go up are haply and shot and burial the mantis sort of reluctantly raise is hands on his pens and then and then crispy is can a shaking his head why is crispy shaking his had u here was crispy locking down the never triplane son's god to stop normalizing this conduct lo we ow whether or not whither or not you believe that the criminal charges are right ore wrong the conduct is believe the office of president of the united states this is the great thing about this country going is aloud but it does not change the true it is they is locking down that never triplane right again there the fore lanes there the trumpets arson grope trumpetjason never trumpets that is that is crispy locking town he never triplane here is a vague trying to lock down the trump adjacent lane by being slavishly sycophantic to president trumpright here let just speak the truth ora present trump i believe it was the best president of the twenty first cent your claim the donate trump is motive add by vengeance and grievance would be a lot more credible if you are entire campaign we are not based on vengeance and grievance against d trump without and soda of vision for this country they could just change the channel to amassed be a right now but ism not running for preside an an asap be seen i am running for president of the united states gas there there is again he is locking down that trumpetjacont lane but he he is not rung for president because here is the thing if you believe the donna trump is the greatest president in human history at first of all i will say again e vsupersmunkoc when he says at greatest president of the twenty for century that is a real shortlist guys there's only been three of them i a and two of them not great it is gorge do bush followed by barockobama followed by dona trump and the next one is been that's that on amazing lists that you have to tort the but if you are that into trump you could not run we trumpet sain he wants the field clip have noticed by the way that in reaction to the debate and everything else trumpets place is romps mommy which is donate trump if you see somebodies at threat mouthing he places them that's tromp has never praised anyone he has ever proceed as a threats this is why they are lot people in re publican party politics right now hare you are just a stalking horse that that is why you are in that does that mean the the vacant an lock down that trump it mason line up he could easily lock down that trump adjacent lane and tom you know he continued i to do this he he made a comminven on the station to day on he would pardon dona trump then we got to i think what was one of the most fascinating exchange is of the debate and that was the exchange over you crane because this goes to sort of the future of the republican party were broadly and where these various plans stand on foreign policy and this is a complete worshocktest because if you are in the sort of more isolation as swing of the re publican party her of locker carbon wing on on foreign policy you loved with take had to say if in the more traditional wing of the republican party think of thy got has ass hand ted to him s again every element here is based on which lane are you are you part of it'll get then we get to the form policy debate and here once again this is the take locking down the trump adjacent of people love trump on policy but have some problems maybe with trump personalitywise the way he does this is by being the only person on stage who basely says right away that he would would draw all military aid to you crane om and tom this turns into a pretty fiery debate which this is why you watch the debates she can actually watch spirited conversations about issue smashing enjoy this part of thedebate the bout yurts a take and i think that this is just else border when we should use those same military resources to prevent across the invasion of our own southern border serin the ninth rush china lions is the single greatest threat we face and i find it offense that we have professional politicians on the stages that will make a pilgrimage to reive to their pope is e lens without doing the same thing for people and malty for the outside of chico man although i will say that i do not think that the sort of anti catholic slap there popezalensky is is prticuatly helpful to the take he is the only one on the stage who is drawing a contrast with regard to you crane and he was forcibly smacked around by both mike pens and nickel hailed here is my sense going after a take and awake actually striking back with once again a quote from aroma this is why i say that because with taco studied and because understands what but successful politicians has done in the past sometimes e customs a cribbing off of them bathe if we do the give away you want to give to prudent to give him his land is not tot to be too long for he rolls or cross an math boarder and frankly a men and women of are a forces are i have to go on figdim i want on let to you crank as a ruin o to you it the earlier do or ass mat that by as fence i you ta lush that you as the say does not exist any war it fell back in nineteen windy u order re a f t the coin o as was tat to a talk a that is enough that right there that is where he quote moderate whet you will that that is of boy up against it rainy twenty twelve the noggin ties called then one ta form policy back ran me that that that is all that is then matey gets into it with nice half and this was nickel's best moment o debate because she made a pretty coaching cases why the united states ought to be involved in the war in u crane again this ta very split question inside the republican party show dehiscent of a fashioning part of the debate the reality is the to a the d i i ta son i that tat the same people who took us into the epoch war the same people who took us into toe we at not war you cannot end that you not stor another no wind war and i do not want to get to the point war sending on military resources abroad when we could be better using them hired home to protect out on borders protect the home land a that will mi top first a we ti t the f t in the my ta find going t to tother people because everybody ah we respect everybody's time here governor hale an you did not raise your hand meaning that you would support more funding for the u crane for you have a said of governor dosantis that a you did not appreciate it when he initially called it a territorial dispute why first of all the america president needs to have moral clarity they need to know the difference between right and wrong they need to know the difference between good and evil when you look at the situation with russia you crane here you have a pro america country that was in faded by a thug when you want to talk about what has been given to you crane less than three and a half per cent of our defense budget has been given to you crane if you look at the present at just cur g d p eleven of the european countries have given more than the guess but what is really import is go back to wen china and russia held hands shook hands before the alembics and name themselves unlimited partners a when for russia is a wind for china we have to know that you crane is the first line of the and for and that we that tot then understand is you wants the hand you crane to russia you wants the a let china eat win you wants to go an stop finding israel you do not wins at to friends what you do in said as you have the backs of your friends you crane at the front line of defense bode has said if russia once russia takes you crane poland and the basic surest that is a world war where trying you for that war look at what pun did to day he killed forgosim when i was at the you end the russia baster suddenly died this guy is the murder and you ware choosing a murder i e the are on the teen the lock heed an had the in the ta the the a to a yon and you in in the o ta a gan in i is li dad you ben pushpin is li allée wan y go and de find dis you wan get e an u ta on tat you o in i o ten o a thing you a no or o thing her tan in than wat i case of this was whale's best women of to bay by far it was a very weak moment for e age i have the reason is his come back right there right which is i wish you well on your future career on the boards of locking ration again that appeals to that trump adjacent crowd who believes that all america for policy as run by the military ans trial complex perhaps but the is a really baseless insult and again i go back to if you are going to hit somebody hit somebody for wat there was when he hits christy and he says you were hanging mama true if he is on to hit somebody else on the stage for doing a thing they did o k but insulting all of your opponents as tools of the military industrial complex that any evidence to that effect is really really absurd and and nick hay laughing handled herself really well right there it the rest of the debate was effectively more of the stage and this brings us too sort of my personal garden than will see lake what how people actually did let us start with ho got the most speaking time the promise you make candidates on the take definitely should not ben this many candidates on the stage burghal and hatching son to up fifteen minutes of time they souldnhae ben on the take him scout was on stage for eight minutes but really was absent now you are talking about li twenty three twenty torments of time that really was distributed poorly there the real people who should he ben on the stage the or are the are the top five people in from to time pence romasuamy christy cantus half by everybody else in in the stage is basically and also ran at this point now reigning elephant outside the room with of course is trump which madman that all these people off man's but in terms who got most time pence got the most time which make some sense in that he is the person who has done presidential debates before the most of any of these people evade because who is a lightning rod got the second most time followed by christy christy also wanted you some lightning foodstuff the mantis got the fourth meantime half actually only got eight minutes on forty on seconds but she made him count how dos that stack up in from is my personal grate i thought tho cantus was fine i thought he was solid i thought that he he basically laid out his record he stayed out of scraps i think that his answer on you crane was a little bit but fuddled but i think other than that to cantos did o k right it was fine i would grate him a bee it'd give nickel valerian e i think she accomplished for purposes i thin she did town of very short about of time i think she really our past expectations for nearly everybody who watch the debate even you do not like he have to see that she actually did better than you expected or to do i give saw a timscota see i who is basely not present for any of this for pence i say yo probably give him a b but for different reasons then to cantus a be because he is just in an unsinkable situation an he good up for himself i thought actually rather well on canary sixth i though that was worth while he is not can a gain any momentum from it will get to that moment and as for christy it'd say that to that was a be crispy per romance in a crispy per romance e he is always going to get the punch is in but he he does not have any of the charm that he once had in twenty eleven now he just the punching machine be about travesty can do as for the value the take is very hard grave because the take is the total roshamon candidate you look at the take on the stage and for me if ism if ism assessing how he did based on sort of what is he telling the truth i thought a lot of ti's not or based on were his where his attacks on other candidates rooted in their actual record on what they did no many times a or f your basing it on his policy i think he is wrong on some of his policy prescriptions having some of he stuff he says about form policy in particular is just not true or within the realm of reality when he says a i it'll start with drawing aid from israel exam o creese piece of middaleast between costar and moon in israel costar and moon are proton tat that that just betrays not a lot of knowledge about h mat a least and on is record right but but if you are talking bout the intreat culture if you are tongue wat the me culture if you are talking out who had energy on the take you aretngue bout the guy who as saying the things nobody else will say which is one way that we have now learned to gage politics is will he say the thing no one sewed now ism of the view and ice always said this there is a difference between being politically in correct in saying the thing that must be sad that no one else will say and just saying the thing no one else will say but that distinction is ben completely obliterator f of course the last ten years or you just say a thing that is for boon then this means that you are brave by that metric to vie kicked ass by that metric the vatted grave and this is what you see reflected o was let us look at these debate results through that light who has momentum coming out o the spake that is really all that matters right three days on found nobody on amends lobate there there is no lasting in pack but did anybody get momentum here did anybody get momentum i grated people based on whether they have strong upper momentum in each lane sum up er momentum same down war momentum ore really downward momentum if you take a look of this chart what is looked y to these candidates ronassan says again his gold here was survive a which as whoop how this debate affects to mantis is going to be really up to what to cantus does next on the you lost ground on thee gave ground with any group he was basely the same with every group going in as he was coming out does he have any momentum inside any lane to one of the there two ways theca gain momentum they are too ways the begin momentum in o presidential race one hes you gain over all moment national to mentbig nationalmentum beaus you are doing great an multiple groups and then there is the do you have moment inside one lane this connection mu a lot we youcood action not too great in a debate but if you really lock up a lane you are momentum in that lane that lane is now going to start generating some up ticking national may not be huge to bean up to a national numbers ho can build off of that lane momentum is something you want coming out of the debate in at least one of the lanes you want momentum the cantus does he have any lane momentum no coming out of this debate can he build it sure basically it is statisquo ante for to cantus it is as though the debate never happen for t is cantus forvavake the take had some momentum among trumpets the thing about the take is that no one really has momentum among trumpets because trump has trumpets famine they are locked up among the traditional grope out say the awake what can of the same is before the traditional hoped not superfine of are maybe has some negative momentum from it but certainly is not picking up ground among sort of the traditional grope three legged stool crowd with he never trampling the party he had serious negative momentum but again he was not gong to win those people anyway he was humming for one lane and one lane only that is that fifteen per cent for trumpetjason he has strong moment among those people that means that his upper boundary takes upward boundary in this republican primary is probably about fifteen per cent he is chiseling that away from the cantus right that he achieve his goal which was strong upward momentum inside that one lane which credit to him he achieved that goal and he made himself more fa national lane which was his goal in this race in the first place because once again he is not running for present against nounal trump the way i know that is because donate trump noses he is not rung for present against nounal trump which is we donna trump his not attacked him every one who goes after trump who is proceeds the threat trump is attacked the is only one candidate in this race who is he serious candidate or proceeds the serious candidate who has not been a tack by tonal trump andthat is the take o a mike pence he comes away with negative omentum from the trumpets because again trimmed unlike among the traditional grope he cam wear the cubit of upward momentum he came away with sum liberal wing momentum like some never trump momentum little bit but does he have lie over all lane momentum strong lane momentum and the way measuring lane momentum is basically do you've a too in any category right do you have strong momentum in any one lane nothing minor ends big momentum an any one lane no for pen he would are comes away basically the same he was before a person why i know my pent i thinkers an honorable human being an honorable person who is not going anywhere i this race nickel hale she is basically wersihroes before him with trumpets in the traditional hope lane she has strung momentum it that a bit was very good for nickel hale among the traditional grope lane and you could start locking up some downers she could be seen as an alternative to him scout youcouldsee a lot of people turning away from shot and moving the money over to nick hale for example are turning away from my sense and moving over nickel hale i would not be surprised if nick whale's company starts to move from your two per sent nationally toward that seven o eight per cent nationally if you look at at timscot again i think he ended up basically when he was beforehand every can likes the gabion not ways here and has for chis crispy he has some lanemomentum with the never trampling which is strong new vampire did everybody sort of achieve their gold the answer is yes is this con make an overall difference against trump the answer's absolutely not because when you look at the the over all a the over all sort of take away from the race trump still has all the momentum with the people who love trump and the trump adjacent wing nobody is taking him at away from him in the trump adjacent wing if you wished in order to beat trump a some he has thirty per cent locked up absolutely locked up and assume there is another forty per cent that is that is playable and right now that splitting twenty per cent trump twenty per cent everybody else and then here is never trampling this twenty per cent this means that if you are going to stack up how to beat trumpright now you have to assume trump has thirty five per cent of the boat locked up then you have the traditional cope wing which he is splitting half with the rest of the party which means that he is already at forty even per cent and that is leavingside the twenty per cent trot trump adjacent an order to beat trump you basically have to wind all the never trampling you havethomg an all of the trip adjacent wing and you have to split the trump grope vote or you have to take all of the traditional trump iopeevot and you have to take five per cent of chetrum adjacent wing who can consolidate that you see who trump has this very very solid lead who exactly can consolidate that sort of math right now all of these lanes are split and trump has a foot in at least three of them is there an heard other candidate who has a foot in three of these lanes the answer is no there is not a single candidwho has a foot in three of these wins except for to cantus which is why to cantus is still the person who has the be shot of beating trump in a primary butt's can have to show some momentum coming out of this debate because the man just none work all that well for anybody who is not name trump meanwhile don trump assess this debate in his own way as you ad predict he is big fan of roman lobby which demonstrates once again that his not running again tromaswammin nor the bake running against him ye at one point tweeted out this answer gave the bake a big win in the debate he is of a thing called to root thank you the bake that would be with regard to the bake explain ha he was the best president of the twenty fir century of course again trump i think at abrygod time probably watching thedebate ya he he was attacking cross crispy he was a attacking nickel hauled little bit he went after for sure the mantis but over all nothing really happened the debate that that i think shook trumps lead meanwhile trump sorry gets we were complaining the they were blocked from the spin roomhich they should be block from the spin from if your candidate does not shop for the bate you do not get to go to the spin room and then saber about the other candidates can ridiculous m but t here is a conjuror complaining about last night right now trying to bin people from action we having just course about polio ah ow y probably wouldn't surprise any of us but that is what it is have been told by other s i would be able to go i they said we were able to go in at the sent they were i ow the were here wit hands candidate that ad you they telling we re ow of wont lame into open on i earthly pocket down is o a find of an calling hand its for security here but they're telling ham that ism not allowed to go in there because the candidates the monk e dance a lass to mate o no in understand for the last what two years did not perform as they had hoped they cannot have someone who can maybe be re presentative of my other to since a few weeks ago when i was cancelled after the first indictment i was actual to go on t abut hand the tantara is id this is silliness this silliness if your candidate does not cup to the debate you do not get to put your person in this bedroom i mean tat that seems fairly fair never level especially because trump was getting plenty of attention this own in interview tug across an unswitter ax apparently it has some two hundred million views now worth exploit explaining here that every time you scrolled past the vision on witter and spent longer than two seconds on it that counts of viol is that equivalent actually watching a a national televise debate those views are not in any way equivalent but those are a big number none none the less and trump had it easy tucker asked him zero hard questions tucked not press him on pretty much anything we will get to that in the member block but if you are not a member you have become member and use coach parol check ut for two months final angel plans clicked line in the description and join us

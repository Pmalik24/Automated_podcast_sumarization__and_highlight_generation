well you've feed the words diversity equity and inclusion over and over and over d e i a hurt from the white house you aureate from your corporation you here it from the media and this standard diversity equity and inclusion according to robin's white house has been infuse in every aspect of america government now what exactly does any of that mean we talked about it at length on the show before diversity equity and inclusion is essentially critical race theory boiled down to a friendlier piece of corporate boiler plate essentially wood argues is that if you have a situation in which one demographic group is underrepresented in any particular industry or job that must b the result of some sort of systemic discrimination or racism for example if you do not have enough say black surgeons that is because the surgical system itself discriminates against black people because in the for of vision of ihram extend either every one is equal in every possible way which means that therefore everyoneshuld be equally represented in every industry or every one is unequal which means that you are races now there is a a sort of half waved point between those two positions which happens to be the truth that people of all races and all individuality differ in their genetics they differ in their environments they differ in their culture that all individuals are different in that means the when you take a look at group beverages there are very few examples actually a cross all of humanity in which group averages are completely identical but we have to ignore that in favor of this d e proposition why because d e i is a is a gun pointed directly at the heart of the meritocracy the meritocracy suggests that there should be objective metrics by which we succeed or fail and the good newsabout meritocracy is that it means that if you succeed it is because you are doing something better than someone else which means that is better for every one else the d e i idea innately means that people we are unqualified are going to advance in life by dints of the fact that they are considered a part of the victimized to group now why does this matter in matters in party much every industry matters tat universities where you've seen for example again america discriminated against because they are too high achieving in favor a people from other groups who have lower scores you have seen it in the government receive people completely unqualified for particular offices appointed two those offices as to establish someform of social justice and now we see it in medicine one of our producers excellent research from producer grogram he helps us put this together and it is in amazing amazing story d i is not just present when it comes to your corporate hiring practices it is also present in medicine and that should fright on living hell out of everyone because all you hereabout when you going to the dowries is my doctor good at the medicating is my doctor good at taking care of me and making sure that i am healthy and in this is an area where meritocracy should be the only thing that counts is my doctor likely to fix me or is my doctor bad at that job and got appointed because of extraneous merits and when matter what those extraneous merits are whether they are interjectional or whether it is wait that does not matter all you care about when you get into that surgical bed is that the person operating on you should be good at that job but surgery is now being impacted by d e eye apparently force is at wake force medical school are about to graduate shell dill rosary she is a me student who injured a conservative patient and then bragged about it here is what she treated his a back in march of twenty twenty two quote i had a patient i was doing a blood drawn see my pronoun pin and laugh loudly to the staff she her well of course it is what other pronouns are even are there it i miss is vain ho had to get stuck twice snorting laughing moi now that of course is in insane the the idea being that if somebody disagrees if you politically then you make them actually suffer because you are in the position of the doctor now as our s sources tell us wake forest aloud rosary t allow and take a voluntary leave of absence when this scandal originally broke a she was not actually expelled or suspended and i fact no apology was issued wake forest went into full denial mode over all this also you pen health has hired you win la who delrosariofs classmate who also treated that it seemed quote dramatic when she injured the patient who mocked her

to last long with helots better sleep starts right now first of all the basic idea the medical error is rooted in karma that you don't to deserve it if there is a medical error upon you because you have the wrong belief system say you believe in the actual scientific fact to there are men and there are women that is a serious serious problem also according to our sources both you pen and lose medical schoolboy forest if attempted to hide loose hiring the force didnectiold list lose hospital and graduation materials pens is not list lose medical school on its web side now again all this is just the tip of the iceberg and this one basic situation which no apology was issued for a bad treat you could theoretically imagine a situation in which these students they said something dumb but now they apologize for it because they realize that was wrong to say it but that is not actually what happened and the bigger problem of course is that this sort of perspective which that left wing social views or introsectonal qualities make you a better doctor this is become a widespread perspective in the field of surgery let us talk about in wardwining due surgicaoressent in gnash roman an internal d lecture roman actually said that is hart sinks when he have patients w watch fox news or where magahats here is what he had to say you know thing as we in the thou right and unlike a lot of the elect hospitals in the notes on the we we say a very southern population this is not of i p hospital a people are not flying in from cat to get treated her we treat patients a just from the community in the south and yes my hot tings overtime i going to a room and i watch them watching focus are they have damage hat on are they are wearing a confederate bet and i these are the patients to retreat but dora i a wolf say the one very good thing ago the thought that inion is exactly what a leaded to alias is that we do not treat the pipes we treat people from our community and all community is as all explain is majority non white and it is wonderful to treat such a dives group of people in every read and that is not an experience that i had an my saves another places a aught that my friends have training another progress for wall diverse meaning non white is an amazingly euphemistic statementdivers usually means i brought diversity of people but now of course diversity means not white people first of all when you have surgical resident it one words talking about their hearts sinking when they see somebody of a different political perspective that should put up your made are a little bit but that is not the bad part the bad part is what roman says next according to roman he says the post gorge flood duke actually made a converted efforts to stop hiring many conceal walls of white men and that the team even learned to abandon particular metrics and of holistic application practices as to accrue more women and more satin act surgeons here is gnash roman twenty twenty en doolie to even hen and go collectively agents the confess of ducuetea they a amen to try to doth the and recognize then is sentiuris long hiss racism and flavory in which dupunivesity essentially was founded on which of a founded and that is when we thought of ad to confront that the hasty of institution they of you department the that them that the a the white men that a draped across o a always and and and that is when we hepatitis stop think that may be something should change something exchange within ours o and in and who comprises this department then of the faculty instead of resident significant inequity in representation in our program and and something that win consciously deliberately working had to change of the last several yeas i some of things that we that we have done in addition to what linin presented i think the most important thing we were don is really systemic changes to our recruitment process to try to recruit divers residence to up program and then to retain in septettes i es residence off to the get to our program part of this has in bad drones thing to completethe holistic review process that we spoke about to to day i apondiding in all to metrics and creeps i looking at peoples life story in in what pro them into sure i and then the oxheart fit is in eating that i best people read the applications and because that is an important component oftinsuring that we get that's residence into our program and then once residence get here i how do we hotter support them just to get that strait he is literally saying that we are ignoring metrics in order to look at the life story of your surgeon now just have a question for you go in for an open hard surgery has god from midget a blockage in your artery do you ask for the surgeon's life story do you care about the surgeons life story should you care about the surgeons life story or do you care a lot more about whether this doctor has a good track record of making sure the people who require a bye pass actually get the by past they need without dying on the table it is insane for surgical residencies do take a look at people base on their while story as opposed to object mantric of success it is totally crazy it is totally what by the way this same person has also treated that he will not quit quote amplify medical literature involving only white men he treated out is jury of twenty twenty quote i would say even for academic publications i do not want to amplify the work of white men who only collaborate with other white men we hate o most of the modern medical advances in human history in e seriously you you you're not going to actually take a book at the academic publications of white man working with other white men we first of all this racism second of all these are the areas where merit matters most and of course again even the sky is only one example of a big or then disguise the tip of the iceberg the america college of surgeons the ace yes gave its lightweight thousand members for example a definition of racism that says it is literally impossible defaces against white people here is what they said quote race racism is the marginalization and ore oppression of people of color these on a socially constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people racism involves one group having the power to carry out systematic discrimination through the institutional policies and practices of society and by shaping the cultural beliefs and values that support those races policies and practices that is the pram extend definition of racism racism is not just discrimination against a race it is power plus discrimination against the race and the only people we can ever deem to be powerful are white men which means that being racist against o white people is totally vine not only is at find it is a corrective mechanism barring for example white men from getting into top level surgical residences as a corrective mechanism is somehow good now and you put that pressure all the way down system and what you are ending up with is feu are qualified people who are entering the system and more unqualified people

physicians who look them they tend it to better an suggest to the grant an wards be distributed to surgeons on the basis of their interosectionality were were seeing evidence that the vercitylyts to pro to comes it the patients we know the lot the a tat whenpatient sea physicians that look then the ten too better they ten a better coming a outcome are an medicine has really lad behind in at sens an representing the population of is er a for example the position of insurgents as a partner wet thealecting a surgical society in gravely compositions that we have a word or say table interns o o can wets import for our members a station for a find of in surgery dust s just otitis satyrs down ta e one thing that their focuston chanting phenomenalism they have on to fell grand in a word specifically for under presented minorities again these sorts of happy talking nonsensical phraseologist all the stuff is one thing in the synergistic corporate board room it is another thing when you are talking about the sorducal roo here is a reason conference not i at pen where you and tuna work one surgeon explain that was off putting that many surgeons were quintal white men it is i think surgeon general has been a predominantly white an ma dominated felt and that can be very am of cutting and intimidate anger somebody a and i unfortion i think they probably lost many great minds just for that reader the do not fee i they the can they feel there another and i think you do not let our hear it it you can very easily feel another just because ye do not look the share lot of the same experiences as your peers you know it make somebody feel another if you literally say that they are in oppressor class and therefore should not be part of your surgical residency these same doctor is go on to explain the surgery require something the anifells run rules the run rule is a ruin the anifell the you must interview a certain number of black c applicants to a position before you are actually allowed to hire their saying the teams should be forced interview might north candidates regardless of qualifications i published years ago that the run rule the rule they us that had a fells should be apple to i can have it not a tat a i can a surgery in particular am if you thoughtsome of the comments must racily about the i efforts were a cholengin it an inflamed tora now you can imagine a decay a go that means that is still needed to be discussed i think the lands of who else is out there let us reach a little further not down but to am pertain to continuance that we need to consider it is polar the way that that they needs to go afford my been i thee there also needs to be some a a countability or some am you do not credent put on diversity initiatives put on the diversity work that you mar may not be doing her the diversity of your department for the diversity of something because certainly if you published seventy five manuscripts in an abbreviated mount of time absolutely but the run rule which we know does not work very well since there is not that many black a had coaches is also that they they just have to interview them they do not have a hirer woman they novae to actually think of bout then you don't on the same level they have to interview them it i think that still were still in the same issue that if the white man or or the the white mail chair is picking their successor or picking whoever it is there is still been a gravity towards the white mail whatever and the truly i thing is great that it needs to go once that further and and ism sure at that lecnati credibly are out in the world but what it is true if the know just interviewing titan enough to this done i ain't it people must be forced to select force to select black candidates or minority candidates or whomever force to pick tat i love the fact that we are now living this orwellian world where she can assume that if a white chair of a medical association picks say in avian persons tor a place them that that is in a fact white supremacy done through unconscious bice but if they openly pick somebody for race then that is somehow a corrective another would you have to assume that the entire system is evil in order for you to puppet perpetuate your own evil which is to select people not on the basis of merit that you literally says that it is one thing if you have seventy five publication or wat ever but what about people who do not have seventy five pop what about the people who are just in competent why should not they have a shot that being chief medical resident at hazard why not what what would exactly is the problem hell i mean listen here is the problem the problem is that the third leading cause of death in the united states is medical error that is the third leading cause of death they are enough mistakes that get made in the operating room or in doctor's offices all around the country already the last thing that you need is to specifically go out of your way to put unqualified people in positions of power based on their race and whenever people say the sort of stuff there is an accusation what your saying is races know what i am saying is the opposite of races i am saying merit should decide merithoudecide the people who are advocating for d e i in these professions they are the races they're explicitly saying that race is the only relevant factor that you beagle to overcome merit and this is dangerous stuff because people die all the time and hospitals people die all the time from medical man practice from medical error and going out of your way is a medical school or is a college of urgent to suggest that d e i ought to be governing principle there ought to be only one governing principle and one governing principle alone and that governing principle ought to be the merit of the doctor that is it there is no other governing principle as a patient the is what i care about when i put my kids in the care of a doctor or a surgeon god forbid the only thing i care about is whether that person is going to be able to take care of me or my kid i do not care at all about the race of the person and the fact not that color blindness is now seen as racism and of the corrective to that is actual racism is totally insane is can get people kill it legitimately will get people killedyoull then competent people in positions of power specifically because of d e eye and that particular philosophy is not of course relegated to the practice of medicine it is more on this in just one moment first tot i tell you

according to c and there has been suspect in the killing of an august university college of nursing student at the university of georgia campus in fins the young woman's name was taken hope rely who is a junior on the densest at august university according to the university of georgia policechieve eff clerk it was a crime of opportunity by an individual who woke up with bad intentions to who exactly is the alleged murderer where the police or recommending charges against a twenty six year old including felling murder false imprissman kidnapping and concealing the death of another in ride's killing to exactly was the suspect where turns out that the suspect was wait for it inly emigrants this person is undocumented apparently according to a member of the georgia legislature the suspect was in the country illegally having crosse the border in you pasotecas into khamsin twenty two hots apprehended at the border and released into the united states now again that is the cattionrelese programmed debit administration as put in places all bout t a remember diverse people get to break the law that is the way that is works the suspect was arrested in queens new york for an injury to a child and having no license that was in september of twenty twenty three but gain new york city also has a d policy whereby they have decided that crime in objective metric is no longer sufficient to decide whether some one ought to go to jail or be deported if two many black or hispannic people are being arrested and or reported well that must mean that the system is broken and we have to get rid of the metric itself the suspect and his brother recited in fins clerk county in october of twenty twenty three for shoplifting the suspect even had n ow standing bench warrants as of remember twenty twenty three for failing to appear in court on the shoplifting charges the suspects brother was charged yesterday by federal authorities for possessing a froshlant green card the suspect brother was arrested in fins clerk counter in september twenty twenty three for a do i driving without a licence speeding open container and failure to lea yield to an emergency vehicle and was arrested again in remember hoyden has taken up d fiat every level of his administration that means with regard to emigration policy as well in people are dead because of it that is not to say that the vast majority of people whore crossing the border a criminals other than the illegal crossing of the border it is to say that when you let people in and you do not let them and you one no idea why there here and then you arrest them multiple times and release them without the porting them people lie they should be very obvious stuff ice put out a statement as well they say that the twenty six year old citizen of venisuayle was arrested by c b piece softener eight twenty twenty two after unlawfully entering the united states near a posse taxis he is paroled and release for further process on september fourteenth twenty twenty three he is arrested by the an why pity and charge he was released by the unwiputy before any detainer could be issued and then on library twenty twenty third twenty twenty four marry aslant encountered this person pursuing to his arrest by the university of gorge police department and being charged with murder and other crimes and finally earn aslant lodged a detainer a this is the pure and obvious outcome of a horrific emigration policy undertaken by this ad ministration none of this had to happen y how we known it did not have happen this jobidon is now considering taking executive actions who stop it from happening job now ants to change the definition of asylum at the border as to reject people at the border rather than processing them and letting them into the country for non specified at period of time tammy duckworth very liberal senator she says that you'd back joins executive actions to stop asylum clams which by the way is in an of itself a tacit admission to all the charges republicans have been making about bad democratic emigration policy the bi administrations considering using exact tat of action to make it harder for migrate to claim asylum would you support that i would support that because we do have a crisis at the porter but i also think the something dona trunk tried well what motto trump has has packed away from this as part of that package there was more money for a whole bits of thinks to include a were a a worker programs o that people could actually go to work at while they are waiting for their case to be abdicated i think that is quickly important is a work armet for folks who come here if they want to work with as put them to work have got the act in streets looking for workers retails of for workers while they are waiting for the let us let allow hem to work the an that compromise it is exactly that there was stuff the fix the of the border problems but also allowed us to let to be humane about how we take care of the migrants er here again been democrats are now realizing hon f political liability this is and they should president truck was on the attack about this over the weekend he was speaking at setback and he had talked about jorbidnsemigration policy and it is it is funny to watch democrats to cry trump for saying what is obviously through here we have a new cat going margin crime and it is going to be more severe then violent crime and crime as we know it because we have millions and millions of people and they came from prisons an jails they came from mentalinstitutions sandman the slums know the not the same say and in sanest em is ta mental institution on steritsit is a silence of the lamps he a the hadabolector they are all being deposited into our country and then you have tears and then you have trash and then you have human traffickers and the coming over it levels never seen before we never seen anything this the people who are getting courage about true saying sun that it seems to me should be a lot more outrage about the fact that illegal immigrants sometimes kill america citizen and they should not be here that is what is truly outrageous i tell about reborn a lot on this show that is because i believe in their mission reborn network of clinics is saving as many babies as possible from the clutches of abortion their clinics are located in the darkest corners of the nation where the majority of abortions are taking place reborn offers these expecting mothers free ultrasounds they believe when a mom heres for babies hardest on the ultrasound she usually chooses life and that is true it is an amazing trains foremen of experience to use ultrasound give forks met all of them long before they were born deals fogbound and now reborn is helping expectant moms do the same they rescue two hundred babies every day but by the time this message is done two more babies will have lost their lives abortiontins on can stop we need every one to say enough and help fight save these unborn children if you have the means would you consider a leadership get to save babies in a big way attack deductible donation of five grandwill sponge or reborn in tirenutwork for s twenty four hours helping to rescue two hundred babies to do not get securely tow pounds to fifty say keyword baby that is town two fives hero say we were baby or go to reborn dot come at slash ben again that is reborn dot come at slashed and this is what trump is banking on for his replace is that bottom line is jobidon has ben a terrible president and people of paid the price because jobidon is a terrible terrible president at see pack present and trumps saying that join is directing the country told collapse and certainly when you look at the fact that at least a seven point two million people were counts and at the border under jobidon millions more not encountered anymore been seven and ten million people of probably entered the country legally since jobidon took office i mean those are awful numbers and trump is right to pointed out obviously if crooked jo bison an is tugs when and twenty twenty for the worst is yet to come a country will go an sink to levels at we are unimaginable and just think about it with for more years of biding the words of a legolelion stamping a cresobord is will excel forty jot fifty million people metic care social security health care and public education will bock and collapse it will collapse as sure your sitting or standing there it will collapse a economy will be starved of energy by crookedgos vindictive green new scam it is a green scampi will be the destruction of our country it is indeed a scam and most of them know it some of them the fuels believe it but most of them no get say president trump the the media re trying to convince you thatyou should be scared of president from policy proposals that is we should be sheriffs the take to acts with regard to trump one is crazy orange man bad and the other is his policies are scary and terrible the problem is that jobidon's cent policies are bad that trumps pledges to reverse those policies a incredibly sane by comparison men trust politico is threatening us for the god times to politicalisan entirepiece tell beyond shock and awe inside drums potential second term agenda from nation white abortion bands wo class from culture wards assaults on climatetines and political demonization of the military his return to the whorehouse to make trombone point o seemed tamp what a ma feel frank about something trump mop not o was tame it was extremely ta trump one point to in terms of policy was sane and tame which is why as of twenty nineteen before the covet pandemic we had a booming economy peace on the foreign front and a fairly high level of domestic tranquillity i noticed all of that why because it was pretty sane if your threatening me with more sanity i do not of that is much f a threat according to politico trying to scare the hell out of you both supporters in critics of the ex present predict a reelected trump would wage a more focus than aggressive attack on the status quit sandman i can only hope this time that he they say he would be far more knowledgeable about the mechanics of wielding executive power having placed many conservatives in federal judgeship hold face less resistance from the court and he would be more determine to place loyalists not rules obsessed traditionalists senior roles went my guess is that he would actually be more i he would be more interested in making sure that people were lower down on the food change were people who were not to tempting to u no destroy his presidency from within what exactly is scary apparently he is talking now about a sixteen week abortion bad that is something that he is pushing a sixty that by the way is way later than virtually every country in rope that is supposed to scare people he apparently also wants to go after federal climate science and in sure t cannot be used to guide government policies which let us be clear about this it should not be guiding executive policy if the legislature wants to make decisions to cripple the america economy bast on the gradual warming of the climate over the next one hundred years using measures that will not markedly decrease that warming and our heavily reliant on for countries to do the same when what the legislature do that let your let your legislators be punished for it why should the executive branch be responsible for doing all of that trump also is going to target china his going to but tariff's on china he said economic security is national security china is not allow america companies to take over the critical infrastructure america sh not allow china to take over our critical in for structure he said he would impose a for your plan to face out all chines imports of a central goods everything from electronics to steal to farmasuticles mean again show me the law where is the problem of that do you want to be reliance on chines farmasuticles what happens when china invades ti one what happened when the ability of amen ricking to get vital goods goes away because we did not prepare for the possibility of that politicoes also trying to carry the he is gin a wager classromore a and this is on of the left favorite games is that they declare war on something perfectly innocuous a classroom by trying to actualized children and then when you say no your waging you classroom war and this is all the stuff that supposed to be scaring you i gotten yo i do not seem scared about all of it w do not seem superscared about it also apparently they are saying that dona drums gem deploy you us troops against america to well know actually what he said is that if there is a rogues he might call the national guard which is pretty saying to me and as far as the notion the is going to a bandit ado that is not true what he says is that the members of dato need to pay their fair share he does not mean that the united states is going to stop being a member of dato and by the way it is worked the members of natal are upping there own defend spending and he's going to loosen the rains on script god for bed oh no we have to make fur the government constant this is what the the democrats our trying to scare you with that is hanging a work there can have to resort to prong number one again which is donate trump crazy person now this is not mean that trump has a a clear pay ahead for the presidency here's a primary over the weekend in south caroling we in to get to that in just one second because it shows you hands the strategic that are being at tempted by both sides democrats and re publicans it is really focus on what we would call the low propensity voter well get to that in just one second first folks as we are talking about when you talk about what the left is doing in the classroom is not just toe classroom they are also doing that with regard to children entertainment it is amazing how they are infusing a bunch of left wing propaganda into entertainment directed at your kids dis'nee

trumpwright now has the advantage there is no question that he has the advantage in the selection and that is not really because of trump much as it is about mobile right now in the real geopolitics pulling average dona trump is running fully one point nine points ahead of jobidon at this point in the last selection cycle tobidon was running nearly five points ahead of donate trumpet of course he only narrowly beat him in the electoral college according to the bran new hers ex one that is out over the course of the last few days trumpet is up for coring econimoust you up trumps up one scoring to morning consult trump is up for if trump is up in the popular vote true swinging the election if trumps even within a point in h popular vote trump is going town the election trump is in pretty goo shape but he does have a problem the problem that he has is can he get low propensity voters to the poles because the republican party has traded high propensity voters for low propensity voters that is one of the things that is happen now democrats of sort of due in the same it is really weird both parties have decided that the median voter the high propensity median voter is no longer a person worth per suing if you look at the rate to voter turn out it is not just can you get a certain per centare of a popular a population base to vote in your favor are what percentage of whites or black aoletinos went you favor it is how often those groups vote are they high propensity voters or are they low propensity voters and what you see is that in the united states there are wide disparities between different groups based on age based on rage based on education based on family in come in who is a voter and who is a non voter huge disparities if you take a look for example at twenty twenty two write the last election cycle what you will see is that among voters the number of of eighteen to twenty nines was really really low twenty seven percent of eighteen to twenty nines did not vote in the twenty twenty to election only ten per cent did the same thing was true of thirty to forty ninurolds thirty even per cent of thirty to forty ninefold did not vote they represented thirty seven percent of the non voters rather they are representable twenty six per cent of voters the over representing groups in terms of people who vote for s people do not vote are people age sixty five plus people ore age sixty five plus definitely benefit trump sos are higher propensity voters however they are other cross cutting considerations for example voters in twenty twenty two whites are overrepresented in terms of being high propensity voters seventy five per cent seventy five per cent of voters in twenty twenty two were white compared with fifty five per cent of non voters nine present ore black nine per cent ore hasbenic three per cent reaction hispannic are wildly under represented there i very low propensity group if you are republican your hat your counting on heavy letzeno turn out to jogged victory or for democrat doing the same those that that is a low propensity voting group black america typically are a are a low propensity voting group when it comes to education however i that look at at to whites overrepresented old people overrepresented but when it comes to education who are those people they ten to be college graduates if you are a high school or less voter that be a lot of true white voters are high whole less very low propensity voters only twenty five percent of voters and twenty twenty two had a high school degree or less in terms of education compared to forty three per cent of the people who did not vote if you have some college then you are petty much equally likely to vote not vote if you are a college great or a post grad your significantly more likely d vote this is why for example democrats are vote ore focussing in on the views of their college educated white ladies in the suburbs those are very high propensity voters but they are then accompanying that with low propensity voters black in his panic voters in major urban areas for example it's a weird coalition meanwhile republicans have also bear built a weird coalition there weird coalition is high propensity voters namely old white people but also very low propensity voters namely high school educated poor white people ore also less likely to vote save a coalition in both parties of some high propensity voters in a lot of low propensity votes the question is how do you get your low propensity voters to vote that is the real question because neither party can afford to lose a lot here i if you are donate trump had do get those low propensity voters out to the poles well donate trump actually does have a habit of getting low propensity high school educated white male for example out to vote in broader numbers can jo bid do the same with minorities it is the reason right now why he is trying to capitulate the commons it is the reason why he is plain footsie with the with the radicals in michigan it is the reason why he refuses to take measures that would crack down any legal immigration up till now he is trying to to please a low propensity voting group young people very low propensity voting group he is trying to please those people allow propensity voting groups black america he things that if he caters to that voting group they will show up in boughten low propensity means likelihood d vote typically the way that you win in election if you want one election yet everybody who is sixty per cent or up in terms of voting for you to get to the poles and then you can since everybody who forty per cent or up on voting for you gets the pulse those who be independent very often people who votalot but you are not sure with for the in vote nobody is aiming at the median voter any more it is pretty i pressie how everyone is steadfastly ignoring the median voter which is for example why nickel hale pulls really well in general election terms because she is contintermns f for positioning she ectiul closer to con the median voter now does that mean that you'd ever win a primary inside the r publican part the answer of course is now which is what happen in south caroling the other days when south caroling donate trump blue nickel hale away he want a twenty point victory over nickel hale in south carolina's republican primary that of course is where she was a the governor that was her home state america for prosperity action told that staff sundae you would stop supporting her financialliyst this race is effectively over for her shoe doesn't have the money to keep running she says she is going a continue to stay in i assume the reason that she is staying in is because she believes that if she stays in and if don't trump gets the nomination that he loses she is gone be able to starless and i offered you an alternative try me give me a shot next time around to shoviouslytingon win the nomination this time here is nickel hale south caroling i would continue to in i i giving up this i when a men forgive mere cans dis a truth of both done trump and jo by get and then she says the dona trump drives people away and by polling data she has correct down true is a highly polarizing figure that given tritons myriad failures as president of the united states trump should be up ten points over jobidon at this point even though he is up very slightly in the poles right now what can trump do to fix that we will talk about that a second here is nickel daily this has never ben about me on my political future we need to bed u biding in no member tubule done trump can be job nearly en tree day trump turns people away toxin wit this comments jest yesterday yet that may very well be true true himself says that he as never seen the republican party as unified as it is right now but that obviously is not true i mean he is the incumbent president he only one but when i say only that the big victory twenty points but the medically he so n eighty twenty not sixty forty the means that forty per cent of the people voting the south carline primary did not want trump now it is an open primary there are democrats for voting in that primary but not everybody who out er for nickel hailed is a democrat her is trump talk about the unity inside the party now this a spirit that i have never seen serin to grip a s e ever e ever this never ten aspire li the an i just on to say that i have never seen the republican bad unify as o e travel e what is trump strategy going to be here u some people think that he is going to try to diversify out his base by picking someone like him shot for vice president i think the answer here for for trump really is that i i think that he figures he is got everybody in the low propensity category his on avovoting maybe tax to the middle in terms of position and hopes that independent voter breaks for him what it seems he is really counting on more than anything else is foreboding not to be able to turn out the low propensity voter that's how a terrible bat it just means the elections can be really really closes when you are betting on the other side to fail as opposed yourself to succeed that can be a very serious problem it els it does not help when you have people my landed this vas the big trumpbacker out there telling people not to vote by mail it dud stop stop if if you want trump to wind you need republicans voting by mail and you need the voting early just get them to not but here is rover loved frozen of the we hat that we have been held tat we are in the the the got a lot of problem but one of e thing to thin tin do when i a parent e her lass ere what came out of that there is argue the green e else the resolution paper boy can con same day body no early body i and by the way ay a the cousin o not early is wrong you not say day in telling you that can harder for them so she at or vote early or get your balling counted now because democrats well of get meanwhile in the best media story of the week end hirachek whose lies of ticktock sheckshe sat down with tail lore's now tail lore's happens to be a full reporter who

just the a journalist and her standard is it must be somebody i believe that it is without any evidence and and you should you should apologized for that totally insane in these are the people in legacy media there is reason we all hate the legacy media it is hard to think of people who are worse than the legacy media to be totally honest with you i mean an iris across the board just the disconnect the disconnect between ore legacy media and theamerican public is utterly wild for example here is a political reporter on emus be see explaining that anyone who believes in god given rights is actually a christian nationalists this what the left us they take an actual term and then they broaden out the definition to expo to include everyone they hate right white supremacy is a term with a meaning and then they either the expand that out to include any one who thinks for example that meritocracy is good you are now white to primisist christian nationalism is a term with an actual meaning what it typically means is something akin to theocracy that law should be christian in orientation not just that it should take its values from christiania which is something that i generally agree with in the united states not that you should be man hated to go to church because there is a separation of churchman states to that extent but that the moral under pinning of the united states of america is rooted in christian theology that there is no question that that is true aby the way is secular sin in the west they are roots historically in christiania clearly but what they say is the christian nationalism means anything that invokes god is now christian nationalists that is he you end up with this idiotic reporter hide chrisbula trying to claim that the declaration of independence is a christian nationalist document the one thing that unit tole because here is many a different chips orbiting trumpet the thing that writ to unites them as christian nationalist not christian by the way because christian nationalist this very de is that they believe that our rights as theamericans as all human beings do not come from any istle authority that come from congress that a confess pin court they come from god you mean the declaration of independence t that that is literally the declaration independenceisshes calling a christian nationalist document now s again if you are on the right you are just whatever is the evil term of the day by the way the cuorrellary to what she saying is tit the only way to be not christian nationalist is to believe that rights come from government that the government grants you rights which of course is ridiculous because that assumes that all power neatly resides not with the people not with individuals now the families now the communities but with the government that is not the way that it works the entire basis for america government is that we granted government certain specified powers in the constitution of the united states specified powers not unlimited powers and that we reserve rights to ourself and that if the government invades those rights the government has failed to do its job and in fact has destroyed it is reason for existence but that is now i guess i a christian nationalists perspective o good news guise i guess aim now christian nationalist if that is the way the that works already folks in just

milk on o the to number t you do me up actually myall numbers these stories reminded me of an old chines saying i once heard actually i learned a couple weeks ago and i have no idea how old it is but it goes this bookstall butch that is my friend u and u an d bookstall butch and hot is if there is no coincidence there will be stories no coincidence no story to implying tents of course life to i don now t developed in the ways that we cannot predict is it if you heard a story with he coincidence afterwards he might be now considers in a story that yes just a expression you use the colt i say a cornything to say mostly i think of no i i will not be a crisis should you ever is it when ism corny yes shat the risk of being corny ism going to say it to days show no coincidence no story while the big man's away beret a sneak these coincident stories on to the air all the stories you will here to day first aired on our show and twenty thirteenth about four years ago and they are all verified true stories that my colleagues hit for me until the actual interviews wouldn't spoil is surprise which is also why there is much on professional giggling this hour and full disclosure i came into this topic a coincidence septic believing that a coincidence is just a coincidence nothing more i judged i confronted weakness i countered wide eyed faith with statistical probability and by the end well stay with us at one grandmas blame liver is living in nicaragua right now we talked on skite about four months ago he was on the phone to his friend civil who goes by mammy he mentioned to her that the screen savor on his telephone had been the same picture for a long time that he wanted to change it i ask toe sou i semi picture of something a and and it was really funny she ended up sang me this picture of her as little kit is a joke alike ah yes can a funny snorts expecting be is funny and then i glanced back at the picture and i saw my grandma walking through behind her what ye how crazy is that right very crazy the picture was taken about eighteen years ago but you recognized her right away i i austere is no question asioshois is that question images coincidence is this one usually have a dense nest of details to bolster the craziness here goes blame is from michican that is where he met camel but camisole's family is not fermisshingan at all there originally from you taw soli sit you ta that is where she grew up ye that she are wat i was this photo from youth no n that is the funny thing is my grandma's in melburne florid and ism thinking a she must have been in mouton what cast campus no now that that pictures taken in ferkfill i than cover island in canada what ya right blame figured out that at the same time that mammy in her family were on vacation an bancouver grandma once had gone there to visit some of her husband's relatives i what is that would it anis to think that not only did i meet mammy but she since me this picture of her in the background of my grandma i do not know what the chances are it is it'll right yes innolily i do not if you seen the picture but not only just in the picture bully perfectly behind her at that moment a fellow producer emailed me the photo and there it was cute four your old mammy in the foreground facing the camera and not far behind her a blond woman walking past wearing blue shorts and a matching top yes she is going it she is in the picture even y write it aunt ope she does not seem aware but i have to say it is it is a little am you knots not a very crisp photo ism sort of surprise you would recognize her right away well ya there is not a lot of it is my aroma newly r i twenty years ago for my first reporting job i interviewed a woman who just turned a hundred years old i asked her admittedly a rooky question what is the most amazing thing that is happened in your life she thought for a while and then she said the most interesting thing that happened to me was that on my first day at phatchog school the principle said to me what is your name i said extra cuddle and he said i have a friend in shelter land by that name i was twelve she said and that to me was remarkable this woman had seen the advent of cars and movies and computers and space travel and this was her answer but the time i thought it was lame that maybe ester was losing it a little but since i our t hearing all these coincident stories the last couple of weeks i reconsidered coincidences feel rare and that sticks with you even when the coincidences barely a coincidence at all and academic study of people's reactions took coincident stories from the early nineteen ladies found that we have an egocentric by us toward hoer own coincidences the people find stories that happened o them far more surprising then the same stories happening to other people destined point mi name if sultan a on eager and in fifteen years old sultana she is got a problem with her grandmother my grandma have been are with e coinfidencind and she find them in all the time in the always want to tell every one about them and we began o annoyed with er i i e you i ye think the to in creatable and have i happened to her all the time and if every time we we her all my got you would not believe what happened to me and l eve am i was at the hospital it am we know he pul o have yo think e can to the a doctor ta quite if it for a pin i ain shall be getting in the waiting room and then am the drive you will get long a tor that and all fee o people they were waiting in the waiting ran wet a at the rest and give always you know i a thought e funny we if agent ten but we not may be e and to get one tho i give not e i we ye one hi a go i v giving a i get in matinglish last we reading the valet letter book a and i were am want we finish the book i and project but we had to come up with what a tin wonder what than we struggled with the to and am i we envy tho we had he create o t letter an paper and than we can tat i fair e tin it o or her and serin on fully edit tho a i we coloring in my letter and cutting it out a my mam wit within the the o man in the back grown ad were watching it om i would literally cutting out my at u no mine a letter e for envy en it ten on the so an petty the even thin and he ma comment want envy a i was cutting out my letter and to i immediately called my grandma and wit telling her about it and her if i go ha that a god one ya and then i did not rally her back from her after that and i thought well e i you envy it of my in an i a i li i o a i o better you happened to run in to a firs en twice in one day i do tat all the time what a o the a ten cutting out e letter e tit would talk about that on hon i was o confuse about it case o ruling's coincidence as a common one we have all had those moments when you are reading a certain word and then some one says it on the radio or on t v but remember sultana sixteen maybe this is the first time as happening to her still ism on her side here i think it is more remarkable than her grandmother's example of the people in the waiting room being at the restaurant do you are you have a phone where you can dial up your grandma i know i can try to it i a on recon sultan a conference tour grandmother in we could settle us ism here you a open he laying old son nice to meet you ti get you go i laid out my argument freelance about the purity and therefore superiority of sultana's example but he lain argued right back there were several hours between the two stings plus the restaurant was about four miles from the hospital and in that four mile racket you mi that i could a glad to any number i re bat t ha tat that i man in er at ha i a i think a quit it i think it she cold a on any plate to that is that is true i mean this there in something i noting it is not a coincidence ism just saying it is not may be as pure as you can break down this sort of probabilities of w certain kind of person in a certain kind of ne g e do you do not think i i ad do you think you are somehow prone to coincidences coincidences i new here than they find other people i do not know that but i you now in my own family a a a a happen to you and do not get don't yo mi o be robot by i a you o a when you a er going a we have nothing to give to you because you have your can you randy my w i a ai what would sultana what would sultana have to experience in terms of a coincidence that would impress you you think what would it need to be we you no i to can a i a couple of week o go i had mi i a not another got i at getting in we fetters gentlemen a plot we in this time it was about an age man in the waiting room whom she laid herself buying a melon a crater pros which alone admitted was not as good as the other one a to in god we trust probably no surprise tat we got a huge number of coincidences pitches about love romantic loves a we years ago after stephenlea proposed to his girl friend been they

and i to sleep an my genes and have changed in my genes in it comes out in it gets in my bedini've figured it out the same way he did it is that stories merely of i i am please to me you coming out do not life the man hole cover that is in a minute from chico public radio when our programmed continues it is this america life ism saracanag sitting in for era glass we have borrowed to days show from a chines saying no coincidence no story we first are the show four years ago after asking you to send us your coincident stories and you flooded us with more than thirteen hundred pitches we found friends we found gems we found stories impossible to classify when isms eff on eff don o ha eff group in so city i when he was sixteen the was hanging out with two of his friends at some one's house the parents were at home there goofing round smoking pot they are in the living room that had a huge window on one wall and we are sitting there and were kind of sitting on this glass wall and there is a dirt road outside this house and up this dirt road barrels this then and the thing that happens next is what you think ingoing to happen when we see a a white can that at night t guides get out there all can of bundled up and they pretty quickly just run to the back of the van open it up and pull out this big black bag they get out they take the the bag out and they quickly run up this kind of small hill this behind his house and it is all wait there is no house us back the they run up this hill with this bag and less than two minutes later the come running back down and they get n the van and they take off eff an his friends do precisely what you do not want them to do if this were in after school special this is the point where you are yelling at the t v saying do not do it stay inside but they decided they had to find out what the strange men in the van have deposited at the top of the hill they run up there we get to the top and can a look around and then we see that and of on one side of it there is the this man hell cover a circular man will cover you see anywhere an coming from one of the edges of the man whole cover it is in place is long brown here human here long brown human hair they are teen avers they are stoned they are freaked out they half to tell in adult about what they have seen a police car happens to drive by they flag it down and the officer tells them to get in the back it became clear that she was really concerned because she then said gathers and our girl this sing on the west side a town for the last coup of days my ad a gain our hearts just for of drop and you had not known that had not bet on the news or something li and we anoint it ideas we we just cone got scared at that point can i can i stay ye for second is the story gin the get funny or is the saharfying story wait actually do not tell me do not to me toll you rock ay do not to me she calls another officer and the other officer comes there is couple cars and they both get out and tell us to get out an they say they wait at the bottom of hit awaiting they go walking out tot and it is dark we cannot really see them that well but we can see them well enough and we do not really want a watch whit is going on because we see them then over pull the cover off and ism trying not to look but of course ism looking am she pulls up a human figure out of the hole on and than she says it is a manikins i do not know what my fibrin but i was sitting there thinking as own how does this story and that coquet in a cousin in in universe i unless you say it is a ma eff goes to school on money tells his story in physic's class and the kid next to him says that was us we did it we went around stealing holiday decorations and we had to get rid of them we stuff them under the man how cover the magical by the way had been the virgin many and some one's nativity seen i think the real coincidences that is our close friend that cause us to happen o they were gin friends er sir i i now eff turns out that is not the real coincidence of the story my producer bran read was listening to all these interviews as they were happening and he interrupted us to tell us we both miss the point bring is to plain out that i is you and i ere both misting an in o coincidence of my own story i submitted at o the coincidencethes thing the main coincidence there is a girl missing at the same time yet i have five words for you eff boo shall we total no coincidence no story here is a definition of coincidence that seems right to me a coincidence is a surprising concurrence of events perceived as meaningfully related with no apparent causal connection it is that middle part meaningfully related that people seem to get stuck on because when events line up just you cannot help it you cannot help but wonder if there is a message in that in that way coincidences are kind of short cuts to very big questions about fate about god even to people who do not believe in either one the notion that somewhere out there some one or some thing is paying attention to your life that there might be a plan conjured through coincidences that notion seems to be most appealing when you are young we got one story about a young couple visiting maracas in morocco thereat a restaurant talking you do about old flames the boyferin wanted to know about one guy in particular i have hate he what did the a look and kat was stopped dead in her track a lifted one hand to her mouth and with the other hand pointed across the restaurant and she said on my gat he looked that and she crop to

coincidence live a long and healthy life to get told and retold and take its rightful place in the narrative of your life sometimes you have to stop yourself from thinking it all the way through why it happened really is the fact is any statistician will probably rain on your parade well tell you these things happened a lot more often than you think but a good coincidence is a good magic trick when you see one a struggle and sis instantaneously but tween the thrill of the apparent miracle and the urged to dobunkit this final story is by carry weeks he is a prop guy for the movies but he told this at a story telling competition here is my story nine years old first time going to summer camp and my grandfather gives me before i go he gives me his old pocket knife is pressingly in antique and the first thing all is boys do when we get to camp is we pull it our knifes who start throw them at things trying to get them to stick the way can or bone did and because his nineteen sound es there is nothing unusual about a bunch of young children throwing sharp knives around got mined to stick in the floor board is i long and is grief that when i pull it out the tip broke off o but anyway cannot goes on and a few days later i notice my knife is missing and it'll look everywhere for it i look look low it is gone the one day and walking through camp and see this group of boys thrown knife at a tree and something tells me i should check this out and sure enough there is his boy there throwing my knife now there is no mistaking this knife because the handle was red and green but the caller's met in the medal n count swell together in the drippy psychedelic way and have never seen a knife that before since walk up to this boy hours little old or be walk up to him as say hey that is my knife he says now it is life ass a no that is my knife my grandfather gave it to me he says no he did not is is my grandfather gave it to me and ism confused all the sun maybe i should have thoughtless through bet more i thought he would just hand it over and the other boys the moving close and in thinking could it be possible that his grandfather gave him the exact same knife that my grandfather gave me i mean is this a thing and i just did know it but ill look at the knife he is holding his hand and i look at the blade and see that the tip of the blade is square it off is though it were broken and i say that is my knife because i broke the tip off when i stuck it in the floor he says what that no it came that way he can is it a screw driver and i look at the other boys and ism not getting any help from them and i wander off just thinking to myself screw driver and never thought of that well as you can imagine this really bug me and i do not mean just while i was at camp but for the rest of my life and i cant think why did i fold easily why did not i go to the counsellors and the only thing i can think of is this ism the sun of a physicist and i used to ask my dad these questions all the time dad how far away is the sun dad how fast is the speed of light dad what is the closest star and he would give me these answers in these numbers that would just in huge i could not get my mind around them my my point is this i better than most other children had an idea of just how bast the universe is and there for how infinite the possibilities are my the thing is at the time my the wot may be the kits telling the truth the only lies when i bring is up is because this is what i was thinking of when some thirty two years later i become the landlord of a small apartment building and one of the first things i did as a landlord was i i threw the sky out because he was a small time drug dealer on the day he is moving out i get a call from his neighbor across the hall a i i call unwiser bob and unwiser bob is a that druggy is stealing your refrigerator and i hop down there and sure enough in the driveway is a pick up took and in the back of the pick up truck is a refrigerator i charge up the stairs and a demand to know just what the else going on and neck the druggy calmly tells me is says do when i moved in here that refrigerator was rose i bought my own refrigerator and swapped it out and i put that when you store and now on just put in at back and i look in the kitchen and sure not there is another refrigerator it is a little old a little dirty but it is working and ism trying to think the through i mean would someone really go to all that trouble of just swapping out or refrigerator in them putting in storage and bringing it back or would at i go to the trouble stealing a used refrigerate or just as crew as landlord and replacing it with and even more used to refrageraand well the answer to both these questions is eats but i look o and there is neck and he is expecting me to say something and there is is bodies or helping him move and they are expecting me to say something i walk up to neck i look him in the eye and i say to him you sweep up real good before you leave cares there is just two many possibilities in this universe carry me explain new york his story was recorded live at a mot story lamming you city you can download the hotspot cast on i tins or wherever you gat your gotta it the beginning if the shall i said i was a septic but after talking to many people about coincidence says including a stamford mathematician hes tat delicate studying them i are not up here agreeing with this one woman i enter yer about her coincide nice she knew her story could probably be explained away with statistics and probability but she said there is just a poetry to things this when they happen there is some kind of beauty in it there is meaning in the noticing of it at all on so also n n n our program was

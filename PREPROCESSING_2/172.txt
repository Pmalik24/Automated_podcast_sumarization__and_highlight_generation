electricity and the trolly boss working and i just felt this sense of election a smile cross my face or something yeld get the pours er gator the air you actually the first time that they took these cookies out on to the table i just i felt happy it had been long since i had even seen them but you mi solos road code you ye be to me do you understand i i had not seen loaves of brad sure i had coffee but still that was the heard to come by and cookies and i had forgot and with that has li and i just felt amazing to have them finally i wat we we yo we t you ben is look woman but to be totally ones i still yearn to go to my place to my home h to day so when to leave how do when it is right to make a decision that is often full of doubt gilt consequences for other people and even afterward sometimes for ever afterward regret and longing and second guesses we have two stories to day with high stakes and complicated choices stay with us act one first do no harm let us start right in with a calm rational person a messing a new reality getting a feel for what it means and deciding what to do meek milk reports media huntsburger has the story she tells about what it is to work at a small rural hospital she is an be u i an a northern high to ho an a place called standpoint an early on she got called down to the emergency room to examine a woman the woman had passed out she was emerging a lot of blood she was miscarrying item to the operating room and i transfused a bunch of blood products and her labs were starting to me o the abnormal and i asked for the lab to get me platelets the nurse supervise sir who was on that night said oh we do not have those and i said oh we we do not we do not have any platelets oh no we do not have those in the blood bank here oh she told me that we could get them from spoken and i was great will lets let us activate that right away and she said oh coquet ah yet they come by taxi but yellow cab tax right and i said really is seriously y what products are are going to be put in a cab and then come to the hospital from spoken which is an hour and half away and when in the winter then shesidya to come by cab most doctors fresh off years of train at fancy urban hospitals might look at an experience this and want a run from m it but for media this was her plan her first choice she grew up in a place standpoint beautiful rural surrounded by mountains she did her first delivery in middle school it was a baby lamb she is to help er dad out during lamming season and all through medschool she was why should not people in rural places get the best care media's some one who generally takes stuff on if it needs doing whenever there is some unpaid committee joined one wants media signs up not an ego way it is more why would not you do that media's husband tents he works at the same hospital he is an e a doctor and he also grew up in a small town they met in medical school and wanted to settle in the place this because they knew rural hospitals desperate leading doctors yes practicing medicine here in standpoint means platelet us arrived by taxi but also media said you really get to know your patients it is nice running into them all over town half on the days people that i know i delighted water the days when your granddaughter coming home when somebody comes up to me and wants in the grocery store and wants to hooka question a fusional discharge that is not also but when a patient comes up to me and wants to show me in a her grandchild who i delivered that is fly delightful media's whole life is in standpoint she invents have raised all three of their kids here recently her parents moved here to but have been talking to amimia for months over the phone and a person not because she loves the place but because she thinks it might in time to me media did not see herself as an abortion care provider she is a general o b g in she sees everyone from teenagers to nine year old she does papers prenatal care rust exams as to is prescribes birth control delivers babies she is got the bullion board to prove en and right now there are lots of stories about pregnant people dealing with the fall of reverses wait and changes in state laws but this story is about their doctors i started calling o b g wings when the supreme quart overturned row because i wanted to know what their dobs or now and how their changing an i started hearing about doctors who were thinking of leading their states because of new laws that criminalize a whole range of common of g want care dah is one of those states it pass some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country no exceptions for the health of a pregnant person no exceptions to save the life of a pregnant person here's how state senator tod lake one of the sponsors of the bill that would soon become law talked about what should happen in the case of for instance a serious pregnancy complication i mi the decisions by silly on a question of sometime post then you are talking about taking a life of you nostril that ways more heavily than since we ha get think you mister termed in just to fall up such as a i guess yes i know the help of the woman's irrelevant yes or and out i would satin ways lest yes then e the wife of the try lots of people had concerns about the laws even the governor who is anti abortion sent a latter to the state senate shine that some parts of these bills would quote in short order be proven both unconstitutional and unwise he signed them into law anyway dagos new laws are also some of the most punitive toward doctors they cover any pregnant that has a duo feudal heartbeat hough in the early stages it is not a heartbeat in a normal sense it is electrical activity in some tissue that will eventually become the heart the sound you here with an ultroson machine it is created by the machine but that counts as far as the laws concerned if a doctor does anything to terminate a pregnancy with a feudal heartbeat they can be charged with a felony and imprisoned for up to five years even if say they have a patient who is miscarrying leading in controllably and they're trying to state their life also there is this phrase an it hose new laws a formative defense what this means is in theory the laws do allow for abortions in the case of rate insist or to save the life of a pregnant person but if a doctor does that they can be arrested and have to prove in court would say report from the police at tasting to rate or somehow proof that their patient would have died and a jury would have to great under idahose new laws it is kind of doctors are assumed guilty instead of assumed innocent until proven guilty it does not sound legal but it is when the abortion band went into a fact after row was over turned media's first thought was not we got ta leave standpoint she was not at that state the stage she was at was let us fight if enough doctors speak out if people l understand the reality they will understand the dangers of these laws and the want a change them media was already on a committee tracking maternal us the state had not had one of those she helped create one she was also heading out the state chapter of the america college of obstetrics and gynecologists cog no one else raise their hand to do it but media did naturally when a law suit was filed against one of the new abortion laws and itohoe media was part of a collision trying to change these laws she knew the lawyer's needed testimony from of g inns lying out specific emergency medical care they would been providing for years that now under the new laws was criminal i think o k while in a reach out to as many of aliens as i can think of and have contact information to and the see if anybody would be welling he are to make a declaration and then i i can have realize i myself have provided warlike this media who had started out trying to find other of g ends to write about their experiences to help change these new laws instead started writing about herself her own medical practice she would never thought of herself in the same category as providers of called elector abortions what happens in abortion clinics she thought of that as a different thing even though she would written the word abortion in her patients medical charts for years the medical term for miss carriages before twenty weeks is spontaneous abortion about one and five pregnancies end this way she treats patient for this all the time ant i abortion rhetoric had actively separated abortion from health care that in a way they have gotten separated in media's had to media signed her declaration and submitted it her written experiences and those of other of g tens it all made a difference in the strictness of the law a small but significant one the day before the trigger laws and itch were about to go into a facts a lateral judge agreed to allow emergency abortion procedures that go through actual emergency rooms for now did that the a big win yes tremendous relief hopeful you know that fell o we somebody is really seeing this with a clear i an rational mind and is well obviously this yetis does not ache sense every other part of the laws still went into effect the very next day and around that time the idea of leaving popped into media's mind for the very first time she popped at rite back out hold up like pass lustrous lure we lech to see even that circumstances and itch are not set in stone things are still changing and moving and let see kind of ware this got sly this is benin b rained in this is the same calculation some of the other doctors have talked to our meeting wait and see but one of the things are all weeding unseen about is who will be the first of g inn put on trial and possibly put in prison for providing health care to one of their patients media back at work had a whole bunch of castoff to sort through in her mind with these laws the new laws to find abortion as the use of any means to intentionally terming a clinically diagnosable pregnancy ectopic pregnancies for example came up all the time in her clinic an ectopic pregnancy means a fertilize a is sitting outside of the uteri s and sometimes has what the law calls a feudal heart beat it is not bible it can be fatal and the longer it sits there the more danger the patient is in what am i supposed to do with a patient this do i need to per the total portion bean i see to wait until she is really sick i cannot act just to protect her health i should be waiting until ism saving her life this is totally opposite of my medical training her medical training was try o stop things before they become life threatening the solution used to be straightforward she would remove ectopic pregnancies with a quick surgical procedure or inject to drag that would end the pregnancy one day media had a patient that their pregnancy test was positive but media could not find a fertilized a in their dares an injection was clearly the best option while the patient was in the exam room media started calling administrators at her hospital asking can i do this she later talk to some lawyers about what she could do in this kind of situation one and sir that i got was that it is probably ninety per cent safe legally what does that me your saying i have a one in ten chance of spending two years in jail with a felony is as out what your telling me right now and what intends sounds pretty risky right i got three kits i mean what that is not reassuring to me it is also not a definite answer it is you know that and then i have anal another lawyer who have been in contact with who stays take care the patient do it you been train to did the care the patient media advised her patient to go to the e are the e are chaotic impersonal and usually more expensive for the patient but that is the only work around she had ta make sure the patient got the charity needed while protecting herself under these new laws media started sending all of her ectopic pregnancies to the car here is another thing media realized about the way the laws are set up even though e a doctors in dah should theoretically be protected from criminal prosecutions a prosecutor could still decide to try and charge for husbandman's anyways and under the law as it stands people can definitely sue doctors including e a doctors for damages it was dawning on media that it was possible that she and tens could pile now be sued by multiple family members of a quote reborn child the father of the reborn child a grand parent of the reborn child a sibling of the reborn child or an ant or uncle of the reborn child when i read this does this mean that the father of a rapist that the sister of rapid that the brother of the rapist can so the physician it absolutely does family members can each file individual separate law suits asking for a minimum of twenty thousand dollars and a have up to four years to filo law suit i back to language of the law stack try damages in an amount not less than twenty thousand dollars just take note instead of having heres the sealing this is the maximum we start with a minimum pay out all of that was on media's mind when another patient came into the clinic she had an ectopic pregnancy that ruptured media put a camera into her patient's abdomen and ism oh my gosh there is we more blood than there was described on the ultreson that this person had sixty minutes ago we have got to move quickly the bleeding could kill her a the weir stop the bleeding was to abort the pregnancy which was never going to be viable anyway an when you do surgery that or it is an emergency an somebody is having ongoing active bleeding that is already high stress and that is her high stress a trained for that i know what to do with that i can handle that then you add in this other we are layer of is her brother can an not understand that this was a not bible pregnancy and that her life was at risk and what about er mom what about her partner what about her sister i do these people understand how serious this condition is or do they only understand that i removed a pregnancy that had a heard bean i do not know how is was to know she start looking at her patient's charge is evidence she might eat en for she wrote down words life threatening and high chance of mortality for some theoretical future laws another case a patient came in to see her for a biopsy of the living other uterus media found herself worrying wait what if she is pregnant the person had mentioned they had not been using contraception and then ism thinking will wait a minute when was her lastmenstral period er definably doing you are pregnancy basket what is the plausibility that there could be a pregnancy that is not detectable yet in a supersuper early stages and in these early stages a detest is not definitive et can still come up his negative if i had at corderford every single time that somebody said there is no way i pregnant not you dot has the posed or pregnancy ten then it be rich if there was any chance that this patient was pregnant a biopsy could inadvertly terminate this patient's potential pregnancy there is pardon that is we should not do anything to day she needs to use a fact contraception for a month and then come back and then i can do this procedure once ism really sure that she is not pregnant but that is also really impractical for this person who is driven hours too come see me and further she has a medical problem that needs attention she is already waited to see me this visit has nothing to do with pregnancy media did not send her back she treated her this is what it means for media to have these laws in her had all the time to have to think of every single person who enters or office as pregnant or possibly pregnant to have that become her constant focus more and more she is finding that what she believes is good care the kind she is obliged to provide under medical out practice laws is indirect conflict with what the new laws say and she knows these laws are in her patient's minds too be cause they asking her like in trouble for this or that is this legal working about that on top of what ever actual medical problem they came tor for in other states there have already been numerous reports about doctors delaying care for pregnant patience or even turning them away because of new laws criminalizing be u i in care some patients have almost died and ended up in the icy you median her husband for months were pinning their hopes on idea who supreme court overturning the states abortion laws that was their bigwig an my on the back of her mind there was this growing nagging feeling will we be able to keep living here if the courts decision does not go our way you ism just agitated as ism describing all of this and you the intensity level is just hi for me and i my friends says well when do you just put this all down and just take a break and ism ism thinking what it was she mean take re hike ta it you ism literally vibrating out of my body i mean that is also a problem that inability to kind of escape this i do not know how to put it down just sort of this walking round and and whether at work or at home and just these deep sizes just feeling there say to it without even in a thinking about it she was having trouble sleeping a first for her laying awake at and thinking about this or that and i think just the tension that your holding in your body or having to think about taking a deep breath because you have been holding your breath all day media invents have had some wild conversations in the last few months they have talked about the possibility that both of them could not have been jail or face multiple lawsuits with potentially massive civil penalties or lose their medical licenses chances ere probably small well also it is impossible to be sure what happens if both of us ere in jail for two years who's raising our kids i man we know ye we have a plan for our kids if that happened what is your plan fancy she did not want to say more about who exactly their kids eleven eight and six years old would go to it was the first time it'd seen her look physically uncomfortable answering a question she kind of first her lips and look her head to know she just could not go there a couple months ago a few things happen that move the idea of leading from the back of media's mine to the front the first took place in a car parked outside the state capital and noisy she was with another of g way they have been talking to the people in the governor's office about expanding medicate average for people who just even birth they were sitting in media's rental car and her friend turned to her and she had told me at that point that she was kind of we sitting between deferent job option job options in another state this was a huge blow to media she would been a key ally in the fight then rite up for that conversation media caught up with another friend a lawyer who would also been fighting these laws media remembers her saying i have not told many people this yet but you of planning to leave ti in the same day and noisy these two people who i respect and admire and trust told me this stay is not a place for me any more and i ism planning mi exit and then the state supreme sort ruling she and her husband since had been waiting for came down amnia was at home and on her day off when it happens i happen to look at my e an all and there was this message from one of the lawyers that jut sit in the subject line supping cart to us an out not got well fallow a later and it want you i just kind of was pannicto what what it wasn't mean and tat ism trying to do the school search nothing comes a and that ism like i go i git taco my kids at my car and i drive to school pick up and then ism waiting a in in you the cars in park and i pall i might e news again to just try to see can i find anything about this and e other people are you thinking to a summary an this and that and ism sobbing right a i to say i of the pestering aright who believes that all three abortion laws a constitutional the court carved out one small exception that topic pregnancies but not miss carriages not deadly fetal anomalies or anything else media broke the news to since she says the first question he asked er as you knows this is this it as this that is a the tipping point was his question to me is this of place that we can continue to live ism practice malison and raise our family what you say ye i think i ism not at the timing point and i i ask back to him our you is this the nail in the coffin for you are are you done and we are not very at right we are not at the tipping point yet do what you are tipping point is no ism ism not ism not sure i obviously this supreme cart decision is it is a big flow and i do not know exactly where that line is of what i can tolerate mince's job in the e are still had some protection that federal court ruling still holds for now allowing emergency abortion procedures that go through actual emergency rooms but everything felt precarious median minced now talk about leaving almost every day sometimes leaving can be and active protest but media feels it would be a retreat he giving in i can save myself but it'd be leaving my patience behind she is worried that if she laughed her clinic could collapse she is one of only four of juiannds and one of the others is thinking about leaving to media says if they did leave first she probably have to leave to if familiar or one of her colleagues does leaves appoint the options for finding of replacement or clique the last time in up j inane left her clinic it took them two years to find another one and that was before profile i do hop already has a severe shortage of doctors one of the worst in the country i was looking at social media and somebody wo as talking about a a person who as completing thar ope human residency and was looking to come the pa if north west and there was all this a we have got an opening washington without n opening or gan without openings an montane and ism hey there is all sorts of openings and i ho and one laughing out loud because i who is gan o be finishing there residency training anteing i definitely want to go stay with the super strict abortion laws they criminalize health care i been i just i we literally laughed out lading that that is awful right i laughing about how ridiculous it is that somebody would choose to come and practise medicine here that is terrible that should be very alarming to my one but i did not i was yous you laugh you do not cry that i do not love know i ya did you post there tuns opening the it to who did better i sure did and i would i mean but then you have i you a the was were boy we git if you are willing to do with the was i will you a i know all the people who are lucking i got you but you are neck in a wan come here y gain i know that i mean if you do wanting om here wo lay tow help you if one is never leave and tennis we ought to go were are you on that inspector know i do not know how to answer them what makes it hard i soft wat ta leave here you know and just an turning in to something more black and what a number scale was an ells hard i mean i that want ta leave but i do not know if i can stay some doctors have decided to leave i talk to two be go fans ant end just left taxes the other tennessee their dobs are different from alias because their high rescobees and their seen some of the most difficult cases they told me they were just media when new abortion laws went to a fact in their estates they also wanted to stay and they also did not know what their tipping point was and wanted to keep treating their patients and each of them described the same kind of moment to me one day they found themselves in a terrible situation with the patient brought on by trying to comply with the new laws one of them had to send a patient to another state in an ambulance it was a five hour ride the patients blood prusshar was rising by the time she got to a hospital her kidneys were starting to fail the other doctor had to turn away a patient pregnant with twins one of the twins was going to die and the doctor needed to intervene to save the others life but he could not because of the laws he does not know what happened to the patient but he knew i need to leave me me she is one of the producers of our show b coming up is the statute of limitations on telling a friend i thought you were away off face we will find out together that is in a minute from chico public radio when our program continues it is this america life ism nancy unlike sitting in for era glass to day show when to leave or if were at a two of two at two the leaving expert the whole idea for this show came from me reading a story by mash guessed a new yorker story mafia is a staffwriter there reports a lot on russia among many other subjects mash grew up in the soviet union then moved to the united states as a tea anger and lives here now the new yorker story was all about leaving about ruffians leaving russia mash was just about to board a plain to russia when russia invaded crane a year ago and almost immediately after landing mash started hearing from people from friends about leaving ism try to think who the first person was i think it was asualiveare o my closest friends mi think the the conversation was we are thinking of leaving we thing om getting to is to georgia there his family in georgia o do you think we should go now were in a couple of months when our sixteen year old gets her for in travel passwords o was a sill going to be viable to leave in a cool months we are they going to close the borders but it still felt almost abstract and then a couple of days later she said we are leaving wednesday and then while mash was at vet's place for their good by gathering another mutual front of ours can by and you a sort of why o feel you fatal whats o was the until to there is always time not an unreasonable question mafia thought at the time that night over night more leaving mash went to the last independent television station in russia to rain and saw a whole scene unfolding staffers at the station had gotten word that the prosecutors office was investigating try rain for quote extremism which meant any one of them could go to jail for years staffers also heard that special forces were coming to search the studios other media outlets had been searched before and people had been rough up staff members who were at the station ran out of the building surhuddled in a pub outside trying to book tickets on their telephones there was this sort of colon responds for people bishcek to took ids grabbing tho i si ashen ere was not it locked it is every night ow they went arching them off at this sort but but yet there o the es there the yet there n an them and a sense of of rush is very adrenaline and very desperate an ten the next day i went to visit other friends and that and i walked in and i realized to this was there good by part pagan and and the friend from the night before the one who had been asking its the point was also there a and he said ism leaving to morrow and that was just unit i mean he looked he was shell shocked because i think tat something had changed inside him that from one day to the new from one day to the next and he was not even he could not possess what had change he knew that change a he knew he was leaving and he was shocked by what he was doing within a week all of mash's friends had left russia all of them and i do not want to say that they running for their lives which is another very important aspect of this of this whole emigration is because people are acutely were that they a that they are not running for their lives that they in fact other people who were running for their lives at that very same time in your can because of the same for e om but a but that there running totuselvage their sense of selves to be able to be in the world it is hard to gauge how many ruffians have left the country in last year tens of thousands hundreds of thousands it is a lot whatever it is people have left for all sorts of presence one reason new laws there were a couple of different laws that they passed am a week after the force invasion began one that made it punishable to call the wore were another was that made it a crime to discredit their armed forces of marsh a that is when tat that is one as wide he know li angel was that you can do that without realizing that what your doing if somebody really wants to that is exactly right right in a way it some more insidious law than than thanking it because calling a more worming the unolitros pop to you no you knot our not suppose tod it but of course tear works much more effectively through laws that are they and that count possibly be uniformly applied there's another reason i wanted to talk to mash in particular about leaving mash is a bit of a leaving expert a sad not just as a reporter but in their own life mash as moved countries three times each time with no idea if they would ever live there again the first time was when mash was fourteen years old and the whole family left this be union to come to america then mash moved back to russia in the nineties they went in nineteen ninety one on reporting assignment bi union was in the final stages of unmaking itself and what was left was the most exciting place on earth to mafia it was russia we making itself mafia also felt something unexpected there they felt at home a profound experience after long away mash spent the next twenty two years living there loved it never wanted to leave and then mafia did leave russia and move back here seeing their friends leave now reminded mafia of just how hard that decision had been to know when to leave it was also about new laws even when they were considering the firsts la against called illjaby oh propaganda to miners it seemed absurd it this was back in twenty twelve and i was i supposed to testify this was still at a time when one one someone me might go and testifying the human rices council and then the person who was organizing the hearing said ye just there is no other can a passim we are not on hold o hearing lisle that is let us let us not draw more attention to it and then of course they passed it and the parliaments are talking about removing children from families and i went to protest and god beaten of and yet it's not it was news right but had never actually been beaten up before i you think you were tired specifically or as as defiling tardiaspacificy a in broad daylight with the police looking on its its a profound experience even if that that sort of thing happens to to other people a even people and and then the pass a law banning a option by people wo ere in same sex relationships or have sidanships of countries were sane sexmarigous land my oldest son is it opted then i was just you know have to leave and that now describes you and your family specifically exactly we put my oldest son on plane and then how was e he was fortune fourteen is the same age mafia was when the family left this be union a whole cycle of leaving and leaving again mafia told me that in the mine of feelings they had in e last year seeing and talking to friends who left russia is a strange kind of relief an e wait you know the world has become kind of mentally more a it makes more sense it were you to to me and to us as as a group that were on the same side of not only the mental border but the but the physical border for years after mafia left while friends stayed mafia sometimes wondered worried did i make the right call by leaving could i have stayed to there was an aging thought of a woe may be it was possible to live there and may be overacted a maybe may they was hysterical about putz any is terrible but how terrible is he and now the lot of thought is just that is that is j that just on his sterile as as as as anyone has ever than a i was deftly not hysterical and know it is was not actually possible to eyeliner and o our people saying that to you as any one saying to you i thought actually were a little off they deep ad now now i now i see what you mean or solely ye yet people have said that a and and it is funny because i even heard it from people who did not actually say to me your crazy years ago but shots that i i thought you were a little but may be overreacting a little but i was wrong am these conversations just seems strange to me to have somebody say that and to i i do not know it seemed sad that is a ye kind i wish you were right i wish i hardly acted exactly am and man that was always my sort of go to phrase i ill be really happy if you prove me wrong ye ye but in it just if id being emotionally honest about it am gets as i dead of course i do not wish i then i don her reacted cause they not of regret it'd have if i doe reacted would be unmanageable it is not i you am full shaman afraid for for for having told you am but there is i yet there and odd sort of emotional peace with having things fallen place i asked macho if they ever think about leaving this country mi she had a few different answers to that my brain book marked this one emit the seen you listens were great for setting down rules to live by and i think one of their rules was a you ere useless in prison or dead but as long as you are to in prisoner were dead and you are not you you're not facing a significant risk of going to prisoner being dead make a difference where you are am an thus a pretty this country is far from our losing the ability to make a difference ye ye i guess i wonder if if you if you have an in on laws changing here i mean it lies that would feel threatening to you on personally i men i think that when a once you have ism a get et once in your life it is always a possibility yet it is even though i ism not actually thinking about leaving the united states it is not it is not a crazy possibility for me it it could happen a i tin personally knows it is it is complicates have kiss here and draw me mi grown a then you become tuna you you start having other kinds of routs am but if for example a and this is not id it is terrible an likely solaria it becomes impossible am to get torment treatment in this country that for me would be a a question of my personal health and i probably actually have to leave but i first heard making this yow i imagined it being about leaving all sorts of places but it is all about the same place home a place you lave if you are lucky you have some choice in the matter in time to think about it mut it is a choice to break your own heart you yet i s no crisis bod brig drop down can sis much a open dato tropabragd every bribe to time

welcome to the superman tonga t as science science back tore r li i and your supermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medium for to day's podcast were going to talk about the parts list of the nervous system now that might sound boring but these are the bits an pieces that together make up everything about your experience of life from what you think about to what you feel what you imagine and what you accomplish from the day you are born until the day you die that parts list is really incredible because it has a history associated with it that really provides a window into all sorts of things engineering warfare religion and philosophy ism going to share with you the parts its that makes up who you are through the lends of some of those other aspects of life and other aspects of the history of the discovery of the nervous system by the end of this podcast i promise you can understand a lot more about how you work and how to apply that knowledge s me me litter but to story tears cut me allot o discussion about the people who made these particular discoveries they'll be a little bit of technical language there is no way to avoid that but at the end you are going to have in hand what would be the equivalent of an entire semester of learning about the nervous system and how you work a few important points before we get started i am not a medical doctor that means i do not proscribe anything ism a professor sometimes it'll profess things in fact i profess a lot of things we are going to talk about some basic functioning o the nervous system parts and et camera but were also go and talk about how to apply that knowledge that said your health care your well being as your responsibilities any time we talk about tools please filter it through that responsibility talk to health care professional this you gan to explore any new tools or practices and on be smart and in your pursuit of these new tools also one emphasize that this podcast and the other things i do on social media are my personal goal of bringing s zero cost of consumer information to the general public it is separate from my role at stamford university in that spirit i really want to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at let it greens is an all in one it i in mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and treason i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which or vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microbial interacts with your man system with your brain to a late mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need end the profiles to support my microbic if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstone calm slash supermen and claim a special offer they willie you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in item en d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stop cam slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fire travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to today's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar of talk many times before on this podcast about the we roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have soda magnesium in potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do cam slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do cam slash superman let us talk about the nervous system the reason i say your nervous system and not your brain is because your brain is actually just one piece of this larger more important thing frankly that we call the nervous system the nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord but also all the connections between your brain and your spinal cord and the organs of your body it also includes very importantly all the connections between your organs back to your spinal cord an brain the way to think about how you function at every level from the moment you are born until the day you die everything you think and remember and feel and imagine is that your nervous system is this continuous loop of communication between the brain spinal cord and body and body spinal cord an brain in fact we really can even separate them its one continuous loop you may have heard of of something call the obvious strip phobias strip is almost one of these impossible figures that no matter which angle you look at it from you cannot tell where t starts and where it ends and that is really how your nervous system is built that is the structure that allows you to for instance deploy a mine cells to release cells that will go kill infection when you are in the presence of infection most people just think about that as a function of the immune system but actually it is your nervous system that tells organs your spleen to release killer cells that go and hunt down those bacterial and viral invaders and en gobble them up if you have a stomach ape for instance sure you feel that in your stomach but it is really your nervous system that is causing the stomach ache the ache aspect of it is a nervous system feature when we want o talk about experience for we want to talk about how to change the cell in any way we really need to think about the nervous system first it is fair to say that the nervous system governs all other biological systems of the body and it is also influence by those other biological systems if we are talking bout the nervous system we need to get a little specific about what we mean it is not just this big loop of wires in fact there is a interesting story about that because at the turn of the of eighteen hundreds to nineteen hundreds it actually was believed that our nervous system was just one giant cell but two guys a names are not superimportant but o unfairness to their important discovery remain coal a standard chomelogulogy and italic guy figured out how to label or stain the nervous system in a way that revealed omagodnists were actually made up of trillions of these little cells nerve cells that are called morons that is what a neon is is just a nerve cell they also saw that those nerve cells were not touching one another there actually separated by little gaps and those little gaps you may have heard of before they are called synapses the synapses are where the chemicals from under on are kind of spit out are vomited into and then the the next nerve cell detects those chemicals and then passes electricity down its length to the next nerve cell and forth really the way to think about your body and your thoughts in your mind is that you are a flow of electricity e there is nothing mystical about this you're a flow of electricity between these different nerve cells and depending on which nerve cells are active you might be lifting your arm or lowering your arm you might be seeing something and perceiving that its read or you might be seen something in perceiving that its green all depending on which nerve cells are electrically active at a given moment ut the example of perceiving red or perceiving green as a particularly good example because often are experience of the world makes it seem as if these out these things that are happening outside us are actually happening inside us but the language of the nervous system is just electricity it is just a a morse code of some sort ere the syllable or and words and consonance and vowels of language the just depends on how their assembled what order and that brings us to the the issue of how the nervous system works the way to think about how the nervous system works is that our experiences our memories everything is sort the keys on a piano being played in a particular order right if i play the keys on a piano in a particular order and with a particular intensity that is a given song we could make that analogous to a given experience it is not really that the key a sharp or e flat is a the sing it is just one component of the song when you hear that for instance a there is a brain area called the hippocampus which there is that is involved in memory well it it is involved in memory but it is not that memories are stored there as a you know sentences there stored there as patterns of electricity in neurons that when repeated give you the sense that you're experiencing the thing again in fact de favor the sense that what your experiencing is familiar and something that you have experience previously is merely that the neurons that were active in one circumstance are now becoming active in the same circumstance again and it is really just hearing the same song may be a not played on a piano but next time on the classical guitar there is something similar about that song eventhough it is being played on two different instruments i think it is important that people understand the parts of their nervous system and that it include much more than just the brain and that there are these things neurons an synapses but really that it is the electrical activity of these neurons that dictates are experience if the early nineteen hundreds were when these neurons were discovered certainly a lot has happened since then and in that time between the early nineteen hundreds and now there some important events that actually happened in history that give us insight or gave us insight into how the nervous system works one of the more surprising ones was actually warfare as o most everybody knows in warfare people get shot and people often die but many people get shot and they do not die and in world were one there were some changes in artillery in bullets that made for situation where bullets would enter the body an brain at very discreet locations and would go out the other side of the body or brain and also make a very small hole at that exit location and in doing produced a lot of naturally occurring lesions of the nervous system now you say o k who how does that relate to hero science well unlike previous years where a lot of the artillery would create these big sort of a holes as as the bullets would would blow out of the brain or body i now the is rather gruesome when the holes were very discreet they entered at one point and left at another point they would take out or destroy very d street bits of nerd tissue of the nervous system people were coming back from war with holes in their brain and in other parts of their nervous system that were limited to very specific locations in addition to that there was some advancement in the cleaning of wounds that happened many more people were were surviving what this meant was that neurologists now had a collection of patients that would come back and they would have holes in very specific locations of their brain and they would say things well i can recognize faces but i cannot recognize who those faces belong to i know it is a face but i do not know who belongs to and after that person eventually died the neurologist would figure out ah have had ten patients that all told me that they could not recognize faces and they all had these bullet holes that went through a particular region of the brain and that is how we know a lot about how particular brain regions the hippocampus work in fact some of the were a amazing examples of this where were people would come back and they o for instance would speak in complete gibberish they would whereas previously they could speak normally and even though they were speaking complete gibberish they could understand language perfectly that is how we know that speech and language are actually control by separate portions of the nervous system and there many examples that people that a could not a recognize the faces of famous people or am and that action brings us to an interesting example in modern times many many years later in the a early two thousands there was ashy paper that was publish in the journal nature excellent journal showing that in a human being a perfectly healthy human being there was a neuron that would become active electrically active only when the person viewed the picture of decipher piston the actress literally a neuron that represented genip piston call gender piston cells nor scientist know aby these decipher piston cells if you can recognize sniper piston's face you have decipher piston neurons and presume we also of neurons that can recognize the faces of other famous and infamous people that indicates that our brain is really a map of our experience a we come into the world and our brain has a kind of bias towards learning particular kinds of things it is ready to receive information and learn that information but the brain is really a map of experience let us talk about what experience really is what does it mean for your brain to work well i think it is fair to say that the nervous system really does five things maybe six the first one is sensation this is important to understand for any and all of you that want to change your nervous system or to apply tools to make your nervous system work better sensation is a non negotiable element of your nervous system you have neurons in your eye that perceive certain colors of light and certain directions of movement you have neurons in your skin that perceive particular kinds of t oh light touch or firm touch or painful touch you have neurons in your ears that perceive certain sounds your entire experience of life is filtered by these what we call sensory receptors if you want to know at the names this always raises an interesting question people ask will is there much more out there is that a lot more happening in the world that ism not experiencing or that humans are not experiencing and the answer courses yes there many species on this planet that are perceiving things that we will never perceive unless we apply technology h best example i could think of on of the top of my head would be something infer red vision there are snakes out there pit vipers and forth that nonsense heat omissions from other animals they do not actually see their shape they sense their heat shape and their heat omissions humans cannot do that unless of course they put on inferegoggles or something the would allow them to detect those heat omissions there are turtles and certain species of birds that migrate long distances that can detect magnetic fields because they have neurons again it is the nervous system that allows them to do this they have neurons in their nose and in their head that allow them to migrate along magnetic fields in order to as amazing as the sounds go from one particular location in the ocean thousands of miles away to all aggregate on one particular beach at a particular time of year that they can mate lay eggs and then wander back off into the see to die and the their young will eventually hatch those little cuttle turtles will shuffle to the ocean swim off and go to the exact same thing they do not do migrate that distance by vision they do not do it by smell they do it by sensing magnetic fields and many other species do these incredible things we do not humans are not magnetic sensing organisms we cannot do that because we do not have receptors that sense magnetic fields there are some data that may be some humans nonsense magnetic fields but you should very skeptical of anyone that is a convince that they can do that with any degree of robustness or accuracy because even the people that can do this are not necessarily aware that they can maybe a topic for a future podcast we have sensation then we have perception perception is our ability to take what were sensing and focus on it and make sense of it to explore it to remember it really perceptions are just whichever sensations we happen to be paying attention to at any moment and you can do this right now you can experience perception in the difference between perception and sensation very easily if for instance i tell you to pay attention to the contact of your feet the bottoms of your feet with whatever surface they happen be in contact with maybe its shoes maybe it is the floor your feet are up maybe it is air the moment you place your what we call the spotlight of attention or the spotlight of perception on your feet you are now perceiving what was happening there what was being sensed there the sensation was happening all along however while sensation is not negotiable you cannot change your receptors unless you a adopt some new technology perception is under the control of your attention and the way to think about attention is it is a spotlight except it is not one spotlight you actually have too attentional spotlights any one that tells you you cannot mufti task tell them the wrong and if they disagree with you tell them to contact me because in old world primates of which humans are we are able to do what is called covert attention we can place a spotlight of attention on something for instance something we are reading or looking at or some one that were listening to and we can place a second spotlight of attention on something we are eating and how it tastes or our child running around in the room or my dog you can split your attention into to locations but of course you can also bring your attention that is your perception to one particular location you can dilate your attention kind making a spotlight more diffuse or you can make it more concentrated this is very important to understand if you arguing to think about tools to improve your nervous system whether not that tool is in the form of a chemical that you decide to take may be a supplement to increase some chemical in your brain if that is a your choice or a brain machine device or you are going to try and learn something better by a engaging in some focus or motivated pursuit for some period of time each day at mention is something that is absolutely under your control in particular when you are rested and we will get back to this but when you are rested and we will define rest very clearly you are able to direct your attention in very deliberate ways and that is because we have something in our nervous system which is sorter a too way street and that too way street is a communication between the aspects of our nervous system that are reflective and the aspects of our nervous system that are deliberate we all know what it is to be reflective you go through life your walking if you already know how to walk you do not think about your walking you just walk and that is because the nervous system wants to pass off as much as it can to reflective action that is called bottom up processing it rely joust means that information is flowing in through your senses regardless of what you are perceiving that information is flowing up and its directing your activity but at any moment for instance let us say a car screeches in front of you around the corner and you suddenly pas you are now moving into deliberate action you would start looking around in a very deliberate way the nervous system can be reflective in its action or it can be deliberate it if reflect give actiontends to be what we call bottom up deliberate action and deliberate perceptions and deliberate thoughts are topped down they require some effort and some focus but that is the point you can decide to focus your attention and energy on anything you want you can decide to focus your behavior in any way you want but it will always feel it require some effort and some strain whereas when your reflective mod just walking and talking and eating and doing your thing it is can a feel very easy and that is because your nervous system basically wired up to be able to do most things easily without much metabolic to man without consuming much energy but the moment you try and do something very specific it is going to you are going to feel a sort of mental friction it is con to be challenging we have got sensations perceptions and then we have got things that we call feelings slash emotions and these get complicated because almost all of us i would hope all of us are familiar with things happiness and sadness or border or frustration scientists argue crazy hero scientist and psychologists and philosophers for that matter are you crazy about what these are and how they work certainly emotions and feelings are the product of the nervous system they involve the activity of grants but as i mention earlier neurons are electrically active but they also release chemicals and there is a certain category of chemicals that has a very profound influence on our emotional states they are called neromodulators and those neromodulators have names that probably you have heard of before things dopamine and serotonin and a setocoline apineferan neuromodulators are really interesting because they buy us which neurons are likely to be active and which ones are likely to be inactive a simple way to think about nurmodulators is they are sort of playlets that you would have on on any kind of device where you can play particular categories of music for instance dopamine which is often discussed as the molecule of reward or joy it's involved in reward and it does tend to create a sort of upbeat mood in when released in appropriate amounts in the brain but the reason it does that is because it make certain neurons and nerneural circuits as we call them more active and others less active chase ceratonan for instance is a molecule that when released tends to make us feel really good with what we have our sort of internal landscape and the resources that we have where as dopamine more than being a molecule of reward is really moramolecule of motivation toward things that are outside us an that we want to pursue and we can look at healthy conditions or situations being in pursuit of a goal where every time we accomplish something in root to that goal a little bit of dopamine is released and we feel more motivation that happens ow we can all look at the extreme example of something mania where somebody is yo relentlessly in pursuit of external things money and relationships that their sort of in this delusional state of thinking that they have the resources that they need in order to pursue all these things when in fact they do not these normodulators can exist in normal levels low levels high levels and that actually gives us a window into a very important aspect of nor science history that all of us are impacted by to day which is the discovery of anti depresses and called antipsychotics in the nineteen fifty sixties and seventies it was discover that there are compounds chemicals that can increase or decrease serotonin that can increase or decrease dopamine and that led to the development of most of what we call antidepressants now the trick here or the problem is that most of these drugs especially in the nineteen fifties and sixties they would reduce serotonin but they would also reduce dopamine or they would increase serotonin but they would also increase some other noromodulator or chemical and that is because all these chemical systems in the body but the normodulators in particular have a lot of receptors now these are different than the receptors were talk about earlier the receptors on talking about now are sort parking spots where dopamine is released and if it attached to a receptor say on the heart it might make the heart beat faster because there is a certain kind of recapture on the heart whereas if dopamine is released and goes and attached to muscle it might have a completely different effect on muscle and in fact it does different receptors on different organs of the body are the ways that these noromodulators can have all these different effects on different aspects of or biology this is a most salient in the example of some of the antidepressants that have a sexual side effects or that blunt appetite or that blunt motivation in if you many of these which increase serotonin can be very beneficial for people it can elevate their mood it can make them feel better but they also at if there the doses are too high or if that particular drug is in right for somebody that person experiences challenges with motivation or appetite or libido because serotonin is binding to receptors in the areas the brain that control those other things as well we talked about sensation we take about perception when we talk about feelings we have to consider these neouromodulators and we have to consider also that feelings and emotions are contextual in some cultures showing a lot of joy or lot of sadness is entirely appropriate in other cultures it is considered inappropriate i do not think it is fair to say that there is a sadness circuit or area of the brain or a happiness circuit or area of the brain however it is fair to say that certain chemicals and certain brain circuits tend to be active when we are in motivated states tend to be active when we are n non motivated lazy states tend to be active when we are focus and tend to be active when we are not focus i wont to emphasize also that emotions are something that we generally feel are not under our control we feel the kind of guise up within us and they just con happen to uts and that is because they are somewhat reflective we do not really set out with a deliberate thought to be happier deliberate thought to be sad we tend to experience them in kind of a passive reflective way and that brings us to the next thing which are thoughts thoughts are really interesting because in many ways they're perceptions except that they draw on not just what is happening in the present but also things we remember from the past and things that we anticipate about the future the other thing about thoughts that is really interesting is that thoughts can be both reflective they can just be occurring all the time sort a pop up windows on an poorly filtered web browser or they can be deliberate we can decide to have a thought infant right now you could decide to have a thought just you would decide to write something out on a piece of paper you cud decide that you are listening to a pod cast that you are in a particular location you not just paying attention to what is happening you are directing your thought process and a lot of people do not understand or at least appreciate that the thought patterns and the nerd circuits that underlie thoughts can actually be controlled in this deliberate way and then finally there are actions actions are behaviors are perhaps the most important aspect to our nervous system because first of all our behaviors are actually the only thing that are going to create any fossil record of our existence after we die the nervous system deteriorates are skeleton will remain but it is you know in the moment of of experiencing something very joyful or something very sad it can feel all encompassing that we actually think that it has some meaning beyond that moment but actually for humans and i think for all species the sensations the perceptions and the thoughts and the feelings that we have in our life span none of that is actually carried forward except the ones that we take and we convert into actions such as writing actions such as words actions such as engineering new things and the fossil record of our species and of each one of us is really through action and that in part is why much of our nervous system is devoted to converting sensation perception feelings and thoughts into actions in fact the great nor a scientists are physiologist sharrington one o no about prize for his work in mapping some of the circuitry the connections between nervouselves that give rise to movement and he said movement is the final common path the other way to think about it is that one of the reasons that or central nervous system our brain and spinal cord include dyestuff in our skull but also connect heavily to the body is because most everything that we experience including our thoughts and feelings was really design to either impact our behavior or not and the fact that thoughts allow us to reach into the past and anticipate the future and not just experience what is happening in the moment gave rise to an incredible capacity for us to engage in behaviors that are not just for the moment there based somethings that we know from the past and that we would to see in the future and this aspect our nervous system of creating movement occurs through some very simple pathways an the reflective pathway basically includes areas of the brainstorm we call central pattern generators when you walk provided you already know how to walk you are basically walking because you have these central pattern generates groups of neurons that generate right footlight foot rightmost left foot kind of movement however when you decide to move in a particular deliberate way that requires a little more attention you start to engage areas of your brain for top down processing where your forebrain works from the top down to control those central pattern generator that may be its right foot right foot left foot right foot right foot left foot if may be your weighting along some rocks or something in you have to engage in that kind of movement movement is just thoughts can be either reflective or deliberate and when we talk about deliberate i want to be very specific about how your brain works in the deliberate way because it give gives rise to a very important feature the nervous system that were no talk about next which is your ability to change your nervous system and what i to center on for a second is this notion of what does it mean for the nervous system to do something deliberately well when you do something deliberately you pay attention you are bringing your perception to an analysis of three things duration how long something is going to take or should be done path what you should be doing an outcome if you do something for a given length of time what is can a happen now the you are walking down the street or your eating or you just talking reflectively you are not doing this what i call deep o duration path outcome type of deliberate function in your brain and nervous system but the moment you decide to learn something or to resist speaking or to speak up when you would rather be quiet any time your deliberately forcing yourself over a threshold your engaging these brain circuits and these nervous system circuits that suddenly make it feel as if something is challenging something has changed what is changed what is change is that when you engage in this duration path and outcome type of on thinking or behavior or way of being you start to recruit these neuromodulators that are released for n particularareas of your brain and also it turns out from your body and they start hewing to your nervous system something is different something is different now about what ism doing something is different about what ism feeling let us let us give a an example where perhaps somebody says something that is triggering to you you do not it and you should not respond you feel i should not respond should not respondision't respondingyou are actively suppressing your behavior through top down processing your forebrain is actually preventing you from saying the thing that you should not say or that maybe you should wait to say or say in a different form this feels agitation and stress because you are actually suppressing a circuit we actually can see examples of what happens when you are not doing this well a some of the examples a come from children if you look at young children they do not have the forebrain circuitry to engage in this top down processing until they reach age now twenty two even twenty five but in young children you see this in a really robust way you will see that will be rocking back and forth at s hard for them to sit still because those central pattern generators are constantly going in the background whereas adults can sit still a kid sees a piece of candy that it wanton which just reach out and grab it whereas an adult probably would ask if they could have a piece or wait until they were offered a piece in most cases people that have damage to the certain areas of the front lobes do not have this kind of restriction though es blurt things out they will just say things we all know people this impulsivity is a lack of top down control a lack of lowdown processing the other thing that will turn off the forebrain and make it harder to lowdown processing is a couple of of drinks containing alcohol will the the removal of inhibition is actually a removal of curl inhibition of nerve sell suppressing the activity of the of other nerve cells and when you look at people that have damage to their front lobes or you look at puppies or you look at young children everything's a stimulus everything is a potential interaction for them and they have a very hard time restricting their behavior in their speech a lot of the motor system is design to just work in a reflective way and then when we decide we want to learn something or do something or not do something we have to engage in this top down restriction and it feels agitation because it is accompanied by the release of a nauromodulator called nor a anefferon which in the body we call a adrenaline and it actually makes us feel agitated for those of you that are trying to learn something new or to learn to suppress your responses or be more deliberate in careful in your responses that is going to feel challenging for a particular reason it is feel challenging because the chemicals in your body that are released in association with that effort are design to make you feel kind of agitated that low level tremor that sometimes people feel when they are really really angry is actually a chemically induced low level tremor and it is the what i call limbic friction there is an area of your brain that is involved in our more p primitive relax of responses call the limbic system and the frontal quorate is in a friction it is in a tug o war with that system all the time unless of course you have damage to the frontal lob or you have had too much to drink or something which case you tend tot say and do whatever and this is really important to understand because if you want understand neral plasticity you want understand how to have your behavior how to shape your thinking how to change how you are able to perform in any context the most important thing to understand is that it requires top down plasticity it requires this feeling of agitation in fact i would say that agitation and strain is the entry point to neral plasticity let us take a look at what nerd plasticity is let us explore it not as the way it is normally talked about in a modern culture as a neral plasticity plasticity is great but what exactly do people mean plasticity itself is just a process by which servants can change their connections in the way they work that you you can go from things being very challenging and deliberate requiring a lot of effort an strain to them being reflexive and typically when we her about plasticity were thing about positive or what i call adaptive plasticity a lot of plasticity can be induced for instance by brain damage but that is generally not the kind of plasticity that we want when i say plasticity unless i say otherwise i mean adaptive plasticity and in particular most of the neral plasticity that people want is self directed plasticity because if there is one truism to nerd plasticity it is that from birth until about age twenty five the brain is incredibly plastic kids are learning all sorts of things but they can learn it passively they do not have to work too hard or focus too hard all though focus helps to learn new things acquire new languages acquire new skills but if you are an adult and you want a change your nerd circuitry at the level of emotions or behavior or thoughts or anything really you absolutely need to ask too important questions one what particular aspect of my nervous system in my trying to change meaning am i trying to change my emotions or my perceptions my sensations and which ones are available for me to change and then the second question is how are you going to go about that what is the structure of a regimen to engage neral plasticity and it turns out that the answer to that second question is governed by how awake or how sleepy we are let us talk about that next nerd plasticity is the ability for these connections in the brain and body to change in response to experience and what incredible about the human nervous system in particular is that we can direct our own nerd changes we can decide that we want it change our brain in other words our brain can change itself and our nervous system can change itself and the same cannot be said for other organs of the body even though our other organs of the body have some ability to change they cannot direct it they cannot think can decide oh your got does not say oh i i want to be able to digest spicy foods better i a rearrange the connections to be able to do that whereas your brain can decide that you want o learn a language or you want to be less emotionally reactive or more emotionally engaged and you can undergo a series of steps that will allow your brain to make those changes that eventually becomes reflective for you to do that which is absolutely incredible for a long time it was thought that nerd plasticity was the unique gift of young animals in humans that it could only occur when were young and in fact the young brain is incredibly plastic children can learn three languages without an accent reflectively whereas adults it is very challenging it takes a lot more effort and strain a lot more of that duration path outcome kind of thinking in order to achieve those plastic changes we now know however that the adult brain can change in response to experience bell prizes were given for a the understanding that the young brain can change very dramatically i think one of the most extreme examples would be of for people that are blunt born blind from birth they use the area of their brain that normally would be used for visualizing objects in colors and things outside of them for brail reading in brain imaging studies it's been shown that people who are blind from birth when they brail read the area the brain that would normally a light up a if you will to for vision lights up for brail reading that real estate is replicated for an entirely different function if some one is made blind in adulthood it is unlikely that their entire visual brain will be taken over by the areas of the brain their responsible for touch however there some evidence that areas of the brain than revolved in hearing and touch can can a migrate into that area and there is a lot of interests now and try to figure out how more plasticity can be in ducked in adulthood more positive plasticity and in order understand that process we really have to understand something that might at first seem totally divorced from nerd plasticity but actually lies at the center of nerd plastic and for any of you that are interested in changing your nervous system that something that you want can go from being very hard or seem almost impossible and out of reach to being very reflective this is in especially important to pay attention to plasticity in the adult human nervous system is gaited meaning it is controlled by neuromogulators these thingsthat we talked about earlier dopamine ceretonan and one in particular r call the seat of coming or what open up plasticity they literally unveil plasticity and allow brief periods of time in which whatever information whatever thing were sensing or perceiving or thinking whatever emotions we feel and literally be mapped in the brain such that later it will become much easier for us to experience and feel that thing this has a backside and a positive side the backside is trashy very easy to get neural plasticity as an adult through dramatic or terrible or challenging experiences but the important question is to say why is that and the reason that is the case is because when something very bad happens there is the release of two sets of nurmodulators in the brain epinephrin which tends to make us feel art an agitated which is associate with mots bad circumstances and a redo calling which tends to create a even more intense and focused perceptional spotlight remember earlier we were talking about perception and how it is come a spotlight a redo calling makes that light particularly bright and particularly restricted to one region of our experience and it does that by making certain neurons in our brain and and body active much more than all the rest a set ogling a sorter a highlight or marker upon which neural plasticity then comes in later and says weight which neurons were active in this particularly on alerting phase of whatever yon day or night whenever this thing happen to happen the way it works as this you can think of epineferon as creating this alertness in this kind of unbelievable level of increased attention compared to what your experiencing before and you can think of asedocoaling as being the molecule that highlights whatever it happens during that period of heighten alertness just to be clearing its epinephrin crates the alertness that is coming from a subset of euros in the brainstorm if your interested and a redo coaling coming from an area the forebrain is tagging or marking the neurons that are particularly active during this heighten level of alertness now that marks the cells the neurons and the synapses for strengthening for becoming more likely to be active in the future even without us thinking about it of in bad circumstances this all happens without us having to do much when we want something to happen however we want learn a new language we want to learn a new skill we want to become more motivated what do we know for certain we know that that process of getting neural plasticity that we have more focus more motivation absolutely requires the release of epinephrin we have to have alertness in order to have focus and we have to have focus in order to direct those plastic changes to particular parts of our nervous system this has immense implications in thinking about the various tools whether not those are chemical tools or machine tools or just self induced regimens of how long or how intensely you are going to focus in order to get nerd plasticity but there is another side to it the dirty secret of nerd plasticity is that no nerd plasticity occurs during the thing you are trying to learn during the terrible event during the great event during the thing that your really trying to shape and learn nothing is actually changing between the neurons that is going to last all the nerd plasticity the strengthening of the synapses the addition in some cases of new nerve cells or at least connections between nerve cells all of that occurs at a very different phase of life which is when we are in sleep and non sleep deep rest and nerd plasticity which is the kind of wholly grail of human experience of now this is the new year and everyone is thinking new year's resolutions and right now perhaps everything's organized and people are highly motivated but what happens in march or able or may well that all depends on how much attention and focus one con continually bring to whatever it is their trying ta learn much that agitation and a feeling of strain are actually required for this process of nerd plasticity to get triggered but the actual rewiring occurs during periods of sleep and non sleep deep rest s a study published last year that is particularly relevant here that i want a share was not done by my laboratory that showed that twenty minutes of deep rest this is not deep sleep but essentially doing something very hard and very intend and then taking twenty minutes afterward immediately afterwards to deliberately turn off the deliberate focused thinking and engagement actually celebrated nerd plasticity there is another study that is just incredible and organ to go into this in a a future episode of the podcast not too long from now that showed that if people are learning a particular skill it could be a language skill or a motor skill and they hear a tone just playing in the background a the tone is playing periodically through background just a bell in deep sleep if that bell is played learning is much faster for the thing that they were learning while they were awake it somehow use the nervous system in sleep used even to have to be in dreaming that something that happened in are the waking phase was the specially important much that that bell is sort of a pavalovian cue it is over reminder to the sleeping brain oh you need to remember what it is that you were learning at that particular time of day and the learning rates and the rates of of retention meaning how much people can remember from the thing they learn are significantly higher under those conditions ism going talk about how to apply all this knowledge in a little bit more in this podcast episode but also in future episodes but it really speaks to the really key importance of sleep and focus these two opposite ends of our attentional state when we are in sleep these depends duration path and outcome analysis are impossible we just cannot do that we are only in relation to what is happening inside of us sleep is key also key our periods of non sleep deep rest where we are turning off our analysis of duration path and outcome in particular for the thing that we were just trying to learn and we are in this kind of o liminal state where our attention is kind of drifting all over turns out that is very important for the consolidation for the changes between the nerve cells that will allow what we were trying to learn to go from being deliberate and hard and stressful and a strain to easy and reflexive this also points to how different people including many modern clinicians are thinking about how to prevent bad circumstances dramas from routing their way into our nervous system permanently it says that we might want inter fear with certain aspects of brain states that are away from the bad thing that happen that happy the brain states that happen the next day or the next month or the next year and also i want o be a what i want to make sure that i pay attention of the fact that for many of you you're thinkingabout neral plasticity not just in changing your nervous system to add something new but to also get rid of things that you do not right that you want of forget bad experiences or at least remove the emotional contingency of a bad relationship or a bad relationship to some thing or some person or some event learning to fear certain things less to eliminate phobia to race a drama the memories themselves do not get traced i am sorry to say that the memories do not themselves get a race but the emotional load of memories can be reduced and their number of different ways that that can happen but they all require this thing that were call calling nerlplasticity we can have a large number of discussions about nerd plasticity an depth but the most important thing to understand is that it is indeed a toophased process what governs the transition between alert and focused and these deep dressed and deep sleep states is a system in our brain embody a certain aspect of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system and it is immensely important to understand how this autonomic nervous system works it has names the sympathetic nervous system an parts sympathetic nervous system which frankly are complicated names because there obit is leading sympathetic is the one that associate with more alertness para sympathetic is the one that associate with more calmness and it gets really misleading because the sympathetic nervous system sounds sympathy and then people think it is relate to calm isn't a called the elertnous system and the calmness system because even though a sympathetic imparisympathetic are sometimes use people really get confused the a the to think about the autonomic nervous system and the reason it is important for every aspect of your life but in particular for neral plasticity and engaging in these focus states and than these refocus states is that it work sort of a sea saw every twenty four hours we are all familiar with the fact that when we wake up in the morning we might be a little bit groggy but then generally were more alert and than as evening comes around we tend to become a little more relaxed and sleep an eventually at some point at night we go to sleep we go from alert to deeply calm and as we do that we go from an ability to engage in these very focus duration path outcome types of analysis to states in sleep that are completely divorce from duration path and outcome in which everything is completely random and untethered in terms of our sensations perceptions and feelings and forth every twenty four hours we have a phase of our day that is optimal for thinking and focusing and learning and nerd plasticity and doing all sorts of things we have energy as well and in another phase of our day were tired and we have no ability to focus we have no ability to engage in duration path outcome types of analysis and it is interesting that both phases are important for shaping our nervous system in the ways that we want if we want to engage mineral plasticity and we want to get the most of ut out of our nervous system we each have to master that both the transition between wakefulness and sleep and thetransition between sleep and e wakefulness now much has been made of the importance of sleep and it is critically important for wound healing for learning as i just mentioned for consolidating learning for all aspects of our mine system it is the one period of time in which we are not doing these duration path and outcomes types of analysis and it is critically important to all aspects of our oath including our longevity much less has been made however of how to get better at sleeping how to get better at the process that involves falling a sleep staying of sleep and accessing these states of mind embody that involve total paralysis must we will don this be racial paralyze during much of your sleep s that you cannot act out your dreams presumably but also where your brain is in a total ideal state where it is not controlling anything it is just left to kind of free run and there are certain things that we can all do in order to master that transition in order to get better at sleeping and it involves much more than just how much we sleep we are all being told of course that we need to sleep more but there is also the issue of sleep quality accessing those deep states of non d to thinking accessing the right timing of sleep not a lot has been discussed publicly as far as ism aware of when to time your sleep i think we all can appreciate that sleeping for half an hour throughout the day om that you get a total of eight hours of sleep every twenty four hour cycle is probably very different and not optimal compared to a solid block of eight hours of s sleep although there are people that have tried this i think of been written about in various books not many people can stick to that schedule incidentally i thing it is called the supermen schedule not to be confused with the supermen schedule because first of all my schedule does not look anything that and second of all i would never attempt such a sleeping regime the other thing that is really important understand is that we have not explored as a culture the rhythms that occur in our waking states much has been focus on the value of sleep in the importance of sleep which is great but i do not think that most people are paying attention to what happening in their waking states and when their brain is optimized for focus when their brain is optimized for these depends these duration path outcome types of engagements for learning and for changing and when their brain is probably better suited for more reflective thinking an behaviors and it turns out that there is a vast amount of scientific data which points to the existence of what are called all radian rhythms may have heard a circadian rhythms circadian means circa about a day as twenty four hour rhythms cause the earth spins once every then twenty four hours all radian rhythms occur throughout the day in and they require less time their shorter the most important radian rhythm for sake of this discussion is the ninety minute rhythm that we are going through all the time in are our ability to attend in focus and in sleep we are our sleep is broken up into ninety minutes segments early in the night we have more phase one and face to lighter sleep and then we going to our deeper face tree in face for sleep and then we return to face one to three for all night you are going through these altradian rhythms of stage one to three for one to three for its repeating most people perhaps know that may be they do not but when you wake up in the morning these altradean rhythms continue and it turns out that we are optimized for focus and attention within these ninety minute cycles that at the beginning of one of these ninety minute cycles maybe sit down to learn something new or to engage in some new challenging behavior for the first five or ten minutes of one of those cycles it is well known that the brain and the neral circus and the neromodulators are not going to be optimally tune to whatever it is your trying to do but as you drop deeper into that ninety minute cycle your ability to focus and to engage in this deep process and to direcneral plasticity an to learn is actually much greater and then you eventually pop out of the at the end of the ninety minute cycle these cycles are occurring in sleep and the cycles are occurring in wakefulness and all of those are governed by this seesaw of alertness to calmness that we call the autonomic nervous system f you want to master in control your nervous system regardless of what tool you reach to whether not a a pharmacologic tool or whether not as a behavioral tool or whether or not it is a brain machine interface tool it is vitally important to understand that your entire existence is occurring in these ninety minute cycles whether not your sleep or awake and you really need to learn how to wedge into those ninety minute cycles and for instance it would be completely crazy and counter productive to try in just learn information while in deep sleep by listening to that information cause you are not able to access it it would be perfectly good however to engage in a focus bout of learning each day and now we know how long that focus about of learning should be it should be at least one ninety minute cycle and the expectation should be that the early phase of that cycle is going to be challenging it is gin to heart it is nock in a feel natural its nock in a feel flow but that you can learn and the circuits of your brain that involved in focus in motivation can learn to drop in to a mode of more focus get more neral plasticity in other words by engaging these altradian cycles at the appropriate times of day for instance some people are very good learners early in the day and not good in the afternoon you can start to explore this process even without any information about the underlying hero chemicals by simply pain attention not just to when you go to sleep and when you wake up each morning how deep or how shallow your sleep felt you subjectively but also throughout the day when your brain tends to be most anxious because it turns out that has a coronet related to perception that we will talk about you can ask yourself when you most focus when you least anxious when you feel most motivated when you feel most least motivated by understanding how the different aspects of your perception sensation feeling thought and actions tend to want to be engaged or not want to be engaged you develop a very good window into what is going to be required to shift your ability to focus or shift your ability to engage in creative type thinking at different times of day should you choose and that is where were heading going forward it all starts with mastering this sea saw that is the autonomic nervous system that at a course level is a transition between wakefulness and sleep but at a finer level and just as important are the various cycles these all trading ninety minute cycles that govern our life all the time twenty four hours a day every day of our life and we are going to talk about how you can take control the autonomic nervous system that you can better access neral plasticity better access sleep even take advantage of the phase that is the transition between sleep and waking to access things creativity and forth all based on studies the have been published over the last hundred years mainly within e last ten years and some that are very very new and that point to the use of specific tools that will allow you to get the most out of your nervous system to day we covered a lot of information if was sort of a whirlwind tour of everything from neurons and synapses to nerd plasticity in the autonomic nervous system we will revisit a lot of these themes going for and if all of that did not sink in in one past a please do not worry we will a come back to these themes over and over again i wanted to equip you with a language that were all developing a kind of common base set of information going forward and i hope the information is valuable to you in your thinking about what is working well for you and is what is working less well and what is been exceedingly challenging what is been easy for you in terms of your pursuit of particular behaviors or emotional states where your challenges ore the challenges of people that might reside as promised in our welcome video the formed of the humeral lab podcast is to dive deep into individual topics for an entire month at a time i the entire month of canary we are going to explore this incredible state that is sleep and a related state which is non sleep deep rest and what they do for things learning resetting our emotional capacity and runs probably familiar with the fact one were sleep deprived were much less good at dealing with life circumstances were more emotionally labile why is that how is that but most importantly origin to talk about how to get better at sleeping and how to access better sleep even when your sleep timing or duration is compromised we are also going to talk about the data that support this very interesting state called non sleep deep rest where one is neither sleep nor awake but it turns out one can recover some of the naromogulators and more importantly the processes involved in sensation perception feeling thought and action it is sure to be a very rich discussion back and forth where ism answering your questions and providing tools and ism certain you're also going to learn a lot of information about our science and what makes up this incredible phase of your life where you think you are not conscious but your actually resetting and renewing yourself in

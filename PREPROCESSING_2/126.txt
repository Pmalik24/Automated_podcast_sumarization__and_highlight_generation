jobidin tries to do his empathy routine and how but fails dramatically democratic officials try to blame the wild fires brutality young climate change and republicans continue to prepare for wednesdays people lobate and venshpir this is the benshfiro so to day's show is sponsor b expressed plan thousands mylicter to already secured doer notice day to join them express fee pinta come flash men you can check your calender as you will see to day is august twenty second he fires in lamina that actually wiped out the entire town it may have killed a thousand people those wild fires well you know they happen non august eighth it is currently almost two weeks beyond the wild fires maybe thous people dead hundreds people dead for shore including possibly up to hundreds of children in fact the mayor of valley says he has no idea how many kids ashes died in these wild fires in china here he was iiatear o many chert ai aawayawa her a teryhinaai awe thing bout about you no idea how many kids o raisin i the president of the united states though he was on dilation he was in rehubof beach delftware and here is how the rules of politics work gan if you are the president and major natural disaster happens on your watch and you're apparently not within i shot of the thing then we say that you do not have empathy and that you are very very bad this was true of gorge job bushman came to hurricane carina it's true of tad crews when it came to freezing temperatures in tacos and apparently it is not true if you are democrat if you're democrat you can do whatever the hell he wants jobidon when on vacation rehubbith beachtollawar he was as specifically about the death told in lamina and he said no comment and then he wrote round on his bite and he had mice cream an he sat on the beach a week and then he went to lake too in neat and do he sat there at the mansion of a major downer and then he took the trouble to finally fly to mall now you would imagine this is when the fame hoiden pithy would make its appearance he hears the thing about jobidon he is not empathetic hoiden is a very selfish creature if you look at jobidon'ste entire life history what you see is the jobidon cars chiefly about himself and also about people in his immediate familial circle he is always been willing to use his power in order to corruptly enrich all of those people including himself he does not see political power as wait to quoting would help the little guy as he pretends he see away to help him in his family and h people he is most close to and if that means denying the family name to a four year old he will do that to but he is been able to get ahead because the media have enable to shield him based on this to supposedly roguish charm that jobidon once had a have never seen it i do not understand why anyonman find join charming but this was the li about jobidon for four decades when in reality he is just wears filled with with boldly i mean that that is what hoiden is it the promise that as he get told her all of the layer is of charm are worn away there is nothing left a bunch of the except a bunch of false old family stories that he trots out and wove empathy and really quite ugly when you see it it is really ugly the first time he went to somebody is house in the person had died a soldier a died and he talks about beau the first time he did that he got lout a sympathy for him and then after he did it time and time and time again the sympathy started to wear away well this time he was visiting when and he proceeded to tell a story about how he knows what it is to lose a home he knows what it is first of all let me just as i said before explain how morning works in the perish community we have very formal and rituals for morning am n orthodox news we do something called shiva shiva means seven seven days after somebody dies for that seven days you literally just bring people food you do all of the minyanim all of the all the jewfish prayers that you have to do our done in the home of the corners the corners do not leave their home for a full week everybody comes an visits them they talk about the person who died and the first rule if you are person who is visiting a the house o morning is keeping hotshot you do not go and talk about all of your personal experiences because that is awful and selfish it such he not empathetic if you walk into the house of somebody who has died and you start talk about how exactly what it is how they feel because you also had somebody who died that is an incredibly arrogant and selfish thing to do its the first rule of visiting a house of morning literally the first rule jobidon bricks that rule he does it early he does it often and then not only does he break the rule he does it with stories that are not even related he visits leheina and up people had the relatives burned a crisp in lamina an people literally lie the worst wild fire disaster in modern america history by slingshot and prison's first responses what if i tell a story about how my house burned own now to understand the story in proper contact for you have to understand is his mouton burned down in fact hoiden he is told the story before and the story is false what actually happen is that one time there was it small kitchen fire cause by a lightening strike in his home it was under control in twenty minutes his house did not burned out nobody was hurt nobody died but to jordan empathy means pretending that he cares about you while talking about himself that is the nature if who job is here is join an lamina yesterday i wan to compare difficos but we have a little sense till i a to lot home yere'sgo now fifty years was e washing o me the press e sun sunny lie struck at home we its you in oho a big on he where him up under e or home the a ceca just this make a long story you i lost my wife why six seven curve i my a a kina fine i watch the fire riders where there's longer not is all expression i grew upright across her from a fire hall an chemo mellower the hell's wrong it this guy sissy what there's wrong with him men side from the senility what is wrong with him is human being this luck not the first time he is trout of this out in the middle of talking about fires he apparently did it in to thousand and at thirteen also he also did it apparently in two thous in and twenty two when he is time made another wild fire is constantly trotting out the story of get a few weeks back my family are's lot a lightening here in the sat flora i some lightening got grounded near our house and it is that a small fire outside of our kitchen is a true story then it was put out the fire files came we left our house an hour we came back how is that relevant tallying it is not it is not relevant at all because what did not happen anything tragic or horrifying it is hotly good story do t it is a what is wrong with you what is wrong with you and the reality is that old age strips away all the pretensions jobidon cares about jopidon everything is refracted through the prism of jobidon he is a person who owns only one surface and it is a mirror apparently because all he cares about its how to facts him how affects his family and what is he have to do seen go back to vacation tools it you real about this what is he really have to do it is an amazing amazing clip an the fact that my imagine for a second i know bletthi's him a the time but it is true because the media a corrupt imagine if donate trump had gone to the sight of a wild fire that killed a thousand people maybe and talked about how one time he almost lost his car because there was a small kitchen fire in his home can you imagine now jobiton is on the s repeatedly over and over and over and everybody in the media keep trying to treat him as empathetic old uncle job he is not empathetic he is never been empathetic jobiton has always an forever and will forever be about jobiton which is why he is used his personal power for the corrupt purpose of enriching his own family that is who he is e beyond that obviously the guys ailing ill get to that momentarily first is yourselfone in desperate need of

chats he standing next to jobidon is join concludes his speech join does not know where he is jobidon looks tough he about to keel over i here is a bran shots at gently trying to guy the elderly gentlemen away from the podium while offering him water get no ti my goodness my goodness what a country we have created for ourselves man we meant we went we make great political choices in this country we really really do well meanwhile the democrat's a media they have found there angle on the howywile fire it is not the incompetence of all the local officials their democrats we cannot talk about their wild in competence this by the way is true every time there is a natural disaster that strikes a left en area the country if hurricane carina hits new organs and the mayor there is just absolute is randan and he is the worst mayor in modern america history and ten thousand people bi because i crappy mayor and the governor is also i democrat we the you blame the president of the united states and feta obviously if you are a governor in a north eastern state an a hurricane wipes through your state and floods the place then you blame climate change and if you are in hawk you do not blame the emergency management chief ho apparently did not sound emergency circus as wild fires near lamina we do not blame him we do not blame many the people were in charge of water management and conservation in a how we do not blame any of the public officials who left o munch it my grass out there to burn at extraordinary heat and speed we soft blame many those people of course we blame climatechange now the reality is then virtually all f these circumstances when it comes to wild fires when it comes to hurricanes when it comes to virtually any natural disaster they are two issues one is the actual natural disaster the sizenscope of it and the other is how the public officials built the place how public officials exacerbated or mitigated the problem this is true pretty much everywhere if this is why in earthquake of five magnetic will hit iron and ten thousand people die but an earthquake of five magnetubil hit californium and nobody will die because the buildings in californium are built better than the buildings an rod it is a public officials actually matter an awful lot in'strmens of the regulations in trams of the response all that stuff matters extraordinarily when a comes to particularly natural disastlict is the one thing they have to be pretty good at when his the re rally bat at it which is win thousand people did the chief permanantiah submitted his resignation citing health reasons going county officials a day earlier to news conference antiar defended the decision not to activate the sirens saying the out door alarms our print are yous primarily for tsunamis oh not of help people because people are train to see higher ground when they hear the siren well i mean everybody would please looked rounding on od crap a giant fire coming down the hill his resignation was accepted again this follows hard on the fact that we we now know that the water was not released t to the area until too late but as we say when it comes to me the narrative somebody else house to be places it cannot be the local democratic officials that cannot be allowed and cannot be the president for a lack lust response or no commute while he sits on rehuboth beach we cannot be that it must be climate change this is the narrative their gonagowath why governor josh crane who is the governor of the state where thesicart is is climate change is the real problem here when your meant go bill warden are you saying that claim at changed amplified the cost of human error yes it did a there is always going to be incredible things that people due to save lives from the fire fighters from citizens and is always going to be decisions that are made that ism sure are not perfect in the moment a and but when you have fire that moved more than a mile a minute and what happened ism told by some of the survivors they were at the initial fire it was put out some time late the afternoon in line and then the fire fighters had to go to three other fires had started because of the conditions when they left the fire stirred up again and then when the storm winds from dora which were that strewn swept it out it just destroyed everything it is the climate change you see it was all about the climate changing tut the earth gradually warming over the course of the next hundred years or how sent our bran shots to the saying tact says it is the new normal of the new normals a thousand people long in line apparently see what do you think the most important specific lessens are that can be learned from this to make sure a tragedy of this level does not happen again well i think we all have to understand that a severe whether vans are going to get more frequent and more severe ism why is the place i that is experienced volcanic eruptions and genomic and hurricanes and tropical storms and we have hod a few wild fires but nothing that a threatened a whole city am nothing that flatten the whole city and i just think this is the new normal for not just the state of we but for the whole platter for the whole country this i the new normal dies is just city's getting flattened by wildfires j isle the governor of washington who is been big on the carman limitation band wagon for years now he tod the exact same thing hes as well that the big issues we need to e carbonize yet you need to stop driving that car of yours is the real it there is a gentile fight that killed a thousand people in hint because you have been using your car to much ice your fault is the fact on matters ten o these today nor the new to these to climate change e we a the whole world's an climate we need did to tin r self for climate change we need i to the climaniser climb o these flies no damages the none of i trees in the world to protected the few stop climate change oh is it is all climate change get there is on one problem it is not climate change will get to that in just one bacon first everyone knows how of my hell's to sleep mates did that just

washington post even the washington post is no this is actually not climate change eff masters meteorologist for yell climate connection says if you'd together a whole bunch of influences that is how you get a disaster no one thing makes it happen the links between human cause climate change in fires are well establish because global warming means plants can more easily dry out but there is one other issue which is that in how it is also meant more rain ah that one of the things that is happened is increased humidity in homie some immediate analysis the winds observed in why he have found does present may have only increase the goes speed by about five miles per hour which is not sufficient to explain what exactly happened year the hurricane and its intensity were certainly not the man effect fueling the fires as for the trout conditions that covered more than a third of mall county where the most destructive fires burn there is note erect sine their product of climate change said abbey eraser an if fleet faculty member a university of hawk why there is a long try then of the climbing precipitation how there is not enough evidence to suggest his the productive anything beside normal climate patters and fluctuations in the pacific she said precipitation patterns there are heavily influence by elnenio which return in tune and by longer try pattern known as the pacific a death oscillation opens known for bringing friar winters but it is rival does not explain the curry conditioners said said eraser in the summer it can bring it more precipitation than normal to natural very ability is just really strong an hawk what exactly cost it well i mean part of it is the fire prone grass as an evasive species than been brought on to the island in order to allow for grazing some of it is failures of local public officials but here is the beauty when your democraticalocal official you can always have the media available to explain away your problems by blaming the earth wheel what a wonderful what wonderful privilege to be a democrat it is thus on it is the earth it is carbon it is life man it is not you sucking used your job ever ever ever can meanwhile speaking of people hare sucking at their job the presidents of the united states continues to preside over an economy the is really really on the verge of something quite bad treasury yields continue to clime meaning the price of bonds is going down that is how you end up if the higher treasury yields riding's the way that yield works is that it is the difference between the facial price of the bond and the return on the bond that means the people are still investing in the stock market but it is ken of weird because the called inverted yield curve continues to predominates the ten your yield clothes if four point they three nine per cent above the nearly sixteen year high it is at last thursday rising yields have weight on stops shall three major indices logging losses last week yet the the rout and bonds as been led by longer turn it treasuries an motherworts people are not trusting that the government may be able to pay back those bonds or they are there very doubtful about the state of the long turn economy meanwhile car prices are about stiganosdive according to the waster journal five years go the dozen models of new cars calling for less than twenty thousand dollars in two thousand twenty three there is only one for the average america paying off a new car turn prices demands forty two weeks of income and you are about to see the prices nosedive when it comes to cars you are so being hiring slow down pretty significantly pay for new hirers is declining it significantly according to the waster journal pay for new hires is staring to shrivel after years of hefty salary bums requiring workers to reset while financial gains to expect from switching two a new job again the red line the red la the red lights are all blinking at this point the only question is wen the economies in step ah ye you have to feel if you watch the economic on daily basis that what goes up must come down and the effects of in inflationary economy in a stagnating economy with little innovation little investment those wages are income do pretty fast right here which means sat one thousand times jobidon is a very very vulnerable incumbent he is not with us he is unsympathetic he is a nasty cup person and he is presiding over bat economy what is that mean u find out what republicans do this week when they have their first to bail to that momentarily first

debate he is not going to according to the latest pulling data some seventy three per cent of america in the republican party with to see trump join the debate twenty seven per cent agreed with trump that he should sit it out but only nine per cent voter said they would trumpsopponis to place an emphasis ism making the case against dona trump very few people ire can be watching the lobate hoping that suit attar dona trump that baseclee is can be chis christie bread this his designated can in the republican primary whatever of that exists know he is showing in pulls in new samphire by the way christy is is running very week in iota but right now according to the latest pollen from new hamper he hoping at fourteen per cent in new samphire which is his best poll showing yet christy for his parts attacking trump with alacrity suggesting the trumpet is coward only christy presumably will make that case at the debate and dour be interesting see how people on the stage respond to all that meanwhile democrats are just voting for casualties on the stage according to the you times after rope fretting about president by ends political standing in their electoral chances an twenty twenty four democrat's and a moment of high confidence has re publicans prepare for their first presidential date on wednesday they will be watching with bated breath in the hopes that the republican candies en brace the likely to be absent donalca trump defend him over its four criminal incitements in worse national restrictions on abortion and call for cuts two social security and medical in democrats at dream scenario even without trump on stage democrats see the republican white house hopeful hopefuls as the avatars for what they describes o party an thrall to its extreme elements nobody is riding for the debates off there's more than democrats praying for mister bygones re election ja messing the campaign manager for brickle momisms all i want is these people to say the same stuff they ben saying on the campaign trail an nationality the please continue to double down on a six week abortion man how be wonderful thank you for doing this well because they are rooting for casualties it is worth while noting how many of them are pushing rivals to governor rondo cantus in florid the poll's right now show that cantus is trailing trump by a wat there is some evidence then i there is life left in to cantus according to the late pulling made up in i the trump campaign is a doing slightly worse in i than theoretically they should be j an sells are the faces i poster who put out new numbers in i it shows that trump right now is a is at forty three per cent meanwhile the santusis in nineteen per cent seller says that the finding s indicate the races closer than it mad for seam that is because in the ill caucus is a voters second place choice matters it let say that you are rondasantis your the first trice o nineteen per cent of the people and then you of for timscott and timsgot is not one of the top too and that means that you are going to now get a boots right because let say the you chose timsgott an in to cantus and then shot's not gets tossed out it is rantroys voting and then that second trice boat goes to do cantus theoretically to cantus could be the winner in i then why register note sixty three per cents of likely jet be caucascore states support trump is their first er second choice that footprint is on par with sixty one per cent who say the same fort to cantus also half of re publicans in that i poll are saying the mine or not yet made up what o the me you have an interest in they haven interest in fragmenting the field obviously the more the field is fragmented if they believe that trump is the best person for them to run against which seems pretty evident then there interest is in propping up other people what not to cantus hell right now the candidate of the moment who is not to cantus is a take romasuamy this presumably is why even mad and no friends to republicans he is a former senior adviser to it round a who appears on prison best regularly he says that evade is the is the person wit the highest potential on the stage on wednesday who yo win we and ha at my of it fin and i tollthe ti in can tin a detention pe pitanga tea ton you i think the greatest potential for this to bay come true the van for sum romsuamy because if you look at his rapid fire approach and you look it how hes he really cry tall as as massage in all this table teeing interviews the end of the dates to base the tally on performances and his ability to really crystallize as manage an deliver that message and make people think wile this as a fighter this as somebody who is a could this the fig o that the the themicrast in the peace access s of the was as hard is anybody up there that i think his probably has the greatest potential for to morris and meanwhile third axe rod is also propping up the take romasuamy right t let us your to lathes the take is not going be president of the united states this election cycle in fact there is an article out to day suggesting that evade basically ran in order to acts as stalking horse for trump is according to a report from abisynews romaswuamy two donors itched himself the candida who could make serious waves in there publican primary to meeting when met with some skepticism romaswammy argued his candida he could also disease to governor dances from entering the races in the lead up to his announcement romaswam would tell several other conservative activist he believe tat if he ran it could stop to cantus from running or impact his viability as candidate if he did enter the race a i it is worth noting that if ta take really were gaining the pols against dona trump you imagined final trouble nicknamed him already right dona trump has never been shy about going after people he considers to be rivals instead all he has warm words for e take do democrats which again i know the take ism friends of the take very nice guy has lot interesting ideas but it was something when avid axe rod is praising you to disguise interesting thing about that to me was the reference to mama swampy you started off as and unknown and has proven himself could be a much more effective culture worrier than the cantus himself and an going a her the the wok also on he is just been much more compelling have it t just again democrats are proving up the take meanwhile by the way the take is am he is he is stepped on his toes a few times were but nit getting fort of national attention that his positive spin is getting right now for example the washington examiner as an entire article about the makes fliplops on a wide variety of issues according too the writer gave kolinsky he says romaswammy an ex farmasuitical executive who rose to prominence following the publication of his twenty twenty one book woke ink inside corporal america social justice is polling in third place in the copy primary behind to cantus herself is clocking in double digest behind former president dona trump romaswammy has fate position himself as an outsider but do the reality is that due again he has been on all sides of a variety of issues the republican told then your post an mid august he be opens to a valuating pardon for members of the biding family in the interest of moving the nation forward if you elected president and then he declared no i do not have any plans pardon hunter began it is planned to trash when you strike the swamp the swamp strikes back when fox news run a story to days later in ought the headman romaswammy breaks with jo on tree d criminalization of her drugs quit ism in that direction where he said that i think in the long run am hung about over the long run peri of times the criminalization seriously is an important part of the long run solution here romaswammy also label bat planted trash ya again he has slipped lopped on foreign policy two months ago he is denied to the washington for beacon who is open t aging military financial support to israel after the autlesided footed from the campantrail where he repeatedly where he reportedly expressed to contrary view and then he said the it was false reporting in tune and then it was report the was is understanding and thence told the outlet on sturdy that he now supports facing on most age to is rail by two thousand an twenty eight he is said that he he's open to basically moving microchip production out of time won sea conductor in dependence he said after that are commitments than our commitment to be wins on military conflict will change because that is rational e and ourself interest again back is e super smart we berate no question but the notion the is ring a fully consistent campaign not much and of course he is been flirting a little bit with some interesting series shall we says he did not interview with the aplanatic nowt lessen full credits of awake for going into unfriendly made spaces in speaking to people who of their candidates all newspeak to and n he gets full credit for this buavake also did say apparently to the aplanatic he said duo i thinks legitimate to say how many police how many federal patients were on the plans the the twin towers maybe the answer is zero it probably is zero for all i know right have no reason to think offs anything other than zero but e for doing a comprehensive a session of what happened on none eleven they have not eleven commission absolute that should be an answer the public knows the answer too well if we are doing in canary six commission absolute those should be questions we should get to the bottom of here are the people who are armed here the people wo are unarmed what perpend to people who are armed or federal lawn foremen officers i thing with probably high actually right then he said i would take the truth on nine eleven am not questioning this not something on staking out anything on i want the truth about nine eleven which is again very can a weird take i do not i do not know what he means by this in any case the is o be gaffs or if to san to set it would b a major media story the vac saying it in for count of flying under the rate a because the media have a stake any very competitive primary that dis not in clue trump they have a stake and true running if fifty per cent and every one else being it fourteen or fifteen per cent i am glad to see than the run up to the are in see debate now finally the fox news has informed the trump campaign that surragets four trump will not be allowed to attend the first re publican debate the borrowing of true surriguts according to the near post for forestays debate comes one day after trump confirm to not participate in the event the post is con firm sprouts for any candidate who did not make the stage will not be allowed at the debate a release in the spin room it is not a true specific ban the ex commander she sell the suns is from junior said he would be attending he show down as a surtout for his father camber goo as also expected to show up at the event and run media for the forme president too were a carry lake by rontonalts mat gets it all been a planning to attend apparently apparently there is still going to go to the events there working on a resolution fox news in the are see to be allowed the post to bate spin room but the truth is the ton be aloweden the pin room either i mean here here is the the only people allow in the sunroom should be surrogates for the peoplewho actually did the debate pretty obviously he's otherwise why would anyone go to abate that is is i so big a mistake to go to any debate just do not go to abate send send a couple of your surriguts rip on everybody in the spin room that is the easiest way out hopefully fox news in the ran see find some testicles in to i true surragets the ability get the spin room because again the sunroom is for the people who play the game it it is very bazar to have surrogates for a person who is explicitly denying the importance of the debate in the sunroom to just crap all over all the other candidates an meanwhile speaking of president trump he is slated to turn himself in in futon county georgeob on these fannuwillis redo charges he expected o that the day after the debate and the timing is in peccable will get to that

racketeering case of also greed to the terms of their bond agreement with the was office drums lawyers get for little through finding and marks a coburg met with the does offs on money before the details of the bond agreement were released other tramplers a ben working behind the scenes on the approach to the bond the release conditions outlined drums bond order are more extensive than those laid out in the others approve earlier money in the case according to the judge quit that rennin shall perform no act to intimidate any person known to him or hurt to be a to defend or witness in this case or to otherwise obstruct the administration in justice the above swollen clue but are not limited to post son shall media or repostof post made by another individual on social medias o an other words if down trump retreats something threatening eruditely on y or ripping on redijulion ear something then theoretically they could haul him back to jail they could tell you a violated you are bond his team is saying this violation of free speech i should be allowed to say basely what i want because your interpretation of intimidation of witness might just bee me it might mi open an ones take on what is going on it to offennincs that seems fairly reasonable actually this is the highest bond of any of the defenders which again is sort of strange given the fact that dona trump is the least likely person in human history to abscond from justice i do not i do not even understand the logic the dona trump is going to be running away from the the country wat what what what is what is even happening it is funny an its dona trump actually put out what was a very very funny statement a on this he said the failed district attorney of footman county fanny wills insisted on y two hundred thou's nova on from me i soon therefore she thought was a flihtrisk it'd fly far far away maybe to russia russia russia sure gold dome sweep with ladies never to be seen or heard from again but i be able to take my very under stated air plane with the gold trump of fixed for all to see probably not are you much better off line commercial ism sure nobody would recognize me i wuldud's funny i mean yosastr not tantrums ay funny funny man that is some funny stuff right there i you dona trump obviously him showing up in sort in plant is going to be the cover to the days and almost as mater what happens in the re publican abate barring some sort o vatic climax circumstance meanwhile as we say in the poles true continues to lead by leaps and bounds the latest south caroling post has a from traffelgot has trump up thirty four percentage points on the rest of the field his still leading by some twenty sum per centare points in i he is stilleaving rest the field in new samphire by twenty sum per tentage points d dos melted now that is non stopping trump from attacking the republicans a to even mean other candidates i mean just other republicans generally i right now he is attacking governor trying keep of georgia which he is tried this before cam got reelected over stay arms the true governor of georgia he ought reelected over her by crushingher to trump's great dismay by the way mean true tried actually primary branch well now he is attacking brankemp for not firing fanny wills which again i he doesn't have the power to do he says governor keep of georgia fighting hard against the impeachment of the crooked in commit ant highly partisan to e of footman county fan wills was murder and other violencrime to massively early cri'min lanes worst tan nation she showed be in peach for many reasons not just the with hunt i did nothing wrong wills should focus out in out of control murder not i will get trump over a perfect phone call georgia does not served this giant murder wave ism i do not understand why that is trying temp's fault i there is not even a majority support in e stay legislature to i peach fanny wills ait this point but ye again it is is free fire in every direction from pressing and trump as always now one of the things that that the multiple incitements of trump continue to underscore is the join gets was pretty much anything anything in everything all the time it is pretty incredible an the media continued cover in baccarat sellers he says there is no evidence that that job had anything to do with hunters business obviously untrue how much more evidence you need job hunter literally less it we have a secret e mail address of does two hunter on crane matters we have partners of under bison openly tustifime that job was involved in hunter's business to the excenthat he would stop by meetings and phone into them i don't i do not understand but what nature of evidence would you re quit at this point democrats a saying if hunterbiting committed a crime hold on accountable but two a addiction touch is every single family in this country o her the overwhelming majority there a in this is a an a very interesting needle that republicans a trying to thread by persecuting some one with an addiction if while having this addiction he committed crime then punish him but there is literally no evidence that this ties back to the president of the united states and i think that what about is am is going a fall flat i is we had into the selection persecuting a man within addiction persecuting a man with visit did the hunter widens victim jury's a life long victim under bison a mean sure every jobs ever held us because hes daddy was either a senator or vise presidents of the united states or president of the united states sure he is made millions of dollars being a useless deli drug attic piece of crap but he is a victim guys you drugadics we should all feel super duper duper bad for him demanding how the words white privilege that baccarat sellers is eager to utter under virtually evert circumstance was just go absent when we talk about the greatest scion of white privilege in modern america history hunterbidon meanwhile by thewy under bisons legalize is targeting wade fort the iris whistleblowers member the iris wasteblors who blow up his sweet harddeal well now apparently according to the her times while mister bison's legalese agrees that press agents affected the deal his lawyers have contended to the justice department that by disclosing details about reinvestigation to congress they

a working class person to have a successful song you have to be pro welfare in order for this toward or presumably you have to cut a song about the match of transcenderism or something that that is

form that is am ya again it shows that when conservatives and a people who are not in the cultural main stream fleets their market p our they are able to make an outsized cultural influence the song is certainly worthtlissen of the i if you recall back to the early days of trumps it is really can of fascinating think backs two thousand fifteen two thousand sixteen when trump was really gaining a lot of street credence and incredibility in hews picking up huge support there are all these pieces after trump one in two thousand seventeen abulic who are these people voted for trump and they sent reporters from big cities into the wilds of iota to discuss with the regular folk as thoughthey were stove win checking out some strange form of kangaroo what exactly these weirdos thought and they wanted the now for a moment for a brief moment in time is one books joy vans is hill billy eulogies started making in roads were people are all maybe the people think differently than we do may they have certain moral values that we do not hole maybe they maybe they are afraid of the peculiar morality that we are bringing to them that suggests that men can be women women can be men and that basically individual subjectivism is the hight of human experience and then it all went away then i all went away within about six months it was noon trump one beat a russia was not because there is any cultural moment that we are missing here it is because of russia well every time one of these can of cultural moments reaches up in grabs left they free out and instead of trying to understand where's rich men north of richmond coming from what is this mean instead of that they just free out the all my god look at these his he is crazy hicks who stuff this how dare they we must have the

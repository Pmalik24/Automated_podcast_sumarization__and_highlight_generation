the showsponser bexpressvepiansimd to stand up against mistake protect or day that express vepianticams lashes there are two major problems with the notion of diversity equity and inclusion or d e i the first is the inherent discrimination in the concept the belief that all aspects of success are due to exploitation and discrimination this means that when applied to groups statistically under performing groups are to be considered victimized whether or not they are victims and to be treated with special privileges those who are members of statistically over achieving groups whether or not they are victimized are to be treated as villains the only possible exception to this hierarchy is white men the are always to be treated as villains whether their group is under performing or over performing in any given situation this philosophy is how you get a holiday party for elected of color thrown by action boson mayor misspell woo apparently the selected of color party has been a thing for a decade in boson here was woo defending it members of the bosons tote council receive an male in the bison to what is call the gathering of elected of color not all members of the coil fit that description i think we have we have had individual conversations with everyone people understand that it with truly just the an onithmithstake that when out in typing the meal feel and a i look for d to celebrating with everyone at the holiday party that we will have beside to spines while tho a it is my intension that we and and a be city that lives our values and create space for all kinds of community for come together living your values requires segregated parties this the obviously discriminatory and wrong if there are white elected only party of course that would be violative of federal discrimination law but d i insist the you cannot be wrong long is your a member of the victim hood hierarchy that is the first problem to t i its races then there is the second problem not disconnected with the first mediocrity if success is to be treated as sinful and failure as virtuous because victimhood is virtue then mediocrity is the happy middle were ye can avoid being completely terrible a things but also escape censure for being actually good at them it is in academia where racially divers mediocrity is preferable to non rampaged meritocratic achievement see for example hazard where president sliding gay despite apparently being both a serial naturist and a soften antisemitons leader is still in her job or see chico where may or brain johns the even worse successor to lory lightfoot announced his plans this week to kill chicanes high achieving selective in roman schools since they ware not racially diverse enough chico public schools see o pedromartinas has put forth a resolution seeking quit a transition away from privatization and admissions in roman policies and approaches that further stratification and inequity in c pis and drive student in roman away from neighborhood schools better that high achieving students be trapped the crappy local school then they be able to go to a better school mediocrity for every one and it is that the white house to where equity prevails above all now when the baton white house promise that equity would be at the hart of a they do they meant it which presumably is why doctor child widen the greatest of all mediocrities he doc but she's a doccardized the most doctors doctor whoeverdoctor she invited the drank dance company to perform a version of the nutcracker ballet at the whorehouse now there's nothing wrong with the concepts here the nutcracker written by chakovsky is a famous christian time at piece of culture an tap dance is a historically black america reform with a long and stored how e would history many of not most of the greatest tapartis in history have ben black america from the nicholas brothers to bill bangles robins to groggery hinds in fact here is some tape of what truly amazing tap looks is the nicholas brothers from stormy weather in nineteen forty three r i go going i of opera e a not it's the good stuff right here right o gate now of course most of the amazing stuff in america tap has been adopted by people of all cultures that is how you end up with get call and fretistair two of the great america artist of all time there is plenty of history and quality for he biding white house to choose from in picking their christian tap routine well what the white house presented was not good tap was not terrible it was just can o weird and me here is the tape the we case and a weirdly attired om lady dancing down the halls of the hungry games white house there and then a weird guy won i lot o weird people dress in weird costing and average kenning walking down the hills and nothing's happening and a prove faces i no win unserious dancing you cainsee their feet what noway this is but it is diverse of there is that an it is hots an to glad these people ism sure a great dancer why cannot we actually see them dance baby good o gate why was dora dance picked to do this much mockrtin ism not the only one who thought it was met presumably it had something to do with the politics o the group mischelldorans founder of the group has dedicated the group to quotenquot anti racism here is what she wrote on her website quote it is our job to tell the history of tartans as a celebration of black culture and also the never ending struggle against systematic racism and white supremacy in this country the origin story of appropriation in america culture in twenty twenty says micelle dozens ism part of the way the story place out ism a whites tap answered with black cultural ancestors in a society that privileges white people in whiteness i am easy for white audiences wanting to access an experience elements of black culture to swallow as the america or supremely opposed to black tapdansers which om no dorrence says the gardant is quote both a tradition born up version revolution and protest and a powerful vehicle for social and political change and adds that is a beneficiary of white privilege i invite you to join me in life long anti braces more understanding how deeply in bended white supremacy racism and colonialism is in our culture is paramount to understanding a roll as white people in perpetuating it and embracing our job to dismantle it or you could just dance an aulic a good dance routine because here is the reality of a free country quality improves every one and everything all the black tap artist i mention before did more foratial comedy and black america tan shell organs ever will because they demonstrated to any one who would even idiotically think that race ought too find somebody that incredible artistry spans rats transcends it but here is the thing when d e i is your goal mediocrity all too often is the result in just one second we will get to a fascinating cultural story about the

was destroyed by a person and nickel cavity thirty five he was then charge he turn himself in with fourth degree criminal mischief an a text message who fox in his digital cavity confirmed he tore down the satanic display which was erected last week by the satanic temple of i to represent the groups right to religious freedom case said is this extremely anti christian cavity a previously run and in successful campaign for congress in twenty twenty two he in elaborate and white there the statue dow bat e posted a bible v us on thursday night to acts after being charged we sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as t o boring ligand walking about seeking whom he may devour in a casebook post the satanic temple of i will wrote that the display was count beyond re pair the grouper we ask that for safety visitors travel together and use the seven tents as reminder for empathy and the knowledge that justice is being pursued the correct way through legal means hope holidays hail satin the i a re publican governor can reads condemned the dis place presence but you said it should be counter with more speech that many lands i find the satanic temples display in the capital capital absolutely objectionable in if free society the best response to objectionable speech is more speech i encourage all those of faith to join me today in praying over the capital and recognizing the ne activity scene he's beyond display the true reason for the season the to founder of the satanic temple person in lucia graves had previously told local media that the displayed be up for two weeks quote were going a really relish the opportunity to pe represented in a public for him we do not have a church on ever street corner my feeling is if people do not our displaying public for a the not have to engage with them thereon have to view them o case less talk about this first of all fur the guy who a who knock the head off the statue this actually is the we you do public protest by the way is if you are actrigan o do this you then accept the consequence is for that thing rat he knock to ad off the statue than he turned himself ins the police unlike all these morons you see who are blocking the freeway where than very very upset that they regretting arrested but when it comes to civil disobedience which is what this is when you put us pagan civil disobedience you then turn yourself in and that that is the way that it works as there is that then there is the question of whether he did anything conn what morally wrong in knocking down the statue now this is only mildly questionable the answer is the answers no he don't do anything morally wrong in knocking down the statue of ha satanic group ism sorry he did not on a moral level you have no moral right to promote a non religion that is specifically directed at hatred of christian that is exactly what this is now you may have a legal right to do that that is not the same thing is a moral right to do the are two different types of right we have all sorts of legal rights to do things tat are immoral in america society's yo have to separate those two things off because very often when we were talking about rights we ten to con plate them we ten to think something is legal there for its moral or it is moral therefor its legal not that is not the same thing it is legal to use the inward for example it is immoral to do you should not similarly it is not immoral two knock down a satanic statue it may be illegal to do because the law is supposed to protect private property can but that raises the question as to why the law does that you see cemrenalds there say that this protected speech that putting up a satanic display at the state capital sponsor by the state presumably is some form of freedom of speech and how that really does require us to ask a specific question a question the we have not asked in a long time this country which is what is a legitimate religion not all religions are actually religion satanism is a perfect example of a non religion is an ideology mascaraing as a religion and if you view the satanic website they openly say things we do not worship action we do not believe the is a thing called satin is linguashin worshipping a godlike being known is that we do not believe in god it it really is is just a political agenda pretending that it is a religious agendas and pretend that this is religious speech is obviously not true in fact if you go back to the founding there is no way that the founding fathers under the rubric of freedom of religion would have included any one who calls themselves a religion in fact the rest us this all the time therefore certain cult groups that try to declare themselves religion the wrestle going now you are not a religion do not believe you which means you do not have freedom of religion rights in the same way that say nativity scene at a capital building wood or conicamnora at a capital building wood again legally speaking this can of bis our libertarian notion that is been picked up on by a lot of re publicans that is just an aspect of freedom of religion to were by satanic display at a state capital there is really not a lot of legal backing to support that idea as good peace by learning franktdiveto over the america conservative a few months back an which you talk specifically about this he has currently an attorney serving as council to papa legal institute and he writes about this he says there is an uproar last week when a school district in money the would have proved in after school satin club after proper casts in sued the school district end the right thing and re considered deciding they should not approve a club for children sponsor by the satanic temple after all america conservatives have been shape by libertarian argument for absolute personal freedom the point has come where they wonder whether satanism is part of the tradition protected by the you as constitution something must be does take back this obvious ground an he points out the there's very little case law on the specific issue of whether satanism is a protected religion what we do have is little bejumple but the point is that since the constitution is not to find religion the court then turns to case law for guidance but the early supreme court to find religion in traditionally theistic terms an other words believing in god not an atheistic untie christian non religion pretending to be a religion for purpose as of putting up a satanic display next than activity seen which is the purpose of what the satanic temple is doing here that is exactly the purpose of what the satanic temple is doing here the founders never would have considered this in aspect of freedom f religion not remotely in fact it was only in twenty nineteen that the press even de cleared that the satanic temple was a taxing tempt church tour under doll trust by thewy a point that onto artist was making we get to more on this in just at one second first from attaining control of your assets to easing the burden on your loved ones in a state plan can insure your family states prepared and protected if

temperament of reshipping at trust and will dot come slash chipper to get started well again as frank soviet points out here it is not merely that the founders would never have considered a religion of satanism to be protected by the first amendment freedom of re legion is notches that it turns out that as pointed out an article at hazard late of you few years back the black letter rule in america law was clear constitutional liberty entailed to right articulate views on religion but e not even a right commit blasphemy the offensive maliciously reviling god which encompass profane ridicule of christy those were come laws this were compatible with the free exercise religion they we completely upheld as this lawyer points out throughout the nations history even into the twentieth century the federal courts have consistently upheld state anti blasphemy laws as constitutional there is no dining precedent stating that anti blasphemy laws in violate the first amendment and this is where what you claim is religion actually matters even if outlook t the church of satin website or the wiccapedia page it is not just the date revile and ridicule crises they do not even best it is not a religion it is not there is nothing there that says religion it is an anti christy political program that it macerating as religion again we talked better on the so before when you look at the satanic temple website they do not actually believe in satin i mean it because that would be to to believe in god in order to believe in in satin presume we have to belie in a supernatural they do not actually believe in any of that they say with unfortunate regularity the satanic temple is confused with an early organization the church of satin the church of satin expresses vehement oppositions o the campaigns an activities of the satanic temple but what they actually say is that they they do not actually believe again in satin itself here is what these satanic temple itselfsizeson is pamphlet quote the satanic temple practices non theistic satanism we believe that religion can and should be divorced from superstition as such we do not believe in either god or the devil as supernatural forces we bow to no gods or gods or and celebrate our outsider status to embrace the name satin is to embrace rational inquiry remove from supernaturalism and archaic tradition a superstitions the satanists should actively work to home critical thinking and exercise reasonable inquiry in all things our beliefs must be mailable tote best current scientific under standings of the material world never the reverse what exactly is satin to the satanic temple quote satin is symbolic of the eternal rebel in opposition to arbitrary authority fever defending personal sovereignty even in the fate of in surmountable odd satin is in icon for the unbowed will of the relentless inquirer the heretic who questions sacred laws and rejects all tyrannical impositions the metaphorical construct provides as for the framework by which we live he is a symbol of defiance satanism does not suggest a supernatural solution to the trials of existence rather it serves as an affirmation of that which is demonstrably be true ours is the historical satin of western literary traditions expressed in tax john million's paradise lost first all this complete misery just at the supordi admissery to paradise lost john melton dos not satin yet to be a more on o believe this button it of matter the bottoming is this obis they not a church is non a religion is just much secular at wo are all what if we just slap a symbol on top of this thingand the we put it up next to the activity scenes that we can laugh t o jess that is what this is all about and again it was not until twenty nineteen when the satanictemple is actually designated a church by the iris the group is now listed in an irastatobas for taxis and t organization what exactly was this satanic statubehead in doing well i mean obviously is ween a historic piece of art it was not the talisman blowing up some giant buddhi statue from a millennium ago it like a statue they put together and then they put in the hyla statapital and stomach people s the knocker down and ow presumably he is going to be put on trial and i assume that he will appeal on the basis of this i seem he is going to a peal the base of the is not actually a religion see can say that i owe them damages for property damage or some thing ad ism willing to pay it and i can raise the money to pay for it but to pretend that this is it actually i religious freedom display is to demean what it means to be religious which just precisely the purpose of this thing it is to demean what like they say we want it up next to the division why why they wanted up next to the activity sene over news we we do the connubial right we have the minor o the connicaminora we bee displaying that since before christiania was even around on planet earth and we would be displaying that whether or not christian were displaying an activity scene is li gar all my gosh we need a connkeea right up next to that have never card whether my conidia is even in the remote proximity of nativity scene but the entire point of the satanictemple is to put their thing right new to the nativity scene in order to much christiania that is what it is all about the first place hopefully this thing gets to u to get out love to see the supreme court actually take on a petty foreign and interesting question as to weather it counts is a religion if you just creed n t anti christian thing and then call it a religion what exactly is satanism again the entire thing is oriented against christiania that is what is oriented against and they are this very clear cosmopolitan just a month ago put forth a an insogrampost that is totally discussing a mean vile how does they satanic abortion ceremony even work they ask hand's a picture of a woman staring into a start of glass that is a mirror and here is what cosmopolitan says is what is it t have a satanic abortion for vesica a thirty several mother of three who received abortion medication the enamel albedoes mam satanic clinic again the whole purpose of satanism is to simply insult religious people and apparently supremecort justices the experience was just very supportive while she is not a satanist justice decided to in corporate a few ceremonially a ceremonial elements into her lowabortion experience why not she thought the over all messaging just clicked with her read more about it at the link in the big here is what it has quit patience of all fates are welcome it samiel albedoes mom satanic abortion panic an now mexico melon with medical council t s t offers free ceremonial support to every one abortion ceremonies are totally optional and customable here is a simple one t s t recommends es t is the satanic temple which is the same group that put up this a satanic statue at the iota state capital to this entire post every single one of these postfreminstragram has an inverted cross to the top it is a cross that is upside down and the entire purpose here is to much christiania the entire purpose that is not a religion that is just mockery of christiania now i can say it is free speech that is not freedom of religion is not the same things are too different things freedom of practice of religion would require that the state capital include different religions in the take capital according to current supreme sort law but this is not a religion it is just mockery inverted cross is as first find a quietspase bring a mirror if you can just before taking the medication gas at your reflection in focus on your personhood home in on your intent your responsibility to you forsulshoud gonna on thsecondale your responsibility you you are god your goddess in this scenario according to the satanic church a gate focus focus on your not the personhood of the baby growing inti do for your killing focus on your own personhood is you are the only person who matters next slide in vested cross take a few deep relaxing breaths when you are ready read the following tenet allowed one's body is inviolable subject to one's own will alone take the medication and immediately afterward reck quit beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world one should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs next slide upside down cross again later ones the procedure is complete ah that euphemism phrisecer is complete return to your reflection my god the self obsession here is totally wild but i guess this is what the religion of satanism is all about worship of self the moments focus again on your personhood your power in making this decision complete the ritual by reciting a personal information and of course this is a mockery of catholic catechism by my body my blood by my will it is done am that is pretty i me could it could possibly be more mocking of christiania i main that that is obviously what it is that they are just mocking the eucharis right even i but a humble ignorant you understand the is mockery of the eucharis but that that that is precisely what it is this not a religion is just mockery quote mirrors or contras or not t s ten point is that your abortion should focus on your autonomy in making this decision patients can include as many loved ones as they or light candles or even dress up whatever makes them feel empowered this sin cosmopolitan magazine yet now is is the church this even remotely resembling a church of course not as nothing to do with church zero zip zilch data all it is is a bunch of sexual secular left wing anti christian propaganda crammed in to a fake phony religion and the your pretended religion see can stick your garbage statue up next to an activity scene it is obvious the christiania is a religion and satanism is not and the founding father s wit have felt the same way and he fact that many people have gone libertarian that they have given up there brain space for the stuff is ridiculous not all things that clear to be religions are in fact religions not all behaviors are forms of speech the strong case you made tat burning a flag is not a form of speech if you want to say things you can say them that is called speech burning things is conduct it again failures to make any of these distinctions all of that has has led to this can a mushy libertarianism in which we are all supposed to pretend that immorality is somehow morality it is led to the conflation also between a legal right as they said t the year beginning and a moral right this are not the same thing not the same thing whatsoever can just one second we will get to the latest on

apparently in covered and allege commas terry plot in ropes remember that time that come said that they want to kill people all over the world yet it turns out that that is true it turns out that inter national tear organizations they are really bad and they like killing people all over the world and they to do number one because they are ideology demands that they spread the calcific may comas has been very clear about this they do not just whish to kill news for example inside israel they wish to killed yous outside of israel as well they are enroll would be a in as comic calcific no different then then what sis would want comas is not just have territorial claims their latest attempt to relights they are charter for public facing distribution is obviously a back fix they do thisinbout twenty seventeen and now by the we they are attempting hilariously enough to push themselves ins that palestine liberation organization as to quote moderate themselves by pretending that they are willing to accept the existence of the state of israel which of course they are not that is the reason why that is slaughtered people in the gaze envelope which as been part of the stay of israel since inception in any case they yesterday were uncovered compass terror apparatus was discovered in rope german authorities on this they detain four alleged members of comas suspected of planning to attack tuition institutions in the region the first suggestion the music conflict might be spilling over beyond the maddest what was that the first indication really because i notice the gossip conflict spilling over beyond themadeleast when hundreds of thousands of supporters of comas were marching in the streets of onion that is that is what i noticed at first actually to be fair germanous federal prosecutors had one of the men acting under orders from compass leaders and weabonon had in the spring begun searching for a cash of weapons the organization had plandestinally assembled in the pass the weapons were to be brought to berlin until they could be used in a possible attack against juisih institutions in rope security official say the roup has long been active in rope but far they say it is been you a mostly logistical basin source of financing rather than possible terra target an october man identified as a leones born a of welcomed a a and two accomplices an egyptian national and dutch national began traveling slumberland across the region to gather weapons assisted by a third man identified as a leones born terrain according to the germinant prosecutor the for a long standing class members but already participated in for an operations for the group give a question why even the in jail already it is get to wander round rope raising money for terror attacks as long as there israel in enjoy an israel pretty amazing stuff meanwhile apparently at least seven terra suspects have actually been arrested in ropes ane got the four that were rested by germany but danish agencies also exposed compass in for structure on european soil least three people were rested in denmark and one in the netherlands on suspicion of plotting to carry out in act of terror an that of course would not be a surprise the goal of these terror groups is to push the west to abandon its interest in themiddle east with terror tax has been true since the arab waits been true before that intrude really since the nineteen sixties nineteen seventy derris in the region used whatever leavers of power they have in order to try to intimidate the west into going hands off in this particular region of the world despite the fact that the west has tremendously have the economic interest in this particular region of the world and also some moral interests in you no defending the only diverse democracy in the entire region meanwhile even as compass is is pushing terror attacks abroad the white house continues to send bazar signals to the israeilies let us be clear about this these rales are not going to stop until compass is completely defenestrated in the gas strip it will end with israel having to station thirty forty thousand troops in the gosh strip in perpetuity an order police that is what is going to happen and the reason that's going to happen is gets come is not just a terror group they have networks of terrasimtizers through out the gasistrip compass currently enjoys a fifty seven fifty seven fifty two per cent approval approval rating in gaze which has been completely wrecked because of compass and in fact the approval rating for comas in the west bank which is the place that supposed to be govern by the paliconian authority right the vaunted p a the biding white house wants to we in charge oath gosistrip no one likes the p in the west bank in fact palistinians in themes bank our highly support of a mass the tune of eighty plus per cent by every available bole ss notion that israel is s m how going to acquiesce to a quotinqual two state solution with the very people who perpetrated october seventh another sympathizers that is insane notes even more insane is the idea that israel is going to hurry up in order to slow down israel is currently hurrying up operations in an attempt to comply with white house dicots which means more as rally soldiers are get killed the number of his rally soldiers were getting kill day on day is rising specifically because the white house is telling these rallies to hurry up that is why seals having to rush its operations as opposed to going slower and meanwhile the stuff they could be doing to minimize their own deaths they have not been doing because again they do not want the bad headlines coming out of the gazes trip instead they are sending their own men and women into harms way going house by house in tunnel by tunnel as suppose to using their complete air superiority an areas that already should been clear of civilians two months ago none the less take mulligan apparently told israel that their war needs to quote transition to the next lower intensity face in a matter of weeks not months hl ism sure if he has a plan israel willing to hear it if he is got a magic later up in the sky maybe he could lend it to the news that this kind of stupidity about war were got take mulligan dictating military time tables in the middle of an operation is totally crazy it is stupid it by the way it is dumb when america politicians do it o our own military he's to down a rock an afghanistan regularly ut haberakomama sitting the top the america government doing things sure will surgeon afghanistan but then thrive an arbitrary deadline by which we have to pull back to search will announce it at the time meanwhile the military official what thus how is this gun work it is truly incredible how many civilian officials seem to think that they can dictate magical time lines to a military that is on the ground fighting that particularly the when your talking about i military that is not under america control israel has that to own rather powerful military according to axioms national security adviser mulligan made clear in all meetings the high intensity conneticcampaign melted to transition to the next lower intensity face in a matter of weeks not months this not a deadline we understand the campaign must and will con tine but in that lower intensity anotherwords what they want is less spectacular headlines by how many people are done that's what they want us for it absolute leader israel kin to kill as many terrorists and people who remembers that terrain out work as they need to in order to insure their future period and of story is was no interest in killing civilians they are not interested in doing that commons is hiding behind o in fact not only as compass hiding pinesvillions just to show what commands commons apparently is literally taking dolls baby dolls and they are connecting them to taperquarters with recorded cries of children and then connecting those to i e deeds when his rally soldiers go to try and save the doll they blow up is something the commons is doing literally right now curly says it has to take as long meanwhile john curly over the national security advisory he said that mulligan asked hard questions about what the next face get a look and he said it has to take as long as they feel in needs in order to eliminate this threat well want the to be over a soon as possible the last thing we wanted to is telegraph to compass what there gone face the next weeks and month wile that is a again hurry has been way better on this than jakesullevan an mama hold over with tremendously stupid ideas about how the middle east actually works meanwhile israel is on to have to move up north ever bee nosing navy to move up north they are going to have to take on was ballet in the north because the ball again has two hundred thousand rockets pointed not only at the north o israel but all over israel israel has already move thirty thousand citizens off the borer they ben out of their homes for felon two months at this point what is truly amazing is to see the propagandists at work against israel with regard to the called two state solution let us be clear about this i mean itstruly mas they are people who very often i think to fine on cable to you do a decent oh on habit be they'll say things i wish israel and the blockade n occupation of gossip israel ended the occupation of gosh in two thousand five the only reason they left a blockade in place is because camps took over and if they had not had a blockade commas wo had been shipping in nothing but weapon real from turkey israel tried the whole two state solution thing by basically handing over the gossestrip two a terror group and they got october seventh and rocket attacks every five minutes their people in israel who left to live underground like weeks at a time because of the rocket attacks meanwhile in the wetback israel tried for thirty years to hand over the westbanke tote palsonian authority they had pieasteals that rejected in ninety four or two thousand two thousand one two thousand eight all of the piesteals walked away from by the palisonian authority an mew of people who keep mouthing the platitudes about the two state solution with whom with whom yesterday the israel ambassador to the puca hippy southerly so s asked by r for about the two state solution shes no by the way a prove for a cpuorncul two state solution ow among is release seven per cent why you think that is why do you think that is israillies have been tasiperatly attempting to hand control over palisonian arab areas two palisinan arab leadership for for decades at this point and no one will take them no one the tordanians will not take them the eruptions will not take them palsonian leadership will not take them because they would prefer to continue to promote the dead that they are going to destroy tell of even take it who exactly ism consistently amaze by the idea that the media know what the a their talking about they do not they say things two state solution is tot self manifesting if you say it enough times needle disappears if you say two state solution often enough a moderate arab leader onward allot ought appears and magically makes piece or alternatively the palistonians are extremely pro terror by every available pole the networks of terror running incredibly deep the educational system in not the wetback and the gosestrip promotes the murder of news and does since the time the palisonian youngsters are incredibly young but if you say prostate solution apparently this makes you magically immune from criticism and it makes you moral person and if you say no two state solution because its absolutely irrelevant and stupid to talk about a two state solution when when one of the parties to the conical solution does not exist then of course you are bad this the ridiculous gaming see being played by the media yesterday on sinews here was the frailly e ambassador to the aka this tell can totes ti i i think it is the ta honor t all to elite the also pop a fail ten the tether to october and we need to build the new o i in order to see a ne one included the palestinians living in ta state of therein think that would innactated the biggest question is what type of pitethinians i dote that it is what is a read they have eat say ten the one its obsoletely noon it'll tell you we wo then the i team come no o the onside the reason there is no israel is because the ate tote with it without offering wat as that to palestine how an the be piece is knows to day an the will should know now the waving the slaw costs fell is because the vote things never wanted to have a state next to israel they one cot the take from the river too the to the connection is then why are you furthest wet the former that never work that great that this critical people in the other that why youfeft wit the think about it this that homo to carry o wit the the notion the never war thin e pot the ate thing is kept on deny and now it is will create another tea state is wot is tot in totem of course she is correct of course she is correct by way jordan was in control of the west bank from nineteen forty eight to nineteen sixty seven and not once did they discuss the possibility of an independent palestonian state in the wetback egypt was in control of the gosistrip from nineteen forty eight nine sixty seven and no point did they discuss the possibility of an independent palestonian state why why is it there is no call for the grabs to do it why and the answer is cause everyone knew it would be a terror state immediately every one knew this where else in the world honest to god wells in the world is there an open actual call for the creation of a state every one her whose would be a terror state it is totally insane it is totally insane october seventh happens twelve hundred user slaughter another two hundred forty are taken prisoner captive into the gossistrip and the world is what sort of concessions can you offer what the is likes honest god it is saying after nine eleven to the united states should not you help set up in all kitostate in in afganniston a mean after all they handsome grievances should not you help set up and all kit state not just ta tarlatan state nail kitastate like specifically four those people shouldn't you d that what what sort of concessions can you offer them only israel demanded this sort of nonsense the testate solution was idiot she from the time it was initiated by sloe it was stupidity it was put forth by people summon paras who completely delusional about the way the world actually works he was actually believer at the time that borders would disappear in the telecast he was a believer in theine t the would be a giant confederation of news and grabs in the middle east that would be completely peaceful because economics would overtake everything else yet that worked how is great again it mouthing delusional notion about how the world works does not manifest the delusional notions it just gets people kill that what israel found out between solo and october seventh and now they are done what that and they should be done with that and people continued its made due crap two state solution without any leadership on the others israel would give he wetback to jordan to day and then wold e up to jordan to crate palisinian state you think jornwould do it jornwenyman take it born most take it israel has offered the gosistrip to the egyptians over and over the egyptians will not take it now just think about that for a second think not crazy that is the egyptians could take it and then they could set up a palistinian state they do not want it because they would not allow a palistinian state to be set up there there's be presumably engaging in exactly the same activities that israel engaging an right now in fact there is reason why egypt wont to low anybody from the gosistrip through their border it is not because they want the historic land claims of the palistinians in the gnosis strip to be maintained is rules inn care whether palistinians live there there is no actual jewfish claim to the got strip in any serious measure he go act to biblical times the gosistrip was never considered a part o biblical israel even there is never been a massive settling movement for example in the gozistrip there is som in the north of of the gosistrip and that was about it the guchkatif that is it the much kat region there were some people living there but it was never as though the gnosis strip was ever conterlicis very fundamental part of the biblical land of israel habit the bottom bottom line is israel evacuated it a if egypt if israel handed over to egypt and ago want crew apalstinans that it happen nothing the reason the egyptians while at thepalisinians in to the sign i desert is not because they are deeply worried about palistinian rights in gibalia it is because they are worried about palistinian people who are radicalized inside their own borers they do not want them pain

the poles are showing the jobiton continues to trail in every single battle ground according to media a new round o pulling in seven keying states boats poorly for preside en by an indicating he trails doll trumpet every single one and with soon he is down four two trump forty five forty one in georgia he is down six in michingan he is down four in pennsylvany he is down two in neat he is down three in north caroling he is down nine these are terrible numbers for jobidon in arizona he is down for very very bad numbers for mobile because again all of the focus right now is on bite now the bind administration is hoping that the federal reserve is going t save mobile that by bringing down the inflation rate they are gong o be able to basically bring down the interest rates several times next year loosening up the economy and leading to a feeling of prosperity in the united states current scion pierce shows tat yesterday saying that by comics his working because the stock market is at record hives look at it relieve the bionic the present ices tarot at the top of the briefing he is monaco of the walking he is on to talk about by enema by comic tan setting in america what what by comic has done but the america people coming out of the pandemic w cannot preset what happen when the present walk an we saw a wittily on the economy at a tails ben and the data shows as you just mention in your question inflation is moderating in you see a jobs created at more than poteen million jobs on employment is tat under for per cent all of those things is bite is are by comic and you will certainly hear the present talk more about that it well the president can talk about it however much he was the bottom line is that consumers right now are still spending because again they have that inflated money in their pocket they realized that the inflation is cooked into the books i takes ale while for people to realized the inflation has actually moderated e specially when inflation is still running at three plus per cent as oppose to two per cent which was the fads tar get rate the real problem here is that when you look at things the stock market corporate earnings are not actually keeping up with the stock market ray now people are invested in the stock market very pirates because the currency is inflated when the currency is in floated you stop investing bonds n you start investing in stocks hell now it appears that the on prices are going up because were not can be raising interest rates any time in the near future soon prices are going up this has also created feeling of economic health in the stock market people pouring money into the stock market the problem is then the stock market the p e ratios are really really high those be the price equity ratio the price earnings ratios those price earnings rations are really really highs benjamin ground the famed in vector who is sort of the inslectual god father of worn buffet he sought price burnings rations around fifteen tine that the price of the company should be a multiple of its earnings by about fifteen but no higher than that well right now the called magnificent seven which are the companies the are basically driving all of the growth in the stock market are a huge per centare of the growth in the stock market these would be company's nevidia apple amazon alphabet met microdot tesla those companies are up around seventy per cent year t date if you took them out of the escape five hundred the index would be up round six per cent as oppose to the i popping gains that your seeing in the broader stock market indicate the essence pe five hundred is to more than twenty one per cent far this year if you took out those seven companies it is up six per cent and the p rations on those companies is fifty five zero it's not sustainable in the long run p ratios of fifty that is betting very heavily those companies ere can beagle to ramp up their earnings obviously yes are to able to ramp up the earnings than the pricing mechanism is way out of wack the suggestion would be theoretically that when the inflation stops that the stock market will continue it hold stable the moneyofll be worth more people will essentially hold stable their stocks there not goings divas because lives taken money out of a a stock market that is done pretty well but stocks are over price is the reason my warn buffet is selling stocks right now and again in elation is not totally been conquered but the real problem here is going t be economic stagnation have time out gross output as a statistic for quite a while her gross output does not just measurer spending at the last layer of the economy which includes in enormous mount a government spending includes business start up in vestment and that is down the first couple quarters of twenty twenty three has been down nine per cent gross gross outlet yer i we seventeen a cue three stay yet on that i cannot imagine is can be very strong business starts i mean if it it is you are in business you feel it also i now if you rein business this is not a boom time nobody really thinks this is a bootie outside of a few quart companies meanwhile now

welcome to the hubermannc science science acetone i mandrhuberman and om a professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is doctor avid person professor of medical science neurobiology and opthomology at brown university doctor person's laboratory is credited with discovering the cells in the eye that set your circadian rhythms these are f the called intrinsically photo sensitive melonopsan cells and whole that is a mouthful all you need to know for a sake of this introduction is that those of the cells that in form your brain nobody about the time of day doctor person's laboratory has also made a number of other important discoveries about how we convert our perceptions of the outside world into motor action more personally doctor person has been my go to resource for all things hero science for nearly two decades i knew of his reputation as a spectacular recharter for a long period of time and then many years ago i cold called him out of the blue i a basically corralled him into a long conversation over the phone after which he invited me out to brown and we have been discussing serow science and how the brain works and the emerging knew technologies an the emerging new concepts in hero science for a very long time now you are going to realize today why doctor person is might go to force he has an exceptionally clear and organized view of how the nervous system works now there are many many parts of the nervous system different nuclide and connections and circuits and chemicals and forth but it takes a special kind of person to be able to organize that information into a structured and logical frame work that can allow us to make sense of how we function in terms of what we feel what we experience how we move through the world doctor person is truly one of a kind in his ability to synthesize and organize and communicate that information and i give him credit as one of my mentors and one of the people that i respect most in the field of science and medical science generally to day doctor person takes us on a journey from the periphery of the nervous system meaning from the outside deep into the nervous system layer by layer structure by structure circuit by circuit making clear to us how each of these individual circuits work and how they work together as a whole it is a really magnificent description that you simply cannot get from any text book from any popular book and frankly as far as i know from any podcast that currently exists out there it is a real gift to have this opportunity to learn from doctor been again i consider him my mentor in the field of learning and teaching hero science and ism excited for you to learn from him one thing is for certain by the end of this podcast you will know far more about how your nervous system works than the vast majority of people out there including many expert biologists and hero scientists before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigrens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstone come slash suberin and claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to today's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element dot come slash superman and now for my discussion with doctor avid burden welcome thank you so nice to be here great to have you for more than twenty years you have been my go to sours for all things nervous system how it works how its structured to day i will not ask you some question is about that i think people would gain a lot of insight into this machine that makes them thing can feel and see it ecetera if you would could you tell us how we see a photon of light enters the eye what happens right how is it that i look outside i see a truck drive by or look on the wall i see of photo of my dog how does that work right this is an old question obviously and clearly in the end the reason you have a visual experience is the your brain it is not some pattern of activity that associates with the input from the perfect but you can have of visual experience with no inlet from the perfect as well when your dreaming your seeing things that are not coming to your eyes are those memories hi would say in a sense they may reflect your visual experience there not necessarily specific visual memories but of course they can be but the point is that the experience of seeing is actually a brain phenomenon but of course under normal circumstances we see the world because it we are looking at it and underusing our eyes to look at it and fundamentally when we are looking at the exterior world it is what the retires telling the brain that matters there are sells called ganglia elves es are neurons there are the resells for communicating between eye and brain the eye is the camera it is detecting the initial image doing some initial processing and thin that signal gets sent back to the brain proper and of course it is there at the level of the quarter that we have this conscious visual experience there many other places in the brain that yet visual input as well doing other things with that kind of information right i get a lot of questions about color vision if you would could you explain how is it that we can perceive reds and greens and blues things of that sort right the first think to understand about light is that it is just a form of electro magnetic radiation ah its vibrating it is oscillating but into say it is vibrating calling you mean that photons are actually moving well in a sense futons are there certainly moving through space we think about photons as particles and that is one way of thinking about light but we can also think of it as a wave a radio way either way is acceptable and the radio waves have frequencies the frequencies on your radio dial and certain frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum can be detected by neurons in the rating those of the things we see but there still different ravelings within the light that can be seen by the eye and those different ravelings are unpacked in a sense are devoted by the nervous system to lead to our experience of color om essentially different ravelings give us the sensation of different colors through the auspices of different neurons that are tune to different ravelings of light when a a photon when a little bit of light hits my eye rides in the photo receptors convert that into electrical signal right how is it that a given photon of light gives me the perception eventually leaves the perception of red verses green verses blue right ah if you imagine that in the first layer of the retina where this transformation occurs from electromagnetic radiation into curl sin s that you have different kinds of sensitive cells they are expressing their making different molecules within themselves for this express purpose absorbing photons which is the first step in the process of seeing now it turns out that altogether there are about five probings this that we need to think about in the typical retina but for seeing color really its three of them that three different probings each absorbs light with the different hae preferred frequency and then the nervous system keeps tract of those signals a a comparison contrasts them to extract some understanding of the wavelike composition of light you can see just by looking at a landscape oh it must be late in the day because things are looking golden that is all function of our absorbing the light that is coming from the the world and interpreting that with our brain because of the different composition of the the the light that is reaching our eyes is it fair to assume that my perception of red is the same as your perception of red well that is a great question and that mine is better it is the great questions a deep philosophical question is a question that really probably cannot even ultimately be answered ah by the usual empirical scientific processes cuss is really about you now an individuals experience a what we can say is that the biological mechanisms that we think are important for seeing color for example seem to be very highly similar from one individuals the next whether it be human beings or other animals ah and we think that the physiological process looks very similar on the front and but what's your at the level of perception or understanding or experience that is something that is a little bit offered an nail down with the the sorts of a scientific approaches that we a approach biological vision with this i you mention that there are five different cone types essentially the cones being the cells that absorb light of different wavelengths a often wondered when i had my dog a what he saw and how his vision differs from our vision and certainly there are animals that can see things that we cannot see right what are some of the more outrageous examples of that of seeing animating in the extreme a a dogs i guessing see reds more as oranges is that right cause they they do not have t is the same array of of anurans that we have for first seen color right the first thing is is not really five types of come there really three types of cons and if you look at the way that color is s thought to work you can sort of see that it has to be three different signals there are couple of other types of pigments one is really mostly for dim like vision when you are walking around and a moonless night in your seeing things a i very low that is the red sell not uses is own pigment a and then there is another class of pigments will propeyou talk about a little bit later the smell and open pigment i thought you referring to culture violet and informed and and whips or riot in the case of a typical a well as put it this way in in human beings most of us have three condyles and we can see colors that debit that stem from that in most manners including your dog a or your cat there really are only two con types and that limits the kind of vision that they can have in the domain of wavelength or color as you would say really a dog sees the world kind of a particular kind of color born blind human might see the world because instead of having three channels to compare in contrast they only have two channels and that makes it much more difficult to figure out exactly which wavelength were you are looking at to a color blind people suffer much as the consequence of being color plant well we know were it its many other disabilities we are a i that the the world is built for people of the most common type in some cases the expectation can be there that somebody can see something that they will not be able to if they are missing one of their con types let say in those moments that can be a real problem a ye know if there is a lack of contrast to they visual system a will be blind to that in general is a fairly modest a visual a a limitation as things go for example if not be able to see acutely can be much more damage and not being able to read in a find print for example that's was fid to give up am a the ability to see certain colors or give up the abilities see clearly i certainly trade out color for clarity right of course colors very manful to us as human being a we would hate to give it up but obviously dogs and cats and all kinds of other mammals do perfectly well in the world tan because we tike care of them spend n here that on a if you care me to a let us talk about the that odd photopigmant am shot o pig men of course being thing that absorbs light of a particular wave length and let us talk about these specialized gangling sells that communicate certain types of information from eye to the brain that are important for many things what ism referring to hear of course is your r to discovery of the called intrinsically photosensitive sells the neurons in the eye that do many of the things that do not act shoes have to do with perception but have to do with importantmiological functions what i would love for you to do as a explain to me why once i heard you say we have a bit of fly i i and you showed this sly of a a giant fly from a horror move trying to attack this woman and maybe was an i also what does it mean that we have a bit of a fly i in our eye yew this is this last pigment is a really peculiar one am it one can think about it as really the initial sensitive element in i system this designed to tell your brain about how bright things are in your world ah and the thing that is really peculiar about this pigment is that it is in the wrong place in essence when you think about the structure of the rating you think about a layer case essentially you have got us this thin membrane at the back of your eye but is actually a stack of thin layers and the outermost of those layers is where these photorosceptors you were talking about earlier are sitting that is where the film of your camera is essentially that is where the photons do their magic with the photopigments in turn it into a hurry signal i that never really thought of the photorcepters as the film of the camera with the mic sense or the sensitive chip on no seedy chipping your in your siphon it is the surface on which the light pattern is imaged by the objects of the eye and now you have got in a ray of censors tit is capturing that information in creating a bit map essentially ah but suits in nerd signals distribute across the surface of the the retina all of that was known to be going on a hundred fifty years ago a couple of types of photocopiers phones and rods if you look a limit more closely three types of cons that is where the transformation from electrocuting at net radiation to a to neural signals was thought to take place but it turns out that this last photopigment is in the other end of the retina the innermost part of the remnant that is where the called ganglia sells are those of the pulls that talk to the brain the once that actually con communicate directly what information comes to them from the photo captors and here you have got a case where actually some of the output neurons that we did not think have any business being directly sensitive to light were actually making this photopigment absorbing light an converting that to neral signals in sending to the brain that made it pretty such surprising and unexpected but there many surprising things about these cells wan what is the relationship to the fly i the right t the length the is that if you ask how the photopigment now communicates downstream from the initial absorption event to get to the electrical signal that is a complex sol tor process above many chemical steps and if you look at how photoreceptor in our eyes work you can see what that cascade is how that chain works if you look in the eyes of flies or other insects or other invertebrates his a very similar kind of chain but the specifics of how the signal as yet from the absorption event by the pigment to the electrical response the nervous system can understand or characteristically different between fuzzy furry creatures us and insects for example the fly i say these funnyextra votoreceptors that bring the wrong lay or doing something completely different or actually using a chemical cascade that looks much more what you would see in a fly photos captor than what you would see in a human motor recept or rod or cone for example it sounds its a very primitive part of a primitive aspects of biology that we maintain exactly right the and despite the fact that dogs can see as many colors as we can and was can see as many colors as we can we have all this extravagant stuff for seen colorant then you get this other pigment sitting in the wrong not wrong but in a difference a part of the eye sending processing very differently right and sending that information into the brain what do these cells do i mean presume there there for a reason there are and the the interesting thing is that one sell time this carrying one kind of signal which i would call a brightness signal essentially can do many things in the brain when you say brightness signal you mean that it right now i have these sell have these e i dead in i stoking i hope i have these ells om i om and their paying attention to bright it is over all but they are not paying attention for instance to the edge of your ear or what else is going on in the room right it is the difference between knowing what the objects ore on the table and knowing whether it is bright enough to be daylight right now what white is your nervous system can been need to know whether it is daylight right now while one thing that needs know that is your circadian clock you if you travel across timezone to rope now your internal clock thinks it is californium time but the rotation of the earth is for a different part of the planet your the rising in setting of the sun is not at all what your body is anticipating you've got an internal representation of the rotation of the earth in your own brain that is your circadian system is keeping time but now you played a trick on your nervous is tom you put yourself into different place where the sun is rising it the cot wrong time let us not good for you right we you got to get back on track one of the things this system does it sends a oh it is daylight now signal to the brain which compares with its internal clock and if that is not right it weeks the clock gradually until you get over your jetlag an you feel back on track again the jet lag case makes a lot of sense to me but presume these a elements didn't of love for jetlag right what wat what are they doing on ha day to day basis right well one me to thing about this is that the clock that you haves in not just your brain in all the calls almost all f the sells of your body they are all oscillating you're all we know begot lot clock is little clocks an themselves there all they are all clocks am they need to be synchronized appropriately ah and the whole thing has to be built in biological machinery this is actually f beautiful story about how gene expression can control gene expression and if you set it upright you can set up a little thing that is sort of hums along at a particular frequency in our case it is humming along at twenty four hours cause us how our earthrottase it is all built into our biology this is great but the reality is that the clock can only be good we were talking about biology ere it is not precision engineering and it can be a little bit off w also it does not it is in our brain it does not have access to any regular unerring signal well if in the absence of the rising and setting of the sonnet does it if you puts something in a cave there biological clock will keep time to within a handful of minutes of twenty four hours that is no problem for one day but if this went on without any correction eventually you be out of phase and this is actually one of the things that blind patience off and complain about i they have got recall blindness is in sonic and whore's ant's abating that ring an a exactly there not synchronize our clock is there but they are drifting out of phase because our clocks only good to you have twenty four point to hours or twenty three point eight hours thill by little your drifting you need a synchronization signal even if you never across time s boson of course we did not back on the banana we stayed within walking distance of where we were ah you still need a synranizer as otherwise you have nothing to actually confirm one the rising the setting of the sun is that is what you are trying to synchronize yourself to ism fascinated by the circadian clock and the fact that all the sells of our body have essentially at twenty four hour is clock in them right we are a lot about these circadian rhythms incircuten clocks the fact that we need light in put from these special neurons in order to set the clock but have never really heard it described how the clock itself works and how the clock signals to all the rest of the body when on the livers should be doing one thing in mat stomach should be doing another i know you have done some work on the clock if you would just may be briefly describe where the clock is what it does and some of that you know top contour of how it tells the cells of the body what to do i the first thing to say is that is you said the clock is all over the place most of the tissues in your body have clocks i we probably have what millions of clock yen we say that is best promptly fair you have millions of saltines you might may have millions of clocks am that the roll of the central pacemaker for the circadian system is to to ordinate all of these and this is it's a little nucleus a little a collection of nerve cells in your brain this called the supercaismatic nucleus the s and ah and it is sitting in a funny place for the rest of the structures in the nervous system that yet direct retinal input its sitting in the heyghpoth flames which you can think about as sort of the great to coordinator of drives and the source of all our pleasures and all our problems right or most our problem yes it really is but it is sort of u now deep in your brain things that drive you o do things if you freezing cold you put on a cod you you you shivery all these things are to ordinate y the hypotalemas this pathway tit were talking about from the retina and from these picul ourselves that are coding light intensity a sending signals directly into the center that is surrounded by all of these centers that control autonomic nervous system and a your hormonal systems am this is a part of your your visual system that does not really reach the level of consciousness it is not something you you think about it is happening under the raid our kind of all the time ah in the signal is working its way into the this central clock to coordinating center now what happens then is not that well understood but it is clear that this is a neral center that has the same ability to communicate with other parts of your brain is any other neral center an clearly there are circuits that involve connections between neurons that a you are conventional when in edition is quite clear that there are also her humoral effects that things are being a using out of the cells ah in the center and may be into the circulation or or just a diffusing through the brain to some extent that can also effect a her on allsweare but the hpathalemes uses everything to control the rest of the bodies and that is true the supercasmatic neuclyas this this circadian center is well ah it can get its dangerous into the autonomic nervous system the humoral system and of course up to the centers of the brain that organized to ordinate rational behavior i understand correctly we have the scrub of cells the superior magnucleus it is got a twenty four hour whither that rhythm is more or less match to what is going on in our external world by the specialized set of means in our eye but then the that the master clock itself the us and release is things in the blood humoral signals on that go out serious places in the body and the said to the autonomic system which is regulating for less on alert or calm we are as well as our thinking in our cognition ism the i love to talk to you about the autonomic part a presume that is through melatonin it is through on a drentlan hollow is it that that of this clock is impacting how the autonomic system how alert or calm weep we feel right there there are pathways by which the supercasmatic nuclear can access with the parts pathetic and sympathetic nervous system just people know the sympathetic nervous system is one that tends to make us more alert than the parasympathetic nervous system is the portion of the autonominervous system makes us feel more calm right in in brought first yet to first approximation wright this is both of these systems are within the grasp of the circadian system through hrypithylamic circus one of the circuits that will be i think of particular interest to some of your liststeris is a pathway that involves this sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system the fight or flight system that is actually through a very curious rule innervating the pineal gland which is sitting in the middle of your brain the called third eye right this is love to get back to why it is call the third eye because ye that is an interesting can altagangs the third eye and that adjusted to leave at thirsleave it there right right anyway this is the major source of monotone into your body light comes in to my eye yes passed off to the supervise magic nucleus eventually not the light itself but the the sitting a representing the light sure then the es and the supervise magnucaliis can impact the maletonan system right v my the pineal right the way this is seen is that if you were to measure your monotone and level over the course of the day if you could do this hour by hour you would see that it is really low during the day very high at night but if you get up n the the night and go to the bathroom and turn on the rightful or at floorman light your melotonea level is slam to the floor light is directly impacting your here mortal levels o through this mechanism that we just described this is one of the routs by which light can act on your or mortal stay is to pathways that are completely beyond what you normally would think about right you are thinking about the the things in the bath real there is the tooth brush nor this the tube of toothbays but meanwhile this other system is just counting photons and saying oh what its lot of protons right now let us shut down the milestone and release that this is one of the main reasons why have encouraged people to avoid bright light exposure in the middle of the night not just blue light but bright light of any wave length because there is the myth out there that blue light because it is the optimal signal for activating this pathway and shutting down megaton and is the only wave length of light that can shut it down but i i correct in thinking that if a light is bright enough right it does not matter of its blue light green light purple light even red light right you are going to slam millstone and down to the ground which is not a good thing to happen in the middle the night right right m any any light will affect the system to some extent the blue light is somewhat more effective but do not full yourself to in into thinking that if you use red light that means your you are avoiding the effect you sis certainly still there and certainly tit is very bright it will be more effective in driving the system than dim blue light would be interesting a lot of people wear blue lockers om and in a kind of odd twist of miss information out there a a lot of people hear blue lockers during the middle of the day which basically makes no sense because during the middle of the day is when you want to get a lot of bright light and including blue light into your eyes correct absolutely and not jobs for the reasons were been talking about in terms of circadian effects there major effects of light on moon ah and seesaw effective disorder apparently is essentially a reflection of this same system in reverse if your living in the northern climes and you are not getting that much light during the middle of the the winter in stock om am you might be pro into depression and photo there if you might be just the ticket for you and that is because there is a direct effect of light on mood was there isn't example where if you do not have enough light it is a problem i think your exactly right is not about is light good or bad for house about what kind of light and when ah that that makes the difference at the general will a thumb that have been living by is to get as much bright light in my eyes ideally from sunlight any time i want to be alert stand doing exactly the opposite when i want to be asleep we are getting drowsy and and there there aspects of this that it spin out way beyond the conversation were having now to things this it turns out that the incidents of my open near suddenness your sightedness right is strongly related to the amount of time that kids send out doors and in what direction of effect the more they spend time outdoors the less hear sightedness they have tit tells out because there viewing things at a distance or because they are getting a lot of blue light is a sunlight it is a great question it is not fully resolve what the epidemiological what the basis of that epidemiological finding is one possibility is the amount of light which would make me think about this meonobsin system again but it might very well be a question of accommodation that is the process by which you focus on near or far things if you are never out doors everything is near by if you are out doors your focussing far sans us here on your hon right exactly which there is a tremendous amount of interests these days in your watches and things that count steps at beginning to realize that we should probably have a device that can count futons during the day and can also count futons at night and tell us hay you getting too many futons you gin a shut down your milestone an at night or you are not getting enough futons to day you did not get enough bright light whether not from artificial lighter from sunlight that i guess the where would you put i easy gallant of your head or you probably want it some place outward facing right it probably what you need is as many futons over as much of the retain as possible to recruit as much of the system as possible in thinking about other effects of this non image forming pathway that involves these special sells in the eye in these and you had a paper a few years ago looking at retinal in put to an airy of the brain i which has a fancy name the pry hobenula but nameston't necessarily matter that had some important effects on mood and other aspects of of light but maybe you tell asylobit about what is the perry hobenula oh well that is a fancy term but i think the way to think about this is is a chunk of the brain that is sitting as part of a bigger chump that is really the linker between puerperal sensory in put of all kinds virtually all kinds a whether it is auditory in pud or tactile in put a or visual put to the region of your brain the quarter that allows you to think about these things and make plans around them and to integrate them in that that kind of thing a a you now we have known about a pathway that gets from the retina through this sort of linker center called the thalamus and then on not syce tringitasexactly but you want to arrive at the destination right now you are grandcentral and now you can do u your thing as you are up at the quarter this is the the standard pattern you have since you input coming from the prefer you have got these primeval elements that are your doing the initial stages of the a the i o skin of your finger tips rain now that the tastebuds on your tongue they are takings raw information in and they are doing some reprocessing maybe or you the early circuits are but eventually most of these signals halve to pass through the gateway to the quarter which is the thalamus and we have known for years for for decades many decks what the major throw put pathway from the retina to the carte is and where it finds up ins up the visual quarter know you pat the back of your head that is where the were the receiving the center is for the main pathway from retina to garter but wait a minute there is more there is this little side pathway it goes tho different part of that linking famous center the going the cart a local train ya from grand centurallas ins in a weird part of the negro it right is t it is a completely different its it is a little trunk line that branches off and goes out into the hinter lands and it is going to the part of this linker center that is talking to a completely different part of court takes way up front front lobe which is much more involved in things planning or a self image or i average literally how on with you us oneself and if you feel good about yourself or i not what is your plan for next thursday a now it is it is a it is a very high level center in the highest level of your nervous system and this is the region that is getting input from this pathway which is mostly worked out in function by want ritard love i know you had him on the pod can leaden talk about this path this pathway all right i a day of a a verandas and and ramekin the folks at work with them we are able to show that this pathway does not exist and get you to a weird place but if you active tit at kind of the wrong time of day animals can become depressed and if you silence it under the right circumstances then weird lighting cycles that would normally make them act sort of depressed no longer have that effect it sounds to me there this pathway from i to this unusual train rout through the the structure we call the thalamus then up to the front of the brain that relates to things of self perception can a higher level functions i find that really interesting because most of what i think about when i think about these fancy well or the primitive rather a grants that do not pay attention to the shapes of things but inside to brightness i think of well it regulates tell atone an eccircating clock mood hunger the really kind of am vegetative life if you well right and this is interesting because i think a lot of people experienced depression not just people that live at in scananaviaan the mi winter and we are very much divorced from our normal interactions with light it also makes me realize that these intrinsically photo sensitive cells that set the clock et camera a in involved in a lot of things i mean they seem to regulate a dozen or more different basic functions i want to ask you about a different aspect of the visual system now which is the one that relates our sense of balance i i love boats but i hate being on them love the ocean from shore because i get incredibly seasick have just it is all i thimlan get sea sick if i think about it too much and once i went on a boatshep i came back and actually got i got motion say or was not seasick as tough it uprating there is a system that somehow gets messed up that was tell us of your feeling sick to look at the horizon et camera et camera and what is the link between our visual system and our balance system and why does it make its noxious sometimes when the world is moving in a way that were not accustomed to i realize this is a big question because it involve i movements et camera but let us maybe just walk in at the simplest layers of vision we stimulator socle balance system and then maybe we can piece the system together for people said hat they can understand and then also we should give them some tools for adjusting there a naris when there an their vestibule's system is to a wack to that i mean t think the versing to think about is that it is tubular system is i designed to allow youth see how your ore detect sense how your moving in the world through the world am it is a funny one because it is o your moving in relationship to the world in a sense and yet it is sort of interceptive in the sense that it is really the incensing the movement of your own body o cause in terruseption we should proxy delicate for people as when your focussing on your internal state gets s a thing outside you right it is is is it a it is a gravity sensing it is it well it is partly a gravity sensing system in the in the sense that gravity is a force tit is acting on you as if you were moving through the world in the opposite direction are now you exam a o o a case basically the idea is that if we leave gravity inside were us sitting in in a in a car in the passenger seen and a driver it is the accelerator and you start moving forward you sense that if your eyes were close you would sennit if your ears were plugged in your eyes were close you would still know it that many people take off on the plain this the dreading the flight and they know on it the plan is taking up sure that is your vestibular system talking because anything that jostles you out of the current position your insight now will be detected by the tubular system pretty much a this is a complicated system but it is basically in your inner your ear very close to where you are hearing him but it the i thousand i do not know my is no u er dot arrived i just getting as to steal our friend rob van elder's explanation we were not consult to the design face and known as i that is a gratin eye that is that is the great one am but it is interesting it is in the ear yah it is i lot's deep in there and is served by the same nerve actually it is serves the hearing system one way to think about it is both the hearing system and the vestibular self motion sensing system are really detecting the signal in the same way there hairy cells and they're excitedly er yes or have they got little silly as sticking up off the surfaces and depending on which way you bend those i selswill either inhibited or excited they are not even neurons but then they talk to servants with a ran process and off you go now you have got in auditory signal if your censing things bouncing around in your coaly vicious is sympathetically the bouncing of your ear drum which is unsympathetically the soundwaves in the world but in the case of the vestibular apparatus evolution is built to system that detects the motion of say fluid going by those hairs and if you put a censor that in ta too that is fluid filled now you have got a censor that will be active ate when you wrote to at that too around the access that passes through the middle of it those you were just listening in will not be la the only says a using of it is three whoops three whole standing up one lying down on the ground hone o the other on the other three ay directions i know the people who fly will talk about role pitch in y'all that kind of thing three axes of in coming just in the calms of the vas no and then i w say it is and then the puppy end till you the puppy hood till yes that is the other one the the point is that your your brain is eventually going to be able to unpack what these censors are telling you about how you dislocated your head in very much the way that the three types of cones we were talking about before are reading the in coming futons in the wavelength don't mean differently and if you enter hearinyet you think wear intrust to get readying blue it seembisic idea if you have three censors and you ray them properly not e can tell if your rotating your head left a right uptown that is the sensory signal coming back into your brain confirming that you just made a movement that you will but what about on the plain because when ism on the plain on complete stationary the plains moving my head has not m right ism just moving forward gravity's constant exactly so as i know am exploring what's happening now is your brain is sensing the motion and the the brains smart enough also to to ask itself did i will that movement or did that come from the outside now terms of sort of understanding what the the vestibular signal means is got to be imbedded in the contact of what you tried to do or what u your other centuries a systems are telling you about what is happening i o as very interesting i but it is not conscious or least if it is conscious is her i not conscious it is deviling very fast i the moment that plain starts moving i know that i did not get up an in char and run forward right but ism not really thinking my getting about in my chair but still i guess the way i think about it is that the nervous system is quote aware at many levels when it gets all the way up to the quart demand were thinking about it you are talking about it that is cortical but the lower levels of the brain that do not require you to actually actively think about it they are just doing their thing are also made aware right a lot of this is happening under the surface of what you are thinking these are reflexes we have got this gravity sensing system right for ism noting for those caressing for a yes movement of the head and no movement of the head or the telling of the head from side to side and then you said that knowledge about whether or not activation of that system comes from my own movements or something acting upon me the plain moving has to be combine with other signals and how is the visual information or information about the visual world combined with balance information right i it i guess maybe the best way to think about how these two systems work together it is to think about what happens when you suddenly routine your head to the left when you suddenly wrote to your head o the left your eyes are actually rotating to the right automatically you you do this in complete darkness if you had an eye inform red camera and watch yourself in complete darkness you cannot see anything yourotining your head to the left your eyes would rotate to the right that is your vestibular system saying it is ism going to try to compensate for the head rotation my eyes are still looking in the same place why is that useful well if it is always doing that then the image of the world on your retina will be pretty stable most of the time and that actually helps vision have they built his into the cameras for a image stabilization was when i move when i take a picture with my one it is blurry it is not it is not clear well actually you might want to get a better fall because now what they have is soft ware in the better abs that will do a kind of image stabilization post hawk by doing a registration of the images that are bouncing round they say this the edge of the house was here let us get that aline at each of your images you may not be aware if you are using a good new phone that if you walk around a a landscape and hold your fan that you know this all this image stabilization going on but it's built into standard cinematic technology now because we try to do a hand hold camera things we be bouncing around things mud be unwatchable you would not be able to really understand what is going on in the scene the the brain works really hard to mostly stabilize the image of the world on your had new o corse you are moving through the worlds you cannot stabilize everything but the more you can stabilize most of the time the better you can see and that is why when we are scanning a scene looking around at things we are making very rapid i movements for very short periods of time and then we direst but we are not the only ones that do that if you ever watch a humming bird does exactly the same thing an a feeder right shit's for tits body coulis is going to make a quick movement and then as could by stable and when you watch a pigeon walking on the side walk it does this funny head bobbing thing but what is really doing is racking its head back on its back while its body goes forward that the image of the visual world staystatic as that weather to yes and you you have seen a funny chicken videos on you two right you have take or chicken move it up and down the leastways in one place it is all the same thing all of these animals are trying hard to keep the image of the worlds stable on their get in as much of the time as they possibly can and then when they've got to move make it fast make it quick and then stable as a gator the piss of their deadbeat it is we i ma fancy to pause there for and the just that amazing case people are not well there is no reason why people would know what we are doing here but a sensual what we are doing is we are building up from sensory light on to the eye ma color to what the brain does with that the integration of that aspirating clock millstone et camera and now what we are doing is returning about mouth sensory were mouth motel combining one sense vision with another sense balance right and it turns out the pigeons no more about this than i do because pigeons know to keep their feedback as they walk forward right all right that gets us to this issue of motion sickness right and if you don't have to go out on a boat any time i go to new york i sit in an user or in a cab in the back and if ism looking at my phone while the cars driving i feel nations by time i arrive at my destination right i always try and look out the front of the wind shield because ism told that helps but it is a little tiny window right and i love feeling slightly less sick if i do that what is going on with the vision and the balance system that causes the kind of a nausea and i she if i keep to o the city old do not throw up easily but but for some reason motion sickness as it is a real thing for it is a proper lot of people in i think throw the fundamental problem timidly when you get motion sick is what they call visual vestibular conflict that is you have two sensory systems they are talking to your brain about how you are moving through the world and as long as they agree you are bine if you are driving you are body senses that you are moving forward your vistiburo systems you is is picking up this acceleration of the car an your visual system is seeing the consequences forward motion in the sweeping of the scene past to you everything is hawk door wrist no problem but when you are headed forward but you are looking at yourself on what is your witnessing your redness seeing the stable image of the screen there is absolutely no motion in that for the motion visor some other motion at some mongofyour it if you are playing a game or you are watching o vedic a football game the motion is uncoupled with what is actually happening to your body your brain does not that your brain likes everything to be it a line and if it is not it is going complain to you a ton you may feel i making if noel noxious and may you'll change your behaviors you are getting an going punished yah for for for for setting it up iran in lit it by the vestibular you will learn visuals in ti i love it m i love the idea of of reward signals and we have done a lot of a discussion about the son the podcast of things opening reward and things but also punishment signals and them i love this example a well maybe marching a la bit further along this pathway am visual in put is combined with balance in put where does that occur and maybe cause i have some hint of where it occurs i you could tell little bit about this a kind of mysterious many brain ah that the call the saraparowe ye the way i tried to describe the serabellam to my students is that it serves sort of the eritraffic control system functions in hour travel that it is a systems very complicated an is really dependent on great information it is takin in information about everything that happening everywhere not only through your sensory systems but is listening into all the little center is elsewhere in your brain they are confuting what you gang to be doing next and forth it is just ravenous for that kind of information t really is a lo many bray it is as it is it is got access to all those signals am and it really hasn't important rule in can in in coordinating and shaping movements but if you suddenly eliminated our traffic control system plaints could still take off and land but you might have some unhappy accidents inn the process the serablum's godlike that it is not that you would be paralyzed if your say serabalem was gone because you still have motormarads you stop ways to talk to your muscles a you still have reflex centers and it is not you oud have any sensory loss because you still have your matrix getting all those beautiful signals that you can think about but you would not be to coordinating things well any more the timing between input and output might be off or if you were trying to practice a new athletic move an overhead serving tennis you be justerrible at learning that all the sequences of muscle movements and the feed back from your centuries apparatus that would let you really get that ball exactly where you wanted to after the tenth rep brightening o the thousandth rep or something get much better at it the sermons all involved in things motor learning and refining the precisions of of movements that they get you where you want to go if you reach for a glass of champagne that you do not knock it over or stop short a it has et yogin people who have selective damage to the sarabellum absolutely and and what i cam familiar with am coursicoughs is is different right is not that o evite deficiency from inchronicalca holding we and they have a they tend o walk on a bow legged and they cannot ornate their movements is that that has some that ism here cameras ayoleer also sarabellum ism not sure about the sarbeller involvement there but they the typical thing would be a patient has a sarabellear stroke or a tumor for example am might be am not that steady on their feet if if the a dynamics of the situation you standing on a s on a street car with your with not to pull the whole on to they might not be as good it adjusting all the little movements of the car am and know this a kind of tremor that can occur as their reaching for things am because they reach a little too far and the they over correct and come back a things that it is it is very common neurological a phenomenon actually a sarbeller a taxies is what the nauralegis call it and it can happy not just with sarabelor damage but damage to the tracts that feed the information intern barbell an evil it structures aptly or output from the sarabellum and the flabellum is wear a lot of visual and and balance information is combined in a very keef place in the sarabellum which is a it is really one of the oldest parts intimas of floes the flocculus right this is it it is a critical place in the sarabellum were visual in the similar information comes together for costing just the kinds of movements we were talking about this image stabilizing network its all happening there and there is learning happening there as well that if your vestibular apparatus is a little bit damage somehow your visual system is actually talking to your sarabellum saying there is a problem here there is an error and your sarabillum is learning to do better by increasing the output of the the tubular system to compensate for whatever that loss was is a little irrecorrection system that sort of typical of sarabeller function and it can happen in many many different to mes this is just one of the domains of sensory motor integration that at explain sir i should say off my for in the users if among a boat i should assent look and as much as possible act as if ism driving the the machine right ism that bewared if i was in the passengers see pretending on striving the machine but i do always feel better from sitting in the front seat passenger right sore of the of the visual world that you can see as if you were actually the one doing them i motion i would think butts stay in the inner ear for a minute as we continued a march around the nervous system when you take off in the plain or when you land or sometimes the mill o there your ears get closed last my ears get clogged that is because of pressure build up in the various tubes of the inner ear et camera will get into this but years ago our good our good friend garvey carton is a another world class near anatomist give a lecture and it talked about how plugging your nose and blowing out verses plugging your nose and sucking in can should be done at different times depending on whether not your taking off or landing and i always see people try to upon their ears right and when you you scoudaving you hear how to do this without necessarily can to it i my just con to moving my john now was have done it all bit of diving but what is the story there ism we do not hae to get into all the differences is an atmospheric pressure et camera but from taken off in my ears are plugged your have recently ascended play a off mars are plugged do i plug my nose and blow out or y plug my nose and suck and right t mastic idea is that if you are ears feel bad because you are going into an area of higher pressure t a pressure rise the cabin more than the pressure that you have on the surface of the planet your ear drums would be bending in and they do not that you mig push a more that her even at single description that you know the pressure goes up then hopes bandana ant in in in the reverse would be true if you go into an arrive low pressure if standing to drive up the mountain side you are the precious getting lower and lower outside now the inside the ear behind your your drum is balloon out ye right is just a question of n are you train to get more pressure or less pressure behind the ear drum in this little tube that does then comes down into your n occur throat there and you force pressure up that too you can be putting more ear pressure into the compartment the counter i if if it is if it is not enough and if you are sucking you are going the other wag in reality i think as long as you open the passage way i think that impressure differentials can solve your problems i think you could actually blow in when you are not quotes pose to esse you could just bring your nose and blow air out or hold your nose and suck in the right a fact either ways fine i think i m excellent you just i just one a hundred dollars from r i n very much as a lock we harry nice the teacher anatomy together else i do not think it matters but thank you rs i it'll split ill split that with you on the is a this is important stuff a but but its sure you hear this it does not matter e other way i i know expert in this area dowery do not will not mes i can a n on but o case we have talked about the inner year we talked about the sarabelum i want to talk about an area of the brain that is rarely discussed which is the mid brain yet and for those the do not know the mid brain is an area beneath the cart i guys we never really defend quarter was outer layers or are the outer layers of the least mammalian brain a human brain but the mid brain is superinteresting because it controls a lot of unconscious stuff reflexes et camera and then there is this phenomenon even called blind sight could please tell us about the midbrain about what it does and what in the world is blind sight yes this is a it's a lot of pieces there a i think the first thing to say is if you imagine the nervous system in your mind's eye you see this big haunting brain and then the is little within little a on that dangles down into your vertical can the spinal cord and that kind of your visual impression am what you have to imagine is starting in the spinal crud working your way up into this big magnificent brain and what you would do as you enter the skull is get into a little place where the spinal cordon a thickens out it still has that sort of long scheme trunk feelings were a paddle or a spoonshape right it stretched spread out a little but thank as your you evolution's packed more interesting goodies in there for processing information and generating movement beyond that is this tween brain we were talking about us long this linker rain with dying suffleon really means the the between road that atween all yes gets none a o then between as assignment said tween tats the between it is at between brain as is what the the name means is the linker from the spinal cord in the periphery up to these grand centers of the quarter but this mid brain your talking about is the last bit of this enlarged sort o spinal forty thing in your skull which is really the brainstorm is what we call it the last bid of that before you get to this repay up to the quarter is the mid brain and this we really important visual center there it is called the superior colliculus ah there is a similar center in the brains of other vertebrate animals of frog for example or a lizard would have this is called the optic rectum there but it is on a center then in these non mammalian a vertebrates is really the main visual center ah then really have what we d call a visual qartexle of there is something sort of that but this where most of the action is in terms of interpreting visual input and of organizing behavior around that you can sort of think about the this region of the brainstorm is a reflex center that can re orient the animals a gaze or body or may be even attention to particular regions of space out there around the animal and that could be all for all kinds of reasons i in it might be appreciator is showed up in one corner of the forest and you pick that up an your trying to avoid it which is any movement many movement right it might be that sudden we a something splats on the page when you're reading a novel and and your eye reflect looks at it you are have to think about that that is a reflex what if you throw me o ball ism not expecting it right i just reach up in and trying habit right or not right is that to handled by the misbrand well that is probably not the mid brain although it coming by itself because it is going to involve all these him movements this movement of your arm and body ah and was i ducking an that o suddenly thrown agha sure right things that ort will certainly have a brainstorm component midbrain component on something looms and you dock a it may not be the superior colliculus were talking about now might be another part of the visual midbrain but these are centers that emerged early in the evolution of brains hours to handle complicated visual events that have significance for the animal in terms of space we is it in space and in fact the same center actually gets input from all kinds of other sensory systems that take information from the external world from particular locations and where you might want either avoid or approach things according to their significance to you you getting put from the touch system yo getting put from the auditory system i work for a while in rattlesnakes they getting put from a part of their om warm enters on their face there in these little pits on on the face circus baby rattlesninks sir the they adult it o i was not hin to diminish the danger i have for some reason they were little ones no i in the world would you work on rattlesnins well because they have a version of an extractive sensory system that is there looking out into the world using a completely different set of censers they are using the same censors that would feel the warmth on your face if you stood in front of a bonfire except evolution is given them this very nice specialized system that let us them image wear the heats coming from you can sort o do that anyway right if you walk around the fire you can feel which fer the faeries from the the n of the heat hitting your face is that in senary way in which they detect praise one of one of the major ways and in fact the vision is well and they bring these two systems together in the same place in this sector regions brainstorm trains on each on jutting about when the thinks that i do not know that may be old factory there made there sniffing the air with there on an the may be a as we a drive you told me that flies actually tasting with their feet vessel have they have taste scepters and lots of funny places i but i want ta pause here just for one second before we get back into the mid brain i think what is interesting in all seriousness about taste receptors on feet heat censors tongues cutting nowt of snakes and vision in all this integration is that it really speaks to the fact that all these sensory neurons are trying to gather information ran stuff it into a system that can make meaning full decisions and actions and that it really does not matter whether or not it is coming from eyes or ears or nose or bottoms of feet because in the end it is just electricity flowing in and it is it it sounds gits placed on each animal always feels were to call flying animal but they are enters at they are animals a it is place in different locations on different animals depending on the particular needs of that animal right but how much more powerful if the nervous systems can also cross cuirrely a cross sensory systems if you have got a weak signal from one century sitting you're not quite sure there is something there and a weeks signal from a another censor y sister tabs tell meg the same locations is is a little b interesting there might be something there you have got those two together you have got corroboration your brain now says it is much more likely that that iscnyou do not be something worth paying attention to is o maybe i am feeling some heat on one side of my face and i also smell something baking in the oven right now there is it is neither is particularly strong but as you said there some corroboration right and that corroboration as o cursing in the mid brain right and then if you throw things into conflict now the brain is confused and that may be where you are your motion sickness comes from it is great to have as a as a brain is great to have as many sources and information as you can have just if you are a you now your your a spy or a journalist you do not want as much information as can get about what is out there but if things conflict that is problematic right your sources are giving you differinformation bout what is what is going on now you've got a problem on your hands what you publish the mid brain is fastening i i do not want it eject us from the midbrain and go back to the vestibule's system but i do have a question that have forgot to ask about the vestibular system which is why is it that for many people including me there is despite my motions sickness and caps that there is a sense of pleasure in moving through space and getting tilted relative to the gravitational pull of the earth for me growing up it we skateboarding but people to corner in cars corner on bikes it may be for some people it is done running or dance but what is it about moving through space and getting tilted was server s around here getting tilted that can tap into some of the pleasure center is we have any idea why that would fly ad no clues their noblemen eight can put to the m system well the dopemenergic system gets a lot of places i it is pretty much to some extent everywhere in the quarters a lotmore in the front a lobe of course but that is just for starters i mean there is basically doormen urging innervation most places in the central nervous system there is the potential for dolmen urging involvement but i really have no clue about the tilting phenomenon i meaning you do not pay money to go on roller coasters right well i think that may be as much about the thrill is any jury and falling as the falling reflects very robust in all of us i in the visual worlds going up very fast the inlemeans that were falling right but am some people that some people do not right and kids kids tolerate a lot more a sort of stibutor crazing is spinning around until they top and i not we have friends it always words me lot bit that will they throw their kids ism not recommending and do this when they are low kids throwing the kids really far back and forth am can some can seem to love it your s ism love being shaken up and down very very i vigorously that's the only thing that would come down sometimes interesting yes o ism guessing we can we can a get that may be there is some activation of the reward systems from you being moved moving through space well tot me if you think about you how rewarding it is to be able to move through space and how unhappy people are who were used to that who suddenly are not able to do that there is a a sense of agency ready if you you can choose to move through the world and to tilt tots not only moving through the world but you are doing with a certain amount of finals maybe that is what it as you can feel your the master of your own movement in a way that you would not if you are going straight ism ism just join smoke here know o we can speculate that is fine i i cannot help but ask the question we case if we i move ourselves impugn intended back into the midbrain the mid brains combining all these different signals for reflective action at what point does this become deliberate action because if i look at something i want in i we pursuit am going to go toward it and many times that is a deliberate decision right this gets very slippery i think because what you have to try to imagine is all these different parts of the brain working on the problem of staying alive you know in surviving and in in the world a they're working on the probe simultaneously and there is not one right answer to how to do that o but the one way to think about it is that you have high levels of your nervous system the are very well designed to override and other wise automatic movement if its n appropriate if you imagine you have been invited to tea with the queen an she hands you ah your very fancy wedge would you teacup very thin wedge would tea yes with very hot tea in it you are burning your hand you probably will try to find a way to put that back down on the saucer rather than is dropping on on the floor because you are with the queen you u know your trying to be appropriate to that you have ways of raining in automatic behaviors if they aregongto be maladaptive but you also want the reflex to work quickly if it is the only thing is can to save you the looming you know object coming at your head don't have time to think about that this is the interplay in these hierarchically organized centers of the nervous system at the lowest level you have got the automatic censers that in centers and reflex you a arks that will keep you safe even if you do not have time to think about it and that you have got the her center saying well ma bye could do this as well or may you we should not do that at all right you have all these different levels operating simultaneously and you need by directional communication between high level cognitive centers decision making on the one hand and these low love a very healthful reflex of centers but they are little rigid little hard wired they need some new ane this they are both of these things are operating interim in real time all the time on our brains and sometimes yo listen more to one than the other you have for people in sports talking about messing up at the playhouse they overwrought it your thinking too hard about it that is partly you've very trained your sir barbell that it a fastball right on the middle right and if you start looking for for something you ore different you are going to mess up your your reflex give swing right if you are trying to think about the physics of the ball as is coming at you you have arty miss right because you r you are not using your this all those rests have built a kind of knowledge is what you want ta rely on when you do not have enough time to a contemplate this is important and a great sexual for what it'd to discuss next wit it which is the bail ganglia this really interesting in the merry of the brain that is involved in go type commands and behaviors instructing us to do things and no go preventing us from doing things wit much of motor learning and skill execution and ism not saying the wrong thing ore sitting still in class when or as you used with that tea with the queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior and sometimes it is activating behavior y o tremendous amount of on line attention as devoted to ism trying to get people motivated if this is not the main focus of our outguess we touch on some of the underline girl circuits of of motivation open me and forth but much of what people struggle with out there or elements around failure to pay attention or o challenges in paying attention which is essentially putting the blinders on air you getting a to straw f yow of the world and maintaining that for a bout of work or something of that sort and trying to get into action of course this is carried out by many marry circuits not just the basil ganglia but what are the bail ganglia and what are their primary roles in controlling go tight behavior and no go tight behavior yes i me to et the basil angle are sitting deep in what you would call the four brains or the highest levels of the brain they are sort of cousins to the cerebral cartel which we talked about is her the highest level of your brain the the thing you are thinking with threblecorte been the refined cousins and then you have get the ray the brutes ya i may that is probably totally unfair but get at sir the basil gangly i can relate underparts of the brain though but to hi patrol mallow is a basil ganglia sure we need it all we need it all and i this aired of the brain has gotten a lot bigger as the cartel has gotten bigger and it is deeply intertwined with cortical function the cortex cannot really do what it needs to do without the help the basil gangly and vice verse there really intertwined a and in a way you can think about this logically is saying if if you have the ability to with whole behavior or to execute it how do you decide which to do well the cortex's can have to do that thinking for you you have to be looking at all the contingencies of your situation o decide is this ta crazy move or is this really smart investment right now or en of what i do not want to go oft for run in the morning ism going to make myself go out for run or ism having a great time out on a run and i know i need to get back unkind one to go another mile i mean another great example is that you are the marshall o test for the little kids they can get two marshall as if they hold off just thirty seconds initially they can have one right away but if they can wait they seconds they got to you now that is the no go because their cortex is saying yuan i really to have two more them having one but they are not con to get the to unless they can not each for the one they have got a hold off the action ah and that has to result from a code to process of the cartel is involved in this in a major way ah yes i recall n that experiment the kids used o variety of tools to some one distract themselves i particularly related to the kid that would just put himself right next to the marshmells and then would and then some the kids cover their eyes some of them would count or saying yes that is all very cortical my coming up with a novel stratify simple example that were using here but of course this is at play any time some one decides they wanting to watch a motivational speech or something just a steeve job's commencement speech just to get motive ate to engage in their de i take this new job it has got great benefits but it is an lousy part of the country why do you think that some people have a harder time running these go no go circuits and other people seem to have very i low activation energy we would say they can just i they have a task they just lean into the task has some people getting into task completion or that things that sort is is very challenging for them ye i ma i think it is really just another is a special case of a very general phenomenon which is brains are complicated and brains resin rains we have are the result of genetics and experience and my genes are different from your genes and my experiences are different from your experiences the things that to be easy or hard for us will not necessarily be a line they they might just happen to be just because they are but the point is that you know you your dealt a certain set of cards you have certainset of genes you a handed to o know a brain you do not choose your brain is handed to you but then there is all the stuck you can do with it you know you you can learn am to now to to have new skills or to you act directly or just show more restraint which is kind of relevant to what we are talking about here or may be show less restrain if your problem is you are button now n you never have any fun in life and you should loosen up a little bit thank you i appreciate that i adagio's always encourage me to have a little more fun so ball gangly are their kind of the disciplinary and or that there's the sort of the instruct or conductor of sorts right go no go you be quiet you start now i wish i knew more about the basil gangly than i then i do my sense is that it this system is key for implementing the plans that yet cooked up in the quarters ah but they also influence the plans that the quarters is dishing out because this is a major source of information too the quarter it becomes almost impossible to figure out where the computation begins and where it ends and whose doing what because these things are all interacting in a complex net work and it is all of it it is the whole network it is not one is the leader in the others the follower of course the these are all the structures that were discussing our working in parallel right and i there is a lot of changing crosstalk i have this somewhat sick a habit avid of a every day i try and do twenty one now goes if i want a reach for my phone i try in not do it just to see if i can prevent myself from engaging in that behavior if it was reflective it is something i want to do a deliberate choice than i certainly allow myself to do it it i do not tend at too much trouble with motivation with go type functions most because ism busy that i i wish it'd more time for more goes but ism to speak but do you think these circuits have genuine plasticity and h absolutely i mean everybody knows how they have learned over time to wait for the tomarshmelll is right you do not have to have instant gratification all the time you are you are willing to do a job sometimes it is not your favorite job because it comes with the territory you want the salary that comes at the end of the week at the end of the month right we can defer gratification you know we can choose not to say the thing that we know is going to inflame our partner an create you know i melt down for the next week we we learn this control but i think these are skills any other am you can get better at i if you practise i think your you are choosing to do that to spontaneously is as kind of a you knows a mental practice it is a discipline is a way of building the skilled that you want to have i find it to be something that when i engage in a no type a situation a then the next time and the next time that i find myself about to move reflexively there is a little gap in consciousness that i can inter i can make a decision whether not this is really the best use of my time because i i i sometimes wonder whether not all this business around attention certainly there is the case of eighty h t and clinical diagnose adage she but all the at the issue round focus and attention is really that people just have not really learned how to short circuit a reflex and much of what makes us different than rattle snakes or well shall they could be deliberate but from the other animals and is our ability to suppress reflex well that is the quarter an or let us o say the format quarter an bayslll gangly re working together sitting on top of this lizard brain that is giving you all these great adapt to reflex is that help you survive yo just hope you do not get the surprising case where the thing that your reflex is telling you is actually exactly the wrong thing in you make a mistake right and that is right that is what the quarters for it is adding needs and context and experience past association and yin human beings obviously learning from others through communication well i was you i went right to it ism and it was where i was going to go let us talk about the quarter we have worked our way up the call her axes as on the aphysiononos will all know we are in the quarter this is the seat of our higher consciousness self image planning an action but as you mention the qartexis in just about that it is got other regions that are involved in other things maybe we should as to staying with vision s tackle o bit about visual quarter you told me a story an amazing story about visual quarter and it was the somewhat of a sad story unfortunately about some one who had a stroke to visual quarter maybe you you would a share that story because i think it illustrates a many important principles about what the quarter does right i you do not the visual quarter is you could see the projection screen the first upon place word this information streaming from the retina through this famous you connecting linker let's played out for the the highest love of your brain to see am it is a representation it is a map of things going on in the visual world that is in your brain ah and i when we describe a scene to a friend were using this drunk of our brain to be able to put words which are coming from a different part of our quarter to the objects and and movements and colors that we see in the world am that is i keep part of your visual experience when you when you can describe the things your seeing you you are looking at your visual quarter and this is that i just was a good question right now because ism looking at your face right as we are talking there are neurons in my brain more or less in the configuration of your face that are active as you move about and ah what if i were to close my eyes and just imagine i do this all the time by the way avid was mad and i imagine avid person's face i do not tend to do that as if maybe i should but you get the point i ism now yous visualization a what you look by way of memory if we were to image the anurans in my brain would the activity of nurse's resemble the activity of anurans that is present when i open my eyes and look at your actual this is a deep question we do not really have full i now stolen to neat yes except your talking about looking in detail at the activity of anurans in a human brain and that is not as easy to do as as it would be in a enjoy some kind of animal model but you are the bottom line is that you you have a spacial representation of the visual world at at the map of the visual world law own on another surface of your quarter the thing that surprising is the it is not one map it is actually dozens of maps what each of those maps do well we do not really have able accounting there either but it looks a little bit the diversification of the output anurans of the eaten o the gangly an sells we ware talking about before the are different types of gainlandselves that are incoming different kinds of information about the visual world we talk about the ones that were concluding the brightness but the once are incoming motion or color these kinds of things the same kinds of specializations in different representations of the visual world in the quarter ah seem to be true it is a complex story we do not have the whole the whole picture yet but it does look as if some parts of the brain are much more important for things reaching for things in the space around you and other parts of the cartels are really important for making associations between particular visual things your looking at now and their significance what they what what is that object what can it do for me how can i use it what about the really specialized areas of cortex the very neurons that respond o particular faces or am anurans that i do not now can help me understand where i am relative to some other specific object right you a visittheser are properties of neurons that extracted from detected by recording the activity of single neurons in some experimental system what is going on when you actually perceive your grandmother's face is a much more complicated question clearly involves hundreds and thousands and public millions of neurons acting in a cooperative way you can pick out any one little element in this very complicated system and see that it is responding differentially to certain kinds of usual patterns and you think your seeing a glimpse of some part of the process by which you recognize your grandmother's face but that is a long way from a complete description and it certainly is not going to be at the level of a magic single neuron that has the special stuff to recognize your grandmother as going to be in some pattern of activity across many many sells resinating in some kind of special way that will represent the internal memory of your of your mother it is really incredible maximin having that every time we do this deep dive which we do from time to time you and i we can let march into the nervous system and am explore how different aspects of are of our life experiences is handled there and how it is organized the it after many decades of doing this it it still boggles my mind that that the collection of neurons a one through seven am active in a particular sequence gives the memory of a a particular face and am run backwards seven through to one it gives you a compeyou could be what rattlesnake piper a heat sensing organs eager ti come out earlier am it sounds is it true that there's a lot of mufti purpose in of the circuitry we cannot say one berg of the brain does ay and another arrear the brain does be up yon areas can mufti task er hamultible jobs that can moonlight right but get i i think in my career the hard problem has been to square that with the fact that you know things are specialized that there are specific genes expressed in specific neurons that make them me synaptic connections with only certain other neuron s and that particular synaptic arrangement actually results in the processing of information that is useful to the animal to survive right it is it is not as if it is either a big undifferentiated network of souls and looking the any one is severing to tell you anything that is too extreme on the one hand nor is it the case that everything's hard wired an every none has one function and this all happens in one place in the brain it is way wore complicated in interactive and interconnected than that the we are not hard wired or soft wire both were sort of am i know what the analogies should be what what substance would work best an no idea there but that the idea is that it is always network activity this always many many neurons involved and yet there is tremendous specificity in the nones that might or might not be participating in any distributed o function that right you have to get your mind around the fact that it is both very specific and very nonspecific at the same time little tricky to do but i think that is kind of where the truth laws and the this example that you mention not to me once before about a woman who had a stroke in visual quarter and i speaks to some of this right am would he share with us that story sure the the point is that you you all those of us who wo see have representations of the visual world in our visual quarter what happens to somebody when they become blind because of promising the eye the rotten of perhaps ah you have a big trunk of the quarter is really valuable real estate for nor processing am that is come to expect input from the visual system and there is not any any more you might think about that is fallow land right is just it is unjam used by the nervous system n that would be a pity but it turns out that it is in fact used am and the the case that your talking about is of a woman who was am blind from very early it in her life and who had risen through the ranks to a very high level executive secretarial position in a major corporation i and she was extremely good at rail reading and she had a rail typewriter and that is how everything was done and apparently she had a stroke and was discovered it were collapsed in part of the hospital and am apparently the neurologist who saw her when she finally came too said you have got good news in bad news bad news is he had a stroke the good news is that it was in an are of your rain or not even using its your visual quarter and i know your blind from births o there should not be any issue here the problem was she lost her ability to read brail what appears to have been the case and this has been confirmed in other ways by imaging experiments in humans is that in people who are blind from very early in birth the visual cartel get's purpose as an a center for processing tactile information and especially if you drain to be a good brail reader you are actually reallocating somehow that real estate to your finger steps what part of the cortex that should be listening to the eyes that is an extreme level of plasticity but what it shows is the visual cartel is kind of a general purpose processing machine is good at spatial information and the skin of your fingers is just another spacial sense and deprived of y any other input the brains seems smart enough if you want to put it that way to rewire itself to use that real estate for something a useful in this case reading brail incredible somewhat tragic but i wadable leave your not cantragic i very for very in formative and of course it can go the other way too i were people can gain function yin particular modalities i can prove hearing er tactile function in the absence of mission item tell us about connectors we hear about genome rodeos micro booms olmsolms oms ah these days am what is a connector and this is valuable yes connectomactually now has two meanings have only refer to what the one that is my passion right now and that is really trying to understand the structure of nervous tissue at a scale a that is very very fine m si smaller than a millimeter way smaller than a millimeter a nan meter or less as us a thousand times smaller am or or itsetually away a million times smaller ah really really tiny yet on the scale of individual synapses between individual neurons or even smaller the individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets of nerve transmitter ten to get a released to a wonder on to communicate to the next very very fine am but the the notion here is that your doing this section after section a very fine scale in theory what you have is a complete description of a chunk of nervous tissue that is complete that if you took enough time to identify where the boundaries are all the sells are you could come up with a complete description of the synaptic wiring of that chunk of nervous tissue because you have a complete description f where all the sells are and where all the snaps is before all the sells are now you essentially have a wiring diagram of this complicated piece of tissue the mix part is the exhaustiveness of it rather than looking at a couple of synapses that are interesting to you from to different saltines you are looking at all the synapses of all f the relatives ah which of course is s massive i have a late of data i a ingenatics you have genetics and the o genomics witty idea of getting the hole gene hall of it and we do not really have an an alehouse word for genetics but it would be connectivity and economic iris avonconictoma holy comics om certify and conictomac its its its wanting at all and of course it is crazy ambitious but your that's thus where it gets fond you us it really it is t a use of electron my cryoscopy a very high resolution microscopic imaging system on a new scale with way more pay off in terms of understanding the connectivity of the nervous system and it is just emerging but i really think its corner revolutionized the field because we are got to be able to query these circuits how d they actually do it look at the hardware in a way that is never been possible before the way to i describe this to people as am if you are to take a chunk of and cold cooked but cold piety right and slice it up very thin your shin to connect up each image of each slice of the edge of the spigetty as figure out which ropes of piety belong to which and have a complete description of word this pieces sbegetty touch as that pieces begetting as there is something special the o as the need sauce is and all the other saltines an the rants the the pesto n all wear it all is around the piety got as of the other set the blood vessels and the gleam cells and what is it good for i mean it you maps are great run i was think of connectors and genomics and prodiomics camera as necessary but not sufficient i right i mean i in many cases what you do as you go out and probably the the function and you understand how the brain does the function by finding neurons it seem to be firing in association with with the function that you are observing and little by little your work your way in and now you want to know what the inactivity is maybe the anatomy could help you but this connect comics approach or at least the serial electron my cross be reconstruction of neurons approach really is allowing us to frame questions starting from the anatomy and saying i see a synaptic circuit here my prediction would be that these saltines would interact in a particular way is that right and then you can go and probe the physiology and you might be right or you might be wrong but more often than to it looks the structure is pointing us in the right direction in my case i am using this to try to understand a circuit tit is involved in this image image stabilization that we were talking about keeping things stable on the retina and this thing only respond at certain speeds of motion see these cells in the circuit slow motion they will not respond to fast motion how does that come about well i was able to probe the circuitry i knew what my sells looked i could see which other souls were talking to it i could categorize listless that might me the players here there involved in this mechanism of tuning thing for slow speeds and then we say tot looks its that teletype and we went and looked and the date bore that up but the anatomy drove the search for the particular salty because we could see it connected in the right place to the right cells as is tat creates the hypothesis lest you go query the physiology that it can go the other way as well it is always the energy between these functional and structural approaches it gives you the the most a lift but a in many cases the anatomy has been a little bit the weak sister in this the structure or trying to work out the diagram because have not had the methods now the methods exist and this whole field is is expanding very quickly because people want these circuit diagrams for the particular part of the nervous system that there working on if you do not know the sale types and he connections ha ow do you really understand how that the machine works ye what i love about is we do not know what we do not know and as scientist we do not ask questions we posed hypotheses hypotheses being of course some prediction that you wager your time on basically right and it either turns out to be true or not true a but if you do not know that a particular teletype is there you could never in any configuration of life a or a career were exploration of a nervous system wager a hypothesis because heder know it was there this allows you say ah there is a little interesting little connection between this cell that i know is interesting in another cell that is a little mysterious but interesting ism going to hypothesize that it is doing blank blanked blank and goes that and in the absence of these connect tomes you would never know that that sell was lurking there in in the shadows right right yet and if you just tried to understand how information flows through this biological machine you don't know where things are narrow transmitters are dumped out of the terminals of one cell and they diffuse across the space between the two calls which is kind of e liquid space and they hit some receptors on the postnaptic cell and have some impact sometimes that is not through a regular snap sometimes it is to a neuromodulator you often talk about in your podcast tit a sort of dozen soft e to exactly losing into the space between the cells and it may be acting at some distance far from where it was released right but if you do not know where the release is happening and we are other things are that might respond to that release your groping around in the dark i love that you are doing this and am i have to share with a the listeners that at the first time i ever met avid and every time have ever met with this in person at least at his laboratory at brown he was in his office door closed drawing her on and the connection s and this is somewhat unusual for somebody who say doubtful professor of chairman the department at camera for many years out to be doing the hands on were typically that is that stuff that is done by technicians or graduates in surposetocts but i think it is fair to say that you really love looking at nervous systems and drawing the accurate renditions of how those nervous systems are organized and thinking about how they work now it is pure joy for me a man am a very visual person my wife is an artist wethlook a lot of a together just the forms of things are are gorgeous in their own right but to know that the form is in a sense the function that they that the architecture of the inactivity is how the computation happens in the brain at some level even tough we do not fully understand that in most contact gives me in a great joy was ism working on something the both visually beautiful but also deeply beautiful in a sort about her sort of fa knowledge context you know what is it what is it all about of it wat is a final question i get asked very often about how people should learn about nervous science am for how they should go about pursuing maybe an education in hero science if the at that stage of their life for that is appropriate for their current trajectory do you have any advice to young people old people and anything in between about how to learn about the nervous system more maybe in a more formal way i man nosy we have our podcast the or other am sources of nervous science information out there but for the young person who thinks they want to understand the brain i they want to learn about the brain what shall we tell them wet it is a great question and there is many sources out there its almost a question of in how do you deal with this avalanche of information out there i think er podcast is a great way for people to to learn more about the nervous system and an accessible way but there is much stuff out there and its is not just that mind the resources are becoming more and more vet for average folks to participate in nervous science research on some level there is is famous iyhwire project of subasiansos i about wire yes that is connect mix and that is a is situation where a very clever scientists realize that the the pays kcal work of doing all this reconstruction of irons from these electron micrograph is a lot of time in solve many many person ours have to go into that to come up with the map that you want of where the sells are and he was very clever about setting out a contact in which he could crowd sources and people were interns in getting a little experience looking at nervous tissue in participating in a research project could learn how to do this an do a little bit for their living room from their living the put a link to rewire that is it also is a great bridge between what we are just like about conictomics and i should participating in research right and you do not need a graduate men too or anything that right i saw to more of this is coming and ism actually interested in building more of this the pole who are interested ant a participated some level do not necessarily have the time or resources to get involved in laboratory research can can get exposed to it in and participate and actually contribute i i think that is i youwant one thing i may just asking questions of the people around you who know a little bit more and have them point you in the right direction here is a book you might to read there is lot of great popular a books out there theatre accessible that will give you some more sense of the full range of what is out therein the nervous sciences and how we can put some lings to a few of those that we right on basic nervous science my a good friend did marlin the late richer a people call hem deictic marlin i had a good book i i i forget the title at the moment ad at sitting behind me somewhere over the on the shelf but i about vision and how nervous systems work o a pretty accessible book for the general problem right right young that and and there is there is many sources out there a mean wickapety is a great way you ought a particular question that visual function i would say by all me as had the wick obedience and get the first look and follow the the references from there or go your library or young there there is many ways to get into it it such an exciting field now here is many gemmy any particular realm that special to you your experience your u know your strength your passions ah there is here is a field of nervous scene devoted to that ya you've forgot if many's gone a neurological problem or ah a psychiatric problem there's a branch of nervous science that is devoted to trying to understand that and to all these kinds of promise down the line i feel the feel the buzz is is an exciting time to to get involved great those are great resources that people can access from anywhere zero cost as you mean interne connection but aside from that we will put the links to some and ism remembering i dick's book is called to we know it when we see it i i one am i heros yet a wonderful college who in forestalling we lost a few years ago but i listen avid this has been wonderful i an a blast we really appreciate you taking the time to do this as a people probably realized by now i your an incredible wealth of knowledge about the entire nervous system to day we just hit this a taunt contour of a number of different areas to give a flavor of the different ways that the nervous system works and is organized and how that is put together i now these airier are talking to one another hen i love about you is that your such an incredible educator and and have taught many students over the years but also i for me personally i as friends but also any time that i want to touching to the the beauty of the nervous system i rarely lose touch with hat but any time i want a touching to it and and start thinking about new problems and ways that i the nervous system is doing things that i had not thought about i call you i a please forgive me for calls past present and future unless you can a number if you do i is sustain in such a blast a any in and this has been great session and it is always fun talking to you its always gets mighty a brain racing thank you thank you thank you for joining me to day for my discussion with doctor avid burden by now you should have a much

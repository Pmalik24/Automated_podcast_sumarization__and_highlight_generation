the menhir show sponsirby expressive median privates a right not a privilege defend your right that expressivvepianta come freshman the massshooter in louistian mane is still at large he his done extraordinary damage eighteen dead thirteen injured lives ended lives destroyed family's rest in america such events quickly devolve into the usual arguments those who argue for gun control blame the weapon carried by the shooter they point out that he was carrying in a re fifteen and that he had a high capacity magazine they say that means outlaws are too loosen that if they had been tighter the shooter never would have bee able to obtain the weapon gunfight's advocates argue by contrast that the shooter was mentally ill that according to the washington post he had quote alarm people around him that he was hospitalized and receive mental health treatment this summer people who knew the shower told investigators that quote in recent months he describes hearing disturbed voices and increasingly become fixated on the bowling alley and the restaurant or he allegedly open fire it is uncleaner where the shower got his weapon if he did not have a criminal record a federal background check would not have stopped him from getting a weapon anyway but man also has a called yellow flag law that requires police to get a medical practitioner to evaluate some one with mental illness and identify them is a thread before the police can petitioner judge to order a persons firearms seized if ever somebody would have qualified for use of such a law the shooter in this case would have qualified in the end the argument's fort an against gun control are not generally about the efficacy of any particular policy least not one t comes to mass shootings masshotings are statistical outliers the vast majority of homicides involving fire arms in the united states are committed with hand guns not long guns act give shower events constitute a very small percentage of overall homicides well he mediate tend to cover large scale mas shootings the louiston shooting they tend toil nor shooting can cities chico despite the fact that firearm tomiciderte for black america is some fourteen times higher than that for white america now the arguments for gun control ten to central lies around one particular argument the argument that no one could quit needs in a r fifteen or any gun for that matter that is the argument the present an widen routinely makes to those grab right long america say it is all about shaping america apian america independent say if you want a fight against ta contrinito f fifteen you need a some little more than a gun the i d the idea we still alow limit about wrist sick is sick hit has no no solo the van step nun not a single sol to rational for prove in if you want a protect yourself get a double by a shock on have the shells o twelve gag shack a promise ho is ever coming in his locker you do not need a or fifteen it is harder at am it is harder o use and in fact you do not need thirty rounds to protects by so on in none of that is true none of that is true also notice his language there when he says no one need to semi automatic weapon that is normal an gun the is a normal rifle a semiautomatic weapon just means that every time you pull the trigger the gun shoots that is all and then it reloads that is that is what to see my auto is but is bison right on principle i spend part of my day yesterday with my wife and some friends at grange while we are there we worked it my smith and lesson amen pe shield my millimeter or my mosberg five hundred chicken and yes my a r fifteen why precisely were we at the grange mesic because i love the grange it is because since the october seventh terror assault on the gaze envelope anti semantics across the west has sky rocketed i currently have full times security on myself on my family probably green to have to have that level of security the rest of our lives but it not just me petty much every new i know who can obtain a weapon is now attempting to do and they should as all law abiding and responsible adults should owning a weapon is in the end the only protection against the darkness the news were murdered raped and kidnapped in the gosh onvelopeere largely unarm is real has extremely strict gun controls in the wake of the massacre tens of thousands of his rallies are now seeking to arm themselves as they should over a hundred thousand is rallies have reportedly submitted gun lice fences applications closer to home the story is the same there are evil people who seek to do harm to innocent people on wednesday morning for example a man was arrested in studio city californium after breaking into a home with the mafia that is a a scroll on the door post of jewfish homes marking it is a jewfish home the man was screaming free pakistan and kill news in trying to kick in a door now new york news are being told to stay indoors by security sources over chat because pool compass protesters decided to descend on brooking onchavat afternoon according to seowhile live at come new should avoid walking around crownheights a heavily orthodox neighborhood according t the anti defamation league anthem sent a incidents of increased by three hundred and eighty eight per cent this month year over year why would not every new want to carry under these circumstances people of decency on all sides do want the same thing here innocence protected and the dangerous disarm the question is how best to achieve that got simple minded statements about blanket weapons bands are not the answer and those answers make even less sense coming from many of the same people who see the police as the problem no ism not going tore giving up my a fifteen because a mentally ill person who never should have had weapons committed thane is facet of evil in fact that is precisely why i keep by weapons because evil people doing evil things are not stopped by parchment barriers in just a second we will get to the political response to the mass shooting and man with of course has followed all the traditional hall marks of the debate first pure take recently announced they would alleviate ten million dollars in veterans at by veteran's day thanks to your support they are fifty three per cents that gold with two wees to go thing about this thrust militaries made up of one hundred per sent volunteers these are men and women who willingly sacrifice everything they have for this country when there done serving they return home to a tight chop market and outrageous living expenses that is why ism happy a private company pure talk has jumped into help when you switch two pure rocks lightning festive to network they will donate a portion of every new order to this excellent cause you can make a real difference just by choosing superior self on service puretalks plans started just twentbux month offering on limited talk faced more data and mobile hotspot just go to puritan dot come slash chipiro and make that switch butts rally together showing wavering support for our veterans is it pure talk do come slash chipuro switch to pure talk to day its the right move it is the america way visit puretalk dot come slash chip again this pure took come slash pure i use partook for all of my calls great tower network which weans the reception is really good plus isms having money plus ism helping out coma pure talk dot come slash burial check maturing out pure too come slash chipiro tod a beg as for our usual arrangement these shootings almost invariably involve somebody with obvious red flags obvious obvious red flags and then the media decide to ignore the red flags in favor of the idea that a hundred million gunners ought to give up their guns because in the end the ideas that you should trust the government to protecting now i do not trust the government for a couple of reasons one i do not think that they can protect me in the first instance sore i live great sheriff'sdepartment excellent police department everybody one horsemen is excellent and what it is can take hem a little while to respond to an actual bad thing happening d it does not matter how good they are it will take then at the very least a few minutes to get to a place and that is too late for the people where in that place her's all very speculative until it happens in a place where you are which is why at mi senior have to gas o carrying we have security and we have had the gigs carrying that is a good thing that is a worth while thing whenever somebodies as well good guys with guns done stop bad got he guns know the answers they do they it is to it always such a weird argument they'll say things up you nought really stops the bad gave a gun is either he commit suicide or the cop stolon why that is because there is no one on teen who a had a gun they to wait until guy was don shooting a bunch people for the cops to get there in shootout or what y can await their furtlegaticoment suicide i gout of the kindness of his heart you think that that is what ingoing to stop this thing an the reality is once again that every one of these situations in involving a masshooter is a situation in which the person has all sorts of indicators that they should not of had a gun in the first place and somebody drop the ball somewhere along the way which really speaks too a a lack of belief in the actual social fabric because if you see somebody around you who should not have a gun somebody around you who has severe mental illness you have an obligation a moral obligation to report that to the authorities in the moral and and the authorities one a moral obligation to try to get that person the care they need and remove from them the ability to have access total weapon that is your moral obligation it is a thing t you should do by the same token it is immoral to remove from a law abiding citizen who knows how to use a gun his means of self defense that is immoral the first write any of us have is the right to self defense and defense of others obviously we whenever one these shootings happens obviously motions rurally high and you see some politicians who decided their going to shift their opinions on politicaliss you not because new evidence is emerge but because they are now emotionally struck by the issue ism not a big fan of this type of politics if your positions changed radically not because new evidence emerge that the decent your prior position but because you are just responding more emotionally to the issue that is not a good reason to shift your opinion on an issue it is not evidence is supposed to decide your positions on the issues well there was a congress person yesterday and her golden democrat from man who reversed course on gun control now main is a democrat dominated state t has democratic governor it has two democratic it has one democratic enter one republican enter and it has a democratic legislature here is is her golden who is a main congress person who represent louis and now coming out in favor of gun control which is the politically safe thing to do after a mass shooting obviously but again there is no new evidence that is ben provided that this would that what form of gun control wouldhav stope this from happening series what form a gun control the apparently already had guns known now how obtain the guns and we do know that he was literally institutionalize just a couple of months ago and somehow to wit access to the weapons what laws on the books would have changed this here is your golden advocating from ore laws anyway none on is we o on a nest an the one is by this sat er is mas him mom downs man to the given one me a were a o to get on n o i do not really understand why he saying it is his responsible what is the law that he failed to pass tat would prevent to this christmurphy of connecticut senator long time advocate for gun control he then actually stomped on this guy that is the also the way politics worse even if your first position the then the people who reflect your new position was stomp here is christmurphy going after yesterday i do not know representative golden personally i know that he is a pretty conservative a member of the house of representatives ah and he is coming to the same reality that many others have chichis democrats weapons do not deserve to be on the streets of america the can protect people second a meet rights but just make sure that folks do not have access to the weapons of war but i wish it did not take members of congress to have to experience amass shooting in their own congressional district to come to the reality ism glad that representative golden made this decision but why does it to have to happen over and over and over again mean do does he have a solution that w stop thus from happening over and over and over again there some fifty people who are shot in chico over the we get nobody new story about it because not as spectacular does not grab the headlines in the same way those were almost invariably with hand guns you do not see christmurphy talking about any of that and again this is the easy liver's way out of the dilemma the real argument the that people left that they are honest one shaves than knowing we gun that is the argument they really wane a have they soft on make that argument because they understand that to losing argument but that is the argument that they actually you want to may instead they decide that they are going to reverse engineer an argument where the greatest danger to your life to day s an a our fifteen wet if the grist insecure my life is not air fifteen in the hands of a crazy person at the greatest defense to my life is in air fifteen in my hands i can stop the crazy person enters him came he is doing the same sort of thing from virgin says we have sickness in this country don't happen anywhere else we have a sickness in is cunt for saulsont true does not happen anywhere s that our mas shootings that our terrasaults the sorstuff does happen another country's but if there is a sickness in this country part of that sickness involves denying sickness denying mental illness pretending the mentalilness is just different brain orientation i suppose to what really is in in many cases a danger to self or others here is it centericane anything this just reopens a won that never heels for all virginals when we see a report of this kind of shooting tragedy we all remember a that tragetyat virgin tack and many since that and it is just it it is just sickens your soul aiming we ever sickness in this country around gun violets and it is a uniquely america problem many other nations do not have the problem that we have a states including virgin have finally taking mindful steps to deal with the the congress thus far is generally teen unwilling to again many of these mashroings give a coin californiash has extraordinarily strong guns use to live there meanwhile crrechon par in the federal level she is doing the same thing she says let us work to ban assault weapons again the weapon is not the problem the person who is carrying the weapon is the problem everyone knows this let us work together to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines let us work together enact universal background checks require safe storage of guns and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous individuals who have no business being armed with ha weapon of war but those people have no business being armed at all at all the weapon is not yet the person as always is the issue and again there is a counts or side to this which is that law abiding people while legitimately afraid and should be legitimately afraid of bad people in the night need to own weapons i am one of those people my wife is one of those people we is by nature a very mental person she is not somebody the is vertically comfortable around fire arms she is learning to use fire she buying a fire m because she wants to be more comfortable she feel safer and she is not wrong we get a lot of threats she's not wrong it is more in this momentarily first every hollowing parents aren't cerate to check their kits candy for potential tampering but what we do not talk about art the actual dangers you encounter everyday in the meat lie lab grown meet is becoming more more popular it is not unusual perform me to be able to product of the united states we really do not know what is in the meat which is a scary truth fortunately my friends a good rangers have made at their mission to change that this hollowing good rmanshrs is taking the trick out of your meat and they are throwing a treat for my listeners thirty bucks off your order with promicoach appear a good ranchers not come the number one place to get america best be chicken and deeply delivered is with good manners their parts are transparently source all america and delicious when y shop a good ranchers come you one to question what is in your meat good ranchers met is guaranteed one hundred per cent america take the

old time i would but you cans who should go check i out good ranchers dot come use cochlear get thirty bucks off with free express shipping ts again the case that very often is just made pretty openly by members of the left es that we do not guns guns or bad or that gun no one needs a gun that is the case made by a personage tailor busting harper over the aplanatic today the title the piece is how much blood is your fun worth i saw the gun violent epidemic and my relation to it as a gun owner as an abstraction then a mas shooting happen in the little city where i work is a person who is from louis to ma the entire article is about how this person is a gun owner and how he was always in favor of gun control but now he is really strongly in favor have gun controls is the honest truth is that have always viewed t gun violent epidemic is an abstraction remote for my own life choices mi many gun owners it'd always supported stronger gun control if the requires written in practical exams and dozens of hours of training to earn the right to drive him mother vehicle have never understood why the same we should not apply fire arms my views on gun control of also been longish academic an nature it something i care about in have written about but f never felt deeply that changed yesterday can say has stronger feelings right now and then guess to this if you had asked me be fore yesterday wyiown guns i would have get you the same line it'd fed my liberal friends on my wife and above all my self for years i w'dhave told you my own guns for hunting for protection for blasting clay portions out of cloudless october skies it'd have told you my own guns because i come from gun family and guns hat guns are some the only things have left from the people i love would have told you about the rifle my holler born great depression surviving grandmother kept under the bed the twenty gage mi grandfather used to bring home thanksgiving turkeys i would hae told you own guns because i a hunter and i own guns because i wrist things that sometimes make people angry but it is only now that gun violence has visited my little corner of the world that i have been forced to confront reality a truth that as been there all long but that i have refused to admit i own guns because i them and because ism an america ism allowed to an on stops me my own guns because nonviolence with something that happen anywhere else and not somewhere close to me he says that he is responsible and he says yesterday's vents having made me changed my mind about being a gun owner the reasons that motivated me to own guns in the first place are no different then yesterday the shooting an moist an change my mind about being a quiet gun owner have spent years of my life making apologies on be half o my gun nut acquaintances si just have question he is not giving up his guns right i mean in the end this guy is not can give up his guns but he is going to lecture you about your guns that is the idea here he says the reason that people own a our fifteens is because they are fun or because they are a toy for some people maybe that is true but here is the bottom line i have a right to on an air fifteen my reason happens to be a pretty good reason which is self defense and defense others but have a that that right is broader than that and the real on it's broader than that is because i cannot prove two the authorities that my need out weighs thing to take one my gone i know this because for f i knows for a fact when i lived in loss angels i was one of the top tar gets of ants metic at threats in two thousand fifteen two thousand sixteen i used to get dethrets all the tine in i knew fairly intimately the people at the f b i in loss socialist because they have been my house more than once in order to pick up at least one time powder from my house other times to in investigate other mail that it me to the house i know the fpaatianswere i live here to a but the difference is that in florid i can get my gone i can go out i can train with it and get good at it an i can carry it because it turns out that that is notions to me in my home when i was in ow s angels me me my the process that i had to go through this is why the right is broader than just my need because it turns out that when the authorities to find the need very often it just obliterates the right when i was in loss angels i literally wants the felicity and i plied for conceal carryperment can steal carry permits in lot angels are almost impossible to get really really difficult to get you have to demonstrates a need what does that mean it means just to demonstrate a need that is beyond the response time of the la pity i sapameeting with elipety i go in i being in a binder ism tong o binder this thick of threats thick binder of threats i sit down with somebody working for the felicity and i s are walking through thethreats they sail say will get back to you that couple weeks later they deny me the percent why because they say that all those threats old they have an actually acted on them yet an i said right that is the entire point they have not but when they do i want yard in fact that pointed out them that the f be i had a rested a person who is sending threats to me and don't c done from junior among other people the would arrest of that person that person and picture of mine coffin the home that person had body armor and a map of the general area where we live and hots pretty much ready to go and the aliped said debut he was rested which is a full catch twenty to we catch the guy that means you are safe we do not catch the guy well you shouldn't have a gone because after all we could a e cat the guy this is why the second amendment exists and en increasingly violent world particularly for people me youon't about things getting personal gun ownership is personal to me this person hays gone violent of personal to him because it racks the communiuary lived because gone violence is personal because violence and threats are personal gun ownership is personal to me and i do not believe ism the only one numeric feels that way think the founders felt the same thing an just one second will get to why it is personal right now first policy genius makes it easy to conceal life in turns clots from top companies and find your lowest price their licsensagients work

be come shy about it gently i have not become shy about it but it does mean that things are petty scariest there ant everybody is taking for cautions meanwhile the good news is that the hard left is

meanwhile the body administration is attempting to grasp its way forward with regard to the situation in the midleeast an the sendingsom mix signals on those signals very goods on those signals are a less good john curly yesterday two his credit the national we purity spokes person to his cried yesterday who's asked about casualty numbers in the gassistrip and he gave one the strongstansers

to parrot the lies that compass tells and they are liars mean it it is amazing it is truly amazing to watch the par battle that is rusted on social media first of all there is no question that algorithmically commas supporters are getting a giant loose right now there is just no question at that is happening on a wide variety of platforms unfortunately i think including asset certainly including sector beyond that compass and m they just openly lie about things much that yesterday a home spokes person was on the b b c the b b c of course is a commas friendly outlet they are perfectly welling to run with nearly anything compasses but even the b s was what here is what happen the comaspokes person tries to claim that they did not kill civilians the b b s points out on you did you killed fifteen hundred civilians and the coma gets up and walkout it was meant the o nation was that to o men t here possess for the it at ti sit so hundreds a e meting were killed to sri and

the way they found materials literally on the bodies of commas terrorist telling them to rape telling them to murder i mean this is like they are liars they are liars and the fact there many people are willing to part the lies is the full scale antisemitism the at the same exact time that that these lies are being told the bidminstration get there is he lottomic signals jobidon is meeting with america muslin leaders to try to play hate their fury over the fossa war that is according to the times of israel tels an in publicize me with muslin america community leaders the move comes men growing fury among arab and muslin america over biding support for israel military response to the compass onslaught the president came under particular fir yesterday for saying he has no confidence in the death tally from compass et that that the fact that biding is meeting with all of these supposedly angry leaders is is totally crazy if you are angry about israel responding to compass have a solution for you call for compass to surrender commas surrenders it is over to day to day at all ends right now it'll coma's leadership have to do come out your hands up that is all another this is all over the hostages go free the electricity turns gets turned back on that that is the next thing that happens everyone knows this but instead join is meeting with these america at muslin leaders

against our forces we will not let them again the bindministration over all doing the right thing a pushing iron off the ball telling them do not do not screw but when the rubbers can meet the road

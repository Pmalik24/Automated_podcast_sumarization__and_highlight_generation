everybody a speaking to you today from the stage of an opera house at the brook on academy of music in new york city wait the the the there mop her ting the hour and the polkas rock an beep tat and ism here on an operahouse stage with ta story that is small it almost feels wrong to tell it in a room this grand it i she about a real opera singer not a superfluous over singer or anything that can glory makes about half of her living singing the other hap she makes recording audio book and body year ago she was staying at a hotel and she had a dead line on this children book that she wasuposed to be recording in the hotel room was con a noisy she she to a noise from the street as if she will drive her quite placenta she went into the closet put pillows all round to dead en the sound sou and the floor with microphone and then the cord of the microphone i went under the door of the closet of to her lap top was her lap top had a fan that made noise and she closes the door its pitch dark except for the light from her eye pad which had the text of the boy that she supposed to read and she began the exciting exploits of an efirbeszent of written bitricia cigarette a narrated by care glory chapter one where is gemma the enchanted forest was deep and green and splashed with cosmos ait would not be incredible if i just now played you the entire audio he paid eighty five books for the sea i can play you the hold od your book because marry gets exactly two and have sentences into this book and she stumbles on word she is i did wait out just you just start again on the start from the beginning she gets up to got o the coset and start the say ganoid recording again and a she tries to get out closet and she discovers that she is locked in only gan the got none at first she thought this is not in to be that hard right after all she has the eye pad his wife i she could call the front desk on sky red there was a problem this wife i was half of one bar and it kept just cutting out but i found the hotel number this course is on the recording into six six one in six sees er i dolt o a e hoo o o we even ai y o i a we e a i and then o course us e longest hotel for man ever o o e a a y y o a of o ai a o and crying to press zero to get to the operator and ism thinking the life is can a cut out at any moment ism listening ti this giant long anew and finally i hear o a w e are ray want o a e be e me i i am actually in room eleven there sex anear me anear me after that the seven minutes of silence on the recording just total silence nothing happens extant every now and then can just laugh to herself happens one minute and forty eight seconds after the found all then it is quiet is no other sound for forty four seconds and then on the recording your here now and then she tries the door handle again thinking she told me at her this cannot really be true this cannot this got of e with is can a word one wall of the cost has the hallway on the other side and eighteen minutes after karat locked herself in she hears people she hear some german tourists walking towards her down the hall and fortunately she actually has the skills board this very situation do i merman's come to the door of the room they whispered to each other for a little bid and then they do nothing o her husband is at on dis than he is also a singer and his come as turned off she tests her mam there is nothing back she owns her mam and right then somebody taps on the dor a the hotel room and calls through it are you oke meow can you come to the door the person asks i erkaran knows that is really were thing to say to somebody is evening rescue but she just could and help herself nobody wants to look a not apparently the german when they fond this very sweet to make an housekeeper and twenty two minutes after karat was locked and the housekeeper set her gray god i was happy to see her and she was nice o my gash she was nice i knows the were question but leg is not appropriate ted tip in a situation that i do not know i did not think of it then ta warn remember if she she's opera singer right and operas are all about spectacle you now's eighty peoples on the stage and horses and love d vengeance and big grand feelings it was really it would really be hard to get further from that to what happened to her in that closet right while all the action takes place in a space not much bigger than your body it is the simplest plot imaginable there is literally no movement in this plot if some one which to stage this as an opera how would that go am it might be minimalist music actually a ray just a repeating theme over and over and over again with me yelling help tend if people say this crus of things an interviews and then it'll put that clot at the end of the story and makes her i sending put a little plucky music under it and maybeyhu heard our should but when we did this interview lie three or four weeks ago i revs a wittering i for once in my life i do not have to let this story stop here i am actually going to be in an opera house very soon i can retire with this i can take this to the next logical step the step it never gets you the step you need an opera house for and it hunt that i actually have a hook up for the kind of music that carman is talking about some of this i have a cousin his name's chili glass is written an number of minimalist operas they been performed here in this very stage since the nineteen eighties right stand on the beach just this past fall and i called chili and he sat down to write and to day wrist now i am pleased to present here on the broken academy of music opera house go cgegold from hear of his latest opera i am not joking this opera is called help commission for our program to day on the boom

program to before your day we want to live up to that you ti son bike trying to invent something ne and what your inform to day is true stories its journalism we always do represented as radio drama and wearing is a readout jumps you have never heard before we have journalism turned into opera in to a full on roadway musical we have journalism turn in to play that a structure a radio dock to entry fake is there many ways you can tell a true story there are many ways and to day instead of just upping the tools of journalism to everyday stories w usually do which a to harness the full power of music and theatre are story we are not done with are story sure you you do it is a minimalist opera but what if you wanted to stage it as kind of an old school opera opera the kind that they take you on field ships too when you r a kid lit what would that be i ask karma our interview and she was game to speculate i do not i mean i as a whole opera i mean opera is long maybe it may be the eld from the book would come an plan t surround and sing about the even ass e a went o o n ai a on oi mean a on a o meany in on on a a anon a o through then or the old in the story also you would want the people the people walking around the closet the german people there could be just got to new york aria sung in german brig can ye i o i i ai ton o eye with the singing is we have just arrived the air is dirty and smoggy nan on i a oo to own in mi in senior a of a was to e i i can a es on me in a iran ate over got the german there one of the theorist says i think some one called for help in german and the others is impossible every one in this country is a goodorette then there is the front desk lady you know when the carry calls from her eyed it could be funny if she was all my life is firing i just answer the pone all day and people ask for room surveys you cut away i stuck in the closet and finally this is her big moment and she does not even know it fbriebri as in drift i end its in oaonanin o obasont fit dasonten there the husband in this version the story we could actually see him out on his edition belting is hard out oblivious to the pain that his wife is going through smother we could incorporate some kind of famous barritown aria i wonder what would be the most appropriate and i ironic are out for him to be singing i her now something about love ism surer or something about being a rescuer as you talked aby what would be best and we final we settlement a scene from rigoletto were the title character who loves his daughter more than anything in the world

chums treat the musical have always i have always wondered what it would mean to try one of one of our radio stories as a musical i was taken to many musicals as a kid and i think because that my basic sense of what makes a satisfying story actually comes from musicals much more than from from to or mavis if you think about the classic old musicals it ere on the rufryvan chorus in its their funny at the beginning and the the something really emotional and there about some bigger idea they take you into this world just i just love that and om what you about to here is our first attempt at a musical base on journalism probably seventy to eighty per cent of what your but to here is for bates quotes from interviews the rest is artistic convention ill say that from ism its basted on a true story you may remember from our radio program back and made twenty eleven at a munch of high schools and palm beach county forbid a group of young police officers were sent under cover to pose as students there were the classes the in the cafeteria they had fa casebook accounts of course i there being a points abut drugs being sold at these schools that is what they were there to deal with and what happened next in this one school was transformed into a musical by a team of people who usually do this on roadway pretty much everybody involvedinis the cast the chorus the musicians the

in to days show where we know what we are doing it ten the radiogram we actually bring you now and then on the program a true story told on stage by the person that it actually happened to please welcome comedian my probigoyo very easy following a musical i i think that my favorite thing about a being married is actually that you can share jokes a with your a wife or husband better funny to you and that person and no one else other than may be your cat a crus when you have a cat your barometer for humor out the window a lassoer my wife i when on trip to massachusetts and and i called it catsachusetts which is not funny but in our house was the joker all are going the cats as shows my wife is i i was a cat was a everyone loves a good pun when you have a cat and we tried to catch the chusetts and when we arrive my wife has a headache and she asked me if i will acclimate van that is her cat to the bedroom cause you cannot just put it under a cat into a house could hill exploded and i bringing h bedroom but i tired from the drive that i fall sleep which is the only thing you can not do when acclamation in inter a cat to a house since i wake i an hour later van is gone he got out and now running round the house when like an yon my cats can exploded i wake up my wife i sit lo her names can i say mister fantastic is gone is names van and lo gave me a look that i can only describe as divorces because before that point i was convinced that we would be married forever and then once i saw the divorce eyes as i o i guess this could ended this it ended it would look about and you the two of us were running round the house ism my marriage is falling apart cats can to explore and we find van but we had another major problem in the house which is that they were mice see casually worse than that because they were the parasitic mice say what is called too plasmoses which me have a at if you might know if this says thine a parasite in them and as the result are unafraid of cats an the unafraid of people and the way we discovered this was that my wife was watching the thee and she looked next to her and there was a mouse and he was watching tea thee also and she scream and he just looked up at her steward little ay wits going on i do not this show either i do not know why all those women would want to marry that one my and then she pushed him off the couch and he did not even run away he did not even scurry which is a fir invented for mice he just walked into the kitchen a room mat fin'goin the the room i just think you are over re acted and then he did a confession all into the mouse cam in the kitchenet was a not here to make friends and here to wend i was here before they came it'll be here when the on ism a mouse that from real mouse lives of cats a chusetts that night n ism sound o sleep in my wite wife's me up bite grabbing my face she says to an is mike mister fantast at found the mouse you need to cat the mouse and i sit up i said lo we have a cat we do everything for the cat we give him food we give him an apartment that he thinks is the world we set aside n the area in the apartment for him to poop in that we clean more often than the area where we poo we have a gentleman's agreement that in the unlikely event that a mouse should walk in that dog he will kill the mouse we'll now slip a mouse again he will be project et that from cap father my wife says mow get the mouse and i sit up and i see what may be the strangest tableau i will ever witness in my entire life i been smacking the mouse the mouse flies in the air land gets up walks back towards give i been smack those flies in the air land gets up walks back town ti in is thrilled his toy is alive have a serious sleep walking disorder as i am watching this ism not even really sure it is happening untying and of at this team before my wife says you get the mouse and she hands my cup i sit up my walked towards the mouse the mouse walked towards me i put the cup over the more put a magazine under the cup i take the cup into the backyard i put the mouse into the forest where i can only bassoon that he walked into the mouse of a wolf and from that day forward we have called it mousesachusesetts i want a point out something really special that happened there at the end a few minutes ago i pressed the story with the massachusetts pace on catsachusetts which we all agreed as a group is out funny just moments ago i concluded the story with another massachusetts came that was nearly identical and that was mouse sachusetts and we applauder which means in a way it is were marry eery to the the the cot ti to took hic the could idea t the cute ate the to er everybody merry a better a out a estate and that story drinks some funny stay to see the viddiure of this entire show she a to stand whet people are laughing at you real not be sorry this america life that or we have arrived at a three of our show at three how do you slow this thing down the stories a follow up to a story the reran couple of years ago which was a full episode of our she about one of our contributors josh barman an his family the sad up is that joshes

condo in a retiring community in west palm beach called century village where they did not belong they were not retirees and they were getting to various kinds of jams and crises and josh would have to fly to later t try to help he and d spent a lot of time there were you about to hear is an experiment at creating a radio drama which has exactly the same structure as one of the documentary stories on our show and what is can happen is the real josh barman is going ta narrate and then instead of going to ouzo ti quotes on taper things that we have actors performing scenes that really happened all this really happened in those ding joshes played by josh hamildon his brother avid is played by names ransom the story begins last year when real life josh found himself back in far it to with his two brothers my mother's been in the hospital much by now she is triggered out how to direct the paramedics emergency show fears or something to all the best facilities her room at wellington

brother yes you have a medical pow of turned yes good and who is then or other brother he is also coming from the held medical power of returned yes not him no i oh a did your mother go to cornel yes why i she told us what else did she say that she does not concern melcohall those were her last words before going under soon enough whit er all told a very different story the first time that happen was five years ago when avid called and told me he had to remit himself to the local sheriff's office forecast just a quick jail sentence o and mams in the hospital i flew ta flora that next day and went straight to the i see you a i o that on that ha well i i she will never be the same again what aware you the neurologist on she we have a saving medical consumer here no i sue i am am just cogon rotation she scored low on the goat test which measures brain function she got a sixty two probably permanently impaired sixty two out out of what a to of a hundred although i never really score as a hundred oh that is true i took it myself for practice in nursing go i got an eighty ya fer perfect score he have to be super man of something not it not we get a hundred what is a guy the guy who can do anything including parade lean out o to mite no no no he is dead she would score poorly i i no g go the speaker i who could do anything jess priest if i was him i never forget any one's name ah he

giant within can totally foster her logical scores one of the other nurses came and told me that earlier that had to restrain my and because even though she was unconscious she would somehow managed to get hold of cigarettes they caught her trying a light one in bed we are not even sure when she got it the nurse said and that is when i knew my mother would be fine within days she was sitting out completely lost chatting up strangers everyone is favorite this time things were bad enough that i call my brother then he can only come in a true emergency because he plays for the ellifill harmonic and he has a couple of kids and ha sketches planed out months in advance he took the red eyes straight from playing at dishy hall o here we are again you do man a can your fitments war coming awe

symphonies it is something has never been done before oh ah even this is doctor sniper my the to met you ah your mother had a heart attack and she has severe respiratory distress nearly septic infection if we can get a breathing out or on again recoveries possible but would take a long time and than what that is a good question that is a good question if she needs in home care it'll think avid could do it the cannot keep the cable one and if she does not make it what then where is seven away right he cannot stay at century village i mean it is a retirement community with a perimeter it is it dislike at a geriatric army base i do not know how it has gotten kicked out already the definitely on to and if they realize mom is not coming back sure we are going to get calls any they know which one y working on oh they that is at it is a a big one yet it is a big one hats a early nice passages to it mom i know you can hear me we love you and we need you what is it about natural life it is avid who says that mam would be happy that all three of her boys were together and that is true one of the few real senses of family i can recall with summers in e west with her and we ware all children years ago we made ice cream and caught fireflies and overstate and normal things that that is why avid does not being in the room red now because he does not one o remember mam this trap in many toes it is some jacked up days leadership he says and yet he is the one who is been in her bedside the most i cannot bring myself to kiss her the way avid does i do not know why after he then goes back to californium i stay with avid an mam time is merciless in florid and especially merciless an i see you day's turn in to weeks and every afternoon a pick up avid we go to the hospital talk

like contra there right at first i try not to look and then i could not look away but we she at a yock it ye et it was i was in denial at first and then i accepted a stages of grieve exactly exactly and then i reach some kind of state of bliss or it was some i was almost in to you not surge exactly the true trust model lay she that that one the arson state it is nice penning time with avid but ism also really worried about him he is had a his try with pills on and off over the years and i suspect it is on again one night where were driving a dinner avid says oh hey josh can we stop over the victory that is a a station down on okuchoty boulevard and victory is a total miss homer for the kindonplace for you pull in and just see munch of heard us crunching round the entrance gets he totally

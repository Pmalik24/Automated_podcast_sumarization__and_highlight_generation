the country who tried it even though in arizona it revealed the jordan one the election with even more votes than they had thought the audit narizona galvanized tons of people who wanted to do more and lots of those people jumped to the precinct strategy an arizona you can really see the effect that strategy's having that is what sac and so had been out their to reporting here is sac all over the country almost everywhere i called georgia florid texts there were local level republican officials who were getting flooded with new people wanting to become precinct committee members a lot of these officials did not know about the precinct strategy they had not seen step banana interview with dandsholtz and there were frankly a little puzzled by what was happening catchy petszas in maricoblic county r crazy a ones a ran storm and people all of a sedan hour of the wood work were wanting to suddenly to come precinct committeemen i used to get two or three people a month and i with getting forty o fifteen ye i not being i see or li o forty o fiftapplications thrown ate i some times tin a week catchy as old school and of republican she says she was stuffing sailors for the party when she was twelve or thirteen when she was the tea major she was a worded outstanding damages republican she got to meet president pagan in the rose garden put sone me consign on her on every year for his birthday she is been a precinct committee member for forty years as district chair she had four hundred fifty four precinct committees lots as she had a clear idea of who a precinct committee member shounsome one who knows the neighborhood and the people in some one knowledge able about local republican politics and catchy wanted to know who are all these new people who suddenly wanted to do this in glamorous job she started taking the applicants out to me one on i at and copy with a hundred and fifty six people have never met bear and got bath i mean sometimes of is mortal times to day i was one with pee they would start bringing out the things that we have all heard about the videos that the snot now this is out the you really should watch the since shul a the to kind of explain to me how i really did not know anything about the election and the prosit bee simply saying there is a conspiracy rigging the election you have been involved in localpotics for a long time bat you do not understand the depth of the same ora and now they would and in i would have an interesting conversation i do not mind pain for their coffees i was interesting no one rational no one who has a is voted over and over and over again actually believes to be clear not all the new appliance thought the election was stolen but a lot of them did and catchy felt what they were saying was not as the district chair catchy hath authority to appoint the new precinct committee members or not other chairs in other districts were cool whatever side a ut but catchy decided she was can screened the people and after every meeting i would go back an kind of look at tit man look up the cot er history only to find out that some of them actually will not registered republicans some many ad only recently registered tot had never voted but in a coffee or meeting or something with them they would tell me about mass of from keys and i ti to never not it if only it is my ism the one signing off very i want to feel pretty comfortable about what ism signing off on and it is my pride it sense in our violets it my choice those people who just registered to vote talking about massive fraud my pleasure to met you see around cats can a look for someone else to fill that slaw it is was also your sneaky criteria for a eliminating some of you you stop the tell i like main was not skin i could that been sneaking gets to the i thing what i mean by or sneaking as you could say if you believe the election was stolen than you don't get ti e it was a fair standard you want to talk about the election i want a took upon it with people who actually prerticipat in election catchy did not think people who were telling her about massive votofraud would make good messengers for the party they were wild about her either oo i spoke with one of the people catchy was trying to keep out of the precinct committee mercy hamilton and when i brought up city's name march lunge lobbing the worst insult you could against a fellow republican thy path supported quietly supported biting she went an that people be competing committeemen if they supported trump have you interview catchy pastas she is lying to you catchy paths did not support trump she told people to vote for biting she was a never trumpet a bold never trumpet catchy actually seemed to be a once trumpet says she supported him in twenty sixteen just not any more sill catchy insist she never supported biting did not tell anybody else to either the ideas in them to catchy mercy says she heard that cat my even recruited democrats to switch parties and become re publicans in order to install them as precinct committee men under her control to keep control for legislative distract this may have happened in only one case i think and i believe catchy did not know the republican done she recruited was actually a registered democrat in her mad dash to recruit pieces who did not believe the election was stolen anyway marasca found out the kinds of people catchy was recruiting all while people her were being ignored and she was mad also catchy stopped holding regular piece meetings she says because of loved mercy thinks it was to keep people out she would have to hear from those who disagreed with her within her legislative district people say el d here i thought that the frustrations that we saw would stop the steal came from people not knowing how to operate their government not knowing how to participate but if you are if your living in an ale where the cheer will not let you participate then of course it is going to manifesting to something stop the steal because people are going to have no other outlet than soul just be mad this feud is not just lathy versus caress everywhere you go there is some version of old school republicans getting overrun by mama election deniers at this ground floor precinct level of the party mercy believes the election was compromised we will never know who on she says but thinks of herself is more reasonable another stop the steamers and a dad expert of sorts cause a work she is done in the past and supply chin management right after twenty twenty she watched her own research projected to how many dead people werevoting she claim to have found thirty three the thorny general than looked at it and found that only one of those was real it was not an various ballet harvester from the democrats it was a republican would voted her recently deceased mothers ballet and she was indicted maria says lathy ride ruled any research an to the twenty twenty election which made her especially mad lathy says she is no idea what mercies referring to but lathy does not have any patience for that kind of research it is true it if she is one of those wo on on to it hearts an idea that everybody's i making hay odd that am going to do it to is that in have anything else golenona might as well to this and that her deal she is a good correcter really good grifter harsh but it is sure that is to she could she could do good but she she uses to missile he all that i have no space for that marasca started rallying other pieces and wanted ne peas who been walked by lathy kavas to do something about her and i was what you want do ye was we are firing pets i said oh ka that is just get people organize to work in the district they called a meeting a meeting greet w she called it i others called it a resistance meeting we had almost forty to fifty people shut it quickly turned into a very loud route conversation they wanted to fire lathy pets they were mad that she was not letting that participate ten er acted these are active sitting pieces that are elected pieces then marish in her crew found to work round in the bylaws it way to go over kitty's head to get people hind to why's preying committees she could send the applications to the republican county chair who was not on seen kathythen she could have proving give it to their reporters office you got a hundred to two hundred recentmattymen appointed that way es that is what maria says thy says was more twenty five to thirty people who got in over her head in any case that is how maria and a whole bunch of new stop the steal recruits got on city's committee lathy was trying to mama lit on a pod that was boiling over even before this attempt to take over precinct committee positions the heirs of a republican party was pretty dominated by water people and after they tried to recall the republican elected officials she certified the election and after they spend millions of dollars

had in great grip of congressmen from prisoner and now we have her this ad venture in grip that went off on the cringing conspiracy carries not this is your party this is where the new energy in the parties coming for all this stain sections to if the party really a curious about winning than they look at who are the best candidate they can win in general election we are not here there is a big wop of us we are not here for half time epizoa is known as a fairly conservative state at least until twenty twenty but actually only about a third of the states registered voters are republicans a little less than the third or democrats the rest are independence whoever win's the general has to win with independence catty thinks the cry lakes of the world cannot do that ut that is not who voting in the republican primary not who is filling of the precincts lats in the local republican party what of the biggest things these stop the tell newbies a doing that is their part of the party organization at the bottom dog as present committee people is she the setting up an info structure to watch all the voting locations in the deters to catch the fraud they did not catch in twenty twenty they have signed up as official republican party polwatchers of voting occasions wit the on primary day outside one of those locations a big suburban church in may we meed up with piggy do mats someone who never paid attention to her precinct until she just became a committee member she is got her snacks permitting a notebook and a in to take notes it is her first time for watching she picked a quiet poling place why i thought piggy would be excited to get a piece of the action to catch the cheaters red handed but actually she did not wat that i an we o man a ani pro we wo that finally she scared shes get a talk out i have to confront the many in an no a o i have tan was me a when you imagine awning e not newly notion i think if e an e no e wain going with her as she voted just before her shift piggy was supersuscicious that something was comic down she brought her own pen to them because in twenty twenty some of the polling places provided sharpypends when tan as a conspiracy theory that the machines could not read those palais ow a what can a ante we tax not i a a no i no isn't tell to tats no ain piggy is a classic new precincts committee member before it was the sharp ease it was the birth certificate i really got it involved in it prays since i would not bald in a tea party back during now o mamma are you doing idiots an mama as you don't wan a you you do not want to going all that that that is done an over with here is nothing we do bout it that or ah that is what me got me of all then an then or course what thus a lection tons tons this was the tough time for piggy and away she says she quit her job during the pandemic she thought she might be ready to retire her job was she helped o people who were under water figure out ha pay off their debts she lives alone with her dogs whom she poison and she ended up spending a ten time on her phone reading about the election being stolen bang a various actors the got peep likes or to the radicalizing moment for piggy was the moment that fox called the election for biding early at just seemed obvious to her that the fix was in there must be more trump voters than bid in ones and air disown out long car caravans in then rallies with thousands and thousands of people the only way biding out one is cheating and for piggy just the frustration that nobody did anything about it she saw the bandonbidio she signed up as a piece the piece strategy you the way to take an now to write pop get the write people it his period yet the rings out i do not them either i just the rob were son of democrats your suppose to be republican and you do not support us i i just them work is the far as ism concern their trainers now that all these people who believe their s fraud everywhere argon by stationed inside the poles i wanted to find out what instructions they were getting for were they gang to do once they were there we tried getting into one of these trainings in arietta but the state party when's let us but this is happening all over the country it is the same idea and we were able to listen in on the training in georgia door also a young best most was her e empty you man dog e t e a enter be and on the deal with this an lots of states including georgia it is ha legal to deliver other people's ballast except family in household members there are a lot of conspiracy theories about democrats going around with bitstocks of fix balas and sticking them in drop boxes if that is what you see here is with the trainer says you should do you go immediately to the pole manager an an question benin say i thin i to somebody codein and drop off more than one bat and maybe be more than one bat and see whet they do i win o run a tin er then and end win or in ta to them i in go o it i and in e pity the and i e o there they li i date a its no evil e meet this is the point they keep coming back to over and over gather evidence that republicans con use in law suits to challenge the results not just in this country in georgia but everywhere a in we ha at and open an investigation an that an a i but you not an do you not an son do you note a ten do you not any o ism not sure that following someone out to their car and taking pictures of their license plate would not lean to confrontation but the thing that really struck me is the people taking the training they were not shying away from the action piggy they sounded they were spoiling for er flight they wanted to catch wrong doers o the act feeling that yet for is poll watching thin as they were watching waging in all were doing takin de yes i we a a rain salt and be able turn over t the police a an hour later at e hot it you get a this is what were her for this i this is the definition of this job o er we are noting and the clearly and document then get i get that simplicity i explanation bat if there is a problem we can address it right away we have a turned and we are notion a way and we are join a way for a can secretary state o not do anything i do one to give you the wrong impression most of this training was pretty by the book a power point with lots of porting details about the state law the pol watchers get long detailed chelas of all the little things they are supposed to write down an photograph even the serial numbers for the baptize that are used to lock up the voting machines tons of

think oh this is this is that is we came o with a great name we just said o yow we just didn't cause the name was funny to be clear he knows here using the word pet loosely the pet databases was an inside joke between small grape boys who hated this teacher cause ye was harsh with them but thee are totally serious about the way he was treating the girls and and is the idea that you think you might accumulate enough evidence that you guises will go to the authorities at some point i do not know what that was i mean in the in my log we just said on this is now the official chat that we later uses evidence against him about petafelia that is the word i use in case anything does come up in the fencer and we to turn out to be correct and i said whenever he said something creepy towards the girls in our class posting coats with the date here jogging the date was actually saying they got from watching deviant moves true crime keeping dates keeping times keeping stuff loved on paper and when we gave i gave an example of something he had said that day and that's how it began what was the thing he would said that to ism he had it called the girl of the word he had said bad to them bad dog type thing but ten use her name right right bad malady ye exactly i had under it said in e flirty a notable times to take towards mountable girls in the class including then i put the names and evidence post will be kind this that is that is what i said that was the establishing thing there that is when that everybody just they understood and they took it seriously about putting the dates and and every few weeks the teacher did something not worthy enough that one the boys word jotted down on a pad secretly wright then and class but tippet directly into disorder on his throne handing an untreated the date was to is its finished with that teacher moved on to the next teacher but to keep the log going they was to kid you had in the next year and they read the new entries it do not we wanted him to say bat things but it was satisfying when we did o them he'd be a great another piece for the rested every time overtime he said something we it is we pictured him pushing himself in the face it do think him me that was all boys during this i would think that girls would have wanted to get in on if they knew it existed perhaps they would have but we did not bring it out but ism sure maybe some of them would we just did not really have any girls in our front group i right right medal school yes exactly the reporter when broke this story and re sealed the path a base to the world is a man o malcabits o the boson got and the reason it became public the reason's you wrote hi story is it an aril of this year the teacher was removed from his job a put on leave was obligations that he would stocked girl a preteen at the school after that happened there was a public appeal to families in the school for any information about other incidents and robin his teacher and my mom told me about it and i told her oh well we have this whole log my friends and i compiled i i was actually shocked i mean it was almost like predict the father when id i was all my god i could it all pay it off did you have this feeling of i cannot believe this is happening i cannot believe that we a use this thing definitely because did you think it i was ever on a pay off that that it was ever going to be used honestly i did not think i mean the so was there for long knowing to do anything about him i and for all i knew they would when i brought is up to a lawyer at not maybe they would just all law that this that it is this cord chat with the punch of people with funny profile forces and names i did not know if that could be used as actual e dance against some one out i was very surprised about that yet we beats of this teacher for an interview about all this but he did not return our calls or tax running about this story the name the teacher has not been made public for the names the miners in bob putting the boys round the path at okay a the voice thatyou been hearing for this interview he is a young actor as you robertson is iemitaining the real student s choselyas possible to keep that kidanonymous the after a reporter a mango malcabits publisher story in aboustan bob it was picked up widely got passed around on social media and naturally the news got back to school we had seen some people reporting it on it is yo i think i heard a couple of people talking about my i my frond told me that it is a lot o people in this mouth class were talking about it this is a friend that was part of the log with me we bit and people are talking about it at school do they know it is you i not the ones that wore involves in the log cause obviously staying an anomies to protect the integrity of the case is a big is important and what is set for you you clerk cannot going round you cannot tell anybody you are superman yes somewhat i mean not really i did not do this for fame or not looking for that i mean it is school that people know what we did but what a you talking about it lifelike i picturing you in the lunch am you people are talking about what you guides did and then you have to keep your mouth shoran be you cannot say i o it that is me i do not over here a lot of bacon chatter but some my friends to en mi and imagine for that on might be to at a heart to keep their mouth shut and it is not hard for you to keep your mouth shut not at all no after the teacher got put on leave and the peter day to baseman the news a young woman an i doubt came forward and said the cheat also been harassed by the same teacher years ago she wrote a letter of the peter day to base boys she said we you we told that adults know best that they know

doubts took my feeling seriously not to mention the blind eye that teachers were turn to the creeper relationships that he had get other students hearing that the same thing was still happening in his class nearly seven years after it'd last his me feeling sad and frustrated with the school systems lack of action thank you much for standing up for all the students whodedn'n of a bocce you are very brave for taking a stand against something new was wrong you should be very proud of yourselves for that thank you the boy told me that it felt good to me that hit made to feel a a a good deal what they done years ago is friends with the political reporter at the ran day now the big opposition newspaper in south mafia back during the height of a park tine he publish story after story about terrible things the white government was doing back then ever decades it had loose or no effect on the government at all he brutality and band stands suppression of descent continued can i talk once about what the point of publishing was in that setting that even in did not see to be doing much good right then hen his editors felt that it was important that there was a record it some one noted what was happening wrote it down later nobody could deny it happened and can i say o can when i finished writing the story yesterday that is what end of the story cause it see a good way to capture but these mile school boys had done but then i to day on my way to work i thought about the stop the stelas they enact one of to day shall i realize how that idea that i do that if you make a factual record of what happened a truthful record that in the future nobody can deny it that idea of feels its from just another era that sure different today the stop the steward continue to believe a whole

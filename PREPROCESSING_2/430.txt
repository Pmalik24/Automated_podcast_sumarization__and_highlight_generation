welcome to the ubermenasciencescience pay to m andrhubermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today we are discussing memory in particular how to improve your memory now the study of memory is one that dates back many decades and by now there is a pretty good understanding of how memories are formed in the brain the different structures involved and some of the near chemicals involved we will talk about some of that today often overlooked however is that memories are not just about learning memories are also about placing your entire life into a context and that is because what s really special about the brain and in particular the human brain is its ability to place events in the context of past events the present and future events and sometimes even comminations of the past in present or present in future and on when we talk about memory what were really talking about is how your immediate experiences relate to previous and future experiences to day i am going to make clear how that process occurs even if you do not have a background in biology or psychology i promise to put into language that any one can access and understand and we are going to talk about the science that point to specific tools for enhancing learning and memory we a also going to talk about unlearning and forgetting there are of course instances in which we would to forget things and that too is a biological process for which great tools exist to for instants eliminate ore at least reduce the emotional load of our previous experience that you really did not were that perhaps even was dramatic to you to day you're going to learn about the systems in the brain and body that establish memories you are going to learn why certain memories are easier to form than others and ism going to talk about specific tools that are grounded in not just one not just a dozen but well over a hundred studies in animals in humans that point to specific protocols that you can use in order to stamp down learning of particular things more easily and you can also leverage that same knowledge to better forget or unload the emotional weight of experiences that you did not we are also going to discuss topics desiavou and photographic memory and for those of you that do not have a photographic memory and i should point out that i do not have a photographic memory either well you will learn how to use your visual system in order to better learn visual and auditory information their protocols to do this grounded in excellent pure reviewed research while you may not have a true photographic memory by the end of the episode you will have tools in hand or i should say tools in mind or in is and mind to be able to in code and remember specific events better than you would otherwise before we begin i to emphasize that this podcast is separatefrom my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body with out let greens that get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer the will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of dated ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if we are getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitemend three and k to is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium in potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do come slash supermen oke let us talk about memory and less talk about how to get better at remembering things in order to address both of those things we need do a little bit of brain science one o one review and i promises will only take two minutes and i promise that even if you do not have a background in biology it will make sense we are constantly been bombarded with physical swim use patterns of touch on our skin light to our eyes light to our skin for that matter smells tastes and sound waves fact if you can hear me sang this right now well that is the consequence of soundwaves arriving into your ears through headphones a computer or some other speaker device each one of an all of those sensory stimuli are converted into electricity and chemical signals by your called nervous system your brain your spinal cord and all their connections with the organs of the body and all the connections of your organs of the body back to your brain and spinal court one of the primary jobs of your nervous system in fact is to convert physical events in the world that are non negotiable photons of light are photons of light soundwaves a soundwaves is no changing that but your nervous system does change that it converts those things into electrical signals and chemical signals which are the language of your nervous system now just because your being bombarded with all the sensory information and being converted into a language that neurons and the rest your nervous system can understand does not mean that you are aware of it all in fact you are only going to perceive a small amount of that sensory information for instance if you can hear me speaking right now you are perceiving my voice but you are also most likely neglecting the feeling of the contact of your skin with which ever surface you happen to be sitting or standing on it is only by perceiving a subset a small fraction of the century events in our environment that we can make sense of the world around us otherwise rages be overwhelmed with all the things that are happening in any one given moment now memory is simply a bias in which perceptions will be replayed again in the future any time you experience something that is the consequence of specific chains of neurons that we call neural circuits being activated and memory is simply a bias in the likelihood that that specific chain of neurons will be activated again for instance if you can remember your name and i certainly hope that you can well that means that there are specific chains of neurons in your brain that represent your name and when those neurons connect with one another and communicate electrically with one another in a particular sequent you remember your name were that particular chain of neurons to be disrupted you would not be able to remember your name now this might seem immensely simple but it raises this really interesting question which we talked about before which is why do we remember certain things and not others because according to what i have just said as you go through life you're experiencing things all the time your constantly being bombarded with sensory stimuli some of those sensory stimuli you perceive and only some of those perceptions get stamped down as memories to day ism going to teach you how certain things get stamped down as memories and ism going to teach you how to leverage that process in order to remember the information that you want far better now even though i told you that a memory is simply a is in the likelihood that a particular chain of anurans will be activated in a particular sequence again and again it does not operate on its own in fact most of what we remember takes place in a context of other events for instance you can most likely remember your name and yet your probably not thinking about when it was that you first learned your nae this you generally happens when we are very very young children and yet ism guessing you could probably remember a time when some one mispronounced your name or made fun of your name or as the case was for me i got to the third grade and there were two address and sadly for me i lost the coin flip that allowed me to keep drew and from about third grade until about on twelfth grade people called me and which i really did not prefer if you call me india the comments althoughlyat your comment just getting does not bother me that much but eventually i reclaimed drew as my name well it was mine to begin with him throughout but i start od going by drew again why do i say this well there is a whole context to my name for me and there may a may not be a whole context to your name for you but presumably if you asked your parents why they named you your given name you will get a context et camera that context reflects the activation of other nor circuits that are also related to other events in your life not just your name but probably your siblings names and who your parents are and on and on and on and the way memory works is that each individual thing that we remember or that we want to remember is linked to something by either a close a medium or a very distant association this turns out to be immensely important i know many of you will read or will encounter programs that resign to help you enhance your memory you they have these a phenoms that can remember fifty names in in a roomful of people or they can remember a bunch of names of novel objects or maybeven in different languages and oftentimes that is done by association people come up with little mental tricks to either link the sound of a word or the meaning of a word in some way that is meaning full for them and will enhance their memory that can be done and is impressive when we see it and for those of you can do that congratulations most of us cannot do that or at least it requires a lot of effort in training however there are things that we can do that leverage the natural biology of our nervous system to enhance learning and memory of particular perceptions and particular information let us first just talk about the most basic ways that we learn and remember things and how to improve learning in memory and the most basic one is repetition the study of memory and the roll of repetition actually dates back to the late eighteen hundreds early nineteen hundreds when ebbinghouse developed the first called learning curves o learning curves are simply what results when you quantify how many repetitions of something are required in order to remember something in fact it is been said that ebbing house liberated the understanding of learning from the philosophers by generating these learning curves we mean by that well before ebbinghouse came along learning and memory were thought to be philosophical ideas ebbinghouse came along and said well let us she take some measurements let us measure how well i can remember a sequence of words or a sequence of numbers if i just repeat them what ebbinghouse did is he would take a sequence of numbers words on a page and he would read them and then he would take a separate sheet of paper and we have to presume he did not cheat and he would write down as many of them as he could and he would try and keep them in the same sequence than he would compare to the originals and e would see how many errors he made you do this over and over and over again and as he would expect early in the training and the learning it took a lot more repetitions to get the sequence correct and over time it took fewer sequences and he referred to that difference in the initial number of repetitions that he had to perform verses the later number of repetitions that he had to perform as a called savings he literally thought of the brain as having to generate a kind of a currency of effort and he talked about savings as the reduction in the amount of effort that he had to put forward in order to learn information and what he got was a learning curving ho can imagine wit that learning curve looked it was at a very sharp peak at the beginning that dropped off over time and of course he remembered all this meaningless information but even though the information might have been meaningless the experiment itself and what ebbing house demonstrated was immensely meaningful because what it said was that with repetition we can activate particular sequences of neurons and that repeated activation lays down what we call a memory and that might all seem a big do but prior to ebbinghouse none of that was known now i should also say ebbinghouse because of when he was alive was not aware of these things that we call naval circuits it was in nineteen o six that gulgiand goal got the noble prize for actually showing that neurons are independent cells connected by synapses these little gaps between them where they communicate he may have ben aware of that but the old notion of naval circuits had not really come about nevertheless what the ebbing house learning curves really established was that sheer repetition just repeating things over and over and over again is sufficient to learn something that no doubt had been observed before but had never been formerly quantified now if we look at that result there is something really important that lies a little bit cryptic that is not obvious to most people which is the information that he was trying to learn was not any more interesting the second time than it was the first probably was even less interesting and less and less interesting with each repetition and yet it was sheer repetition that allowed him to remember now sometime later in the early to midnineteen twenty s a psychologist in candida name donate herb came up with what was called herb's postulate and he's postulate broadly speaking is this idea that if a sequence of neurons is active at the same time or at roughly the same time that that would lead to a strengthening of the connections between those neurons and many many decades of experimentation later we now know that postulate to be true neurons themselves are not smart they do not have knowledge every memory is the consequence as i told you before of the repeated activation of a particular chain of neurons and what anyhow showed through repetition and what donate herb proposed and was eventually verified through experimentation on animals and humans was that if you encourage the activation of neurons meaning have neuron's fire at roughly the same time they will strengthen their connections it leads to a bias in the probability that those neurons will be active again this is vitally important because nowadays we hear a lot about how memories of the consequence of new neurons added in the brain or that every time you learn something a new connection in your brain forms while sorry to break it to you but that simply not the case most of the time and i want to emphasize most not all but most of the time when we learn something it is because existing neurons not new neurons but existing neurons strengthen their connection through activation over and over and over through repetition or and this is a very important or or through very strong activation once and only ones in far there something called one trial learning whereby we experience something and we will remember that thing forever this is often most associated with negative events andi'll explain when a few minutes but it can also be associated with positive events the first time you saw your romantic partner or something that happened with that romantic partner or the first time that you saw your child or any other positive event as well as any other extremely negative event again both repetition and i guess we could labeled intensity but were really mean when we say intensity is strong activation of neurons can lay down these traces these circuits that are far more likely to be active again then had there not been repetition ere not some strong activation of those circuits with that in mine let us return to the original contrary in question that i raise before which is why do we remember anything every day you wake up your neurons in your brain and body are active different neural circuits a active and yet you only remember a small fraction of the things that happen each day and yet you retain a lot of information from previous days in the days before those and on it is only with a lot of repetition or with extremely strong activation of a given normal circuit that we will create new memories and in a few minutes it'll explain how to get extremely strong activation of particular normal circuits repetition is pretty obvious repetition is repetition but in a few minutes it'll illustrate a whole set of experiments and a whole set of tools the point to how you can get extra strong activation of a given neral circuit as it relates to learning that you will remember that information perhaps not just with one trial of learning but certainly with far fewer repetitions than would be required otherwise before we go any further i want a preface to discussion by saying that there are lot of different kinds of memory in fact were you to take a voyage into the normal science and or psychology of memory you would find an immense number of different terms to describe the immense number of different types of memory that researchers focus on but forsake of to day's discussion really just one of focus on short term memory medium term memory and long term memory and while there is still debate as is always the case wat scientists frankly about the exact divisions between short term medium and long tern memory we can broadly define short her memory and long term memory and we can describe a couple different types of those that i think you can relate to in your every day life the most common form of short term memory that were on a foison is called working memory working memory is your ability to keep a chain of numbers in mind for some period of time but the expectation really is not that you would remember those numbers the next day and certainly not the next week good example will be a phone number if i were to tell you shoe number forint three two nine three eight well you c probably remember it for an in three two nine three eight but if i came back to morrow and asked you to repeat that chain of numbers most likely you would not unless of course we used a particular tool to stamp down that memory into your mind and commit it to long term memory now of course in this day and age most people have phone members programmed into their phone key do not really have to remember the exact numbers its usually done by contact identity and forth a different example that some of you are probably more familiar with would be those security cotes you trine log on to an a or a website and ask you for a security code that is been sent to your text messages and then you can either plug that in directly in some cases r you after remember that short sequence of anywhere usually from to seven sometimes eight memory your ability to do that to switch back and forth between web pages or as and plug in that number by remembering the sequence and plugging it in by testing or or being it in noon your keyboard that is a really god example of working memory long term memory of the sort that we are gong to be talking a lot about to day is your ability to commit certain patterns of information either connive information or motor information write the ability move your limbs in a particular sequence over long periods of times such such that you could remember it a day or a week or a month or maybe even a year or several years later we got shorter memory long term memory and we got this working memory which is an i keeping something one line but then discarding it o can not on line on a computer on line within your brain there are also two major categories of memory that i you to know about one is explicit memory this is not necessarily explicit of the sort that you're used to thinking about but rather the fact that you can declare something you have an explicit memory of your name presume you have an explicit memory of the house or the apartment that you grew up in something and it and you can declaring i can ask you what was the color of the first car that you own or what is the color of your romantic partner's hair these sorts of things that is an explicit declarative memory but you also have explicit procedural memories now procedural memories as the name suggests involve action sequences the simplest one it is almost ridiculously simple is walking if i say how is it that you walk from one room to the other you would probably say well i go that direction that turn left i said no no no how is it exactly that you do it say well i move my left foot can my right foot an my left foot and you could describe that it is an explicit procedural memory much that if you are going to teach a young toddler how to walk you would probably say okay good good trocar you probably that s can be prelanguage for the toddler but you are going to encourage them to move one leg than the other and you are going to encourage and reward them for moving one leg the than the other because you have an explicit procedure memory of how to walk cay almost ridiculously simple may even truly ridiculously simple but none the less when you think about in the context of nerd circuits in nor firing pretty amazing even more amazing is the fact that all explicit memories both declarative and procedural explicit memories can be moved from explicit to implicit what i mean by that well in example of walking you might a chuckled a lobe or conshook your head and this a ridiculous thing to ask how to i walk from one room to the next i just walk i just do it ah well what is just do it what it is is that you have an implicit understanding meaning your nervous system knows how to walk without you actually having to think about what about how to walk you just get up out of your chair or you get up out of bed and you walk in the brain you have a structure in fact you have one on each side of your brain called the hippocampus the hippocampus literally means sea horse anatomist the name brain structures after things that they think those brain structures resemble when i look at the hippocampus frankly it does not look a sea horse which either reflects my lack of understanding of what a sea horse really looks a visual deficit or i think it is fair to say that those anatomists were using a little bit of creative om elaboration when thinking about what the hippocampus looks none the less it is a curved structure it has many layers it is been described by my colleague robot supolski by others as looking more a jelly role or a cinamonrole is what it looks to me a and if you were to take one cinamonrol chop it down the middle now you have got two half cinamonroles and rather than put them back together in the configuration they were before you just slide one down that you have got essential two see two c shaped haves of this cinamonrole and you push them together right slightly offset from one another well that is what the hippocampus looks to me and i think that is a far better description of its actual physical structure but i guess if you were to use that physical structures the name will then you would have to open up a brain atlas and it would be called two half c cinamonroles stuffed halfway together that is not very goods i guess s horst will work hippocampus is the name of this structure and it is the sit in your brain and again you have one on each side of your brain in which explicit declarative memories are formed it is not where those memories are stored and maintained it is where they are established in the first place in contrast implicit memories right these subconscious memories are formed and stored elsewhere in the brain mainly by areas the cerebellum but also the no porters the and of outer shell of your brain the serabellmas literally means many brain and it does in fact look a many brain and is in the back of the brain and the youocortects is the outer part of the brain that covers all the other stuff the hippocampus is vitally important for establishing these new declarative memories of what and what how to do now in order to really understand the roll of the hippocampus in memory in particular explicit declarative and explicit procedural memory and to really understand how that is distinct from implicit declarative an implicit procedural memories we have to look to a clinical case and the clinical caste i referring to is a patient who went by the name h m patients go by their initials in order to maintain confidentiality of their real identity h m had what is called intractable epilepsy he would have these really dramaticsocalled grand mall seizures or drop seizures or those of you that no somebody with epilepsy or that have epilepsy you might be familiar with this you can have petitmal seizures which are minor seizures you can have tonic clinic seizures which are sometimes not even detectable toucan have absent seizures will people will just stop it is almost as if their brain goes on paws and to stop there is reported actually that instead had absent seizures although i do not know that it sever really been confirmed neurologically grandma seizures are extremely severe and that is what h m had he could just be going about his day and maybe even cooking or doing something driving operating any kind of m machinery and then all the sudden he would just have a drop seizures he would just physically drop in go into a grand malseizures such convulsing of the whole body loss of consciousness et camera or he would feel it coming on oftentimes s eolith epilepsy can feel the plea seizure coming on collie a wave from the back of the brain and sometimes they can get to a safe circumstance but not always and the frequency in the intensity of his seizures were robot that the narrow surgeons an neurologist decided that they need to locate the origin what they call the losing of those seizures and remove that brain tissue because the way seizures work is the spread out from that to focus of that foci of brain tissue and unfortunately for h m the focus of his seizures was the hippocampus after a lot of deliberation a narrow surgeon effect one of the most famous narc surgeons in the world at that time made what are called a electrolytic legions actually burned out the hippocampus in the brain of h m and as a consequence he lost all explicit memory now the consequence of this was that he could not exist in normal every day life most people he had to live mostly not not entirely but mostly in a kind of hospital setting and have take to several people who have who i should say who met h m directly because he is no longer alive but an interaction with him might look the following he would walk up to you just find you would not know that he had any kind of brain damage he could walk fine he could speak fine and you would say his ism drew and he say high ism whatever his name happened to be get he would not say h m but he brolly say his real name and then perhaps some one knew would walk into the room he might turn around look at that person as any of us might do then turn around back to me and say hi what is your name and if i were to say li just told you my name and you just told me your name you remember that he would say ism sorry i do not remember any of that what is your name we you to go through this over and over again i complete lack of explicit declarative memory now he did have some memory for previous events in his life that dated way back oke again hinting at the idea that memories are not necessarily stored in the hippocampus there just formed in the hippocampus once they have moved out of the ippicampust other brain areas he could still keep those memories there in a different date a base if you will therein a different pattern of firing of other nerd circuits but he could not form new memories now there some very important and interesting twists on what h m could and could not do in terms of learning in memory that teach us a lot about the brain in fact i think most her scientists would degree that this unfortunate case of he's epilepsy and the subsequent nor surgery that he had taught us much of what we know or at least think about in terms of human learning in memory for instance as i mention before he still had implicit knowledge he knew how to a walk he knew how to do certain things make a cup a coffee he knew the names of people that he had met much earlier in his life and on and yet he could not form new memories now in violation to that last statement there were some elements of h mes emotionality that suggests that there was some sort of residual capacity to learn new information but it was not what we normally think of as explicit declarative or procedural memory for instance it is been reported or it is been said i should say because i do not know that the studies were ever done with intense physiological measurements that if you were to tell h m a joke and he thought it was funny he would laugh really hard he liked jokes element you say h m i want to tell you a joke you tellhim a joke an end laugh really hard then you could leave the room come back and tell him the same joke again now keep in mind he did not remember that you told him the joke previously and the second time he would laugh a little bit less and then you love the room come back again say hi ism drew hes o nice to met you because as you no as you recall because you can recall things but he could not recall things he did not know that he just met you r at least he couldn't remember it you tell i the joke a third time or a fourth time and with each subsequent telling of the joke he found it a little less funny just as keep this in mind folks if you tell a joke and you get a big laugh do not tell it again at least not immediately not to the same person or the same crowd because the second time it is a little less funny in the third time it is a little less funny and that i she has to do with e whole element of dopamine and its relationship to surprise and that is the topic of a future pod cast where we talk all about humor and novelty in the brain but the point being that certain forms of memory seems to exist in a kind of phantom way within h mes brain what do i mean by that well this underscores the fact that he had an implicit memory of having heard the joke before and it suggests that humor or at least what we find funny is somehow more related to procedures similar to walking or a memorability then it is to this precise content of that joke are i that is a obit of an abstract concept but the point is that h m lacked explicit declarative memory he could not tell you what he had just heard he could not learn new information and he could not tell you how to do something unless he had learned how to do that something many years prior now there ben a lot of other patients besides h m that have had brain lesions do to epilepsy or i should say do to surgeries to treat epilepsy do to strokes do to om sadly gunshot wounds and other forms of what we call infer infare i an f a r c t in far is the word we used to describe damage to a particular brain region and many different patients with many different patterns of infarct have taught us a lot about how memory another a aspects of the brain work h m really teaches us that what we know and what we are able to do is the consequence of things that we are aware of and learning that have been passed off into subconscious knowledge that are body knows are brain knows but we do not know exactly how we know that thing and i tell you the story about h ms ability to understand a joke but that with repeated telling of a joke it has less and less and less of impact in creating a sense of laughter of humor in h m not is just an anecdote to flesh out his story but because emotion itself turns out to be the way in which we can enhance memories even if those are memories for things that are not funny are not intensely sad are not immensely happy or do not evoke a really strong emotional response or even any creme emotional response and the reason for that is that emotions just perception just sensation are the consequence of particular nor chemicals being present in our brain and body and as ism going to tell you next there are particular nurchemicals that you can leverage in order to learn specific information faster and to remember it for a much longer period of time may be even forever and you can do that by leveraging the relationship in your nervous system between your brain and your body and your body back to your brain let us talk about tools for enhancing memory and there is one tool that it is absolutely clear works and it is always worked it works now and it will work for ever and that is repetition the more often that you perform something or that you recite something the more likely you are to remember it in the future and while that might seem obvious it is worth thinking about what is happening when you repeat something but when i say what is happening i mean at the curl level what is happening is that you are encouraging the firing oft particular chains of anurans that reside in a particular circuit wright particular sequence of nurse's playing neurons b c d played in that particular sequent over and over and over again and with more repetitions you get more strengthening of those nerve connections now repetition works but the problem for most people is that they either do not have the patients they do not have the time and sometimes they literally do not have the time beaus they have got a dead line on something that they are trying to remember and learn or they simply would to be able to remember things better in general remember them more quickly this process of accelerating repetition based learning that your learning curve does not go from having to perform something a thousand times and then gradually over time is a thousand seven hundred fifty times a day five hundred times a day three hundred times t yen down to now repetitions right you can perform that thing the first time in every time well there is a way to shift that curve that you can essentially establish stronger connections between the neurons that are involved in generating that memory or behavior more quickly how do you do that well in order to answer that we have to look at the beautiful work of names magic and marry my hill names mac gas and marry cay hill did a number of experiments over several decades really based on a lot of animal literature but mainly focussed on humans that really established what is required to get better at remembering things and to do very quickly i want to talk about one experiment that they did that was particularly important we will provide a link to this paper it some years old now but the result still hold up in fact the results establish an entire field of memory in narrow science in psychology what they did is they had human subjects come into the laboratory and to read a short paragraph of about twelve sentences and the anything is that some subjects read a paragraph that was pretty mundane the content the information within the paragraph was all related to the content of the previous sentence was a cogent paragraph might it just was not meaningless scramble of words but it described a kind of mundane set of circumstances tit be would be a story about some one who walked into a room sat down in a desk wrote for a little bit than got up and had lunch and i just kind of mundane information not very interesting another group of subjects read also a twelve sentence paragraph but that paragraph included a subset of sentences that had a lot of emotionally intense language or that had language that could evoke an emotionally intense response in the person reading it might have talked about a car accident or a very intense surgery but it also to be positive stuff things a birthday party or a celebration of some other kind or a big sports win in other words you have two conditions of this study people either read a boring paragraph er they read a really emotionally maiden paragraph and again the emotions could either be positive or negative emotions subjects left the laboratory and some time later they were called back to the laboratory and i should say at no point in the experiment did they know they were part of a memory experiment ski they do not know why there being this paragraph they came in either for class credit or to get paid stupidly how these things are done on college campuses or elsewhere they come back into the lab and they would get a pop quiz they would be asked to recall the content of the paragraph that they had read previously ow as is probably expected perhaps even obvious to you the subjects that read the emotionally intense paragraph remembered far more of the content of that paragraph and were far more accurate in the remembering of that information now that particular finding was not very novel many people had previously described how emotionally intense events are better remembered than none emotionally intense events in fact way back in the sixteen hundreds francs bacon whose largely credited with developing the scientific method said quote memory is assisted by anything that makes an impression on a powerful passion inspiring fear for example or wonder shame or joy francs bacon said that in sixteen twenty simian lady call were certainly not the first to demonstrate or to conceive of the idea that emotionally laid in experiences are more easily remembered than other experiences however what they did next was immensely important for our understanding a memory and for are building of tools to enhance learning in memory what they did was they evaluated the capacity for stress and for particular negro chemicals associate with stress to improve our ability to learn information not just information that is emotional but information of all kinds ism going to describe some experiments done in animal models just very briefly and then experemons done on human subjects because manual work mainly on animals also human subjects larycahill almost exclusively on human subjects if you take a rat or mouse and put it in in arena where at one location the animal receives an electrical shock and then you come back the next day you remove the shock of joking device and you let the animal move around that arena that animal will quite understandably avoid the location where it was shock called conditioned place aversion that effect of avoiding that particular location occurs in one trial that is a good example one trial learning somehow the animal knows that it was shock to that location it remembers that it is a hippocampus dependent learning animals that lackohippocampus or have their hippocampus pharmicologically or otherwise in capacitated will not learn that new bit of information but for animals that do they remember it after the first time and every time unless you are to block the release of certain chemicals in the brain and body and then chemicals are referring to are epinephrin a adrenalin and to some extent the cortical stones things coatis all now we know that the effect of getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrin at least in this particular experimental scenario because if researchers do the exact same experiment and they have don exact same experiment but they introduce a pharmacy logical blocker of epinefran that epinephrin is released in response to the shock but it cannot actually bind to its receptors and have all f its biological effects will then the animal is perfectly happy to tread back into the area where it received the shock it is almost as if it did not know or we have to assume they did not remember that it receive the shock at that location it all seems pretty obvious when you hear it something bad happens the location on go back to that location that is condition place avoidance but it turns out that the opposite is also true meaning for something called condition place preference you can take an animal put into a novena feed it or reward it somehow at one location in that arena you can give a hungry rat or mouths food at one particular location take the animal out come back the next day no food is introduce but it will go back to the location were receive the food or you can do any variant of this you can make the arena will but chilly and provide warmth at that location or you can take a man animal and turns out male rats and mice will mate at any point or female animal that that that particular called receptivepase of for mating cycle and give them an opportunity to mate at a given location they will go back to that location and weight in way this is perhaps why we will go back to the same bar or the bar see at the bar or the same reason an wait for cause of the one time they things worked out for them whatever the context was condition place preference condition place preference as with condition place avoidance depends on the release of a adrenaline wright's not just about stress it is about a heightened emotional state in the brain and body can is really important it is not just about stress you can get one trial learning for positive events condition place preference and you can get one trial learning for negative events here i say police negative ism putting what miscalled vigilance on a making a value judgements about whether not the animal liked it or did not it and we have to presume what the animal liked or did not and how it felt but this turns out all to be true for humans as well we know that because wagon cay hill did experiments where they gaze people a boring paragraph to read and only a boring paragraph to read but one group of subjects was asked to read the paragraph and then to place their arm into very very cold water in fatuous ice water we know that placing one's arm into ice water spy shave its up to the shoulder or near to it evokes the release of a adrenaline in the body it is not an enormous release but it is a significant increase and yes they measured a adrenaline release in some cases they also measured for things cortical et camera what they found is that if one evokes the release of a adrenaline through this arm into ice water approach the information that they read previously just a few minutes before was remembered it was retained as well as emotionally intense information but keep a mind that information that they read was not interesting at all at least it wasn't emotionally laden this had to be the effect of a adrenaline released into the brain and body because if they blocked the release or the function of a adrenaline in the brain end or body they could block this effect now they biology of epinephrin and courtesan are literate complex but their some haunts there that is actually interesting in important to us first of all a adrenaline is released in the body end in the brain its release in the body from the adrenals remember epineferan and a adrenaline are the same thing coatis all is also release from the adrenal lands these too little glands that ration our kidneys but it cannot cross into the brain it only has what we call parietal effects quickening of the heart rate right changes the patterns of blood flow changes our patterns of breathing and general makes our breathing more shallow and faster in general makes our heart beat more quickly et camera within our brain we have a little trainer called locust sedulous which is the back of the brain which has the opportunity to sprinkler the rest of the brain with the neuramodulator epinferan a adrenaline as well as nor epinefrnar related oramodulator and to a mentally wake up or create a state of alertness throughout the brain was very general effect the reason we have two sites of release is because these nurchemicals do not cross the blood brainbarrier and waking up the body with a adrenaline and waking up the brain are too separate called parallel phenomena courts all can cross the blood cranberry because its lipophilic meaning it can move through fatty tissue and will et into the biology of that in another episode but coatis all in general is released and has much longer term effects and as have just told you can permeate throughout the brain embody a adrenaline has more local effects are at least asseverated between the brain and the body this will turn out to be important later the important thing to keep in mind is that it is the emotionality evoked by an experience or to be more precise it is the emotional state that you were in after you experience something the dictates whether or not you will learn it quickly or not this is absolutely important in terms of thinking about tools to improve your memory and no i am not going to suggest that every time you ane to learn something you plunge your arm into firewater why will not i suggest that well it will induce the release of a adrenaline but their better ways to get that adrenaline release before i explain exactly what those tools are i want a tamed down the biology of how all this works because in that understanding you will have access to the best possible tools to improve your memory first of all macaw in chill were excellent experimentalists they did not just establish that you could quicken the formation of a memory by accessing material that was very emotionally laid an or creating an emotional hyodrenaline state after interacting with some thing some words some person some information they also tested whether not that whole effect could be blocked by blocking the emotional state or by blocking a adrenalin what they did is they had people read paragraphs o either had a lot of emotional content or they had people read paragraphs that were pretty boring but then had them put their arm into idea er and i should say they did other experiments two to increase the adrenaline their even some shock experiments that were done by other groups any number of things to evoke the release of a adrenaline even people taking drugs that increase the adrenaline but then they also did what are called blocking experiments they did experiments where they had people get into a highly emotional state from reading highly emotional material or they got people to get in to a highly emotional negro chemical state by reading boring material and then taking a drug to increase the adrenaline or ice bath or a shock and then they also administered a drug called a data blocker to block the effect of a adrenaline and related chemicals in the brain and body and what they found is that even if people were exposed to something really emotional or had a lot of a adrenaline an their system because they received a drug to increase the amount of a adrenaline two manipulations that normally would increase memory keep that n mind if they gave them a batablocker which reduced the response to that of adrenaline right no quickening the tartrate no quickening of the breathing no increase in the activity of locustserulias and these kind of wake up signals to the rest of the brain well then the material was not remembered better at all what this tells us is that yes francs bacon was right wagon chill were right hundreds if not thousands of philosophers and psychologists and nauru scientists were right in stating and in thinking that high emotional states help you learn things but what magic in kill really showed and what is most important to know is that it is the presence of high a adrenaline high amounts of norepinefran and epinephrin and perhaps coatis all as well as you will soon see that a lows a memory to be stamped down quickly it is not the emotion it is the negro chemical state that you go in to as a consequence of the emotion and it is very important understand that while those two things are related they are not one in the same thing because what that means is that were you to evoke the release of epinefran norepinefran in sort us all or even just one or two of those chemicals after experiencing something you are stamping down the experience that you just previously had this is fundamentally important and far and away different then the idea that we remember things because they are important to us are because they evoke emotion that is true but the real reason that near chemical reason the mechanism behind all that is these petrochemicals have the ability to strength in neural connections by making them active just once there is something truly magic about that petrochemical cocktail that removes the need for repetition o case let us supply this knowledge let us establish a scientifically grounded see of tools meaning tools that take in to account the identity of the petrochemicals that are important for in hanging learning and the timing of the release of those chemicals in order to enhance learning when i first learned about the results of man a hill i was just blown away i was also pretty upset but not with them i was upset with myself because i realize that the way that i ad been approaching learning in memory was not optimal in fact it was probably in the opposite direction to the enhanced photo can for learning a memory that i am going to teach you to day my typical mode of trying to learn something while i was in college or while was in graduate school or is a junior professor senior professor was to sit down to whatever it is i was going to try and learn perhaps even memorize or if it was a physical skill move to whatever environment i was going to learn that physical skill in and prior to that to make sure that i was hydrated cause that is important to me and certainly can contribute to your brains ability to function your bodies ability to function and general patterns of alertness but also to raffinate i would have a nice strong cup of coffee or express i would have a nice strong cup of bromate and i still drink coffee or yeurbamante very regularly i drink them in moderation i think certainly for me but typically i would drink those things before i would engage in any kind of attempt to learn or memorize or to acquire a new skill now caffeine in the form of coffee or carbamate or any other form of caffeine does create a sense of alertness in our brain an body and it does that through too major mechanisms the first mechanism is by blocking the effects of a decisive a decisive is a molecule that builds up in the brain anybody the longer that we are awake and it is largely what is responsible for our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue when we have been awake for a very long time caffeine essentially acts to block the effects of a decisive it is a competing agonist not to get technical but it binds to the receptor for a decisive for some were to time and prevents a decisive from having its normal pattern of action and thereby reduces our feelings of fatigue but it also increases state of alertness while it is reducing fatigue it is also pushing on narrow chemical systems in order to directly increase our alertness and it does that enlarge part by increasing the transmission of epineffrnt a adrenaline in the brain an body it also has this interesting effect of regulating the number and or efficiency or we say the efficacy of dopominoreceptors such that when dopamines present and as a molecule that increases motivation and craving and pursuit that dopamine can have a more potent effect than it would otherwise caffeine really hits these three systems it its other systems to but t mainly reduces fatigue by reducing a denizens increases alertness by increasing epineferan release or grenadine release i should say both from the adrenals in your body and from locus terulios within the brain and it can in parallels all that increase the action or the efficacy of the action of dreamy my typical way of approaching learning a memory would be to drink some caffeine and then folks really hard on whatever it is that item trying to learn trying eliminate distractions and then hope hope hope or try try try to remember that information as best as i could frankly i felt like it was working pretty well for me and typically if i leveraged other forms of farm apology in order to enhance learning a memory things alpha p c or phosphatital crine i would do that by taking those things before i sat down to learn a particular said of information or before i went off to learn a particular physical skill now for those of you out there listening in this your probably thinking well o k the results of agone k hill pointed to the fact that having a adrenaline released after learning something enhanced learning of that thing but allot of these things affine or alpha p c can increase upineferin and a adrenaline or dopamine or other molecules in the brain and body they can hance memory for a long period of time take sense to take it first or even during learning and then allow that increase to occur and the increase will occur over a long period of time and will enhance learning a memory and while that is partially true it is not entirely true and it turns out its not optimal work that was done by the magic laboratory and other laboratories evaluated the precise temporal relationship between nurichemical activation of these pathways and learning in memory what they did is they had animals and or people depending on the experiment take a drug could be caffeine could be in piliform something that would increase a adrenaline or related molecules the create this state of a heartless that are related to emotionality and they had them do it either an hour before thirty minutes before ten minutes before five minutes before learning or during the bout of learning write the eating of the information or the performing of the skill that one is thing to learn or five minutes ten minutes fifteen minutes thirty minutes et camera afterwards they looked very precisely at when exactly as best to evoke this adrenaline release and it turns out that the best time window to evoke the release of these chemicals if the goal is to enhance learning in memory of the material is either immediately after or just a few minutes five ten maybe fifteen minutes after your repeating that information you're trying to learn that information again this could be connive information or this could be a physical skill now this really spits in the face of the way that most of us approach learning a memory most of us if we use stimulates caffeine or alpha p c were taking those before or during an attempt to learn not afterwards these results point to the fact that it is after the learning a memory that you really want to get that big increase in apenefron and the related molecules that will tamp down memory what this means is that if you are currently use in coffin or other compounds d will talk about what those are and safety issues and forth in a moment if you are using those compounds in order to enhance learning an memory by taking them before or during a learning episode well then i encourage you to try and take them either late in the learning episode or immediately after the learning episode now given everything have told you up until now why would i say late in the learning episode or immediately after well when you invest something by drinking it or you take it in capital form there is a period of time before that gets absorbed into the body in different substances such is coffin nalphicep you see et camera are absorbed in from the got into the blood stream and reach the brain and trigger these effects in the brain body at different rates it is not instantaneous some have effects within minutes others within tens of minutes and on really going to depend on the pharmacology of those things and its also going to depend on whether not yet food in your got what else you happen have circulating in your bloodstream et camera but at a very basic level we can confidently say that there are not one not dozens but as i mention before hundreds of studies in animals and in humans that point to the fact that triggering the increase of a adrenaline late in learning or immediately after learning is going to be most beneficial if your goal is to retain that information for some period of time and to reduce the number of repetitions required in order to learn that information now i want to acknowledge that on previous episodes of this podcast and in appearing another podcast have talked a lot about things non sleep deep rest and naps and sleep as vital to the learning process and i want to emphasize that none of that information has changed i i do not look at any of that information differently is the consequence of what ism talking about to day it is still true that the strengthening of connections in the brain the literal neural plates the changing of the circuits occurs during deep sleep and non sleep deep rest and it is also true and have mention these results earlier that two papers were published in sell reports see paternal excellent journal of the last few years showing that brief naps of about twenty to up to ninety minutes some in some period of time after and attempt to learn can enhance the rate of learning in memory however those bouts of sleep the deep sleep that night i should say or those brief naps or even the called enemy are as we call it non sleep deep rest that was used to insane the learning in memory of particular pieces of information either cognitive or physical information are both that still can be performed but it can be performed some hours later even an hour later it can be performed two hours later four hours later remember it is in these naps and in deep sleep that the actual recon figuration of the neral circus occurs the strengthening of those naval circuits occurs it is not the case that you need to finish about of learning and drop immediately into a nap or sleep some people might do that but if you really trying to optimize and enhance an improve your memory the data from wagon chill and many other laboratories that stemmed out from their initial work really point to the fact that the ideal protocol would be focus on the thing you are trying to learn very intensely there also some other things perorates et camera plus see are episodes on learning we have a news letter on how to learn better you can access that at huremlabdacomet ta zero cost news letter you grab that pedal it lists out the things to do during the learning bout still trying get excellent sleep again fundamentally important for mental physical health and performance and we can now extend from performance to saying including learning in memory nap if it does not interrupt your night time sleep naps of anywhere from ten to ninety minutes or non sleep deepest protocols will enhance learning and memory but we can now add to that that spiking an adrenaline provided can be done in a safe way is going to reduce the number of repetitions require to learn and that should be done at the very tale end or immediately after a learning about which is compatible with all the author protocols that i mention and the reason am revisiting the stuff about sleep and non sleep breast as i think that some people got the impression that they need to do that immediately after learning and to day saying to the contrary immediately after learning you need to go into heighten state of emotionality an alertness now it is vitally important to point out that you do not need pharmacology you do not need caffeine you do not need alpha g p c you do not need any pharmacologic substance to spike adrenaline unless that something the you already are doing or that you can do safely or that that you can do safely and i always say andi'll say it again ism not a physician am not proscribing anything of professor s i profess things you need to do what safe for use o if your somebody who is not used to drinking caffeine and you suddenly drink forest press after trying to learn something you are going to have a severe increase in alertness and probably o an anxiety if your panic attack prone please do not start taking stimulants in order to learn things better please be safe i do not you say that to protect me i say that to protect you and i should mention that if you are not accustomed to taking something you always want to first check wit your doctor of course but also move in to that gradually right stop start with the lowest effective dottle dose the minimal effective dose and sometimes the final effective dose is zero telegrams it is nothing why ow i say that well we already talked about results where they put people's arms into an ice bath in order to evokeadrenal in release you are welcome to do that if you want in fact that is a pretty low cost a zero pharmacology at least exogenous pharmacology way to approach this whole thing that is a way of evoking your own natural apinaffran and it turns out also dopamine release you could take a cold shower you could do an ice bath or get into a a cold circulating bath we have done several episodes on the utility of cold for health and performance you can find those episodes at bring labia cam also the episode with my colleague at stamford from the biology department doctor crag heller lots of protocols in particular in the episode on cold for health and performance that describe how best to use the cold shower or the ice bath or the circulating cold bath in order to evoke pin are an dopamine release the point is that the time in which you would want to do those protocols is after ideally immediately after your learning bout meaning when you are sitting down to learn you information or after trying to learn some new physical skill now whether not that is compatible with the other reasons you're doing colic deliberate cold exposure and whether or not that is compatible with the other things you are doing that depends on the contour of your lifestyle your training you are academic goals your learningolls et camera but if your specific purpose is to enhance learning a memory you want a spike a rent and afterwards and what ism telling yous you can do that with affine can do that with alpha p c you can do that with ha commination of canine and alpha p c if you can do that safely some of you i know are using other forms of pharmacology i did a long episode all about eighty eight i after just really declare my stance very clearly that i am not a fan i am actually oppose to people using prescription drugs who are not prescribe those drugs rite in order to enhance a heartless i think there is a big addictive potential there also is a potential to really disrupt one's one pharmacology around the doomed uric system a however some of you i know are prescribed things riddled after all and modaphinil in things to that sort in order to crease a alertness and focus for those of you that are prescribe those things from a a you in bort certified physician you are going have to decide you arguing to take them before trying to learn or after trying to learn you will have to take in toe consideration that some of those drugs are very long acting summer shorter acting and time that according to what your thing to learn and when that is formacology but as have mention there are the behavioral protocols you can use cold and cold is an excellent stimulus because first of all it does not if all pharmacology second of all you can generally access it at low to zero cost specially the cold shower approach and third you can ti trade it you can start with warmer water you can make it very very cold if that is your thing and you are able to tolerate that safely you can make it moderately cold how cold should it be in order to evoke a adrenalin release well it should be uncomfortably cold but cold enough that you feel you really want to get out but can stay in safely that is going to evoke a rent in release if it quickens your breathing if it makes you go wide eyed that is increasing a adrenalin release and fact of those effects of i wide eyed and quickening of the breathing and the challenges and thinking clearly those are the direct effects of a renal in on your brain in body and of course there are other ways to increase ta adrenalin you could go out for a horrid run you could do any number of things that would increase a adrenaline in your body which things you choose is up to you but from a very clear solid grounding in research data we can confidently say that spiking an adrenalin after interacting with some material physical or cognac material that your trying to learn is going to be the best time to spike that a adrenalin now i realize that am being a bit redundant to day or perhaps a lot redundant in repeating over and over that the increase in epinefran should occur either very late in an attempt to learn something or immediately after an attempt to learn something i also want to emphasize the general contour of pharmacologic effects and of behavior tools to create a adrenalin what do i mean by that sentence what i mean is that magic in colleagues explored a huge number of different compounds and approaches everything from the hand into the ice bath to injecting a adrenalin to caffeine to drugs that block the effects of a renal caffeine drugs musical and pecrotox and please do not take those these are drugs that reduce or enhance the amount of a adrenalin and the over all take away is that anything that increases a adrenaline will increase learning in memory and will reduce the number of repetitions required to learn something regardless of whether not that something has an emotional intensity or not provided that that spike in a adrenaline occurs at in the learning or immediately after and anything that reduces epineferan an a adrenalin will impair learning and that is the key and novel piece of information that ism acting now which is if you are taking batablockers for instance or if you're trying to learn some thing and it is not evoking much of an emotional response and you are not using any pharmacology or other methods to enhance a adrenalin release after learning that thing well you are nock an a learn it very well in fact pagan kail did beautiful experiments in humans looking at how much a adrenalin is increased by varying the emotional intensity of different things that they were trying to get people to learn or by changing the dosage of epinefran or by changing the amount of epinefran blocker that they injected lots and lots of studies the anything to take away from those studies is that for some people a adrenaline was increased six hundred to seven hundred per cent six to sevenfold over base line in the amount of circulating epineferon or adrenaline and keep it mind sometimes that increase was due to the actual thing they were trying to learn being very emotional positive or negative emotion and sometimes it is because they were using a pharmacologic approach or the ice bath approach i do not thin they ever used to cold shower approach but that would have ben a very effective one we can be sure however other people had a zero to ten per cent increase or very small increase in pin effort what we can confidently say on the basis of all those data is that the more epineferan release the better that people remembered the material over and over again this was shown whether not it as for cognitive material to learning a language learning a passage of words learning mathematics or whether not for physical learning i want to emphasize something about physical learning because i know a number of you are probably drinking a cup of coffee or having a cup of your rotate or may be even an energy drink and taken some alphagpe see or something before physical exercise ism not saying that is a bad thing to do or that you would not want to do that but that is really to increase alertness it will not enhance learning at least not as well as doing those things after the physical exercise now again many of you including myself exercise for sake of the physical benefits of that exercise a party of vascular resistance training but we are not really focused on learning and memory i emphasize this just it is immensely clear to everybody if you want to use those approaches of increasing a adrenalin prior to or turning physical training or connive work for that matter be my guests i think that is perfectly fine provided that safe for you only by moving it to late or after the learning that your really shifting the role of that a adrenalin increase to enhancing memory specifically and as a cautionary note do not think that you can push this entire system to the extreme over and over again or ironically as we say and get away with it in other words you are not can to be able to take a alpha p c and a double express do your focus bowed of work connive or physical work and then spike a dreamland again afterwards and remember that stuff even better right ism not encouraging in fact om discouraging you from chronically increasing a adrenalin both during and after a given bowed of work if the goal is to learn why do i say that well work from again chill and others has shown that it is not the absolute amount of a adrenaline that your release in your brain body that matters for enhancing memory it is the amount of a adrenaline that you release relative to the amount of a drenninlin that was in your system just prior in particular in the hour or to prior get it is the delta as we say it is the difference you're get a chronically increase a adrenalin you are not an a learn is well the real key is to have a adrenalin modestly low perhaps even just as much as you need in order to be able to focus on something pay attention to it and then spike it afterwards this is immensely important because well much of what we are talking about is actually a form of inducing a negro chemical acute stress being a brief and rapid onset of stress well chronictrise the chronic elevation of epinaperan and sort us all is actually detrimental to learning and there is an end higher category of literature mainly from the work of the great and sadly the late a brace manual from the rockevill a university and some of his scientific offspring the great robot supolsky showing that chronic stress chronic elevation of epinephrin actually inhibits learning in memory and also can inhimitimune system function whereas acute right sharp increases in a adrenalin and court is all actually can enhance learning windy can enhance the avian system if you really want a leverage this information you might consider getting your brain and body into a very calm and yet alert state high attentional state that will allow you to focus on what it is that your trying to learn we know focus is vital for incoming information and for triggering neral plasticity but remaining calm throughout that time and then afterwards spiking a drennalan and allowing a adrenalin to have these incredible effects on reducing the number repetitions required to learn if you are me your learning about this information this beautiful work of wagon a hill and others and thinking while i should perhaps consider spiking by a adrenalin in one former another at the tale end or immediately follow an attempt to learn something and yet we are not the first to have this conversation nor were wagon k hill or any other researchers that have discussed to day the first to start using this technique in fact there is a beautiful review that was published just this year may of twenty twenty two in the journal neuron see press journal excellent journal call mechanisms of memory under stress and i just want to read to you the first opening paragraph of this review which is of the name suggest all about memory and stress here i am reading and i quote in medieval times communities through young children in the river when they wanted them to remember important events they believe that throwing a child in the water after witnessing stoic proceedings would leave a lifelong memory for the events in the child believe are not this is true this is a practice that somehow people arrived at i do not know if they were aware of what a adrenalin was probably not but somehow in medieval times it was understood that spiking a adrenalin or creating a robust emotional experience after an experience that one hoped a child would learn would encourage the child's nervous system and the amino nervous system was but would encourage the brain and body that child to remember those particular events very counter intuitive if you ask me i would have thought that the kid would remember only being thrown into the river my guesses that they remember that but that they the idea here anyway is that they also remember the things that preceded being thrown into the river both interesting and amusing and somewhat om i should a thought stimulating really that this is a practice that has been going on for many hundreds of years and we are not the first to start thinking about using cold water as in adrenaline stimulus nor are we the first to start thing about using cold water induced to adrenaline as a way to enhance learning a memory this is been happening since medieval times up until now have been talking about the pretty broad contour of these experiments have been talking bout the the underlying for apology the roll of epinephrin and forth have not really talked a lot about the underlying neral mechanisms just can take a in or to and describe those forgo because they are in formative we all have a brain structure called the emigdula a lot of people think its associated with fear but its actually associated with threat detection and more generally and i should say more specifically with detecting what sorts of events in the environment are novel and are linked to particular emotional states both positive emotional that's an negative emotional states the neurons in the imigdula are exquisitely good at figuring out filthy don't hove their own mind but a detecting correlations between sensory events in the environment that trigger the release of a adrenaline and what is going on in the brain and because the imigulis extensively interconnected with other airs of the brain i basely connects to everything in everything connects back to it the immigulas in a position to strengthen particular connections in the brain very easily provided certain conditions are met an those conditions of the ones we been talking about up in tone up until now emotional saliency that results in increases in epinephrin in cortical or circulating pan effort and coatis all being much higher than it was ten men cirfifteen minutes before and the net effect of the imigdula in this context is to take whatever patterns of neral activity preceded that increase in ha adrenaline in corticosterone and strengthen those synapses that were involved in that neral activity the ligula does not have knowledge it is not a thinking area it is a correlation detector and its correlating near chemical states of the brain anybody with different patterns of electrical activity in the brain this is important because it really emphasizes the fact that both negative and positive emotional states and the different but somewhat overlapping chemical states that they create or the conditions as we say the and gates through which memory is laid down and gates will be familiar to those of you who have done a bit of computer programming an mandate is simply a condition in which you need one thing and another to happen in order for a third thing to happen you need epinefran elevated and you need robust activity in a particular brain circuit if in fact that brain circuit is going to be strengthened it is not sufficient to have one or the other you need both hence the name and gate and the imigulas very good at establishing these indicate contingencies it is also of very generic brain structure in the sense that it does not really care what sorts of sensory events are involved provided the correlated in time with that increase in a adrenaline and corticosterone this has a wonderful side and a kind of dark side the dark side is that pitiasti and dramas of various kinds often involve a increase in a adrenaline because whatever it was that cause the pities was indeed very stressful cause these big increases in these chemicals and because the emigdula is rather general in its functions right it is not tuned or designed in any kind of way to be specifically active in response to particular types of sensory events or perceptions well then what it means is that we can start to become afraid of entire city blocks where one bad thing happened in a particular room of a particular building in a city block we can become fearful of any place that contains a lot of people if something bad happen to us in a place that contained a lot of people the emigdula is not much of a splitter as we say in science we to about lumpers and splitters lumpers or kind of generalize a generalizes if that is even a word and i think it is some one will tell me one work or the other and splitters are people that are ultra precise and specific and nuance about every little detail the emigdula is more of a lumper than a splitter when it comes to sensory events other airs of the brain only become active under very very specific conditions and only those conditions and similarly epinefran is just a molecule its just a chemical that circulating in our brain and body there is no even efferent specifically for a cult shower that is distinct from the epinferan associate with a bad event which is distinct from the epinefran associate with a really exciting event that makes you really alert epinefron is just a molecules generic also these systems have a lot of overlap and that can explain an large part why when good things happen in particular locations and in the company of particular people we often generalize to large categories of people places and things and when negative things happen in particular circumstances we often generalize about people places and things associated with that negative event now it'd to talk about other tools that you can leverage that have been shown in quality previewed studies to enhance learning in memory and perhaps one of the most potent of those tools is exercise there are numerous studies on this in both animal models and fortunately now also in humans thanks to the beautiful work of people windy kabuki from new york university wendy'slab has identified how exercise works to enhance learning in memory and other forms of cognition i shoulvention as well as things that can augment can enhance the effects of exercise on learning in memory and other forms of cognition windy is going to be a guest on this podcast is actually the episode that follows this episode and includes a lot of material that we have not covered to day and shes an incredible scientist and has some incredible findings that i know everyone is going to find events useful in the meantime one to talk about some of the general effects of exercise on learning an memory that she is discovered in the other laboratories have discovered you recall earlier i mention that learning in memory almost always involves the strengthening of particular synapsis and neural circuits in the brain and not much the increase in the number of neurons in the brain there is one exception however and we now have both animal data and some human data to support the fact that cardiovascular exercise seems to increase will we call dentate gyros autogenesis nurgenesis is the creation of new neurons the dentate gyros is a subregion of the hippocampus that is involved in learning and memory of particular kinds i certain types of events in particular contextual learning but some other things as well sometimes involved in spacial learning lot a debate about exactly what the dense gyros does but forsake of this discussion and i think everyone in the tyrosines compete would agree that the dentate gyros is important for memory formation and consolidation the dentate gyros does seem to be one region of the brain certainly in the road in brain but more and more it seeming also in the human brain where at least some new neurons are added throughout the life span and as it turns out that cardiovascular exercise can increase the proliferation of new neurons in the structure and that those our new neurons souse me are important for the formation of certain types of new memories their wonderful data showing that if you use ex radiation which is away to eliminate the formation of those new cells or other tools and tricks to eliminate the formation of those cells that you block the formation of certain kinds of learning an memory what does this mean well there a latter reasons for the statement i am about to make that extend far beyond nurgenisis and the hippocampus learning in memory but it is very clear that getting anywhere from a hundred and eighty i should say a minimum of a hundred and eighty to two hundred minutes have called zone to cardiovascular exercise this is cardiovascular exercise that can be performed at a pretty steady states a which would allow you to just barely hold a conversation a breathing hard but not superhero sis an sprints or high intense the interval training bet doing that for a hundred and eighty to two hundred minutes per week total is it appears the minimum threshold for enhancing some of the longevity effects associated with improvements in cardiovascular fitness and we believe that it is indirectly i should say indirectly through enhancements in cardiovascular fitness that there are improvements in hyppicampel dense gyros autogenesis what does that mean the improvements in cardiovascular function are indirectly impacting the ability of the dense gyros to create these new neurons to my knowledge there's no direct relationship between exercise and stimulating the production of new neurons in the brain it seems that it is the improvements in blood flow that also relate to improvements in things lymphatic flow the circulation of limp fluid within the brain that are enhancing neurogenesis and that gamogenesis is it appears is important now in fairness to the a landscape of serow science and my colleagues at stamford and elsewhere there is a lot of debate as to whether not there is much if any cenogenesis in the adult human brain but regardless i think the date are quite clear that the under any to two hundred its minimum of cardiovascular exercises going t be important for other health metrics now it is clear that exercise can impact learning in memory through other non cenogenesis non new neon time mechanisms and one of the more exciting one that has been studied over the years is this notion of hormones from bone traveling in the blood stream to the brain and enhancing the function of the hippocampus the words hormones from bones is surprising to you here to tell you that yes indeed your bones make hormones we call these indicant effects in biology we hear about audicrin pericline and endocrine and those different terms referred to over what distance a given chemical has an effect on a cell forincisisel can have a effect on itself it can have an effect on immediately neighboring cells or can have an effect on both itself immediately neighboring cells and cells far far away in the body and that last example of given chemical or substance having an effect on the cell that produced it plus neighboring cells plucells far away is an indican effect and a lot of hormones not all work in this fashion hence why we sometimes hereabout indican and hormone as kind of synonymous terms your bones make chemicals that travel in the blood stream and have these indicant effects of their effectively acting as hormones and one such chemicals somethiygcalled step calling now these findings arrive to us through various slaps but one of the more important labs forsake of this discussion today is the laboratory of epic can dell at colombia medical school epic is now i believe in his midtolate nineties still very sharp and has studied learning an memory it also turns out that he is an avid swimmer now i happen to know that epic swims anywhere from a half a mile to a mile a day and again this is anecdote of this is am not referring to the publish date of just yet but he credits that exercise as one of the ways in which he keeps his brain sharp and has indeed kept his brain sharp for many many decades and as i went o before he welling to his ninety pretty impressive his laboratory has studied the effects of exercise on hippochampal function an memory and other laboratories have done that is well and wat they found is that cardiovascular exercise and perhaps other forms of exercise to but mainly cardiovascular exercise creates the release of step c algin from the bones that travels to the brain and to subregion of the hippocampus and encourages the electrical activity and the formation and maintenance of connections within the hippocampus and keeps the hippocampus functioning well in order to lay down new memories now onto also has a lot of effects besides just improving the function of the hippocampus ostiocalson is involved in bone growth itself it is involved in hormone regulation in fact the really nice evidence that can regulate testosterone and estrogen production by the testesand ovaries and a much of other effects and other organs of the body because again its acting in this indercrin manner its arriving from bone to a lot of different organs to have effects load bearing exercise in particular turns out to be important for inducing the release of onto calling and when you think about this it makes sense a nervous system exists for letter reasons depends perceive et camera you got taste you got smell you got hearing but the vast majority of brain real estate especially in humans is dedicated to two things one vision we have an enormous amount of brain real estate devoted to vision certainly compared to other senses and to movement the ability to generate course movements of the body the generate the ability souse me to generate fine movements of the body the digest or to wink one eye or o tilt your head in our particular way or move your lips and move your face and do all sorts of different things in a very nuance and detailed way much of our brain real estate is devoted to movement that it is been hypothesized for more than a half century but especially in recent years as we have learned more about the function of the brain at a really detailed circuit level that the relationship between the brain and body and the maintenance and perhaps even the improvement of nerd circuitry in the brain depends on our body movements and the signal from the body that our brain is still moving think about that how would your brain know if your body was moving regularly and how would it know how much it was moving how would it know which limbs it was moving well you could say if the heart rate is increase then the blood flow will be increased and than the brain will know ah but how does your brain know that its increased blood flow due to movement and not to for instance just stress right make you actually cannot moving your very stressed about that and the increase blood flow is simply a consequence of i increased stress the fact that onto calling is released from bone and in particular can be released in response to load bearing exercise this would be running again weight lifting has not been tested directly but one would imagine anything involves jumping and landing or weight lifting or body a body weight movements and things of that sort that is a signal to release onto calling and we know that signal occurs that is directly reflective of the fact that the body was moving and moving in particular ways in fact you could imagine that big bones your fee me are going to release more onto chain ore being a position to release more onto chain than five move fine movements the movements of the digits and this idea that the body is constantly signalling to the brain about the status of the body and the varying needs of the brain to update its brain circuitry is a really attractive idea that fits entirely with the biology of exercise onto chain and hypocampal function i do not mention that i am not the first to raise this hypothesis this hypothesis actually was discussed in the fair amount of detail by john raid whose of professor and harbor medical school you wrote a book called spark which was one of the early books leas from an academic about brain plasticity in the relationship between exercise and movement and plasticity and john who i have the good portion to know has described to me experiments or should they observations of species of of ocean dwelling animals that have at least for the early part of their life a very robotic complicated nervous system but then these particular animals are in the habit of plopping down on to a rock they find a kind of a safe comfy space and they actually stick to that rock and they do not move any more for a certain portion i should say the late portion of their life and it is at the transition between moving a lot and being stationary that those animals actually digest their own brain they literally metabolize a good portion of their nervous system if they decide on holy this any more and gobble it up use it for it is nutritional value and then sit there a more on version of themselves with a limited amount of brain tissue because they do not need to move any more now i certainly do not want to give the message that just moving just exercise is sufficient to keep the nerd architecture of your brain healthy young and able to learn while that might be true it is also important to actually engage in attempts to learn new material either physical material new types of movements and skills and or new types of connive information languages mathematics history a current events all sorts of things o that involve your brain none the less it is clear that physical movement and cognitive ability and the potential to enhance conning of ability and the ability of learn new physical skills are intimately connected and onto calcic appears to be at least one way in which that brainbody relationship is established and maintained given the information about onto chain and movement and given the information about spiking an adrenaline late or after of period of attempt to learn you might be asking when is the best time to exercise now unfortunately that has not been addressed in a lot of varying detail were every sort of variation on the theme has been carried out and yet when sezuki's lap has done really beautiful experiments where they have people exercise generally it was in the morning but at other periods of the day as we l what they find is that at least as late as two hours after that exercise there is an enhancement in learning in memory now i want to be clear we do not know whether r not that exercise led to big increases in a adrenalin it may be that those forms of exercise were modest enough or don't challenge people enough that they merely got a lot of blood flow going and that the improvements and learning a memory were related to blood flow and we presume increases in auction also however you could imagine a couple of different logical protocols base on what we have talked about let say you were going to do a form of exercise that was going to spike a adrenalin a lot this would be exercise that really challenges your system in forces you can o push through a burn rites o here ism mainly thing about cratyvascular exercise but it could be a it could even be yoga it could be resistance training if it s going to give you a big spike in the adrenalin can it take some serious effort then logically speaking you would want to place that after a learning bout in order to increase learning in memory however if your using the exercise in order to enhance blood flow and to enhance onto calling release in efforts to augment the functionary hippocampus i think it stands to reason that doing that exercise some time within the hour to three hours preceding and attempt to learn makes a lot of sense and there on basing it on the human data from when usuzuci's lab on basing it on the studies for mericandellan from others labs again right now there has not been an evaluation of a lot of different protocols to arrive at the pure review laboratory superprotocol however since wat were talking about is using activity's exercise that most of us probably perhaps all of us should be doing regularly anyway and i do believe most if not all of us should my regularly be trying to learn and keep our brain functioning well and acquire new knowledge because it is just a wonderful part of life and there is evidence that that actually can keep your brain young to speak well then exercising either before or after a learning bout makes a lot of sense with the emphasis on after a learning bout if the form of exercise spikes a lot of a adrenaline for all the reasons we talked about before o case the we have talked about two major categories of protocols to improve memory that are grounded in quality pure reviewed science and there is yet another third protocol that will talk about in a few minute but before we do that when a briefly touch on an aspect of memory in fact two aspects of memory that i get a lot of questions about the first one is photographic memory to be clear there are people out there who have a true photographic memory they can look at a page of text they can scan it with their eyes and they can essentially commit that to memory with very little if any effort when it might seem to having a photographic memory is a very attractive skill to have should caution you against believing that because it turns out that people with true photographic memory are often very challenged at remembering thing e that they hear and oftentimes are not good at learning physical skills is not always the case but often that is the case be careful what you wish for if you you have a photographic memory there are certain professions that lend themselves particularly well to you and indeed a lot of people it photographic memory have to find they profession and have to move through life in a way that is in concert with that photographic memory again it is a insuperability it is a hyperacidity and yet it is not necessarily one that a is desirable for most people there is also this category of what are called superrecognizers on these people are are i should mention highly employable by government agencies ties are people that have an absolutely astonishing ability to recognize faces and to match faces to templets they can look at a photograph of say somebody on a most wanted list and then they can look at video footage of let say an air port or small or city street at fairly low resolution and they can spot the person whose face matches that photograph that they looked at even if that video or other footage is of people a profiles or even the tops of their heads and just a portion of their forehead these people have just an incredible ability to recognize faces an to templet match and again these people often will take a jobs with agencies where this sort of thing is important a some of you out there probably are superrecognizers and may or may not notice it if you ever have the experience of watching a move and thought t yourself ow her mouth look much my cousin s mouth or you look at a character and a movie tell o vision so and you think how they look almost the younger sister of and well then it is very likely that you have this or at least a mild form of this superrecognize her ability that is not memory person that is the hyper functioning of an area of the brain that we call the fusiform gyros the fusiform gyros is literally a face recognition area and efface templet matching area and it harbors neurons that respond to faces generally as humans and other non human primates care lot about faces and their emotional content and the identity of faces is superimportant to us for all the kinds of reasons that are probably obvious knowing whose friend whose foe who do well whose famous who is not famous et camera that is not memory person and yet if your superrecognizer or i guess we could call it a moderate face recognizer or not very good at recognizing faces cause indeed there are some people that are kind of face blind they do not actually recognize people when they walk in the room i ease to work with somebody this i walk into his office and he'd say are you rich or are you drew i say will my rich rich wealth rich no and need say no are you richer or are you drew hand it'd say drew we know each other really once it oh am sorry r my ism got of face blind and at actually often to be better worse on of depending on how much he was working o ironically the more rested he was the more face blind he would become it was not a sleep deprivation thing that exists that is out there there is the full constellation of people's ability recognized faces that is not really memory and yet visual function is a profoundly powerful way in which we can enhance our memory whether not you're a superrecognizer of faces werethere not you are face blind or anything in between next omen to tell you about a study which points out the immense value of visual images for laying down memories and you can leverage's information and this involves both the taking a photograph something as i should quite easy easily done these days with your phone as well as your ability to take mental photographs by literally snapping your eyelids shot just briefly want to describe this paper because it provides a tool that you can leverage in your attempt to learn and remember things better the title of this paper is photographic memory the effects of our volitional photoaging on memory for visual and auditory aspects of an experience i really this paper because it refers to photographic memory not in the contact of photographic memory that we normally hereabout where people are truly photographic look at a pageant somehow absorbable that information and commit it to memory but rather the use of camera photographs or the use of mental camera photographs literally looking at something in deciding blink snapping a to speak snapping a snapshot of whatever it is that you are looking at and re mentoring the content reason i this paper and the reason ism attracted to this issue of mental snap shots is this is something that i bee doing since i was a kid i do not know why i star tod doing it but every once in a while i which thy may be twice a year i would look at something and decides just snap a mental snapshot of it and have maintained very clear memories of those visual scenes two years ago i was in an user and i looked out the window and it was a street see now was actually in new york at the time and i decided for reasons that are still unclear to me to take a mental snap shot of this city street image even though nothing interesting in particular was happening and o i do recall that there was a guy wearing yellow shirt walking therewase some construction et camera i can still see that image in my mind's eye because i took this mental snap shot this paper address is whether not this mental snap shooting thing is real and this is something that i think a lot of people a will resonate with whether not the constant taking of pictures on our phones or with other devices is either improving or degrading our memory you can imagine an argument for both a lot of people are taking pictures that they never look at again and in a sense their outsourcing there met their visual memory of events into their phone or to some other device and there not ever accessing the actual image and they're not looking at it right you are not printing out those photos you are not scanning through your phone again sometimes you might do that but most of time people do not most of the photographs that people taking they are not revisiting again the motivation for the study was that previous experiments had shown that if people take photos of a scene or a person or an object that they are actually less good at remembering the details of that scene or object et camera this study challenged that idea and raised the hypothesis that if people are allowed to choose what they take photos of that taking photos again this is with a camera not mental snapshouting that taking those photos would actually enhance their memory for those objects those places those people and in fact details of those object places and people and indeed that is what they found in contrast to previous studies where people had been more or less told take photos of these following objects or these following people or these following places and then they were given a memory test tot some point later in this study people were given volitional control right they were given agency in making the decision of what to take photos of will just sunrise the results will provide a link to the study should say that some of the stuff that they tested was actually pretty challenging am some of them were a pottery and other forms of ceramics that a are of the sort tat you see if you go to a big museum in a big city and if you have ever done that you see all the different objects lot of details in those objects and law those objects look a lot a and some will have two handles what some we have one handle the position of the handles how how broad or narrow these things are hen allotted is pretty detailed stuff they also took photos of other other things basically what they found was that if people take pictures of things and they choose which things they are taking pictures of right s up to them its volitional that there is enhanced memory for those objects later on however it degraded their ability to remember auditory information hat this means is that when we take a picture of something or a person we are stamping down a visual memory of that thing and that make sense its a photograph after all but we are actually inhibiting our ability to remember the auditory the sound components of that visual seen or what the person was saying very interesting and points to the fact that the visual system can out compete the auditory system at least in terms of how they hap campus is in coding this information the other finding i find particularly interesting within the study is that it did not matter whether not they ever looked at the photos again whet they actually had people take photos or not take photos of different objects they had some people keep their photos and they had other people to let the photos and turns out that whether or not people kept the photos are defeated those photos had no bearing on whether not they were better or worse it remembering things they were always better remembering them as compared to not taking photos them what dis this mean it means if you really want to remember something or somebody take a photo of that thing or person pay attention while you take the photo what it don't really matter if you look at the photo again somehow the process of taking that photo probably looking at it you known it camera typically relate through the view finder or now because of visual cameras on the the screen on the back of that camera or on your phone that framing up of the photograph stamps down a visual image in your mind that is more robust at serving a memory than had you just looked at that thing with your own eyes very interesting and raises all sorts of questions for me about whether not it is because your framing up a small aperture of small portion of the visual scene that is one logical interpretation although they did not test that i should also say that they found that whether not you looked at a photo that you took or whether not you released it never looked at it again did not just enhance visual memory or the or the memory for those for the visual components of that image but it always reduced your ability to remember sounds associated with that experience that is interesting and then lastbenot least and perhaps most interesting at least to me was the fact that you did not even need a camera to see this effect it subjects looked at something and took a mental photograph of that thing it enhanced their visual memory of that thing significantly more than had they not taken a mental picture in fact it increased their memory of that thing almost as much as taking an actual photograph with an actual camera and the reason i find the interesting is that a lot of what we try and learn is visual and for a lot of people the ability to learn visual information feels challenging and will look at something an will trying create some detailed understanding of it will try and understand the relationships between things in that scene it does appear base on the study that the mere decision to take a mental snapshot o chapman blink my eyelids and own take a snapshot of whatever it is i see can actually stamp down a visual memory much in the same way that a camera can stamp down a visual memory of course through vastly distinct mechanisms no discussion of memory would be complete without a discussion of the ever intriguing phenomenon known as dejavou this sense that we have experience something before but we cannot quite put our finger on it where and when did it happen er the sense that we been some place before or that we are in a familiar state or place or contact of some kind now i talked about this on the podcast before at least i think i have and the way this works has been defined largely by the wonderful work of resume tonagaua at massachusetts institute of technology and my tee resume collected a bell prize quite appropriately for his beautiful work on immunology and his also a highly accomplished narrow scientist who studies memory and learning and dejavous and i should also mention the beautiful work of mark mayor at the scripts institute and you see san dingo beautiful work on this notion of dejavous here's what they discovered they have valuated the patterns of neral firing in the hippocampus as subjects learn new things barony fires the baron be fires the baron sea fires in a particular sequence again the firing of anurans in a particular sequence the playing of keys on a piano in a particular sequence leads to a particular song on the piano and leads to a particular memory of an experience within the brain they then used some molecular tools and tricks to label and capture those saran such that they could go back later and activate those anurans in either the same sequence or in a different sequence to the one that occurred during the formation of the memory and to make a long story short and to summarize multiple papers published in incredibly high to your journals journals nature and science which are extremely stringent found that whether or not those particular anurans were played in the precise sequence that happen when they encoded the memory or whether or not those grans were played in a different sequence or even if those anurans were played activated that is all at once with no temporal sequence all firing concert all at once evoked the same behavior and in some sense the same memory at a normal circuit level this is dejavous this is a different pattern of firing of anurans in the brain leading to the same sense of what happened leading to a particular emotional state or behavior whether or not this same sort of phenomenon occurs when you are walking down the street and suddenly you feel as if how i fee have been here before you meet someone and you feeling ash i feel i know you i feel there some familiarity here that cannot quite put my finger on we do not know for sure that that is what is happening but this is the most mechanistic and logical explanation for what has for many decades if not hundreds of years has been described as dejavous for those of you that experienced de famous often just know that this reflects a normal pattern of incoming experiences in events within your hippocampus i know not aware of any pathological situations where the presence of dejavous in habits daily life some people the sensation of dejavous other people do not almost everybody however describes it as somewhat ere this idea that even though you are in a very different place even though you are interaction with a very different person that you could somehow feel as if this has happened before and just realize this that your hippocampus well it is exquisitely good and incoming new types of perceptions new experiences new emotions new contingencies and relationships of life events it is not infinitely large nor does it have an infinite bucket full of different options of different sequences for osnarons to play an a cutaways it makes perfect sense that sometimes we would feel as if a given experience had happened previously i to cover one additional tool that you can use to improve learning and memory and i should mention this is a particularly powerful one and it is one that ism definably going to employ myself this is based on a paper from none other then windy sezuki at new york university talked about her lout earlier and again she is going to be on the podcast in our next episode and unjust an incredible research have known went for a number of years and it is only in the last i was a five or six years that she is really shifted her laboratory toward generating protocols that human beings can use and she is putting that a to great effect great positive effect i should say publishing papers of the sort that i about to describe but also incorporating some of these tools and protocols into the learning curriculum and the lifestyle curriculum of students it and joyous which i think is a terrific initiative you do not need to be an then why you student in order to benefit from her work ism going tell you about some of that work now and she will tell you about this and much more in the episode that follows this one the title of this paper will tell you a lot about where we are going the title is brief daily meditation enhances attention memory mood and emotional regulation in non experienced mediators if ever there was an incentive to meditate it is the data contained within this paper when a briefly describe the study and then i also want to emphasize that when you meditate is absolutely critical it'll talk about that just at the end this is a study that involves subjects aged eighteen to forty five none of whom were experienced mediators prior to this study they were two general groups in the study one group did a thirteen minute long meditation and this meditation was a fairly conventional meditation they would sit or lie down they would do somewhat of a body skin evaluating for instance how tense or relax they felt throughout their body and they would focus on their breathing trying to bring their attention back to their breathing and to the state of their body as the meditation progress the other group which we can call the control group listen to of all things a podcast they did not listen to this podcast they listen to radio lab which is a popular podcast for an equivalent amount of time but they were not instructed to do any kind of body scanter pay attention to their breathing every subject in the study either meditated daily or listen to a equivalent duration podcast daily for a period of eight weeks and the experimenters measured a large number of things o variable was we say they looked at measures of emotion regulation they actually measured cortical a stress harmony they measured as the title suggest attention and memory and forth and the basic take away of the study is that eight weeks but not four weeks of this daily this been minute day meditation had a significant a fact in improving attention memory mood and emotion regulation i find the study to be very interesting and in fact important because most of us have heard about the passive effects of meditation on things stress production or on things such as improving sleep and i want to come back to sleep in a few moments cause it turns out to be very important feature of the study this particular study i much because they used a really broad array of measurements for cognac function things the wisconstan card sorting task on not and going this things the strip task and they also as i mention measured corpus all and many other things including not surprisingly memory and peoples ability to remember certain types of information in fact varied types of information and the basic take away was again that you could get really robust improvements in learning and memory mood and attention from just thirteen minutes a day of meditation now there is an important twist in this study that i want o emphasize you read in to the discussion of the study it is mention that somehow meditation did not improve but actually impaired sleep quality compared to the control subjects you may think we why would that be mean meditations just to reduce our stress stresses post to inhibit sleep and therefore why would sleep get worse well what is interesting is the time of day when most of these subjects tended to do their meditation most of the subjects in this study did their meditation late in the day this is often the case and experiments i know this because a we run experiments with human subjects in my laboratory and people are paid some amount of money in order to participate or they given a something is compensation for being the study but oftentimes the meditation or in the case of my lab the respiration work or other kinds of on things that they are some to do are not their top top priority and we understand this but in this study the majority of subjects here on reading completed their meditation sand a sessions from eight to somewhere between eight and eleven p m and sometimes even between twelve and three a m think that partly were a lot of college students and rolled in the study and their hours often or late shifted that impaired sleep and this raises a bigger theme that i think is important many times before on this podcast and certainly in the episode on mastering sleep and o conquering your mastering stress those episodes we talked about the value again of these non sleep deep rest protocols and misty are for reducing the activity of your sympathetic nervous system the the alertness called stress arm of your autonomic nervous sister will that makes you feel really alert nasty are superb for reducing your level of alertness increasing your level of calmness and putting you into a called more parts sympathetic relaxed state meditation does that too but it also increases attention if yo u think about meditation meditation involves focusing on your breath and constantly focussing back on your breath and trying to avoid the distraction of things your thinking or things that your hearing and coming called back to your body back to your breath meditation is actually has a high attentional load it requires a lot of prefrontal quartic activity that is involved an attention which then logically relates to the one of the outcomes of this study which is that attention abilities improved in daily mediators it also points out that increasing the level of attention and the activity of your prefrontal quarter may and i wont emphasize may because ism here ism speculating about the underlying mechanism inhibit your ability to fall asleep while we have meditation on the one hand that does tend to put us into a calm state but it is a calm very focus state in fact attention in focus are inherent to most forms of meditation non sleep deep rest such as yoganedra as some of it to be or an best are there is a terrific an auto a script that is available free on line that is put out by made force you go to you to an pesto are made for you nallsuggest do a search for an auto a their number of these available out there again at no cost those an testy are protocols tend to put people into a state of deep relaxation but also very low attention and we have to assume very low activation of the prefrontal quarter the take always from the study are several first of all that daily meditation of thirteen minutes can enhance your ability to pay attention and to learn it can truly enhance memory however you need to do that for at least eight weeks in order to start to see the affects to occur and we have to presume the you have to continue those a meditation training sessions in fact they found that if people only did four weeks of meditation these affects in show up now eight weeks might seem a long time but i think that thirteen minutes a day is not actually that big of a time commitment and the repulse of the study certainly and sentivise me to start adopting a am going for fifteen minutes a day now have been at on enough meditator for a number of years have been pretty good about it lately but i confess have been doing far shorter meditations of anywhere from three to five or ay be ten minutes ism going to ramp that up to fifteen minutes a day and ism doing that specifically to try an access these improvements in cognivability and are abilities to learn also based on the date on this paper ism going to do those meditation sessions either early in the day such as immediately after waking or close to it i might get my sunshine first i as you all know very big on getting sunlight in the eyes early in the day is much as one can an as early as one can once the sun is out but certainly doing it early in the day and not pass five p m or in order to make sure that i do not inhibit sleep because i think this result that they describe of meditation inhibiting quality e sleep compared to controls is an important one to pay attention to no pone intended to day we covered a lot of aspects of memory and how to improve your memory we talked about the different forms of memory and we talked about some of the underlying neral circuitry of memory formation and we talked about how the emotional saliency and intensity of what your trying to learn has a profound impact on whether not you learn in response to some sort of experience whether not that experience is reading or mathematics or music or language or a physical skill does not matter the more intense of an emotional state that you're in in the period immediately following that learning the more likely you are to remember whatever it is that your trying to learn and we talked about the norchemicals that explain that effect about epinephrin and cortical stones corpus all and how adjusting the timing of those is key to enhancing your memory ad we talk about the deferent ways to enhance those chemicals everything ranging from cold water to pharmacology and even just adjusting the emotional state within your mind in order to stamp down and remember experience is better we also talked about how to leverage exercise in particular load bearing exercise in order to evoke the release of hormones onto chain which can travel from your bones o your brain and enhance your ability to learn and we talked about a new form of photographic memory not the traditional type photographic memory in which people can remember everything they look at very easily but rather taking mental snap shots of things that you see again emphasizing that that will create a better memory of what you see when you take that mental snapshot but will actually reduce your memory for the things that you hear at that moment and we discuss the really exciting data looking at how particular meditation protocols can enhance memory but also attention and mood however if done too late in the day can actually disrupt sleep precisely because those meditation protocols can enhance attention now i know that many of you are interested in nor chemicals that can enhance learning in memory and i intend to cover those in deep detail in a future episode however forsake of what was discussed to day please understand that any number of different norchemicals can evoke or incant increase the amount of a adrenaline that circulating in your brain and body and its less important how one accesses that increase in a trehalose right again this can be done through behavioral protocols or through pharmacology assuming that those behavioral protocols and pharmacology are safe for you it really does not matter how you evoke the adrenaline release because remember adrenaline is the final common pathway by which particular experiences particular perceptions are stamped into memory which answers are very first question rays to the beginning of the episode which is why do we remember anything at all right that was the question that we raise we sit that from morning till night and throughout your entire life you have tons of sensory experience tons of perceptions is at that some are remembered and others or not while i would never want to distill ad important questions such as that down to a one molecule type of answer i think we can confidently say based on the vast amount of animal and human research data that epineferan a adrenalin and some of the other chemicals that it acts with in concert is in fact the way that we remember particular events and not all events if you are learning from and or

supplements are not necessary for everybody many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things enhancing sleep and focus and indeed for learning in memory for that reason the supermen lab podcast is now partnered with momentous supplements the reason we partner with momentous is severalfold first of all we wanted to have one location where people could go to acts as single ingredient high quality versions of the supplements that we were discussing on this podcast this is a critical issue a lot of supplement companies out there sell excellent supplements but they combine different ingredients into different formulations which make it very hard to figure out exactly what works for you and to arrive at the minimal effective dose of the various compounds that are best for you which we think is extremely important and that certainly the most scientific way a rigorous way to approach any kind of supplementation regiment momentous has made these single ingredient formulations on the basis of what we suggested to them and am happy t say they alsoship internationally whether not your in the us or abroad they'll ship to you if you to see the supplements recommended on the supermen labpodcast you can go to livmomentous tot calm slash supermen they have started to assemble the supplements that we talked about on the podcast and in the upcoming weeks they will be adding many more supplements such that in a brief period of time most if not all f the compounds that are discussed on this podcast will be there again in single ingredient extremely high quality formulations that you can use to arrive at the best supplement protocols for you we also include behavior protocols that can be combined with supplementation protocols in order to deliver the maximum effect once again that livemomentous dot calm slash supermen and you are not already following us on twitter an d instergam it is superman lab on both twitter and instergam there i describe science

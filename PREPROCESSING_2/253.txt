of quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in to day's episode of the show if you prefer a beat version you can find that at our weight this america life network re member that old fashioned idea the two people who disagree about politics could sit down tax e could see the others point of view a big used to quit scripture as he headed into political negotiations come let us reason together now of course we all realize that that is impossible a never stating for a fact but when i mean man there this famous moment a few years ago when all this seems way might possible a moment we she's long go now the cam bad because of this thing that happened into presidential press conference before i take your questions i want a talk for a few minutes about the progress we making on health an durance reform that a goes ta dracobamarecanomigates two thousand nine six money to wicks here to re the o so ran simian has been revisiting this piece of very recent history because it is recent that feels thine its almost quaint he fact the people thought that sitting down in talking together myth work he rabbin he era o case i talk to damn finer he is the deputy communications guy in the mama white house at the time he was there in the room for that press conference before hand they gone over with the president that ten specific reporters they wanted him to gallon a ye got to the under that war and not at going off gat and you can tell ah the president wit going very good about it reformed you get usually think e go well that he was e h are wore question can i not the ever god ever come e e one wore question i i try to make that short that whence we would get her last question thank you mister president and i remember the question i gulag yesterday recently professor henry newescates junior is arrested at his home in cartridge what does that incident say to you and what does it say about races relations in the medical well i should say the outset that ship gates is a friend i may be a little by assure i do not know all the facts o gave such as turn on everybody word henry lots gates junior famous hazard professor african pelicans color he comes home one night his trying to get into his own house an h is a problem getting an line the keys do not work or something and someone see him and calls the police the cops up and he responding officer f sergeant names call he learns that it is in fact gates own house but then again to an argument and isolates and they both have words and then gates gets a teston it cats this comes up i the press conference us gas yean president ant mama is comfortable on his again he is casual in this common was that he even makes thus little joke that is impossible to imagine i making ow i a m if i was tranagigerin well i guess this is my assess hi were at but let us say my hole house in can a here i get shut i a but then he says this this is the part that is can a cause all the trouble i thing is fer to say number one any of us would be pretty angry number two that the cabbage police i action stupidly in arresting somebody when that there was already proof that they were in their own home an number three what i think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there is a long history in this country of african america and routines being stopped by on forcemeat is proportion that that is just a felt the night ends and enters thinking none pretty god ye i to i yet we we cob it yo we goon an item usually re with your acari i would walk back wait ham ah an cop light you put came at out i but in hi thin he might have got up there to did a pleasure we were in that a he anywhere ah got on whenever talking you about it that night he might have got the gallery right afterward valley arrest one of mama's senior advisers she was at the press conference to i remember listening to the answer and thinking yet tat sounds right and then when he said the word stupidly i paused for a minute and then i thought about n i said a when when somebody gets a rested to their own home that is pretty odd right and i did not give much more thought to it but by the time i got from the eastern i in the residents back to my office in the west wing it had gone up oh that night i man literally within six or seven minutes it was adjust went viral ride away of his a big deal almost instantly the reaction to him saying the word stupidly roses was an instant problem after accusing police of acting stupidly for a resting a hazard professor in his own home president mama came under fire cash police i much stupid i the you tasty the knows us knows that i thin the preset mi o plain pall for torso person o what ten try contra to professor this president i think has exposed himself as a guy over and over and over again who has a deep seeded hatred for white people or the white culture i don't know what it is i not saying that he does not white white people i say he has a problem he has a this guys is i believe a races the was on back on fox news infamously ye that was one reaction but simultaneously civil rightscrups are calling the white house and thinking mama for putting a spotlight on this issue that was important to them essentially prison mama had artlessly divided the country with this one word stupidly it was not intended to trigger i polarize the police from the communities of they servant protect it was really and of an off handed comment and if perhaps he had not said stupidly things would have go would not have got his derailed as they did if he had if he had said for an example it is understandable that skip would be annoyed than a police officer were address would arrest him in his home oi think people would have said ye it'd be annoyed but when he said something about the police officers in tend or behavior i think that is what gone under people's skin inside the white house they going to full crisis mode the hoping it all die down but i does not they come up it is idea to in vote gates and called to the white house to sit down and have a beer and then that run the pray you a dryer end an what at say a ma new to bear mat at a a man or ban overdo your tomato be mutated o you me parent the it dada a picture yer other ad at we did what a eyes anti gan of the an e to the get to it the to beers commination down picnic pictures and as we on know that did not word ya no it still comes up like a month ago as our colleague she chase was that in trunprally in new hampshir the talk to people there about why the country is divided and two supper people brought this up on their own when it to this as the moment that they knew that mama was out to divide the country would he did his fir is first what a thing hours her he went after the copying cartridge that is the thing that i started in i really started he he started hat just the things that did as starting with the the beer vomit we had cartridge yet all these dome things that he did blown i this is t i was is is lengthen e case o bear som i did not unify america right i have thought about this much since it happened just the casual way that president mama stepped into this have won need if he was i sat the table already with the race conversation as a candidate people know where am coming from give wondered if maybe he was just trying to test the water is right then maybe he just thought we let just see how let just see where we are i do not know that there was that much thought i think to your point on wanna an honesty dominant thought about this before he put it to me but ism sure because the race speech had gone well and was embraced broadly and it was raw and honest not himself he hope that people had a better sense of who he was and because he would one the presidency a an had comported himself throughout his short tenure at that point as the president for all of america i think perhaps he thought he had the standing to say that and and not experienced the back lash and that was a teaching moment to than i a fir her for him crawl of us yen can told me he thinks that it was not what a mama said but that he was the first black president in the white house and that if it was not this would've been something else i cay but if the goal of the beer summit was just three people sitting round trying to understand each other little better even for those people did at work i mean yet it kind of did lake they were really mad before and then after the beer som that sarge crawled dote this press conference where he says we agree that we both have a lot to learn from each other and we want stay and touch and they stand touch yet it seems it since then a gates has said that he and sarge crawled have developed a really good relationship and then he did this thing he has as past v show where he tests telemetries wanna and tells them about their history am he asked crawled to do a daannatest and found out that they have a common iris ancestor a cousin sir robin another words that it is possible for people to get along and a and become friends in see each others points of view especially around the magic potion that we call beer but we of in a country where a most of the nation for one reason in another chooses not to believe that seems out a yet but that is actually you show to day people sitting down trying to see the other persons point of view over beer in all these stories no getting beer is involved at a critical turning point in one story the fate of an entire nation is its tag a tall note o think that the true for whether story to from debybasy chico its this america life stay with us one one for my baby and one more for the road if everybody reunited states in rope breaking off into political groups who seems to understand each other less and lest these days this german journalists named nasty on barber islet the last three years were putting on people from these kinds of groups that dislike and mistrust each other and see things very differently who actually sit down and try to get along he taken to a bunch of different countries looking for examples of this were people do indeed somehow come to see id eye for example when denmark he and a lewd policemen who decided that the very best way to combat the most radical people they faced jehad's and teonazis was to invite them in for coffee with i have to say amazing results and the most extreme example of the city found was in banana were for decades now the government has been running this kind of big an a social experiment to fight tribadism based what happens is that every year the government tells thousands of civil servants to just pack up their belongings and move sometimes very far from home to live and work the people who are som ad very different from them this pine is not popular sometimes a parent is forced to work hundred miles from around family bathe government as stubbornly stack with this palace for decades here is pasta when whatuona became independent from brain in nineteen six six six it was one of the last african countries to do imagine the colonials sleep and you are the first president of pazuana for years all around you you have seen the same story over and over again countries become independent ethnic violence follows barley became independent in nineteen sixty two years later the tragic started o civil war congo same story soon of that is independent the province of cabana tried to break away nigeria independence in nineteen sixty very soon the echos and houses started clashing having seen all of that the early leaders in banana knew they had a problem because the exact thing that had fueled the violence in all those countries they headed as well a if you think about that these borders a will just to an a and some of the restart word us see that they could have cut through the passing is fully you this is unity dow the foreign minister of pazuana she was a kit beck in the sixties when a few people in onion through the borders of her country on a map creating banana and like in all those other places in africa they were putting a bunch of ethnic groups together that did not really each other the clangs in the north the baquanaa south of the call hard desert the banguato in the center in whatuana every one refers to these groups as tribes that is what i am going to say in this story in whatuana they were twenty tribes give take they spoke different languages at different traditions and now they were forced into one country the early leaders figurate to avoid that kind of violent here what we need to do is break up tribe quantities and form a true nation no more as no more than just a wee but how do you do that they came up with the plan first they decided every one needs to understand each other in schools they would only teach english and said iguana the other tribe languages not at all second to keep people from fighting over land they gave a piece of land to any one who wished and they said everything underneath tat land belongs to the state this is important because this is one of the diamond richest countries on earth whtevens if i given a this offhand i settled there i did and i find a rich diamond mine w you get moved what you mean that you get moved you have to declare that taming my saran it is they against the for to absolute to to keep it for yourself you cannot defend that man an and i find o a wat once yo find it it is not yours there a lord that just verge lady says it is is not yours belongs to everybody a you just get an atherpisolan say places i would be frustrated also of her troubles e fat there was one more thing probably the most important one people told me the transfers remember each tripe at its territory if you were from a certain village in the north you were most likely clangs if you were from the central district probably bang to they figured why not make all civil servants moved to a different trial area from their own for a few years there would make sure that their teachers and doctors everywhere in the country but also it would force people to mikes it would be an anti tribalism too when you move people around you a in devote try foreign and then to take that carat in that new home should up the new cant anvil to cold that ho you foreign all is in and the that for sin friendships can you force friendships does that kind of thing work the transfers affected every one working for the government by far the latest employ in the country engineers administrate us doctors nurses and most of all teachers when i was in botany i take to twenty teachers to find out if this works and what it is for the people going through it ism going to tell you the story of one of the teachers a woman named

it is funny to think that this could be the real secret to hit might actually work people fall in love for carol after she met tabs everything changed i i as tat a living then the place nohow did e change and how did at change he know you have some one in the village he is you by friend he moves that on show cousin in the village you tent to love it the the place what did you discoverabout place

they a loving people i love them i love them she became friends with the owner of the smelly bar she cooked for the socratine she was invited to be a judged in a beauty contest which is kind of a big deal in the village she went to weddings and funerals there was even a woman who gave her a piece of land i have but a houseboy no we am talking you no series the former education minister unity doll she says what carol experience is actually pretty common and a big part of the programmed success what happens when he put we people around maybe eighty percent will come back to into day they cud marriage i its a mass of stating program i i do noesis me having a e governments conceretating thing li is people go some place they fall in love fastaphon would not say that you joke but the truth is at just i nature of how he means move and a the acclimatize and cons arms o a few years after she had moved to the village carol finally felt at how she had built that house her relationship with tabs was going rat carol was taking oranges to glass again she did still bring her hand back and her heels to class every day in fact one of the women who teased her about it a since teacher she started bringing her hardback too carol was still a little bit of a stop about the locals but over all she was as happy here as she had been in the city but there is something i have not told you about the transfer programmed you do not just get transferred once for teachers it is every five years sometimes a little less sometimes a little more one day the school had called us it was a lady she told us that one of you as togo there were five teachers teaching religious education one too many we as to what minded i wise she busigalisid we ever came fist would be the not to go and definitely i knew it was me i think for about for fife panda was waiting for the betta new that any time i would be going that that must be frustrating i mean now you there people intimately ye and then that you have to start from the bottom yes and you have is little forestrisin ye it is es at is at is first within at is first resting a lot on the other hand if it were not for the transfer program she would not have me tabs are you a ye ye where i she and we are planing to get merit oh her is am the i prom me this was remember last year they had been together for fifteen years at that point survived three transfers tabs had never moved with her as a soldier he was also told but the government were to work but then a couple of month after the interview i was testing with carol and she told me she had broke up with tabs just before the wedding she had found out that he was having an affair do you blame the transfer program for the end of your relationship with tabs at all sometimes not really a presence mentality s not you be blaming on any a known the government i don't but if if it was not for the transfer a grogram you would have been able to stay with him maybe and maybe anode maybe icily ye all the teachers i talked to for the transfer thing mostly annoying some of them found disruptive that at some point they considered quitting a there was this one guy after being transferred he fell in low much carol he had a kit ut then he was transferred again and again and again he worked in seven schools he had four kits with four women and he was single again when i talk to him he blamed the transfers and himself recently the government has made some changes they now allow married people to move together they've tried to reunite couples whole been split up they also low swaps if you find another teacher across the country who is willing to switch cops they usually agree yes they tried to make things a little easier but still this policies suppose to be intrusive that is the idea all the officials i talked to acknowledge the hardships at causes and all of them good buy it yes it was sometimes bed for individual people but it was good for the people us a whole in fact they say it is a big reason why they are to he effect of the transfers has never been systematically analyzed there is no study and was one had other things going for it tat help them unify there was less of a colonial legacy to overcome the brutish had kind of ignored the country and ruled from neighboring south africa and patron an act that those loss that prevented any one crud from getting rich of the countries dim and wealth but the officials i talk to were convinced the transfers were essential they help make their country drawn on a map fifty years ago in to a unified nation one that has never seen war one that is the least corrupt country in africa and one of africa best working democracies and you economy from the mid sixties t the mid nineties button had the faster growing economy in the world not they united states not emerging china bhat'suana it works miracle this is the president of poazuana maguitzi mas sexy i had the chance to speak to him a few weeks act in the same way as all on when guys system was still in its napkin stages we had body school you had people from this pattie country going over here and there and people married from every way and at what is for i asked if some version of this might work elsewhere in the us another countries tat o divided it could be a fix but an an i do not really want to coming too deeply about the issues of another nation state a e you do not sand we at do have us they may just copy us come from us it is hard to imagine the s shipping teachers from new york city to red states and bice were if you attempted this with teachers in germany we if you would probably have rides on your hands but we could try something to get different kinds of people talking to each other face to face everybody i spoke with in butzuana told me the transfer program works and everything i found in my reporting suggested works but i also got a glimpse of its limits one day i gave a woman ride a young french teacher we set in the car waiting for the rain to pass and she talked about her family a family of teachers a family shaped by francs for my father was the teacher and he was posted in another area my mother was a teaching the was posted another he got on did i since not business as she got upset and left but then i grew up knowing that that the teacher is my father by my father with someone else another village somewhere in another try innocence my mother raised me as a moans and i motzuana in other words a batzuana i hate that question because which which less omega omega her what does i mean what is your tribe oh hi ki i was your home village and is that ha very common question it is a very common question every one will ask you that i whoever you go that is the first thing people ask you omega omega whats gaga e get me i do not that am just a moans at does not matter where i come from does not matter where my village is the moans and and that is not just an answer to shut the people up its it is it is you what you really feel s how i feel i do not i do not understand why we have to always identify with our tribes do you realize that this is liked in e notshal tat the bozuana story really o i do not you think i i yest now you given me that moment fore d you i am sin mocusho we he at at all trench he stilted listing the botswana tribes gala gat palace the can late it the we

democratic club and then everybody can i he blot they were all all a s but i must say it oh a and a shock and all who called rust to hear his version of all this runs it'll say is gruff but night he is real connoisseur of short answers what is it that convinced you to support president trump i just him but were there policies or certain issues i just him he did have more than that to say about the rally though mainly that he was completely and totally on apologetic if you had known the people at the club were watching t v that night and they were seeing you on on t v farteknowner washin and b had a banner rushes here at we down rig no yes runs as the valley was exciting he went there with the buddy that night another democrat turned trump a porter it was not easy rust has problems with his legs and by his account can hardly walk his friend could not use one foot because e dies but they willed themselves through the walk to southern's convention enter and then they stood an waited until donate trump made his entrance to the rolling stones start me out find facing the the present were where were you in the rood he is a rightoweer rust points indicating he was in the back back towards the back right corner of the rooms can back under back wall back ears and but we had such incredible crowds look at this rum as s example right into the corners people hallo corner how far away were i crow of a host too the wall pretty far in the back as son relax crack or nonalso india as primary comes pretty late in the process others but that night trump was on the verge of effectively locking up the republican nomination and he told us and his body and the crowd there that there votes the next day could put him over the tie and the at is becoming very importantusually by this time it is over a then out does it bat but this time you folks belong a you belong it is called the port feel a i la of course that night in important bell not every one was feeling great about stub specifically the patrons of one democratic bar who would been watching to anger embarrassment outrage there was people that were raging again list comes long time clay democratic club member it it was e it was every of motion cause you felt the dog had bet ripped out underneath your feet it was the wizard of of you really a republic ad run a democratic club never mind was behind that curt it was exactly the wizzes of of anon n it probably seems rest could not hade been more busted bat he was the head of the saint josh county democratic party that is the county wore south bends the head of the entire democratic party at that time was a guinea mason crib club mason was outside the trump valley that night his checking out the trump supporters and then what happened he looks across the street he told me who do i see it is runs fucking homes he was i i think he was warn a hat he was it was one of those things fore it was an accident he was his walking long the side walk it was obvious is due was going and to the reality and was a trump supporter mason was ism the county party chair this kind of a weird thing for me to get mixed up in but also cannot too big of a deal to just let go you non toy how much o a fight do i want a pick over something and this is their club it is their rules not knowing what to do mason started calling and testing a small group of people who he knows go to the club eventually he gets the can hardpan former president of the clay democratic club yeses me what is going on i told his missus mason i do not know ism that an off star to club any more can hardpan is everything about the clay democratic club turned into a person his life seems to rhyme with everything about the place can was born in south bend nineteen forty six same years the club in the beginning the founders did not haven of money for a building they just word a basemen and put a roof on it some of man's early memories are being a little kid running around on the low slung roof of that basement building while he adults were down stairs on the club can was a member for years eventually became vice president can was present for seven years before rest came in for anything bad to happen down here on as affected me emotionally begun have got such strong feeling for the membership and the club i mi desire to have this club succeeded just he meant the hulongas om i in thin goes wrong his club its i feel it is part of me and mouton officers lately feel that way and and that is the way the officers of the club should feel the club is part of i an and o i do not meet your life revolved around it but close this every one at the club seems to lobe can which is easy he is not a big guy but he seems big because he outgoing his grandfather of sixteen retired team step drop a truck for years army veteran he is got this completely ball head an a long great goatee when can got the call from mason about rest hit was the first he would heard of any of this can was reeling what woad do you feel in mean to pretender your club you never critic club is share at a rally tor a republican candidate for president what do you doing do a me your put put n black mark on our party on our club can who known rust for years ended at being the one to have to call him to see what this was about i confronted him about it a why did you do that rust i because i believe in the the man ism i i ice support trump sham not republican obliged support trump i should you are the president of the democratic club in your doing that till your democratic party it does not look very good rust i mean you go to did at home watch on other any other van he so that is my right to do that my i should of can appreciate that you have your right to do whatever we want to do i did not ran hall or anything that good does not get you he at the club meeting the soon followed can asked every one to quit not crucified their friend for his beliefs i right away they want to kick him out of the club right away they on de hard feather the poor guan running off well it was not me what it was all the people stating he is gone he is done or not again lis my comes lis says she was friends with rust still is friends with rust but she says most people at least the ones that spoke up at this meeting drew a hard line about what he did this democratic club we are old yellow dogs and what that means as i rather vow for and yellow dog that a republican they just able as a turn cold and that was it it was i possible it was there was just no way that he could even function as president day no you lie tot everybody wo there is no he just he did not understand what his position met and how much it mut rest resigned his president a couple people told me he was not doing that good ma jab anyway us denies that the only thing rust would say is that it was quit personal no matter how many times i asked that is what he said what i do know rust submitted a very distinct letter of resignation shortly after the incident at the rally no reasons just that he was stepping down as president of the clay democratic club can hardpan came back for another term li get y are but what makes all of this complicated is that rust quit as president but he kept coming into the club because it the great bar for of people he knows and because rust still considers himself a democrat previously now in the future he says he just likes trump his o moment dona good on are not satin i us thing about him the dive dragon oh is that right did you you voted for dragon r would it do you feel there is a couple times in your life when for the most part you have been a democrat but there is been a few times in your life that he said ism gun for the republican in this case i fun mi tick at every eery e robot i still to som democrat i will not on bones first year at this point it seems it became clear that the rest him as situation was not just going to be about rust when rusted thus it split everybody apart because you are either a democrat or you are not list combe says things changed at the club in the months that followed when can hardpan came back as president he told rust if he was going to keep coming in he d to be tactful about his support for trump but can also made sure runs knew that he was still welcome and us continued to do some of the things he would always done run carryon at the club on fridge nights which is how carryon night turned into a time for people at the club to choose sides you had people got in for us that is true and then you had runs reporters which i get it is freedom of speech you are allow that in your aloud to do whatever you wat and that that is part of the constitution and on thankful everyday we have that that is fight an everybody's regular life but what did those people do when they would come down how often would it happen that people would stir up trouble sort of it seem every week and because runs was doing the carryon and it seem there was a fight every fridge night every time he fight somebody would just start yelling and being out o control because he was up on stage doing the carryon he ultimate himself the target wake would it go both ways would it be he would run the carryon night and somebody would yell something at him they would heckleham about what id happen absolutely and then there were people that felt sorry for him because they would defend him yes because he is an aging man and there uneducated and they did not understand what he did us estimates that maybe ten per cent of the club's members president trump others said the same thing but most of the trump supporters keep it quiet most though definitely not all another contingent increasingly came into the club spoiling for a fight looking to mix it up can hardpan and dismal comes and a number of others say the loudest was getting mike pool he would pound his fist on the bar trump trump trump trump trump us mike's a life long democrat member of the club for years who decided to support trump can hardpan told me mike would come into his office at the club and tried to convince can to defect he had again here is lie why would you come to a democratic club to be a trumpet when you say that he would pound his fist on the bar and say train i that is what he would say tromp tromp trump literally and that is catspaw the trumpets are that is exactly how mike pawl behaves surprisingly and unsurprisingly mike pool sees this whole situation differently mike's account he has not gone looking for fights about trump in fact he feels if anything spend the other way round madebody old to pul i somebody shut stone me to me n start cutting down trump it'll a you your truck the told gie he yogi talk over the the gs sometimes are you man well there was a blow up over the situation at a board meeting at the club hen they discuss rest his support for trump and the impact it was having according to a few accounts have heard some one a long time democrats stood up and he said some version of half the board did not even vote democratic club president can hardpan shot back saying that was in true though i guess that comment about half the board is what produced the story that spread through democratic circles and eventually made its way to mare buddhagidge at this meeting mike pool told me he got called out as a trumpsipporter to which he yelled back it is none of your business how i voted mike told me a staunched democrat started shouting at mike's wife who was the club's financial secretary he is pointing a finger in her face mike told me he went up to the guy after the meeting and told him if he pointed a finger in his wife's face again he break it off and shoved up his ass danhardman says he is done what he could to limit the damage an stories this circulated he wrote in the news letter telling people not to believe everything they heard making it clear that it was a democratic club for democrats dang told me leading up to all this membership of the club had already been to lining but all this strife they made it worse we went down from from nearly a thousand members to write now were we are looking maybe three hundred any and and that membership is hard to to keep together because we can of you we cannot get people to come down because we they they think that we turned our our backs all he means democrats did not think the club was really for democrats any more and the there are some the i don't see them oh i through yours that must have been difficult to go through with a a club that you would been running and that you built over the course a years all it was heartbreaking it was really heartbreaking i do not know i do not know why they do not come back mike an us the more they have come under attack from the democratic friends the more they have thought the company of those who agree with them rest told me these days he is relying almost entirely on folks news both guys read a lot of conservative stuff that they get from other trump supporters on the internet democrats want open borders president mama wanted one world government mike said he does not want museums in our government that scares the tar out of me he said as both of them what the democrats might do to win them back if that was even possible rest said maybe for twenty twenty four but ism sticking with trump mike told me he some of what he heard from busy aboard and my club share but really it was pretty unlikely what do you think the democrats do not understand about somebody you or somebody us wo identified for a long time as a democrat and then they and then they left for truck i don't think they cere they in this to feel they happen in agenda in tee do not cere what we think any more i mean everything is about you legals and and the poor everything else they do not care about ah o any more they is do not it is just we are arolvit you do not you shout about us if there was a democratic politician though and you felt that is somebody who cares about a guy ma that is a big you that is the kind of thing they could get you back that is huge yes a you are not just what trunk does but it is about feeling your man you know mean if you think somebody do not give a cat about you what istle matter your isn't got towards somebothe care somebody don't think thinks so matter that is that is that is about a lie what about us there is a certain sketsofrania to rest in mikes politics these days even though they support president trump the biggest concern still do seemed to be traditionally democratic pauses rest says he is concern about health care and if somebody could present a plan to get everybody covered he before that mike also derris about health care and the cost of prescription drugs and about the quality of public education in america they both told me the story of the democratic party they were loyal to that they still love was the story of a party that was for the little guy and against the big guy i told them i think many of the democrats running now still talk about the party that way and they are making proposals to do things that both men say they want but whatever the story the democrats are telling runs and mi do not see themselves in it the one part of the democrat's message that seems to be getting through to rest and mike it is just how badly they all want to get rid of trump which just makes them want offend him one democrat who had to come up with the strategy for how to deal with the dresses and mikes of the world its club president can hardpan and his strategy could pretty much be boiled down to let us just all credit chill custom go easy on each other maybe have a beer us is in interested in hearing for many democratic politicians right now but he also made a point of telling me about this thing the can did for him after all this went down rest lost his wife carol earlier this year hey been together since high school after she died rust really depressed in the middle of that want organize the dinner for him and he held it at the democratic club russia that that meant much to him and there is one democrat i know for a fact rest respects that he listens to that he likes it is a guy who keeps letting him know he is welcome to sit with him at the bar regardless of whose in the white house of tan along is one of the

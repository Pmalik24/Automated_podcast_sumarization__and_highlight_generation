events around the country trying to put people in proximity to one another and speaking about the power of friendship at these events according to political quote people dressed as dancing unicorns handed out prescriptions for five minutes of social connection quantity endless refills daily that is a thing that you are paying for mirth then encourage people to spend forty five seconds writing a ten to a loved one mothy asks people to engage in what he calls the connection exercise he says that such exercises can be supplemented by investments in social infrastructure which is where policy makers come in or alternatively it is precisely wear policy makers and government should but out see there is a reason far loneliness epidemic that is a real thing e loneliness epidemic people are lonely they are disconnected there admit and sure all of that has to do with smart phones and the intranet and the increasing atomization of our lives as we hunger down with our screens and wreck our necks but screens are just a tool to be used for good or ill the real problem is that are social institutions have been summarily destroyed over the course of decades largely by government those social institutions used to begin with and center around church historically churches performed three interwoven functions first they provided common orientation around a higher goal complete with rules and regulations that required skin in the game in order to be accepted into the group everybody goes to my pentagon believes in god and also believes in a series of commandments that we have been given the skin in the game ranges from for example wearing comic showing that you're committed to the group and to the idea to keep in colure an obviously every church has something similar a higher orientation and as sat of rules that require skin in the game second churches provided economic benefits and social reinforcement ranging from charity to the helping hands of neighbors in our community that means when some one falls on hard times that we all try to find that person a job that we will bridge the financial gap for people that will make sure that somebody is able to drive our neighbors kids home if their parents are stuck at work finally churches emerging from the first functions create a feeling of community that feeling of community sociologist meal durkimrote in the late nineteen century could only be attain with referents to the sacred a series of beliefs worth while they were not to be question that is what the sacred is something that is higher something that is not really open to descend or question as robot and is but the sociologist rights q it is community that gives to the sacred its most vital expressions everywhere birth marriage death and other moment in the human drama those are things that are higher the sacred undergirds the community and the community provided the support structure necessary for the flourishing of the family and then government tried s replace the church and destroyed community in the process the first step with the substitution of government benefits for the earned membership of a church see in order for you to earn benefits of being a member of my synagogue for example you have to be a member of the synagogue not a paid member but you have to at least be in the community love to perform the functions but once government stepped in people no longer had to have skin in the game of a community in order to be given charity now they had entitlements by dint of breathing you are here therefore somebody of you money according to one study yew zeal policies from the nineteen thirties crowded out thirty per cent of all charitable spending by churches because instead of people going to church getting charity from their neighbor which might come with the awkward requirement that you actually part of the community in goods your neighbor instead yous go to the relief office government benefits are now exponentially greater than they were in the nineteen thirties family structure itself was dramatically undermine by government spending you are no longer responsible for your kids in fact if you are a dad you just did chum kids and the single monger bigger benefits from the government you are no longer responsible for paying for your elderly parents government would do that through social security another would borrow the money to make up the gap your call on your neighbor no longer acquired you to sacrifice for the community instead of you having go your neighbor and silicon members the same community i take care your kids you take care of my kids ere all in this together instead yous go the government the government points it is gone at your neighbor and steals his wallet able to reap the rewards without the cost many people stopped going to church after all if you get the money without having to engage in any of the actual cops structure why do it and over the course of decades churches began to a just to the pews that were emptying out not by reenforcing the common orientation round a higher goal sanctity an the thing that really brings people to church but instead by trying to get rid of judgments as to include more people because the pews are emptying out there really only two ways to refill thus one is a rededication to for principle and the other is demolishing for principle and basically turning a church into a piece of party churches began to try to mirror government skin in the game plenty of benefits as guard similar wrote to deistical quote this process of religious accommodation has since gone on a pace that to day many mainline churches offered little or no resistance to the prevailing culture on the contrary some are very much part of it priding themselves on being cosmopolitan and sophisticated undogmatic and unsensorias is how you end up with pride flags hanging off to hundred year old churches and thus the sacred has been wiped away leaving us all alone with our subjective sense of self waiter to by a broad welfare state are we happier will that problem be cured by government of course not at can only be cured by return to community and historically that community means religious community and that is why it is stand to see religious leaders playing around the edges of conciliation with value sister that undermine the sacred at every single turn get to that in just one mum at first are you traveling for the holidays if buttock has he covered because they just added international coming to over thirty countries that

religion opening its doors to value systems that really undermine the religion on money according t the vast majority of the legs media pope francs apparently decided the it was fine for priest to bless same sex couples to t least was the headline from the legacy media according to your times this move was quote is most definitive step yet to make the roman catholic church more welcoming to el g b t u catholic and more reflective of his vision ate more pastoral and less rigid church if all of that were true of course that would mark a massive shift for the catholic church whit has held fast to the traditional teaching that marriage is between one man and one woman and that sexual union within marriage is the only morally permissible form of sexual union by the way that is an opinion agreed to by virtually every main line religion for the past several thousand years the church has held fast for thousands of years not only to the sanctity of marriage but to the natural law philosophy inherent in that sanctity of philosophy that says that the world of god's creation carries within it certain obvious rights and wrongs biological ends in this viewpoint things in nature were designed to perform certain functions the sexual function was designed to create children man and woman were designed to become one flesh according to this philosophy and that creation is designed to end in the creation of new human life as philosopher robot gorge was catholic sex plot what is unique about marriage is that it is truly a comprehensive sharing of life a sharing founded on the bodily union made uniquely possible by the sexual complement verity of man and woman a complementarity that makes it possible for two human beings to be come in the language of the bible one flesh and for this one flesh union to be to be the foundation of a relationship in which it is intelligible for two persons to bind themselves to each other in pledges of permanence monogamy and fidelity it would certainly be a mass of surrender for the catholic church to reject that teaching on behalf of a broader teaching that morality now in compasses sexual relationships of all sorts per circularly sexual relationships without any potential whatsoever for the creation of human life asper the l g b t u plus minus via by sinagenda is the media really accurately reporting what the pope said what did he actually say what his defenders say that yo reallychange nothing according to the catholic publicationtho pilloquoe toducia supplicant which is the name of this publication says clearly the vatic does not intends permit same sex marriage or anything that resembles it and says that the church does not actually have the power or authority to do that while the text does great a framework for blessing a couples it says that those blessings should not be confused with marriage or even with approval of same sex unions or homosexual activity fascia supplicant says that blessings are quote a pastoral resource to be value rather than a risk or problem and that they may be bestowed upon those persons who quote although in a union that cannot be compared in any way to a marriage desired to intrust themselves to the lord and his mercy to invoke his help and to be guided guided to a greater understanding of his plan of love and true such blessings ought not to be given in any circumstance resembling a sanctification of same sex unions says the vatic and quote there is no intention to legitimize anything furthermore says the document the blessing ought to descend on those who quote do not claim a legitimation of their own status but who bag that all that is true good and humanly valid in their lives in their relationships be enriched heard and elevated by the presence of the holy spirit is there any reason for the controversy of nothing change i mean there is the document itself suggest the blessings should not be quote subjected to too many moral prerequisites and that priest ought not to lose pastoral charity which should permeate all our divisions in attitudes and to avoid being quote judges only deny reject and exclude furthermore the document does not make clear whether the church will in fact crack down onset surgical blessings its is not approve in the document the pope in other words is being bag and others are supposed to clean up after him which which tends to be the way on fortunately pope francs works a lot my friend largo corner catholic has a good run down of his interpretation parties missive heareswhat he rate quote i am not in full communion with the church as such i am required to abstain from partaking in the chariot at mass i walk up to the altar with my arms crossed on my chest another residing plate priest offers me a blessing he is not blessing the situation i am in that keeps me from being in communion with the church he is offering me a priestly blessing i can continue my faith journey and move forward closer to crisis bye my situation this exactly what the vatic has confirmed the passers may do for individuals ho have same sex attraction and are also not in full communion with the church because of their situation but is that all the pope is doing because lady is not approaching the altar as a member of a samsextu couples not walking up their ladies divorce is not walking up with his second wife to gather with her to receive a blessing as a couple according to lyric he is approaching individually of course religions should offer blessings to sinners while hating their sin of course every one is a sinner this is true in judiousiment just as it is true and cathalicism or procentism everyone is a sinner and if sin or what barred you for receiving a blessing no one could receive a blessing but when a same sex couple approaches a priest for a blessing as a same sex couple the distinction starts to fall away hes again they are not approaching individually and asking for blessing individually while being a sinner the idea is that the church knows they are same sex couple an they are preaching for a blessing as a same sex couple and then they're receiving a blessing as a same sex couple the copier is not allowing blessing for individuals who participate in same sex unions that was already the case every traditional religion allows sin eyes to receive blessings individually far as ism aware instead the vatic is apparently now green lighting blessing same sex couples as couples then pretending it does not mean anything long as the blessing is not in outright sanctification of the same sex relationship now that is clearly how the left is reading it the reverend names martin of radical left win catholic sex we this new declaration opens the doors who noble surgical blessings for same sex couples something that had previously been off limits for bishop's prep and deacons of all with many breeks i will now be delighted to bless my friends in same sex unions why ought we to care now's not a catholic but here is the thing we ought to care because when historical pillars of western tradition including natural all begin to carve away at those pillars in the name of tolerance and diversity when they throw open to does of the church by getting rid of quart principles or by crumbling those cart principles the entire edifice starts to wear away and the state problem for religious believers of all traditional stripes is not restricted the catholic church s should not be read as just cretin of the pope it is not unseats catharsis its happening in nudism ts happening in protestants on the same day the pope issued his statement celebrated by the car times the york times issued another piece about the collapse of the united methods church riven by controversy over el g b t k plus minis divided by sign issues as the time describes quote at issue for methods is the question of ordaining and marrying el g b t k people a topic that is splintered many other protestant denominations and which methods have been eating for years there are eight million methods in the united states in twenty twenty according to the us religion senses between large scale departures and the broader train of the cline according to one force that number could drop by half in debate the exodus marks a calamitous decline for the broad er tradition of mainline protestants which ones dominated the america religious social and cultural landscape and here in lies the biggest problem of all there is no substitute for traditional religion in the america landscape or indeed in the western landscape more broadly and traditional religion requires skin in the game it requires rules it requires behavioral restrictions it requires people to actually believe in a moral system above their own subjective morality the minute religion becomes merely a non judge mental blessing jumped on top of subjective self glorification religion is no longer valuable and when religion loses its value church crumbles and when church crumbles social society crumbles and then we are relegated to the surgeon general of the united states the take merely lecturing us as dancing unicorns hound out prescriptions for social connection herein lies the problem when church dies does the united states it is why every one feels chaotic these days non to know by the way why there arising conspiracies theories on overside the isle these ads is because when you do not trust in god you start believing there has to be some other conspiracy responsible for why the world works the way that the world works when you believing god it makes we my easy to hellcat i do not understand what the else going on here about there is some one who does but when you do not believing god or when you fear that god may not be in charge then you start believing that a small today of human beings are capable of manipulating a pends to the and degree and then you find those human beings than y blame those human beings and this allows you to believe in any form of conspiracy theory and that is a real problem because once you start believing in those sorts of theories you cannot have a functional democracy or functional republic along those lines does not mean there are not conspiracies that are true but when people start believing evidence free conspiracies when every thing that happens the sign of a broader conspiracy of which you have no evidence that is really a problem ex a means you cannot trust any outcome every outcome is now inherently untrustworthy and that is a real danger for the country i can meanwhile jobidon has at record approval ratings in the twenty twenty four election according to a bran new poll from monmouth university he is now town thirty four per cent sixty one per cent of those poll disapprove of the job that biding is doing his president went with the twenty twenty four presidential lection now let than a your way according to mediate another are really horrifyingly bad numbers for cordon cats a twenty four per cent approval rating among independence this puts him behind the pail in pretty much every swing state dona trump is recently leading ans touches me saying at democraeticpollster stand the greening he sang they are losing ground every single month this campaniles getting weaker inflation's thirty point hire then make problem and you cannot o a president early down if if e always a with were making progress an then yo ain prices a you lookgetit ad in the black tee mainly ten to i in tan e i i e job but that is that were there they are not they're lothinggr on every one an danger about it but the you have to at the thou a see what thetic problem have you how do you we wit the first problem is inflation an the cost o of it ant what he is right about all that and can see it reflected in the pulse meanwhile the news media are trying to make e case to jobidin that the reason the he is losing polarities because he is not left going enough which is in a hosing case to make ism to have the president who spent more money than any president in america history here is en b s interviewing young voters for running way from biding and naturally if you interview all the crazy young people an meant it look at these people i me my goners if this is the next generation we are s screwed and here they are trying to explain the are from done count to wiscontin why they are enthused about voting for jobidon i e e postman that what the a your those this life not not in thus t the over ye very prat mat it an strategic about it all of the this is that that our popular with democrats has not only not address but all thin on be entire opposite way to a mean it i can look at a most every sum i have this important o an and n i if failure unbinds part say well it is not going to be because of these voters that yourebine loses the reason jordan is going to lose if you loses because gan lose those independent voters in the middle again he as perceived as the moderate alternative to true in twenty twenty he is no longer perceived as a moderate alternative to trump and hits can be particularly true if the economy continues to basically stag a along now the entire media are invest in the idea that we have now avoided recession that the economy is booming everything is going amazingly while the washington post has an entire peace hat the top of their website today titled every one expected recession the fed and white house found a way out wow amazing sure we have had complete wage stagnation in the country for last three yours sure everything cost a pagurian dollars more than it did just a couple of years ago but they avoided a recession technically now actually they did not if you recall last your ritually did have a couple of consecutive quarters of negative growth which technically qualifies his recession but if the idea hears that were avoiding a gigantic procession in favor of bomb ask stagnation for a long period of time that probably true and that stagnation is going to get worse because there are a we economic factors that cut in favor of the idea that the stock market for example is actually ahead of where the federal service fillet to that in just one second we need to ramp up our efforts to save the lives of innocent babes i cannot stress this enough because of our partnership with reborn in

right ow at medicare dot come slash ben already meanwhile the biding administration there again i still think economically speaking their their whistling past thegraveyard the inflation stats have come dow they have come down merges lot of supply chains have now been restored the supply change problem was in acting mass of contributing factor to inflation bid one lying about that now you add an on top of that with records spending into an economy that had two we goods flowing through it and as the supply chance of open back up the number of goods has risen and it is moving toward meeting the amount of money that is flowing through the system however they because of their cowardly for policy they are now experiencing the possibility of serious problems on the supply chain again that as happening in the sues canoe according to the wallstery journal thou us unveiled a mufti national naval force to protect merchant vessels in the red sea after who the rebel attacks threatened the sues canal central pulling local trade on money the pendragons had it was establishing as security operation to protect sea born traffic from holistic missile and drop attacks launch by the whole groups in

stopping the other the oil coin be p on money was the latest company to halt its tankers from sailing through the red s now for for all the people who ten to believe that form policy has no impacted on how you live our life that obviously is untrue things get a more expensive when these see are not free for trade let us be rial about these the economic development of the past couple centuries and a half that been due in large part to two main factors first the brutish on para and control the seas and second the america avian control of the seas you be in order if those two things do not happen you can forget about your cheap goods at the stor you can forget about being able to afore all nice things you can afford i know there is this beard take out there that somehow for policy does not affect you in anyway or the your life would be significantly better if you did not have cheaper goods available to you ism just wondering how that is the is o this strange idea that our lives on a material level forget about a spiritual level on a material level are somehow not better chantey were in nineteen eighty is ridiculous on every possible level you have a bigger house than you did in nineteen eighty you have more devices than you did in nineteen eighty you to ley have central air you have that in nineteen eighty you probably have a much better parer than you did in nineteen eighty all of that is because of supply chains economics is not a simple case of its separate from foreign policy it requires free movement of goods and services across bode next trade lanes the red sea is one such trade lane the baby man strait is one such trade lings as canal is a trade lane time on straits our trade lane all these places are tradlingsthes are hot points that can absolutely crush you at the super market if they are not guaranteed by a western navy and the reality the the united states is only now starting to sail commabel i scortsome ships through the baboon of trade or what ever it as again that is going to have some pretty significant knock on effects if the red sea becomes no goes one from most tankers according the walsterturnal t would redraw the global oil market for the second time in two years after the ware on you crane and related sanctions force russia to find new markets for its petroleum that could send oil prices andtankorades vaulting higher according to richer matters research tractor at e gipon shipbrokers its all you knows it is in a cause chaos everything can get lot more expensive as a money morning matters had most tanker companies were still willing to send their vessels through the shipping chopping preventing a jumping prices but if the whooshes continue their attack in these particular areas then things are going to get worse now they are two ways to prevent those attar in in these areas it is really only one way they have the only way to prevent the attaxinairs by blowing the pirates out of the water that is grow the only way to do that because you in pretend that if you should run away from the area that magically terrors scraps are not going to then attempt to do the same thing and grab money and ransom these ships for example but that is not true me glad there by administration as always late is attempting to do something about this butt again cowardly foreign policy ends with much much worse economic circumstances for america tax pays and ye add on to that the fact that we are about to enter into the a of big taxes and the weak foreign policy high tax economy of the united states which is very reminiscent o the nineteen seventies it is not on to be grates nineteen seventies ere time are we had over spend and we decided to recede on foreign policy and the commination of those two factors led to much higher prices at home a led to a stagnating economy an less people in gas lines that could come back fairly easily according tote wallstregernal rich countries are raising more money from tax pairs than they have in decades to finance a burst of state spending as surging interstates make borrowing less attractive tax revenues have risen to record levels is a share of economic output in a number of mature economies including france japan and south core the increases are with hundreds of billions of dollars and additional revenue for governments they are navigating in array of new spending needs from military priorities to industrial policy governments continue to spend and or to keep up that spending they are going to have to increase the tax revenue in order to do that they can have to jack up the taxes it is something that jobidon has on to do for quite a while now the united states has been able to rely on the fact that we are still the best bet on the block when it comes to our debt because we are till thestrongest economy they are will come appoint when that is no longer true in fact we are fast approaching that point when no ones can one actually buy you es tat because the possibility that down the were no can a show repay that that organ in late our way out of it and that means increases in taxes in the twenty nation eurozon according o the whilestrternal government spending will reach half of the regions economic output this year according to the came in the united states state spending stands at thirty eight per cent of g d p in the entire get pea the country the country is now spending thirty eight per cent of that on social services and much new costs are coming down the tractor because the country and the west are getting older we have baked into the cake extraordinary and to try spending programs and the noway pay for that is to increase the taxes in try to grow your way out of it er not gone grow your way out of it given the policies the regulatory an business policies pursued by this administration if you do not grow your way out of it then your camel payferin in the stuff without radically raising taxes or radically in floating the currency or both and the federal reserve knows this by the way right now the stock mark is the little but disconnected from the federal reserve the federal reserve announce the their day that they were not going to be raising the interest rates and this was taken is a sign that inflation has been defeated in the united states in the federaleserve knows it and pretty soon he gust art lowering those interest rates whichwill are it easier to get a mortgage shall make a crediccard rates go down and all the rest of people get very enthusiastic heat will take that money o put it right back in the stock market that is ken on thy basic idea but the problems people are doing that now in anticipation of the fed lowering theintrest rates there so little bit ahead of the market at this point as mohomedal avian is saying mohomedael avian is an excellent financial analyst he is saying that if right now people are expecting the fad to lower the intrestrats an they do not lower the interest rates in the next year as much is expected the stock market will drop again jobitons economy is on tenter hooks because of many systemic probes created over the course of decades and then exacerbated by join now again as we mention a moment a go some of that exassurbation is being driven by events in the middle east now the best way to guarantee the freedom of the season at least is to not let pirates push around his not let the aronians push around in the region and one the best ways do not let the aronians push o around in the region is that when one of the baronial proxy groups comics the worst terror attack since nine eleven you let in the ally of the united states completely destroy that terrogroup there be an excellent way to throw iron off of this to push them back to contain them to speak without going directly to war with them cutting off the arms of the onto music you are not willing to go directly at the head israel for its part wants to do exactly that right now israel is attempting to push another cranial pro out cause bylaw off their northern border they want to prevent another conflict the one that is currently happening according to onion israel told the by administration wants use bells forces to be pushed roughly six miles from the border as part of a diplomatic deal to en mentions with lebanon the big administration is deeply concerned that escalating border skirmishes could lead to an all out war that would be even worse than the music conflict in tat of course is true but if israel force into worth cabala israel is not can hole back israel is holding back in goa they are that is why they have got out a hundred an thirty one dead soldiers over the course of the last couple of months in the gazistrip that is is not going to apply in serena for has blow is far better armed and has rockets capable of reaching the entirety of israel hes rally governments has publicly that in order to allow his daily citizens to go back to their homes the situation us to change either through dediplumacy or military action attentions on the border with lebanon were of of the main issues under discussion between secretary defense laid busting and is rally primnistern its now who administer defense you gallons in tell of eve they want his below not to be allowed to go back to their positions along the boarder which israel destroyed in the last couple of months again israel they have thirty thousand citizens we cully nonliving their homes are not going to allow this to continue the way that it is but one of the preconditions to solid form policy is not miscasting form policy unfortunately the united states seems to be in the weird position of being half realist in half miscasting it's on the realist side laid busting yesterday he was in israel an he said he is not here to dictate time lines to the israel government redoing time line is is steals a pay and that here to dictate time in or turn a support er to israel right to defend itself is i lie is you heard me san ta er time in the man take it is critical is i ratepayer that have not mas and that be able to threaten israel a from laser or even threaten gain any more o abet then load busting starts his miscasting says compass does not speak for the palistonian people not why does this matter in matters because there is this weird idea that is prevalent in america form policy circles that the palicinian authority run by abumazen machmudabas who is in actual holiest denying terror supporter his actual government has law that pays people who kills just right now there is this weird idea that the palcinan authority which enjoys an extraordinarily low approvalrating in the wetback where it has governed tyrannically for the last twenty years abumazen is now in the seventeenth year of a fore your term the have an held election in seventeen years and f alachnwer helped agamas win in the wetback this idea requires is real to then make concessions to cranial proxies the will en mamas the power again do not wish conform policy folks it toad mistake here is to laid busting to inxtjus that mamas is still holing hostages including america citizens ham in be itself an ha itself by incised palistandian savage mamas is not speak for the palistanian people mamas is it vermin to don both is radios and pelistandias to an unific si go of suffering an strike all of that is true except for compass does not represent the palistonian people what evidence does he have that that is not that that is not the case am not commas then who an it is feared idea that u just hand over the gaze strip to the pain an authority and this will somehow guarantee is daily security and palisinian security is totally insane and just one second will get to the other side of the because jordan obviously has very low apruvalratings but som re publican is going to have to beat him in order to take him out the wight house first holiday prepping giant pain in the but it feels

to bring back good trump bad trump because that is just the reality of trump sometimes he says good thing and sometimes he says bad things well yesterday he desmid once again attack chippy one o those conservation members of the house re publican at cakes he said has any smart and energetic republican in the great state of texts decided to run in the primary against rhino congress men shipway for the right person his very people if interested let me know get just be very clear chippy is one f he bust congress people in america he is an excellent congress person deeply conservative he is one the people who pride connections away from caviar earthy s if you light those concessions thank chippy chip is again an excellent thinker super conservative dona trump does not him because he did not go along with the idea that dona trump one the twenty twenty lection he still pissed about it and by the way this is really stupid when i say it stupid i mean to his technically stupid the primary ballot is not open it is too late to get on the primary ballet against shipway at seven days after the techs primary filing deadline past and which is and tweeting things or putting things down on truth social does not manifest them in the world now this should be a point of annoyance for lot of conservatives it really should but the biggest problem is that again conservatives they basically trust trump they watched him be president for four years the polices that he promoted we are pretty conservative and the have learned to basely discount anything that he says on truth social which means that there not a lot of amazing lines of attack by his opponents in the republican primaries against him on to cantus is line of attack was going to be ion more trustworthy as a conservative an the best conservative governor of your lifetime and all of that is true but if the base in love of trust from the conservative public is very high for trump very hard to outflank him that way this seems to be the mantis continued message and again in primary primary held today i vote for tosantus over trump an hale but to mantis ow this line of attack is not going to be fruitful against donate trump he says trump could pardon non violent ganuaris i protestors he chose not to out during donate trump is not going to work what is interesting on on the could gaucher sex protest o man we he called that rally knowing that that was get to been d see were wore things could get pettentually out o hand and he is now saying he would do claimant we for that i would guess the non way am the bineont he could have don that when he was president he could have said look this was he could ha taken responds o ability he could have said that the people that went not the violent people overly that the the pro the pen it is a word of a different further but on the people that were there just as protestors an cat a got caught up and he could hae grand claimant seat of the am and he chose not to because o thin we was told that if he did that he could effectually rest being convicted that is set it in pakecontrel of the idea that now he is going to help people that were railroad ad he could have done that before he left office also desansis is totally correct about all this of course but that is assuming that the conserve republic is deeply interested in trumps policy positions which they are not meanwhile de basis turning his guns on nickel hale and he saying that she exemplifies everything the trump supporters oppose which again is weird because she was the yuan ambassador under trump very pro trump throughout his administration she slipped flowed down from a little bit post his ad ministration he is not wrong about this again if you look at the poles trump supporters are likely to shift if tolan see its trace they are not likely shift hale tenants they the dessansis is voters would move over to trump in a likelihood which is again why both of these candidates are very unlikely to to defeat trump in the nomination fight just speaking technically and looking at the poles right now but here as desansis going after nickel hale yesterday she is not get a win a re publican primary it she is there to do is to take some boats from people who do not want trump and really i think in sure that trump has a better path ought to be able to go interestingly donor trumps trumps corse supporters do not hale because everything they claim there chance establish man global is om liberal wall street don ears not on and on that that is hale right and yet when trump is asked can you categorically a rule out her is vice president he will not rule her out as vice president now again he is right about all this but is that line of attacking a bare fruit probably not new samphire where again nick hale is is now in second place by pretty significant margin o interesting see what happens in i when meanwhile whale's angle on trump continues to be tithes too old and maybe that lifeworks a little bit better but the reality is that he is going up against join his dead some not are that line workseth this is the biggest problem the most plausible line against trump from remember twenty twenty two was he loses elections a wat and because he lose election's lot you do not want to lose the upcoming election but nobody was able to jump in in time to capture that message before bison started sinking enough in the bulls that now from his beating him in virtually of repel here is nickel hale going after o going after donate trump yesterday now a clear second place nick hale has behind trump in the first thin the nation primary state and on the heels of those naming covers she is also launching an new ad not heating at her republican rivals but right at president by that it'll just into zombie akin nursing in a mandarin inform yesterday cannot mead ai tomorrow we man tum mental woman a really ta an re stor r r con o his obviously an aligns bit is not really not aging bid it is really much more about trumbrime she is running in's trump in a primary when she says too old what she really means a trump is that likely to end with trump not winning the nomination again ism not seeing a lot of fruitful line of attacks against trump at this point in the race just technically speaking but true is also not held to any of the same rules is normal politicians he is literally out their tacking one often best congress people in america right now an conserves m ism not i wish i know it to about that i i honestly do not know the answer meanwhile democracy not to t about trump either there just going with the trumps hitlerisin again the doubles wrinkly he is out there doing this routine the singing o be them all the way up til they election as i say and let me to say something no one in america things trumpet tiller no one thinks less another may be some crazes left us tho believe this in reality here is a column ant that washington post yesterday the pointed this out people ask you look at trump's policies and what he says on policy in they he seems kind f a confused moderate milk really conservatives no that he did a lot of conservative things but most people are pretty disconnected from politics and here is what donate trump has said on major issues major controversial issues a he is set on abortion do not knowhow to do about it will come to a universally consents which is a con quart moderate position is not a proline position a he is said when it comes to things gift an time now gene watch them u terraaban group band ho neat ism not tat i man demand re that that is acuunc moderate position when it comes to el go be take plus jinnis be by sentisshus i a let germ can use the girl bathroom tat they vine in they gunman i every hopbutan issue trump has takin a queasy moderate position he is not in fact a hard core conservative and also when people stars an authoritarian that is a suing a level of competence that he is not demonstrated in being in authors firkin to this kendo cat from doubles wrinkly is not going to for get to that in just one second first if the audio engineer feel it is typically not filled with joy and laughter our auto engineer mi coming no exception have ask him to her up for i know is beenalmost a debated this point he is he is not going to listen he is just going to remain as down as ever but we love it fall of that because he is an excellent excellent audio engineer despite the fact that he is not exacting in m to pep in your step with his personality i see him mike i see i be this is

proposal is the dona trump must lose because he is an authoritarian and we do not authoritarians exception when joins using his pen in his phone to try to manat that eighty million people take of vaccination or lose their jobs and then then they authoritarians or when they try to just by did not of executive order get rid of hundreds of billions o dollars in to loaned at and then the sprimcourts has now and then they do it anyway which the thing that is literally happening right now they still been dispersing fun ism not getting in violation of supreme court ruling that matter the real authoritarians are people donate trump again look at that truth social and tell me the what you are looking here is it what you sing here is a burgeoning mousilinear hitter wo got is truth social do you does not know how to capitalize right guys he miss spells basic words like to when he was president of the united states his authoritarianism a mounted to him saying things on twitter that he then did not do but dis noon t be there entitling no one thing sound trumpets this scary seriously ism sirrylic even people hartrart suggesting that canary six was a massive crisis level event for the t not just an ugly horrible thing that happen which agree ugly horrible bad images of people swarming t capital building hurting police officers anal the last that was not an existential crisis for the united states not remotely was much it dolts and some people who art in good faith there and wandering the halls who held up the proceegertflike to ours and then that was it but there still going with the trump either thing here who is that which has invaded a national body especially the strong an flow a force plod that is fa my come as at historiated what isn't you here and the fellow presents remarks i heard former cressiden who is o hiding on fascism here is no question about that being the in o in cop he knows he is been galling in to i for how li o keeps we speeches an tat side o o my coons to be e we inspire to the to a ani o becausits it is the find of language went to be little people bee humanize them o an wen where not making of any a ti true coat or saying he is a dashikis that really for dealing wit o by in our country between democracy and assist an trumps telling you that he isn't he does not really mind they he er comparison because a her he and mires her really who buses this seriously doesn't by this meanwhile any loud doing the simrotinan i'msemd you see i massed me see the trumpet hitter channel is they say the trumps tapping into longstanding illiberal tradition again hearing people on the left talk about illiberal traditions as they simultaneously shut down for speech on campuses tell people that they are not allowed used biological pronouns use the power of the pen and the telephone to you whatever they damn would well please i i ism having some trouble squaring the circle here remember not see lawyers in the nineteen thirty is actually looking to america law and in etimostatination law emigration law as examples molconv actually quotes the america project as an exemplary prose remember in nineteen thirty none in main to square garden there is n extraordinary not serially par wat top has done he is tapped in to a long standing illiberal tradition in the united states and is exploiting it we need to see the newness of it but also see what is actually quite familiar by the way some of the biggest supporters of musolinan learn in the early nineteen thirties people the democratic party including by the way f do army

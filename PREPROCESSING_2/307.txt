welcome to the superman ladpodca t just science e science pace toe or li blow everybody and welcome i want a thank all of you premium humeral lab podcast subscribers for joining this is an exciting one even though the backdrop here looks very much lithe studio back in united states i am doing this a m a live from kidney australia where i and supermen lab podcast have been for well over a week we were in melon and we just did two live shows here in kidney and were headed off to bribe to morrow and it is been absolutely delightful that much fun talking science learning from people hat's a wonderful place i want to get right into your questions and do my best answer as many of them as possible as thoroughly clearly and succinctly as possible over the next hour been a dive into those in just a moment just one last important thing before i do that which is that i want to thank every one for being a premium subscriber and let that we based on your contributions to the premium channel have already as supported four laboratories at stamford colombia university all constitute and elsewhere for important projects on humans that are already leading to important therapeutic break through that we will soon share with you on the humeral lampodcast but that this year twenty twenty four we were fortune enough to secure no fewer than three dollar for dollar match donors who have generously agreed to match our contributions from the premium channel to additional projects in those are going to head out to a number of different universities and researchers working again on human studies of no animal studies human studies on important projects everything from novel treatments for mental health issues headache and my grain ism some interesting stuff on menology and cancer mind sets and immune system function and much much more also nutrition physiology exercise physiology et camera your contributions to the premium channel really do make a difference i can say this i because ism familiar with the challenges of raising funding for doing truly break through work and getting things quickly out to the general public thank you thank you thank you and now without further ado let us get to your questions the first question was is how are you managing to achieve your key health pillars while in australia and anthem other place you have enjoyed doing all while working hard well thanks for the question it'll answer this question in the context of what i think we all can and should and i really will do i because if you are premium channel subscriber ism certainly you are taking your earth seriously a first off am i think there is a bit of a misconception about the protocols on the hubrmen ladpodcast being that a we are all including myself super superregimented about them to the point where we do not enjoy other things in life and that is simply not true i view the protocols of the hubermenlad podcast as science base actionable locostirocostminimal cost in almost all situations there few exceptions to that but the really design to mash with the rest of life and in hints mental health and physical health which of course means remaining social staying on typical sleep schedule et camera the big ones for me when arriving here were of course to get morning sunlight am as often as possible a saw beautiful sunrise this morning over kidney but even on the overcast's we have had a few any overcast's to really make it a point to get outside and to get that morning sunlight also a our true did travel in with a a red light not a red light panel although you have a couple red light panels an those portable ones ism that i use from time to time the red lights om referring to om in reference to answering this question are the red lights with are just red light bulb that we i i should trouble with a red subunit it is us just a small screw unit you plug it in here a within dapper of course and then in the evening we have switched off the lights and the place where we are staying in it just brings the over all levels of quarter all down lo very quickly and it makes at very easy to get to sleep each night it makes a big big difference and this is a very low cost tole you could sentry purchase any red light even red party lights and put those up and then switch off the regular overhead lights it makes a big difference that is probably even cops saving ah we have also stayed fairly regimented about exercise o this morning took a great jog down to the ocean jumped in the ocean if you do not have access to an ocean on vacation just getting outside and getting some movement early in the day can help shift your rhythm really the quadfecta of shifting your circadian rhythm in a new place or becoming an early riser if you want to do that is morning sunlight movement social engagement and in my case affine although some people would opt for eating breakfast i just happen to prefer to eat a a bit later in the day when you combine those things you are really ample lying that morning quarters all increase hat have talked about on the pod cast morning katacolemine release o dopamine up an effort in nor up an fern and those act in synergy to create for early day and daytime mudfocus an alertness and enhance the transition to night time sleep but of course the dimming of the lights and maybeven red light in the evening really really can help and those are the biggies and then of course if you want to shift your circadian rhythm really quickly to be on a local schedule it helps to hop on the local meal schedule but for me that always means skipping breakfast ism not a big breakfast eater i lunch an afternoon snack sometimes and dinner when you do all of those things makes a very easy to stay with the health pillars and of course stress control is important we are down lives here's a lot of work to do there a daily for me non sleep deep rest or yoganedra photo call by the way you may be familiar with non sleep e breast in yogenedra terrific zero cost practise for reducing stress replacing we replenishing opening and mental and physical vigor have talked about this and the studies that support this on the podcast there is a a superman an testy a script on you too that is against zero cost but while down here we recorded a ten minute twenty minute and thirty minute and it a script with a view of a beautiful kidney sunrise those should be posted to our superman lab eclipse channel in the not too different future probing the next couple weeks and then you can have different duration and sit a scrips that you can use again complete these hero cost any time you i wee recorded also some additional meditations and a were considering putting out a a notify album if you will of an sty a in meditations that are science base of different durations if you that idea maybe just i give a shout into the internet and holy will hear it or put a comment on in the latest episode of the german lab podcast on you tube and if that sounds a good idea to you we will do more of that these are again zero cost zero to access tools for enhancing mental half physical health combining all of those is really what we have done u next question was is i have followed your sleep advice and i have seen a huge improvement great happy to hear that wonderful but i still wake up at night and only yet five or six hours is that enough can you please give more advice if possible well torso all thanks for turning into the the sleep advice the question of whether not five or six hours is enough really depends on person context and by contexts i mean it can even change across the course of the year by life circumstances the criteria for insane our very clear insomnia is excessive daytime sleepiness due to lack of sleep at night excessive daytime y sleeping less due to lack of sleep at night if you are not falling asleep during the day and you feel reasonably good throughout the day may be only need a brief ten minute to thirty minute nap in the after an some people nap some people do not want to no does not matter but if you feel pretty good throughout the day and you have enough mental and physical energy and focus to complete the activities you need to complete then i would not worry much about five to six hours and i would not obsess over the and of scary things that we hear o for not getting seventy eight hours that we get to mesh et camera because that is not necessarily the case everyone has different sleep needs the other thing and this is perhaps the most important thing for everybody listening to this really to think about is cut cut arty which is quality quantity timing excuse me quality quantity regularity and timing cut cut art much art ah which is an acronym going by the great jaywalker author of the bookwuy we sleep yes on terrific podcast in his own right is a series on the govern lappet cast coming out soon much arty is what you really n to think about when you think about your sleep you want to thing about the quantity how much are you getting you ream who ask this question are getting five to six hours to night o we what about the quality of that sleep is it consistently five to six hours with no break series there break in the middle one trip to the rest arm the ill the night is considered normal and healthy for most people you are making multiple trips to the rest airmen the mill the night you are waking up until times throughout the night on a regular basis that something to try and overcome the quality pieces important also whether not you remember your dreams or you do not you want to make sure that you are getting ample amounts of slow wave sleep which dominates the first half of your sleep night and rapid eye movement sleep which dominates the second half you sleep night because they have different rolls in recovery of brain and body namely slow wave each deep sleep is responsible for growthomon release rapid eye movement sleep responsible for of the unpacking or the uncoupling of a motions to prior day and previous day experiences and in that way acts as a kind of a a scrubbing out or therapy for your emotional state are yo feeling emotionally rested when you wake up as a good indication of wether not you are getting enough rain eve movement sleep some people sleep trackers using their eight sleep or their whoop or the or ring or something that ism a fan of sleep trackers but i think that relying too heavily on see scores can be risky there are data from allycrums lab at stamford showing that if people receive a poor sleep score even though they sleep well their performance will drop if people get a good sleep square even though am their their sleep was lousy their performances maintained or even inland you do not want it take any one sleep score and over interpret you an't a look at the average and compare that to your subjective experience of sleep maybe i would say go about half way through your day if you can bear to do it before looking at your sleep score and see how you feel then look at your sleep score as a post to the other way around that might be a good way to a just for that unbelief effect i just mention but if you are getting enough quantity let say you get five to six hours than quality our sleeping through that bout maybe with one a epoch of waking up and then the regularity of your sleep is that you are going to sleep more or less at the same time each night pluses minus an hour on let say five to six days per week because sometimes we to stay up on we can night and have some fun or something that and then the timing where that sleep is falling in your twenty four hour schedule is really key and hearts what we are learning as a field that for many people who are early to bed early to rise types if they go to bed around nine p m nine thirty and they only get six hours of sleep they feel great whereas if they get the equivalent amount of sleep but go to bed at eleven p m or midnight they feel lousy similarly if your night out you are somebody that really prefers to go to bed around one or two a m and wake up around let say ten a m if you take that equivalent amount sleep and you go to bed earlier you are going to feel not good getting the timing of your sleep in the twenty four hour cycle correct and fairly consistent that is the are part of tuck art a correct is going to be beneficial i would not worry much about five to six hours only here is what i would do ream i would take that five to six hours and before getting out of bed each morning i would do a ten to thirty minute and star non sleep deep least protocol which will allow you to feel deeply rested and frankly to recover whatever bits of sleep that you perhaps miss during the night have found that to be a tremendously beneficial practice waking up if i do not feel thoroughly rested doing at ten to thirty minute and star then getting out of bed and continuing the and if you do not have time to do that do that ten minute may be twenty minute at s car later in the day at any point and i think you will see terrific results not just because you are recovering some sleep that you lost perhaps during the night maybe you just need five to six hours but also because you will get better at falling and staying deeply asleep through the practice of antiar in the morning or at some point throughout the day i i would not recommend anything else elaborate unless your feeling really exhausted during the day in which case than i would move to some of the more advance sleep tools have had vertigo i should denounce this is a question ism not just telling about my vertigo have had vertigo on and off and wonder what causes it is it hormones a urinals autolysis moving around ah this person knows about the cocoa hydration virus exposure zenana i think it is how you pronounce your name forgive me if that is notpronunciation banana vertigo is very interesting am unfortunately it is uncomfortable but we can learn a thing or two right now that should bet help you zenana and others even if they have not had vertigo vertigo this perception of falling or dizziness needs to be distinguished from light headdress if your ever feeling dizzy it is worth stopping and sitting or if you cannot sit standing an closing your eyes and asking yourself a question do i feel ism ready to fall straight down or do i feel ism going to spin and fall down because in answering that question you can determine whether not you are light headed that would be the straight falling down or you have vertigo which is your dizzy which is that you are going to spin and fall that i do this in the sate place please you can do this while bracing yourself against a wall or that is what i said ideally seated sou do not actually fall but in most cases if your feeling that spin if you are feeling truly dizzy your feeling vertigo in move my head are only on purpose then chances are you have got some issue in either your visual system or your inner ear o miso since this is being recorded on video i can display when ism about to say your visual system and your inner ear system for balance have some really important features one to make this a very quick tutorial your head as you move through space is experiencing visual images going by all the time your retina's your eyes are essentially exposed to a lot of what is called visual slip imagine your walking in your thing to take a a picture on your telephone or a have an android phone on your android phone and your moving it is can be blurry right well there is a stabilization process in your body and brain it is a magnificent one that frank is built in into all jawed animals whereby your head because it can move forward think coding right this is pitch for you pilots right yaw moving from side to side this would be the no this would be the no no pitch yaw and roll which would be the puppy look right pitch yaw and roll pitch yaw rail those are the three major angles of visual slip and in an absolutely magnificent set of things your inner ear has three hoolahoop shaped structures one that is arranged vertically up on its end one that is at an angle of about forty five degrees to that and another that sits aholahoop flat on the ground and inside of each of those little hoolahoop tubes they're little stones called activist can you heard that word earlier that roll around on the bottom just marbles at the bottom of ahoolahoop such that when you pitch nod the marbles in the verticalhoolahoop slide back and forth when you say no the marbles in that hoolahoop lying essentially parallel to the floor move around and then the one at forty five degrees when you roll your head from side to side those move and each of those sensual signals that converge on the hurry signals coming from the eye and get this when you move through space there is a precise offset of whatever visual slip you happen to be experiencing by walking images e movingyour looking up you revoking a buildings you precooking around you are talking a somebody they are moving their head and your eye is making little tiny movements little microsicads on the middle second time scale that act is a perfect image stabilizer what this means this is by the way called the vestibule ocular reflex the tubular system ocular reflex and it is melted through a structure call the cerebellum in the back of the brain this is why when you are on a boat when the horizon is tipping back and forth after be careful this because i have such prominent sea sickness spaced on a prior experienced that of thing about this too much i might get anxious when that horizon is moving around your system becomes uncalibrated because you cannot really keep the system jolting about in a regular way to be really careful your getting dizzy nosistid dizzy not light headed u and you will end up disrupt ting that slip processing you essentially over compensate which is why whenever you feel sick on a boat they say look at the horizon fixate to something at a distance oh we if you have vertigo almost certainly there is something going on in you are inner ear yes it can be caused by crisis yes it can be caused by hormones these things tend to be transient but the most important thing is going to be to anchor the visual part of the vestibulaocular reflex what you are going to want to do is your going to want a fixate on a point may be three or four feet away and then you are going to actually want to move closer to that point or if you got have axes to youwould want a look at your hand yen your finger out in front of you and then slowly move it in toward your nose at some point you will feel you region to go crossed and you can stop at that point then move out again then in again what are you doing when you are doing this we you're doing is you are over riding the error signals the incorrect error signals that exist in your kind of default setting at that when you have her togo and you are forcing the visual component to dominate and then your inner your mechanisms will adjust to that this is a very powerful tool if you ever feel cautious or see sick at a very powerful to if you have in mes in the back of an user and in the users too small you get out more walking to a building wherethere no windows are i do not relieve feel good get outside and look at a fixation point some distance away this actually happened the other day we went to the him we went inside this him we have been in a in a van and then wen inside and were not feeling well we decide to get out and just take a walk and fixate to the longest distance possible the fresh air probably helped as well but when doing that you are anchoring the visual part of the vestibulaocular reflex now that is far and away better than trying to avoid moving your head to not get those little stones moving around in the semicircular can canals lots to say about this ma could go on and on botfly you learn semeiology and you learn to how to not be cautious if ever you feel dizzy or cautious based on movement motion sick and we can talk about why you get motion sick but its through the vaguest nerve et camera et camera but this is a very useful tool and if your ever just not feeling well unless you have a fever r something that i recommend getting outside and looking at the furthest vexation point with your vision that you possibly can and then walking toward it as far as you can safely if not by sushi is doing a few of these exercises of looking at your finger up close that is going to be very good for anchoring the vestibular ocular reflex and not every time but many times people port feeling better especially if you have moved from one closed environment to another closed environment to another closed environment and on of next question is what can be done to improve brain function for people they've been negatively impacted by things such as poor sleep poor i and t bi early in life names yet this is a great question i get this a lot i think that it reminds me that a lot of the conversation that we have on the pod cast is about the good things that happen when you do things right and the bad things tho happen when you do things wrong and while i think that is an important conversation what have frankly failed to do u enough and that's we grateful for this question because it gives the opportunity to talk more about the fact that your your system is very robot there is narrow plasticity and also as my graduaadviser used to say time machines broken which is not to say you are out o luck but i would not spend any extra energy thinking about how many we not seedskus how many have to be careful the entoil debate is still a debate it is unclear how many a translate a you are exposed to in childhood we know translate are bad everyone agrees they are bad governments agee they're bad this perhaps one the few things everybody agrees on in the nutrition space translate are bad when i was growing up translate were abundant in foods u there probably fewer of certain things that we have more of now that are bad but yo now we at old transits we had larger in our fridge am there are other things that were probably wasn't good for us that we consumed and never one while it'll think ash if i had only been eating grass fed meats and fruits and vegetables and am and healthy grains as i do now back then imagine how much healthier i be but i really do not spend too much time on it and i do not think you should either i think the most important thing to remember is that biological systems unless there really damage you talk about it a a major injury a and even then there very robot you can overcome years decades of poor use are misuse of those systems that said if you have the opportunity to take care of them now i highly suggest you do for instance if you have not slept well for years now's the time to get it right i would not worry about the past truly you can always rescue some of your health and healtspen in life spend a poor diet same thing just it is a just do it kind of thing just hop on hop on the train of getting things right eighty to ninety per cent of the time t b i dramatic brain injury well the episode of the hubreumen lalpokes its outright now with doctor marked es patio he is an empty and urologist a originally trained at a universal pennsylvania now at university calfornia barely we talk about t b the lo different forms of t b i am different origins am everything from bombast to car accident construction work to justyou slipped on the stairs at a party i know ne that slipped on a some wet floor and party and you o has a brain injury what what do we know well get back to the basics sleep is a going to be important but there are some things transcranial magnetic stimulation certainly things that reduce brain inflammation lymphatic outflow lymphatic outflow is this washing of the brain at night the removes debris very very important am in the weeks and months after dramatic brain injury to get adequate sleep for that reason but then there are rings that also seem to perhaps improve outcomes from dramatic branantries such as hyperbaric chambers o hyporoxygenation treatments if you have access to those even things elevating the feat slightly when you sleep by about five to fifteen degrees is known to increase lymphatic flow during sleep which can we believe by way of increase clearance of a bunch of basically debris react if oxygen species within the cells but also debris outside the cells in the extracellular or space o between noranzeis an just empty space there is all this i heavily oscillated stuff which easily just means this kind of spongy carbohydrate stuff that fills in the spaces the clearance of some of the a metabolites and some of the debris that is accumulate there by just sleeping with feet slightly elevated deftly not falling asleep in a chair upright that is the worst thing for lymphatic flow things that some people go and a bonkers on all things anti inflammation they stare taking tons of kurcumen and they cannot get obsessed with inflammation as as the enemy i would not do that in fact there's some negative effects of things kircumen am turmeric if you take in hypnosis limiting the amount of the hydratostosteron production which s not good you do not want that a male or female you do not want to take too much numeric or churchmen on their real issues with that ism to say nothing of the the studies have showed lead contamination in a lot of turmerics you want of check the forcing very carefully if you do consume any numeric a little bit is probably fine cooking with it is fine but where here where tie mut supplementation and and you'll just really not trying to turn inflammation into this terrible thing to the point where you restarting to do other things that are potentially damaging there is some really interesting evidence that five grams may be ten grams depending on your body weight of creating monohydrate per day can enhance creating phosphate metabolism in the forebrain and infants brain function under conditions of high altitude or t be e i take five to ten grams of creating just creating monohydrate powder frankly any creating monohydrate powder should be sufficient there are other forms of creating they are not any better cretin monohydrate is the least expensive fortunately am that makes in water you take it with her without food some people ask o this creating make your hair fall out no it does not make your hair fall out but some people to experience a increase in d h t with with create monohydrade an there can be a d h t hair lost links if you think you are losing a hair from taking creatine then stop and see to the control experiment it should grow back but five to ten grams of creating mono hydrate something to explore hyperoberc chamber something to explore excellent sleep definitely do that and i just would not obsess over past ills are wrongs to the extent that am it impactsourability to try and correct those in the present i out see that about most everything but then again i understand that is humans because we can remember the past the present and the future that sometimes a and it is difficult to let go of the mistakes of pass that we made but that is just simply o being human and i do not have a solution to that are we any closer defending the cause of o c d well i think we know what causes of d i think om it is pretty clear that o so d is some form of miss wiring in the basil ganglia the structures of the brain that are involved in go action and no go with holding action type o behaviors a and some a malwiring of those structures to the dopamine reward system because here's what is interesting about o s d o c d involves obsessions obviously that is h o in o s d compulsions the actions that the c in o s d but in a kind of weird twist of the neurology of d is a situation where the compulsion does not remove the obsession rather it exacerbates it of the compulsion does not remove the obsession it exacerbates it unlike an it that you scratch with o s d the scratching of the i makes at worse which is actually what we experience when we have a mosquito bite which bathe have absolute loathe mosquito bites economy least favorite things in life a have about thirty six hundred an counting peeves that deposing high on the list of those the obsessive compulsive disorder is one that really needs to be treated frankly neurologically it is one for which there are behavioral interventions but it is clear that adjusting the pharmacology of the neural circuits involved in old really cannot help there again there are behavioral treatments but for severe cases of o c d it is just very very clear that interventions which include essessorises which have been demonized a lot of people say oh sire select seratona rep taken hitters are terrible babbled the ceretonan hypothesis of depression is in true well listen the reality is this that all treatments for depression that are effective which include accessorize in some cases chignon behavioral treatments all of these sorts of things which have shown efficacy are all about what they are now about saratonan they are about negro plasticity that is why some anta depression center on opening an norpanefferand other center on serotonin they are about neural plasticity there about changing neural networks they are not about negro chemical perse but the neuromodulators such as saratonan allow an access point they are a wedge into the negro plasticity process now with o c d in order to overcome these these malwirings it is very important to get plasticity how do you get plasticity well you in my belief you work with an excellent psychiatrists who can prescribe the appropriate dos of drop to release the appropriate amount of neurmodulator then and this is really key you have opened up the window for plasticity but then it is really imported that the proper behaviors are engaged in and when i did an episode nosed talked about what some of these are for instance the person is exposed to the stimulus that causes the obsession or maybe the obsession arises spontaneously they feel the i pulse to complete the compulsion the behavior and they resist with the support of a therapist but they are doing this in the context of having elevated levels of ceretonan or some other naurmodulator that then allows fewer trials of resistance fewer times of needing to withhold the the the behavior that this person badly wants to perform because it is coming from within as this compulsion literally then they are able to achieve plasticity more quickly perhaps also transcurnua my new stimulation a conjunction of the correct behavior the withholding behavior maybe a replacement behavior that is often use use a replacement behavior with the appropriate negro chemical miles is the solution to o s d can next question is if ism just going to new york city from san francisco how do i control shifting my circadian rhythm by only three hours if you are going in new york city from san francisco the best way frankly would be to get up an hour earlier two days before you head off to new york and then another day you might trench by two hours before you go and then head to new york can do the last shift on the last day a most people will not do that is just on takes ala bit of work but on they just do not have the the time ability or your discipline to do that but it is perhaps the best way i would say the best thing to do is to know your temperature minimument it'll try and keep this o pretty simple if you typically wake up at eight a m let us say just by way of example that means that you are minimumbody temperatures at six a m which means that if you want to get up earlier in the days where you travel to new york well in the couple of days before you leave any time between six a m and ten a m get some bright light in your eyes even if you go back to sleep for instance get up at six a m sevenalarm clock i know you only to get up at at a m get up at six a m get some bright light in your eyes from artificial sources or from sunlight maybe five ten minutes and go back to sleep until eight a m you do that again the next night and then you head off to new york you will find the shift to be much easier now here is what you do not want to do you want to make sure that you do not view bright light before six i m in the middle of the night if you get up you would use the restaurant trying to use dim lights as dim as a safely possible et camera and what you doing when you are doing this yet could get into a long description of the science behind this and it'll probably to a podcast all about this at some point but really what you are doing if you get up at six a m and getting some bright light exposure is you think about it you cannot looking at a new york sunrise of sorts ay if it is not a sunrise you are getting some bright light that mimic sunrise at least to som extent nothings quite sunrise but to some extent in that sens even if you go back to sleep what you are doing as you are sending the light signal the zit weber the time signal to your circadian clock of your hypothalamus that it should shift that you need to get up earlier and indeed that will happen over the course of about two three days the other thing you can do and i no this is a is is kind of a rare these days to get an answer this the other thing you can do is just flat to new york and force yourself to get up and just drink machine and get out and exercise and use the social rhythm of the activity of the city in order to get up earlier but you will feel lousy late morning and you would only want to do that if you could access a brief nap of anywhere from thirty to ninety minutes late morning and then you will feel for but my suggestion would be to some something back there say some animal or something that answer much the at yet would be to just trying to get a obit of light exposure a couple hours before your normal wake up time then go back to sleep in the two days before you had off to new york city and of course everything here was set in the context of the new york city a flight from samrecisco new york city but but the principal the logic holds and if you have any questions about this temperature minimum and wake up time and you want to get your circadian clock r the for travel check out the episode that we did on jetlag shift work and ism realizing now as i say this and i at my teams here and there listening that i will do a video on the human labclips channel where i explain temperature minimum and how to plug in your wake normal wake up time in order to essentially arrive at whatever time shift you want we ship put that ours a news letter too where to look share words as i currently wake up at eight a m and then which means my and the we'll say subtract to hours my temperature men in am six a m and i want to travel to whatever it is i kidney australia on this day from this city and then we know the time change and hat i can tell you exactly what to do for couple days have done this m for very military grooves have done this for people and a close friends and who travel lot and i works favilessly well i cannot eliminate jet lag for you do not i wish i could just wet lamina flag i cannot do that but i define can have the time that it takes for you to shift may be more i i i love the kidney show thank you thinks for coming out thanks fore coming to australia thanks for having us i take fish oil but ism not sure ism getting the dose it what your thoughts on fishbowl and dose i have lots of thoughts on fishbowl i think it is a terrific tool i think every time i see a study er an news article saying fishbowl not shown to i giscagashi listen whoeverzri wrote that article i m i take no pleasure in em your on declining hell spender life span but o whatsoever but the rest of us say going to be taken fishbowl a men here is why there is just oh much evidence that getting enough omagathree fadiacis is great for brain health body health and i think that the the issue around fishbowl is typically round contaminate you one may sure that does not have loads of mercury things sardines caused liveroil et camera you can get those from natural sources except there is one problem i hate sardines and i do not want to slip down a bunch of cod fat ism just not interested in that if you eat a lot of fatty ocean fish in it is really clean fish great i do not most people do not i believe in taking a high quality fish oil there lot of different sources of these in fact on the episode that we do with doctor roger trick there is a link in the shown captions i believe that takes you to a chart of the different fish oil sources and there love relative levels of contaminate et camera but most of the reputable brands out there are not going to have any contaminants because they have been cleaned out it is been checked for ah i take the fish oil from a one or for momentous that is just me they're lot of other great sources out there but i will say this that is when ism travelling and i take calls typically i to take it in liquid form and i will take the taken liquid form i have no financial relationship to the to the liquid non capsule forms of fish oil and i get the one that has a lemon flavor to overcome the absolutely disgusting flavor of cod liver oil i guess i not presume cod the taste of cod liver oil but i do not that is what i do ill are a table spoon of that once a day in approaching shake at taste lemon it does not takes cod ant goodness and when i travel i take the capsids from a one o momentous or their excellent ones from other sources ma lots of great sources out there now what are we trying to do when we take fish oil yes it can produce inflammation yes it can do a number of differentials but that is all by way of o ego three fatiacid and take right most people get far too much o mama six right this is why there is a seed oil debate one no can have that debate now we would put us all asleep am frankly the anything is to get enough to mega threes and there hard to get unless you are eating chills unless you are large you know join wail am your ply biting that much chill ah if you are getting fat fish great but when you take an o mama three facias in the form of fish oil ere you sardines for that matter what you are getting essentially is the substrate for a lot of other important building blocks not the least of which is the lipid by layer that surrounds the neurons of you of your of your brain and basically the obegathry fadiasits provide the subtract for some key building blocks of nerve cells and other cells in the brain and body and and this is perhaps the most important reason i can think of when you get out past one gram of the e p a form of omega three get one gram of e p a form of a megathere per a it is clear there is a either mile to moderate anti depressing effect much that one can in some cases talk t your psychiatry s or psychologist partially offset the dosage of any anti depressant i am not telling you to go off into to present medication and go on to fisioil that is not what ism saying i just saying that there is some impressive clinical trials showing that fish oil if taken at dosages of one to three grams of e p a per a can have a mil to modern anti depress in effect and i do not know any one that won't want to have better mood i take one and a half grams of e p which is not to say one and grams official used to look at the package and see how much fishbowl would then look at how much e p a and typically it is less than one gram per servings you may have to take two servings some you'll i was it safe to take two servings i do not see any reason why not a and then of course there is the high potency fishbowls for which there is certainly one gram or more of e p a keep in mind that all the discussion about fishbowl might sound cone to health food hippy store forgive me hippies a health food store kind of stuff but the reality is that e p a high concentration e p is actually a prescription drug in the united states and elsewhere a prescribed often for enhancing mental health and once in party vascular health and on and on we are not out on a limb or out on a fin as it were when having this discussion we are actually just talking about something for which there is a lot of critical evidence there is a lot about chemical evidence there is a lot of mechanisms i take anywhere from one to two grams of e p per a even if the t requires taking six rather than the suggested three capsids per day or taking a full tablespoons even two tablespoons of fish oil and frankly most people are getting too much for make a six fadiacids and not enough to make a three i shout out to the fish oils what is the recommended protocol for measuring hormone levels interesting how frequently do you advise honoring these levels to accurately determine their typical range and i just have to try and pronounce your name volar rest neshenko what a cool name volt jesting ism a big fan of let two syllable foison when i volar regnashenko thank you for this question in the opportunity to the trying pronounce your name hormone levels i think a good thing to do is in the absence of any apparent or suspected indicting dysfunction i sort ti go out you feel pretty good you are wondering if you are good under if i say good under the hood that to sounds we are a rives if you are feeling pretty good i recommend getting your hormone levels checked once if you can if you are still in your teens in your light teens after you have gone through puberty to establish a sort of base line most people will not do that because it is too late i did not do that once in your mid twenties again we are talking about no suspected or apparent endocrine dis function kain you are made twenty's you have a base line something to compare to when you were in your say eighteen to twenty and again whenyou are twenty five that would be ideal and then again i would say when you are thirty and then start once a year starting when you are forty or alder i think that just just logically i would love to know what my hormone levels were when i was twenty five when i was thirty maybe when i was yet when i was eighteen twenty five thirty thirty five and shall thirty f we is when i got my first blood blood draw for just getting a look under the hood what is there what what what are my estrogen levels wore men testosterone levels er my growth home on levels this kind of thing and then once you are forty and older i think once a year minimum and i realize that some people out there against say be that is ridiculous what even do wit that information well you in do a lot with that information you are gin to figure out whether not your dial claustral is in healthy range youregin to figure out whether not your a t is in healthy range you are gin to figure to withe not your ago b is in healthy ranger you are you arguing to figure out a lot more than just whether it your testosterone is four hundred six hundred eight hundred or or twelve hundred and i think we also need to be careful about over interpreting results of hormones because a lot of ask to do with the ratio of testostro an estrogen or the ratio a free testosterone to testosterone both in men and women for instance if you are testostronlevel is nine hundred but your free testosterone level is two well then you have a problem whereas if you are total teststron level is five hundred or six hundred but your free testosterone level is n fifteen well then you probably doing pretty well i would say getting your hormone levels checked once a year after age forty and price that once every three to five years starting in about eight eighteen would be ideal but most people do not do that thereither do not have the disposable income i cerlindon when i was eighteen twenty twenty five and i at that time it was really hard to get that measured unless you had a clinical problem now if any one has a clinical problem that they suspect or is real then obviously more testing i think great sources for enticrane profiling are things inside tracker for disclosure they are response for the pod cast but they do an excellent job they will even come to your house the flambadimus will come to you house if you honor you can go to clinic they make it all very easy but there are other sources as well right ism i'llnever make the mas or anything else about specific companies for for its own sake i just think ins tracked is a great job there are number of clinics merit health and others on mine clinics that will do that but it is part of a more comprehensive package of of agreeing to work with them at least that is how i understand it hope i did not get that wrong but check s now days it is pretty easy to find ways to get your hormones a check but i would am suggest that the fallowing things at least beyond there grothhormon or get on rather get on tesastron estrogen is true for women and men a by the way get one testastron estrogen do not shops destroy dial on there free testastron diadrotestastron courts all keep in my morning coatis all always elevated relative t afternoon court is all am it will be impacted by food you want to going fasted in the morning a my deal get this done early your great mean levels which by the way will be elevated if you are taking creating oar your exercising hard your doctrines are your creating levels are elevating you say will great will my creating and take his elevated too am take that am it is not in to be a problem necessarily do check with your doctor a radio claustral ago b and a the pay a few others hat that would be good am yo having there for a men and women sexhormo dining globular we at es h b g and for women especially progesterone and pro lactone am and porch and any of the progestins are going t be important and of course for women the trick is going to be wen you get your blood taken with respect to your hormone cycle your ovulate try cycle an to try to make that at least consistent from test to test not necessarily having to go in both during the vehicular and the audial phase of your cycle but always going in during you omidfelicular amidludil and and that can be challenging to do perhaps but that is going to be important because of course those are widely fuck fluctuating levels across across the cycle but am unless you are really oblast with your a homo levels amend and analyzing them taking them at until times throughout your menstrual cycle probably not necessary unless your sorry to think about conceiving or there is some issue am piso as for other issue one i find that i need you angst yore after working out any thoughts on this am yes well farewell glad your using an stars your control known to replenishment mental and physical vigor works o well i think it is great i think it probably is accelerating your recovery i think this tells me you are probably working out really hard am and hopefully not too long if you find that you work out in the morning and then you are really really sleepy in the afternoon and the next day you might be working out too long or too hard may we ratchet back the intensity old bit or the duration it is amazing how great we can feel when we work out to eighty to ninety per cent of our maximum out put am in duration we did the the other day you knowhow know we we went out for a jog rebounding skipping ah jumping jack thing and stopped it eighty to ninety per cent of maximum and ten went about the rest of the day and evening feeling great if you do this consistently you will find you have more energy and there is a actual lot of solid physiology and physics to support why that is as suppose to if you go to the him an you do every set to failure or even every exercise you include one set to failureand you are grinding out for straps or you are i do not know kind of exercise your doing you you are running more and more distance each day or with more intensity you it it is understandable how one gets kind of indrawn to a addicted to that burn or the effort but keep in mind that is stress you are you are stressing the body to produce a certain kind of adaptation either endurance or strength or hypertrophy or et center adaptation there is there is real beauty and learning to love working out hard but to leaving the him or ending the run with ten to twenty per cent of the gas in the tank and knowing that you can come back can do more and you of she can want to do more there is that it increase is vigor is supposed to taking yourself over that cliff even a slight ten to twenty percent and then finding that our you are kind of to pleated and this is something that we do not hear enough about because we ah most people there into fitness are into pushing themselves it is also true for work i think some of the best advice i ever got in the professional landscape was when i was a graduate student that you see burley and excellent neurologist by the name of tonight said the key is to figure out how much can you work each day consistently if that is four hours a day fine if that is eight hours a day fine we are talking with week breaks cause that was in the year of wee can breaks maybe a week end every one while where you have a dead line but by thinking about what you personally can really do consistently while maintaining sleep and mental health and physical health you are going to go a lot further then doing for instance what i did which is maniac and working hundred hour weeks as a graduate student than an uptick four times a year and missing out on a bunch of days when i could have been in lave these days i trying get as much focused work on as possible but trying make that as consistent as possible if not from every day to the next over time figure out with those averages are and do not be ashamed of those averages i was say declare those averages to people they know it to expect and the fact that you can do more does not necessarily mean that you should do more because i think one of the best apiece of advice i ever got in the world of fitness is more important than training hard more important than doing any particular exercises more import than anything is to not get hurt because if you get hurt you cannot train i love thatyou are doing nest you are after training i love that you are am making that part o your practice but maybe also throttle back a little bit cause you said i have to do t after training maybe throttle back low bit on the duration or intense of exercise and see how you feel what can we do to optimize the function of our gutbrain access that is very simple get enough sleep in addition to that avoid excessive in take avantobiotics but if your doctor prescribes them take them i maybelever an antibiotics o he before the intonate jumps on me ism not ant i by ism not anti antibiotic i always want to say that ism not anti antibiotic i am not pro antibiotic but i am pro robotics ism robotic i a think you should in just wonderful servings of sugar tormented foods pray sarocrat kimchi dato or keeper or otherwise whatever you in fits with your nutrition preferences in plan i think it is also very important that you do not overuse antiseptics canteceptic mouthwashes and handransas and all it stuff this was all discussed on a pokes episode i did with doctor just in soninberg on the youverin kapok's which is just to say that just in who a professor at stamford an is amazing even said that he lets his kids eat lunch when they have been playing outside without washing their hands before eating lunch because he wants the robotic make up of they are got to be diverse including from outside now ism presuming that is not a public park of assuming its their yards who are not talking about ism grow stuffing on their hands retuning about a little dirt here and there turns out owning a pet increases the diversity of your microfilm ism lots of things that i you do not want to go round licking people's pets can to let them lick you depending ism on what your preferences are but do not lick them but when you interact with people you shake their hands or pets your you are increasing the diversity of your microfilm when you eat lowsugar tormented foods you want to make sure also you get enough fiber both robotic and robotic fibers of fruits and vegetables i the fiber debate to for me just makes me roll my eyes i it is clear that fiber is good for us forget motility and for offsetting cancers of the got i may i realize they're the people out there who are really into elimination diets where they just only e me but man there is just much good data on fiber ism especially from fibrous vegetables it just seems a or yes ism i ma not is almost silly that we have the debate frankly but ism sure soon out there whose pure carnivore will be ism shouting but guess what you are shouting and you are constipated last question regarding the subject on tongue cleaning from the oral health hap episode can you please share a bit on brushing tongue scraping tongue and generally how best to clean the tongue tongue cleaning came up on the or health episode i talk to four different dentists and a paridantists in preparation for that episode almost all of them remarkably extraordinarily converged on the same advice except for some slight deviations around frequency of flossy stand of cool my a field where almost everybody seems to agree i realize that is not the hugest sample size but i pick them from diverse locations backgrounds trainings et camera every one of them said brush and foster teeth every one of them said antiseptic it'll call base mouthwashes are bad and every single one of them said that brushingyour teeth before sleep is e specially important because at now you produce less alive when you want to be able to demineralize your teeth that is plan cavities that are staring to form while you sleep brush your teeth floats ideally as well before sleep at least brush and of course in the morning too for everyone is sake but if we are talking about tongue brushing and scraping it was clear that the tongue scraping was advised if tongue correctly oka because there are certain backchery that grow on the tongue that you do not want there and that scraping can help with the turn over of healthy bacteria there in addition of removing some of the bad bacteria but that most people scrape their tongue too hard and rather it would be wise to brush your tongue gently with the soft tooth brush d by the way you should also use a softbrush for your teeth but not the same one that you use for tongue brushing the take away that i was told and makes lost sense to me base on what i know know about the biology physiology and care of the mouth is that you want to use a different soft tooth brush to brush your tongue then the soft brush that you use to brush your teeth and that you do not need to use anything on it but if you want to put a little bit of salt and baking soda that is perfectly fine a lot of you'll wonder whether not baking soda scrapes the enamel off the teeth it anally is low on the abrasion scale dentist have believe it or not an brain scale with a list of things of how much enamel it scrapes off at a given pressure dentist have done their work it is really really cool i cannot say always liked dentist i did not going the dentist they away seem nice people but now i have newfound respect for dentist they really care about their craft and or health has been on a push to the back see of the different aspects of health i consider it one of the major pillars of bent health and physical earth because taking care of your teeth your gums your mouth going your oral microbus it is critical for party of muscular health it is critical for brain health one of the bad bacteria stripped focus am you tans that can proliferate in the mouth especially after sugary eating sugary foods om can make it through the blood brain barrier and maybe it is thought o one the causes of dimension can disrupt your neurons your brain about is a system everything's talking everything else and yet brush your tongue but use a separate soft brush to do that and replace it every few weeks to months i that can i suppose get expensive but probably notes expensive as o some of the other health issues hat or just described appreciate that question ah we did not talk about oil pulling on the pod castle if you wildest about that and you will to swish oil men spitted out as a weight that is oil pulling i for oil health ad all the dentist i spoke to said e not big fans of oil pulling but none of them said it would be particularly bad but i a if you enjoy it or you think it works for you great but ism none of them really pointed to any clear evidence that was going to be beneficial i was told that was the last question and we are coming up on the hour a gan i want a thank everybody for joining this a m eh ism doing this from australia kidney australia what is interesting down here is because we are below the equator everything is reversed right this was actually shut it is been presented you ups i was ism actually upside down but they turn the camera i would appear right side up to you i also when ism down here i drink my age yo one normally i swish it counter clockwise by nose here flexibly on swishing at clock wise an my lots of interesting stuff going on we will talk about how that all works it is not through the vestibularcular reflex it turns out but may be on a future episode of the podcast about the relationship between i location relative to the equator and nerd functioning and ism just kitting but what ism not kitting about as they appreciate the tuned in and alas but certainly not least thank you for your interest in scene s

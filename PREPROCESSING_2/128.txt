next weeks first presumably trumpets go pe debate am benshpirtis is the bencher so themes beer show sponsor by express v in privacy is a right not a privileged to fendyorights at express apian ti calm freshmen isolate yesterday afternoon the house oversee committee released a bombshell letter to the activist of the united states the national arrives and records administration asking for all records and meals related to a particular meal address this is not the official meal dress the hoiden use when he is vice president of the united states instead this is a secret meal dress the healegirdly used when his vice president of the united states now we have known about a series of names that were found in hundrbiden's con laptop from hell since two thousand twenty one those names included one called rath l robot l peters robot el peters turns out is a pudendum the committee has now identified ask then vice president widen first of all the pendent an reality territory when we have official members of the federal government for using turned give meal addresses sudonamus meal dresses in order to meal about actual political goings on we saw that hilericlin had a private meal server there's been other people who in the passive had private meal addresses and if those private em addresses are dealing with no private business that is one thing but if they are dealing with outside business activities and this is being used the sort of a chines firewall in order to screen those outside business activities from any sort of discovery that is a real problem to the house oversitecomittee writes the committee on oversihtan accountability's in investigating president en bisons meetings and communications with certain family members and their business associates during his tenyuars vice pressor the national argots and records ad ministration has published the bidet vice presidential records election which contains information relevant to the committees work many of these records havebeen reactive for publication pursuant to the presidential records act and fora to further or investigation and is essential the committed review these documents in their original format the

which have been published on narcs wepsiht these records hae been reactive for public release pursuant to p r a and fora also they want all of the sudonimous meals buts tach this meal made available on the narrow aside as e document that indicates and nine a m onslitswi twenty seven to thousand sixteen vice president baton took recall at the presidents of ran pentroporshenko it is concerning to the committee however that this document was send to robot l peters a pudendum the committee has identified as then vice president widen additionally the coatee questions whether thanvice president son hunter bid and only under widen was copied on this meal to then vice president widen there now saying that hoiden was using a false meal address in order to meal his son about a can the he had just had with the then ahead of u crane this is a pretty dick stuff for jobidon and again jobidon has long been a deeply corrupt man bine in jobidon his corruption goes all thewy back to his first senate race their serious allegations that his first senate race people related to the bison campaign worked alongside members of local union to prevent for example the dissemination of a newspaper that contained in insert for his republican opponent that the union was basically told to create a a picket line said the newspaper did not go out that day thus boosting jobidon to his first senatorial victory in delftware and then from then on it is been unbroken series of scandals involving jobidon and family members and money from family members who are absolutely on credit worthy receiving money from banks who absolute should not a been lending the money because they knew that jobidon was the senator from delftware to his sons receiving jobs they certainly should not have had two hunter bison running around in foreign precincts picking up bad of cash under the bison name but jobidon has always hit behind the sort of plausible deniability i was never directly involve that was not involved in any way shipper form and its been perfectly obvious to everybody t he was deeply involved in every way shape form after all how does a man who earned approximately two hundred thousand dollars a year for literally his entire career in the senate end up being fifteen million dollar mansions how does that happen how dos he end up with these giant houses how is a the money flowing how does hunter bison one of the most juralictes human beings ever to walk the earth clear millions and millions and millions of dollars over the course of the last decade for being a complete near dowel how does his brother names clear butcher money how is rote frank clear a butcher money how are all these people mow exorbitantly wealthy how does that happen muss jobidon is actively interested in them doing really well by using his name and he knows that there using his name in order to traffic he knows that but this would be the first evidence that jobidon was directly involved as in writing memos out we have a lot of indirect evidence the join was directly involved we have a lot of indirect evidence ranging from actual testimony from police govern archer that hunter bison was having job's stop by business meetings or that hunter would act would call up job on the phone and ice took not the weather and then they would get off the phone in front for the people we we have testimony from tony bobylensky that job would stop by various business functions we have pictures of job with various business dignitaries that hunter was cultivating at we have all of those things but this would be actual communications two hunter widen about the business which would be the first that we have actively seen at this point in riding be fascinating to see what actually a rives your and also how the white house as brush of the sop because what the white house will say is that we have no ideal at this is what aether even talking about were now obligation to turn over those heals how you know there even about petroporroshankl ho do youknow what those are about this are private meals and now we are back into the killer clinic hidden e headdress what is it what aether talking bout arena and that is him pretty dick stuff obviously for jobidon ajobidon's campaign is a very went campaign this is why he continue s to run away from reporters this is the constant pattern over and over and over again yesterday for example he was yester about his how trip and that is a pretty easy question were going to why he runs away from the question here he was get by catchy later and then them we to people ask him questions and he continued to ignore the reporters again the city pattern with jobiton jobiton's pattern is i will not answer any questions on any topic off really interest to the america people because i do not need to because it least ism not a re publican at least ism not a re publican only works if re publicans continued run candidates forbad if candidates run who actually are not bad at least ism not a re publican does not have quite the same sort of a bite and at least ism not a republican for a feria trip corrupt see my old man is really a bad campaign here is join yesterday running away from the pressor at least hobbling away from the rest her to watch em honest honest to got every som a each o clip of cotton ye you wondering for watching

yo prospecting i protean weetsmuck is yet a anyway he is right but can comma arris the very back bandit democrats are stuck which brings us to the states of the republican party i have a question what is your plan to win what is your plan to win you have a corrupt elderly man who's not capable of fulfilling his office and when he is capable it is even worse it'd rather have him being seen o watching outlook in the basement then having him do the sort of damage he does to the country when he occasionally is awoken by authorizing shot or something republicans have an opportunity to get rid of this guise to you note they should do maybe thy should run a candidate who could win i do not know it is soundslike a crazy idea i know it sounds not maybe they should focus last an personality and a emotional response two particular candidates and maybe thy should focus on who could be the president of the united states and make trobidi nobby the president of the united states it is up there is very interesting piece of data then is coming down from at nation they come to some really cod date and apsis at the near times even they'd at the mercies naconsday an apsis s good i and om he breaks down the republican party in to mentally six pieces first is the socially moderate establishment highly educated fallen socially moderate or even liberal outright never trump very often the be fourteen per cent the moderate establishment would be people who support say chis christy four example maybe nick hale at the edge rig theylyc did they can have left doing o the republican party they the as hutchenson wing then there is the traditional conservatives twenty six per cent old fashioned economic and social conservatives to pose abortion and prefer corporate tax cuts to new terrify then a love mister trump but they doe supporting rates there is be made it never can maybe trumpets then love got the right wing that is twenty six per cent they watch fox news in newsman they are very conservative tear disproportional evangelical they believe america on the brink of catastrophe and they love trump more than any other group that is twenty six per cent the blue color populace that is twelve per cent they are mostly northern socially moderate economic populace who hold deeply conservative news on race and emigration not only do they back mister trump he himself nobly counted as one a debate ago that is twelve per cent the blue color populace o they be lady basis crowd the libertarian conservativestese are fourteen per cent these dis proportionally western and midwestern conservatives value small government there relatively socially moderate and isolationist and there on the lower end of trump support comparedwth other groups in n there is the new comers eight per cent they don't look republicans their young divers and moderate but these disaffecting voters democrats and the woke left even less o case if you nut break this town whee you would figure is that trump has about thirty eight per ends of the republican vote absolutely locked up it is a tat means almost forty per cent of the republican party is basically locked up what he says that the alliance between blue color populace and the right wing has left mister trumps potential o potent opposition in disarray the fore trump the party's main stream prevailed against within candidates by uniting traditional conservatives and the moderate factions both establishment and blue color that blue pain for victory appears to be closed at least for now without a natural factional base onto cantus is struggle to maintain a steady footholds in the race in fact trump leads to santusamong every group of republican voters identified in the analysis the rest of the party beyond trumps pase may not always back trumps policies butts not necessarily anti trump the closest thing to an anti trump group the party the moderaistablishment has become alienated from the rest of the party yow again that break down breaks very much in favor of president trump what exactly does that mean for any one who wishes to challenge president trump hell it seems to me that if you are a if you are a candidate who wishes to challenge president trump there is really only two bases to do one is that president trump as president did not do enough that president trump as president his record the first three years was great but in the last year he for fellopart and also yo because of that he did not win the last election that is point number one and there is lot of truth to that the last year of jump of of don trumps residence he was not good his is handling of covet was not good is handling of the race riots of twenty twenty was not good all of that can be trump and then there is the second point this s the really more telling one which is donate trump does not have an excellent shot at beating jobidon the polling that we are seeing right now that i showing him competitive with jordan very often is incredibly incredibly bias pulling yere'sthat the is a plicae out yesterday for example that showed the he and jobidon were effectively tied in the race it there is only one problem it that pole it shows jobideon winning minority voters by plus twelve jobinan is not going to in minority voters by plus twelves an when minority voters by thirty thirty to forty points because this for democrats always win by there is been some movement at the edges but not to the tune of twenty five to thirty per cent this a notion that trump is got to only lose by twelve points among my norite voters broad red black has panic an avion voters his totally while but those poles are floating trumpright now because again if the electability argument is the chief argument than the poles that show that trump is still electable against jobidon are really really helping him obviously and that is about jobidon's weakness but people need to ask themselves to this point what is trump on run is campaign on going forward this not about to mantis this now about trump you onto make the campaign about trump than the campaigns but trump can trump win should be the argument the republicans are having and you can see already that the argument is shifting from can trump wind inside the republican party to what is the campaign even design to do and that is a serious probmill get it that in

people should just drop out the ration handed to him great house just out leading by forty fifty at even sixty points who expected that i did i no capture south caroling all very strong but also ready biding very big the sanctdemodiusis crashing perhaps the party should come together people should drop out of the race we unify and we beat biding and the democrats my should be easy to be because our country is never been in worse condition that it is right now thank you o gain notice of t very very in he drops in the badman stuff but really what this races about is sort of his personal revenge on the rest of republican party by the way he dona true as always feel slighted by a wide variety of people and that is pretty much everybody he hired by the way a a dona trump over the last forty eight hours cancel the crack an again as you remember that he promise that on money who is gin to have a press conference were he spelled out all the ways that he was cheated of the election in georgia well now he is canceled it he put out a a truth sand quit rather than releasing the report on the ridden stolen tore of twenty twenty presidential election on money my lawyers would prefer putting this i believe irrefutable and overwhelming evidence of election froughtin irregularities and formal legal filings as we fight to dismiss this disgraceful indictment by publicity and campaign final seeking d eh we sadly presides over a reckon breaking murder and violent primary at manta therefore the news conference is no longer necessary what actually happens his lawyer said to him donate we do not trust that your noon a go in front of the pass and then say bunch of stuff that can t it you in further trouble for for example suborning costs or obstruct tang or or tampering with witness is or it ever and we need you to canella an for true afturly listen to his lawyers for once in his life which a good thing by the way and he cancel the press conference but is this campaign really onto be about your bite orbs giving about all this sort of stuff bill bar yesterday his former attorney get remember job the this was donate trumps a turn general o a he picked him bill bar was on fox news and bill bar suggested the donate trump could the practically be in jail by the time the primaries even clothes in may of next year an tum and donate trump then put out a truth saying just found this clip of bill bar prior to him scamming to impeachment an other threats of the radical left lunatics his bravado change rapidly because he did not want to be impeached republican's have to be much trugferancesmarter or you will not have a party or a country left bar did not have the courage or stamina to fight but he knew what was happening i canned him and felt really good about it now he goes all over the place especially fox pretending he is a tough guy what is this campagngonto be folks what is this campaign going to be y have an idea of what this campaign is going to be and that idea comes courtesy of match lap o match slap is the up chare of s pack and he put out a sweet yesterday just call another radiohost he turbit out somebody explain is om l content years old how does t anyone dropping out help trump stout of prison please be pacific if everyone drops out what do we do when the commingtits in michigan an pensylvania keep him off the general election ballet and schlep says quote the sooner we unify behind nominee the sooner we can use resources to fund the defenses of everyone in died for being a trump re publican the to be come about a bigger principal in just one man now you may thing that the election of twenty twenty four is about you no get rid of jobidon but according to mat and i as some according to much of team trump what it's really about is you funding donate trumpslegal bills nelson have got a sympathy for the fact that trump is being victimized by the legal establishment have made that incredibly clear over the course of the see last several months i think the case in manhaddon is b s overt b s i think that the canary six case being brought by blacksmith in d c is a discharge i thin the case being brought by fanny wills this ego case is in over charge and is a is use of recon likely because she does not naturally have a criminal enterprise and i think that the class i document's case mite be a good legal case but also is obviated by the fact that the didn't proscutiller clean for pitting much these actsinthing with all of that sad why should twenty twenty four be about litigation as opposed to you no elections i do not understand my interest as an america citizen is primarily in jo bi hoping president of the united states running of the do j mesmeric garland that is predominantly my interest i certainly have an interest in donate trump fighting his legal battles that that is fine is that my primary interest as an america citizen who base taxes is epic the thing i care about the most if i have to prioritize it dona trumps legal cases or is i beating jobidon if it dona trumps legal cases that is fine the dude's got a legal fun is not asked anybody to do not ate to his legal fun in stead he sort of wandering the money from his campaign into his legal fun he we money to his campaign than h uses it for his legal cost is that wire do not getting is because he care that much about is legal u fine he should open a legal fun you can give to it or do you care about beating jobidon donate trump could the oraticaly when all his legal cases it and still not be jobidon i do not understand the prioritization and i do not understand what the campaign's plan is here fillet to more on this momentarily first everyone knows i love that help is mattress but did that just launch their newest most high and collection he licks lets hell's has hon list years of extensive mattress expertise to bring their customers are truly elevated sleep experience the helps i my collection includes six different mattress morals each tailor for specific sleep positions and from ness preferences have had my heroics matters for seven eight years this point it is fantastic it is the thing that blows me to stay alive given my lack of sleep nervous about buying a mattress on line don't have to be he like has a sleep quit i matters your bodytype and sleep preferences to the perfect mattress he's woe your buy a matters made for somebody else i took that he looks quit as match or the firm but breathable mattress it is great again it's the thing that that basically allows me to have any level of energy what soever on the fact that my energy is being taken up by four young children plus dog go to heck sleep got come freshmen take their two minute keep quod find the perfect matters for a body and sleep type your mattreswill come rights your worship for free plus he looks has a ten your warrant e can try it out for a hundred nights rest free though even pick it up for you if he do not of it but you will for lemmatime he like his offering up to twenty per cents off all mattressorters plus two free pills for elisenerss is their best i forget hurry on over to he like sleep got tom slash ben with clicks better sleep starts right this moment all right when i look at the pulling data what i see is that the america people not the publican maze the america people ore not particularly interested in donate trumps legal troubles as the point of referendum the the notion that what this campaign should artily be is about funding donate trump's legal troubles by the way it is not clear that he is funding anybody else is legal troubles he is got a bunch of lawyers who are very loyal to him and the minute that they said that they are not in favor of him being the nominee apparently he is cot them off that include gene ell's a genesis is out their basically asking for donations to her legal fun nurse people to give to gene elks is legal fun by the way but genesis is now in person because she is not sufficiently sick o frantic to trump personally is this a way to run at campaign i gain ism just asking yo you get trumpsipport he can love the guy in hin ours a great precedent in every aspect that's all finethats old dandy you can say that if he is the nominee love for him if he is anomnelvod for him but that is not the question the question is if he is the hominy what is this campaign likely to be about are you there too fun donate trumps legal troubles or are you there to beat job bison the are not synonymous donate trump is trying to bind the two into one but ism just wondering what the evidence is that this is going to work i do not understands i do not understand why people thing that donate trump's legal troubles our somehow a boon to him in a general election ism asking for one piece evidence ism master asking for a piece of strategy donate trump is can be stacked up to was with legal cases he is to one coming in canary he is got one coming maybe in february he is got one coming in march and the hes got another one coming in may that is four legal cases in the first five months of the year what do you think he is going to be talking bat you eve me takeout jo bisons inflation that is absolutely uninteresting to dona trump on a personal level he is deeply uninterested in jo bison politically speaking he does not care about him he is a personal animus for jobidon in animus that i think should be widely share is jobideng is he deeply corrupt human being but is that the case that you are going to make in order to in order to in i i i do not understand it i truly do not hey this might be a topic hate o bate but u but dona trumpsingin ta trumpfor to mate ' dona trump yesterday he put out a statement a couple of them one blasting fox news suggesting that fox news was being unkind to him he cause ism he was apparently you not going trump for the bate andyuasays why does not fox an fun show all of the poles where ism beating bine by lot well because the poles where you repeating join by lot a by a lot do not exist that is why en sorry to break its everybody those poles do not exist ism in to read you the last several poles in the real clear politics pulling average it is all the poles since jury twenty third youready to forty three forty three began plus one began plus one began plus one bison plus one bine plus three the poles where dona trump is leaving by lot do not exist unless you are looking at cats or pules one's witter ism sorry they do not that does not mean that trump could not be the critically competitive with hoiden although have serious doubts given the fact that dona trump does not our pass in any pole literally any pole he does not surpass forty six per cents he is not going to win the election with less than forty six per cents and even at forty six percent he got a grate on by as can be real cloths show me the bath the is oral trump lines fifty per cent of the boat show men that doings forty eight per cento not it'd love to see it the would make his campaign much more durable to me because what i care about is beating hoiden by the way total trump one other question no thank god i make a very nice living give god forbid i have legal troubles y will pay for those legal troubles using the nice living that i have made dona trump is eons wealthier than i am his has a multiple of wealth that i do dona trump is supposedly one of the richer people on plan an earth according to dona trump he is worth up to ten billycan dollars why is he using his campaign fun to fun his legal problems is a serious question why i mean should he be using him to beat hoiden forget about the idea that his his own supporters are are really hoping he will use the funding not for his legal funding but for everything else is not there a tacit admission there that either he is not worth as much money as he says he is or that he would rather used your money to fun his legal bills an his own money to fun is legal bills that why is his mut why is his money not being used for his own legal probes and for the legal promise of his allies by the way in speaking of his campaign mean there's an incredible story from politico today okay this is story talking about for lumber for lumber is apparently very opsetimen because i mentioned it that she is a kind of a crazy person and the dona trump is allied with her she is kind of a crazy person dona trump is allied with her that is just what that is what it is in any case according to politico on chili cowboy who is a far left twitter attic he has teemed up now with lord lumber and people of ciliated with dona trumps campaign to a tack ronasantis just to get this straight the way that works in publican party politics if you save one bad word about dona trump and you are another republican candidate republicans are angry at you if don trumps campaign teems up with on chili cowboy to attack onto cantus that is good apparently apparently according to politico chili kooky see i probably the top anted to wantad person on twist on twitter rivals have something anted t cantus that one t get into the main stream they'll send it to me the trump campaign declined to comment and whether they are to coordinating with a far left is on chilli cowboy to attack to cantus which my thewy does not seem really good conservative strategy it does not it seems to me that if you do not want a circular firing squad that would apply to every one in the in the firing squad for lumber said that they speak occasionally quote he knows ism a trump loyalist and i know he does a trump and despite our differences we have found common ground on making sure onto santusis never elected precedents of the united states ever never to cantus is a thing apparently that that is strong stuff right there strong stuff rooftop cowboy teeming up with the lour lumber to attack on decent doesthis sound a way to be trust just a question by the way the wants as now been target by more negative expenditures than both widen and trump combined a quarter of all independent expenditures in the twenty twenty four election cycle according to washington examiner twenty million dollars have targeted to cantus trump was it wit just eight million dollars of negative independent expenditures directed toward him bison was attacked of nine million dollars independent expenditures pretty much everybody is attacking to cantus at this point and nobody is attacking trump weird weird you know west nobody's attacking is of course the take romasuamin isn't ism friends with the face and makes release mark also the face spends every waking women not attacking the front runner of his own party not mentioning anything bout is political differences withe front runner his own party the face is a clever guy i will also note that the poling data with regard to the take is a little but bifurcated the alpine poles show at eight nine ten per cents and then the actual phone poles the ones that are a little but more reliable than on mine poles have to that is a pretty wig gap and the press or of course trumping on the idea thou vac surging into mantis fling here is the reality of the race the races absolutely stagnant is been stagnant for three to four months again if i look at those real her politics polling averages ism looking at them right this very instant what you see is that de cantus has de lined about son some one between three and four percent over the course of the last idanow eight months if you look at the poling in october of twenty twenty two it showed trump at fifty three and cantus at nineteen to day in the real clapollin average it shows the trump at fifty five and cantus hat fifteen that is not exactly a poling collapse tenace has been surging to eleven per cent and the mantis even in that fox newspole that is the open by the way the fox news poles the only resinpole that shoran actual of the take search that is not n online only pole that post there is moreen consulpollish was man nide both of those poles also show to cantus at sixteen per cent which means that he is basically when he is been f r the last several months this race is not change very much re's will ben movement at the bottom of the race not a lot of movement in the rest of the race what is that mean means going into the debate i would a soon that all the attacks are going to be on to cantus i that that is that is basically the way that is going to go a eff row who outruns one of the descant superpats he he then there is one of things that the superpack some times do to avoid legal complications with to coordinating with campaigns they are not allowed to do sometimes in dark corners of theintrn at the post things hoping that the campaign sees it and then implements apparently memo has now gone out from eff row it debate advise for do cantus for next week trump is are that he is not debating in fact he is in accounted program the debate ism going to see amen trump is a is going to do some sort of event with tucker carbon it sounds he is a floating that he is skipping it but the in got my the grandees absolutely cutlass see mate of supergutless because what is the araks he doing here the ran see is to coordinating with trumps surrogates to represent him in the spin room apparently that means that they will allow carry lake barons onwards and mad gats as well as the republicans in congress where trump supporters openly to at tend that debate next week and then rand then basically critique to debate in the spin room that is while that is while ism say if your man does not show up you should not be in the spin room that is the tanto sang ism not on to show up but i em gin a and christie shaw over to the debate room to critics all the other candidates that is that is an absurdity it really is one of these other candidates could rise but ism wondering how and am wondering at what going the republicans are going to say it might be worth while to examined some other options at this point just in case busting case anyway the a jeffro memo about waste cantus needs to do is quote take a sledge hammer to the age romasuammy the political new comprising the pulse he should defend donate true am wen when fritz crispy inevitably attacks the porn president and needs to attack jo lion an the media no less than three to five times now again one campaigns are having trouble very often t feels the just stumbling on landmine after landmine when a campaign is having trouble and basis campaign is experiencing trouble to launch for shore when you see this what you see is stuff this leeks in the pass about debate strategy now is that a terrible strategy ism ism not sure that the irate a terrible strategy but the fact that it is now being revealed publicly and and being treated as top lie news is part of the on going media narrative which is that the mantis is getting hammered by true here is the reality the media have a common interest in insuring tat trump gets the nomination because they believe rightly or wrongly that donate trump getting the binational loos mobile that is what they want more than anything else and if republicans believe that that is not the case and the nominate trump maybe he will be right and maybe the be wrong but if they are right i would to see the date thatheyare right and out to see the plan that trump plans to implements to avoid what happened last nit i still one question and one question only guides if donate trump is the nominee and he thinks that the last selection was stolen from him after he wanted bi big numbers according to him right he one huge what is his plan to stop that from happening again does it exist what would it be it seems to me the right now the r publican party is in its own referendum do we care more about dona trump personally or do we care more about beating jobidon now maybe you think that two are not in conflict andthat is a nice easy answer but if the two are in conflicts which one do you prioritize as a voter is serious question for everyone because the dato show that the two right now are in conflict in pretend the data away we can assign the date do not exist that is fine but just as ha hypothetical humor me if the burin conflict beating jobidon or personal wove for donate trump which

to disaster obviously a major major disaster but one of thighs been hearing from medias that is all about club warming it is not to glubwarming it is about as always human failure according to cliff mass who is a a professor at the universal of washington atmospheric sciences how fires are not connected to climate change he told my friend mason ran over on it t h he said i no he they have nothing to do with climate change zero he says there ware due to a commination of dry and invasive grass an powerful wind that accelerated the spread of the fire not climate change he says this an aerial of extensive grass the grass more bountiful the normal because there is not a lot because there was a lot of precipitation over the winter road a lot of grass lo that grass is not natural grass one's evasive stuff brought over in last century they'd an extraordinarily strongwindstorm it really had nothing to do with the anything except for that the winter am likely to stroud a power line cretingspark that united the grass the only thin that had been done is to warn the locals and this is where the failure kicked in apparently according to the lalstrjournal during the twenty nineteen wild thirteen in one of the worst male had ever seen woman electric pollute concluded it needed to do far more to prevent its power lines from sitting sparks the utility examined californium's plans reduce fires ignited by powerlines starter lines runs over its territory and vowed to take steps to protect its equipment and its customers from the throat fire nearly four years later the company as completed little such work between twenty nineteen and twenty twenty two it invested less than two hundred forty five thousand dollars on wildfire specific projects on the island regulatory filing show it did not seek state approval to raise rates to pay for broad wildfire safety improvements until twenty twenty to and has gets receive it the blaze as cost at least a hundred and ten deaths destroy china and resulted in estimated billions of dollars in damage join electric said it would investigate any rollitsin for structure may have played and coordinate with the spare probe ins the fire launch last week by hay attorney general there is also reports that the there that a island alarm went off which is completely useless once again human failure generally to blame for massive natural disasters in the same way that faulty building in new organs led to the full scale disaster that's result for can carina away time for some things i and then some things that i ate things that i to day i am amuse that californium is till talking bout one point to million dollars for reparations payouts in the take of californium as you will know californium was never slavesday the matter californium is still tog my reparations and now they are saying that they m they have the math combine recommendation reparations could total more than one point two million dollars per person they are saying health harms come out to thirteen thousand six hundred dollars t annually which the nine hundred sixty seven thousand dollar maximum of for seventy one years housing discrimination thirty four hundred dollars for each year which is a hundred forty nine thousand dollar maximum and mass in incarceration and over policing which amounts to some one committed crime lets jail twenty four hundred dollars per year over forty course years they are trying to put a price tag on difference is in life expectancy from eighteen fifty to present and then pay people for this and what there coming up with is one point to million dollars for person now it is californa hae the money for that of course californium is not have the money for that also e how exactly are they going to distribute that money what happens to people who have mixed race parentage but who pays whom at tenon's care benny this is all for show than nevergnan to any of this but it is amusing to watch californium push found with this sort of stuff presumably by increasing the taxburden on people who are wealthy which is driving people from the state congratulations californium once again on pursuing crappy polls o a time for some things at that i hate coring to bright bar my come a study of open a is at chat b t conducted by researchers at the university of east ganglia in the up shows the market leading a i chap has a clear bias for left its political paries now we knew this for fact men yo can see are you to video that we did where i have discussions with catch p t and where it will right glowing poems about you bit and then it will refuse to write any thing auditory about donnaltrump i the there obviously parameters than placed on these chariots on these a is that make them more left leaning without a doubt the study publish in the journal public choice shows catch p t under its defaults settings favors democrats in the united states the labor party in the u ka and present lucid soda of the workers party in brazil researchers asked at catch p t to i personates to porters of various political parties and positions and then ask the modify chariots a series of sixty ideological questions the responses to the questions were then compared two catch p ts at fault answers this allowed the researchers to task t weather catch p it's default response is favor particular political stances is it to overcome difficulties caused by inherent randomness of the large language models each question as asked a hundred times at different responses were collected what they found is that of course there was serious political by us to a i that of course is not a shocker at all as we said you you go to chance p t it hinting and tried out my producer is because this is

entire musical about how i realized thati've ben wrong abut my politics forever that is according to the a i the title is the righteous mind a ben shul per musical the show opens with benshoper in his conservative political common take or person addressing a crowd of supporters he sings about the important of individualism the dangers of collectivism and the need for personal responsibility as the

his private self i a ism first of all off the rail's immediately immediately me just tell you there is no difficulty balancing my family life with my professional life that am i queer wear just i in georgia for a small family vacation and as my producers will tell you and everyone else of they are part ism literally carrying round my heads all the literally physically carrying ramickheads all the time yap good job a i a too the second act opens of the dramatic showdown between ben and a liberal counterpart debating the roll of government in society the two characters engage in a fiery duet each defending the respective positions as the shown yours it is conclusion ben begins to question his own beliefs and principals thank you a i he sings a sol searching solo about the importance of empathy and understanding and how these qualities can be reconciled with his concerned about first of all it is the left that has no empathy and no understanding it is the left that truly believes that instead of actually taking care of people on a personal level you would just give the money and other people's money at that it is the least empathetic position hay look up or person should i

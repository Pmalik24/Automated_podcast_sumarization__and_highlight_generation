that making can china is threatening some very basic things about the city and their lives but far the coverage here it are show we for we were not seeing many stories the we got to know anybody very well we they were what exact could they expect it was going to come out of the protest given china an chansgense three of us arrived in hong long in in september me an manual an o to work or dial will have to say one of things that was fascinating giving the ugly state of democracy hearing the united states lately was to be among many young people who believe intensity in democratic ideals and yearned deeply for the basics bike normal elections free speech and free assembly though just in he last three weeks since we got to hong long we have watch the situation changed dramatically it is gotten much more violent harshness measures by the government this hour we have the story of the change that we witness what we think it might mean if you have not been following the story at all may be been setting this one out work in a catch you up on what you need to know we have all sorts of people from all sides of this that we want you to meet e b easy chico it is this america life this wee over sees with a lot of people who have some very america values stay with us a on the curse generation a case o what politicized thousands thousands people this much that the have dropped their normal lives and the coming out every single week in to protest it is now been eighteen straight weeks take gender for instance she somebody worked at abercronbian fitch during college show me in the bust of protest that is why r english is good somebody wanted to be a singer i should got a chance to go pro when so a sixteen but on quack that saying was too much of a long shot an she should get an education and get a normal job gender was actually various surprise when i in formed her than an america parent mi ta said the same exact thing i thought a make date stay trip a i is a watch lee e s i had this we watching internet say college grad in er first office jot how did she and up protesting in the street every week and with tens or ani may be its hundreds of thousands of years o for starters delivers twenty two which means she is part of a special generation and hong no an for i hong sonny mac sat it be for hand over and here is a protestor were calling alive and i fine an nineteen ninety seven here is her friend to a con tiffin i also boy nine ninety seven you cant call me you and ism born a nineteen not seven sin ninety ninety seven a year when soon was headed over a china for the brutish the gals just pause on these twenty two yearolds for a minute for some quick history as you may or may not know hon long sits on the edge o main land china a and was a brutish colony for a really long time starting in the nineteenth century and the finally nineteen ninety seven the brutish got out i handed it over to china and the idea was the can be a fifty year transition period after fifty years china will fully be in charge but during that fifty years hong long would be a democracy now o colly people a to run hoy call that is the last brutish governor of in long during the hand over ceremony and nineteen ninety seven that is the promise a that is the unshakable destiny and to be queer honking had not been a democracy undo brain but the were gin t transition towards it of er bunch of years and the hope was after fifty years in twenty forty seven he chines government let them stay a democracy which it the time did not seem a crazy idea chin was opening up in all kinds of ways though was not square how this was going to play out and at the end of the day after fifty years and the your twenty forty seven china was going to be able to do whatever it wanted in hon long these are the children born the year that cock started ticking and you heard of the phrase curse generation yes sir it whats this job o more tin teen oi the save people it was he was pretty much a job o pretty much a funny thing to us as we we firs job about it at fairly pi a schools but at hesttaagon yous just foiling joking you on for all those years eriginary the joke had to do with the coincidence there were curse cause of some weird bad lock during some big childhood milestones say a went though together the year of their kindogarden graduation the says virus had hong long and city shut down graduations were cancel six years later when they shuldhave had their elementary school graduation same thing happen again but a swine flew an genial remembers that a friend stoke that wen they graduated high school it was going to be a bola and that is when they started using the word curse i think that was the time you the time the jack rain rot hareporte and the curst child ye many of us older the curse always say that we a the chosen the is hireporta was to chose that all of us of hirimoder we always ta were the chosen when we have to face something sbeshoin her life or we are the curst to on we have to family bat or face something significant genitor says i chosen one side of things did really kicking to their senior year of high school that twenty fourteen they were seventeen the seventeenth years since the hand over and that your people in hon conger still expecting that gangland china was going to let them start holding full on elections with they could choose thrown waters as promised back in nineteen ninety seven and that year china announced it was not going a happy sled to a movement called the umbrella movement headed by young peopleteen air we worked to politics in this public school classes that all these twenty twee year old talk about is being instrumental in the thinking classes the began as part the hand her called liberal studies classes ut explained among other things promises of nineteen ninety seven n the rites as hon long city tens e the sure most for the first time demanding the boat carrying umbrellas thousands of people in a vast procession down the streets and pro testmovement that was almost entirely peace and they lost did not get the boat after three months the protest ended alive works for among national company in entry of a job bout a college she is management trains shays she went to some protest back then out of solidarity with her peers i was just amazed by the other this but she dim get all the politics that changed in tune twenty nineteen when honor introduced the bill that would allow gangland china to extra dit people from hong long to be tried and punished in china under chines law this was sene is a new and very menacing and coachmen on the rights of hong long citizens since nineteen ninety seven they would been ruled by hong congas and hong long courts everybody as presumed innocent with the rights we known most democratic countries now anybody could get thrown into the prisons and courts of communist china i say that that that was the time when i first feel awaken when ism truly understanding a happening when i first go t the macho the no extradition bill and on i was very very emotional at that time because there is only around seven million people an hong long that one million onion the street with the same de most with the same wish of hoping hon con to remain its current day whetting honor to stay like it is with its own laws separate from china a week later too many people came out at the time i was dining very only o this is touching wise feel united and then the next second the gofer men just declares that oh we heard your force that were we will be continuing on the bill on today that was a really big contrast and in the morning you see how peaceful things we that at nip you see t police coming out and stopped brutally hitting people i was it was really unforgettable to me because that was the first time when i witness with my real hi that the polis is chasing people they are chasing students who did not do anything and stop to bid the and arrest them other twenty to your old also ton us how radicalizing its ben to see lest her gassing and beating peaceful protestors and this point i understand this before we got to hon on a lot of the emotion driving the protest it is just about the police because the government is separating them to do such things and there is no penalty for them even if they are doing things that are completely and susceptible to every one bee worst nobody knows when this is gong to we by twenty forty seven we china fully takes of her in con but we ganifering lots of other people her age things were starting to feel pretty minus was not con going to become just any other chines city round by the communes when your fifty what do you picture life here will be i can pay cha that am i wild be super depress was i supervise common on politicothine i really cannot imagine the day that i cannot speak freely on internal that wading no have that freedom of speech anymore and i cannot imagine that that will commaday me and my friends commenting on the government wild become a crime and you think that would happen yes i do when like am all the tings that is happening manage hazan now especially i will say in where sin can shin e can what is happening hinting you will happen hon con shes taking about in german camps with h chines are holding perhaps a million weaker an others they say is real education bat e specially a concentration camp the poor people who does not who do not again with the government into the concentration camp and acialtate them and ti cot monuturge wherever and when ever they go everywhere is police police monsters everybody's move and i dosing that if we do not fight for our future that will comma day hometown would become seam because shes poo agree active this is not feel an abstract thread when the twenty two year old picture who china going to crack down on it is them thanks also in her first job out a college jerks at a bank casterestr replace her voice with an actors who knows whatever they would do to us an ate i shun disinter who knows where we w go whats having the a per that is what we fear off titans heard of the social credit system the china started the monitor an rated citizens she fears it of china decide o your any government it make it impossible for you to get the job on arise in society n the devices the china uses to monitor its population estimated two hundred a million surveillance cameras around the country wit facial recognition software they be going up around honor tend o thousands of them many lite me a scar being monitor an rat that me we never ever be freed into anything every on and then the momentary of the china gavel this is nothing else i did not understand before i came to hon con the protestors tiny and gender do not just feer whits can happen to them in the future with extradition as or who is internal or going free speech an the daily lives right now they believe the watching china already transforming hon on making a less the honking they know a more the mainland center points a changes in the public school circular she says for seven year old nephew i speaking manner in it school five days a week it did happen when she was kid wanderings with they speak in manage china and on con people most to speaking companies and in english o all the chins classes are conducted engendering he speaks rendering every day basically he is bees mastering better than english can you can you explain a littleabit why canvases as in for em contains is more a an identity to us but o what makes hon on on on these days when get offer pictures what a life is can to be between now and twenty forty seven she imagine around kids going to public schools not studying companies coming home in parting the pro government wine that will be the correkulin by them am i do love kits a really want to ha kits i i want to have a fupateam of kits really bet a i just cannot imagine the life they will be having in hon only to roll i i can not promise my kit a happy life i if i am not certain about what will hon con be come you do not think the children re raise to be happy in man men him not not the kind of happy that li think hon don't man ten child of people they think that they are happy cast they cans to leet but then we we we not things to more tan just surviving in the society we we look for rights and freedoms and human rise but the mind can china they ignore all those things they just think hair a staple life having kits having food a good place to live in is already happy enough yet and the change she says she seeing i now an hon on she is upset it all the manlanders moving there in her neighborhood and you verse shioun't said she in a friends in cautery cowage many man under she says i i i just feel really we was i i am drowning rate in hon con a goats a local school but than i have to be surrounded by all the ma menders does another you to be surrounded by mainland's yes actually quite but then we have a hundred and fifteen new in the gets from china to honk on every day i get i does not a positive there for a second the total by the way is over a million calenders since nineteen ninety seven rot we forty five thousand a year but soppily because i soft know how your feeling about genitor but this was a point we came to in a few interviews with these twenty two year old when you got them under the subject of mainland's get ready for a wave of totally bigoted opinions i especially i live in new ternaries all the people surrounding here rendering and then you start to see those last educated people they squatting next tot streets i did witness an mind lands lady having her children pe at the road and i always here man can people yelling shouting out for nothing in them all and i always they jump into the long everything is bather me ala squatting what he means squatter an i do not know they just they just squat on the roads it waiting people they just dint equation and wait for nothing they can quit for an hour pee went hon con don do that we do not has who was quit at the road why you don't just start why you conscious sat the more comfortable it i just does not look good it does not look good it visit of civilized crawl the arm the gender in the first generation feel about the future the parents often not as alarmed about chin a takin more control of hon on about what the islands can to be in twenty fenny seven i diver's parents they hate her going out to protests every pecan i make o our patrons they li we really has some ran in less fight and they they think wed just china take over hon long it will be fine after or parents sol the all o generation just do not believe o they have not ready enough to open up their eyes a see what is actually going to happen f just feel the thin not the any for in won a my i not the any for in won uneven fie it is galling about this fortipany is that she feels she is being the responsible one fighting for everybody's future and they are telling her not to protest she was like maybe a for parents a done this themselves years ago things would not be bad to day li ism twenty two years in the pass we lost danger the never stood up like us all fight li as to as a what they are promise in tat hate set it is fenny when you talk about it you you are madam your parents abatis i just feel i mean i do not understand why they will not want this rights o we they do not think that som bat it is go to habit in the next fifty years if any in gender and many others the count given over the lives to protested they work doing the week protest on the week hands e say there no much time in the lives for mu helves be it's interesting is they nothing is going to work most of interview is told us that they do not think china's going to give in again here is gander i am pretty much pessimistic actually and i do wish that one day we old the see we wan a down critic con come but now i just do not see away out i it is been three months with been trying each and every that we've broke into the legislative council we have more than a thousand people got a rested that the government is till trying to ignore all of this if if you feel pasimestic about the results why is stop girl why you stop going out every weekend an at least the government we that we are not that how do we say we we are not that obedient we have to continuously tell the government that we are not satisfy with what they are giving we have to do it again here is outs i think even if we have to lose we need to were are true thoughts in history will we need to let of people behind as knows that with tried twenty forty seven is coming and this a very grand thing to say but many of these curse generation kids feeling they have a special destiny ale prefer to speak to us thougoan interpreter she is a for my protestor bills barricades s been rested om one photo ho one you got the a n on was i to his go ho i think we a shy lucky techs we grow up with people who tilt the same ways and we realize that when we turn fifty it is the end of our freedoms ism twenty two now and i imagine that when ism twenty hive was the ready half away until the boy expos and if we do not do any things by the time we are fifty years old it would be awful i do not want our children to have the same battle and then when were it people look back and and think that woe don't do en tough our birthday is a count down the end and more than other people i yet my generation an have a duty an into do for pul see do seemincome again here is gander if we were born early probably i would become a data and if i were on later i would probably the come those late kiss became men to ring better than canines i am happy that i am wordy they ninety satin that we are in the needle we have the chance to know what is freedom and we are experiencing that are frankly s being taken away and thus why we are the grizzly

breaking the law any one is subject to a rest which affects crowdsize macron penalty is give years ten years if we convicted variety its while the protestors have scared of getting a rested all the time but despite that the beginning of the protest has the feeling of a bock party people strolling chatting e see if we parents and kids some non protesters cut through the crowd running errands but

many protesters select deafer the i gets their job to support the people at the front who are the hard for ones wo push back against police and throw molatop cocktails and chase police with sticks and metal rods and tear stop down to to barriers to slow the police were in full gear holds and goggles and gas masts and gloves finally the front liners yell that they want room to retreat and we need to

ye posh they fire her gas they spray blue water and everybody we move back and then we stand here tan work our gold this has been a very frequently as cravat e nowadays very get i thing tillstand on our own gowns not o be is first tat easily its it just all as to display out as long as you can and then eventually the police will push off the street in other words its exactly the entire protest movement we din to twenty fort sets to how them down as much as you can yes in the and china were win but for as long as your manual to stand here in the street is pretty at to say see but ta treating much a cure a ten we the yelling a the targe tan there we headed to a mass tree as fleece advance towards us and for the first time the seems to be actual real fear were running down streets and side roads we get separated fro genitors friends and from a manual dodging the police finally taking refuge tin a church there safe houses lie the surround hon on the protestrstockinto it takes over an hour finally the cost is clear ice never calls a friend o the rot their volunteer drivers for the protesters part of the inform structure they have created gender changes out of er black teacher into civilian cloves no make up she is to tired yo a an no needed shes getting to got i change hon a the back r o we coming up we are from people in hong long who welcome trying to stake over the city with open arms and i want of them gain to feel that way that is an a minute ciao to bagredio wen our program continues is mere can life from our glass to day we are returning to a program that we first broad cast this past fall about the protests and hong long i travelled honking with my coworkers dial wo and a manual marry under the new national scirtigall the china put into affect t couple weeks ago an hong long many of the things that these protest said to as back tan that you are hearing the sower could the medically be prosecuted we have changed near everybody's name we will and the show today with an interview that i did this month about that law with janitor who heard the first after the show for now we have arrived at at three of our programmed a three good cop dad cop is an america visiting hong long for the first time one of the things ta kind of killed me was hearing that before the last few years of pro test people were really into the police they were trusted they were respected and it was only the last few years especiallythe less you months of protest that changed you that at a rally act she saw people chanting at a row of cats that they hoped that they and their families would die and feelings bat who decide with the police of the protesters they've got in intense it is taring families a part on the telegram a there is a whole channel for protestors who get kicked out by their parents and need a place to live all new grew up in honking he knows a family that is very far part on this the son is a protester the dad is a re tired police officer and not had this sit down and do what nobody in honongis doing talk to each other there is really no dialogue between police and protesters anywhere in honking as far as we could tell and can i say listening to the story to day nine months after we firs broadcasted after weeks of protest against police violence across hated states i really do wonder how common this kind of experience is in our country anyway here is out have known this family since i was six i knew them because of my friend jonathan i wrote the schools with him everyday his father peter was the first policeman i knew in real life i was excited to talk to him because you never hear what the police think about the protests police here are not really allowed to talk to the press peters retired but still very connected to the force before the family all sat down together i asked piece has to get together with me and my producer manual i had not seen him since i was twelve back then people call me you recon which means fishbowl because the cantinyse for fish sounds master a you and because i was fact i will not recognize you on the street i will not i will not ale sir canters o e all it i i guess as a compliment that here we recut e have is were fat as a kid i liked peter he take time off work to stop y during recess and by us chips and other snacks my friend jonathan would half his birth parties at the police station which we loved big barbecue a the policeman around peter was the cool tad people in honor trusted even eve the police fact then one of the most popular to he show was a cop show tauten steer were the police we heroes her peter's her is gray now he is tall athletic he placed tennis by my minicam in tennis do not know why my hangmen tennis is a federal better fetter i meter roger radar i do not know why may be my skill ananotheher won pistol likes is that jokes i cannot imagine petard ever doing what have been seeing in these videos beating up unarmed protesters kicking people on the ground i thought surely he would object to some of those things and that his views would be complicated from what you have seen in recent months has in anything that the police has on that you think you would disagree with nothing is perfect by s as a hole in general i seen the puts tat doing doingthe pretty good jo if it is in to the police force in or the countries i just look at the carssuties look look just lo at the collie of fatal to numbers it will not i will not be zero i asked him about different situations the police having criticize as git i even show him victims off police brutally arresting people things i think are clearly wrong but h e always seems to have a justification for the way police behave he says your judging the police pas on what you see in these clips that is not fair you do not know what the officer was facings the solid media only show the part the police hiding people but one minute a go they bee check by loss of people one minute later the meet to to the to the mop o attacking them hat you can see is one minute after but you deed not see the full picture he is not conflitset about police and he she very sympathetic of protestors he thinks the protest out the trying hon hong the expedition of this oke he does not think china wo and free sweecian hong hon and protests fear of china is way overblown and i eve hong con be par of china come on wick up people wick up disks the f where the china is good or bet hong con is prof china if you do not it those people waving the nesses fag waving the cousin neck fat if engnand ties to oven go t yogin good inland y you go to further god californium ye go go if from tics to ye go it'd already been worried how this family conversation was going to go hearing what peter believed did not help peter told me he understands that jonathan goes the protest but does not ask him abutted because he does not want any details jonathan said he does not ask stand what he thinks of the way police beet and to gas protestors for the same reason it is if he says something he fly something that's complete does messes to me brings him down is as a person i just i would fee tit uses head not not who i thought he was in the ecasyou think that can be ye to come this family does not talk about the protest at all tens yes saucer yes pat great but no politics til to night this agreed it to have the conversation they have been avoiding after then jonathan man torso washes radices wat e i recognize the song writes away ism surprised she is humming in front of peter is the protestors new anthem glory to hong ones altar is s on jonathan side was she works with lawyers including som in the prodemocracy camp i i ask if peter knows what that song is she says maybe in on that is kind of how it is been going between her and her husband no real discussion but the occasional pass one the gesso comment while the watching the news always some passive e gesso coming during dishes this is another reason jonathan avoids bringing up the protests he does not want to start of fight between his parents a we the worse senary be some moving out i guess yo because the cannot send it any more ye i guess living apart would be the worse case are i believe us that by sort of and officially means then you no longer to get is y that could be his man or his tad or him we all set at dinner table i do not know why they are to talk about this maybe just because have known them for long an i astir i or i hope maybe part of tam wanted to talk and i was just a good excuse you peters facing me and jonathan and alpha are next to meou go jonahan has their talk poky am not to the argol character on his land aga say porn to the conversations tore with all of them saying in different ways it is fine that we do not talk about this we all have mutual respect in wen ta mute respect teatiaevor instead of talking to each other or looking at each other the talking to me or looking at the dag it few all very careful proper and calm o this continues for half an hour then everything changes when peter uses the word on compromise the compromiser tall he i compromise tit is basically the government line rings that is what honchos chief executive carry lamp says that the protestors should stall protesting and after that the two sides can talk mi than an jonathan hear that is meaning the protestors should back dour they both lay in sir peter the we was your your manger come ten ta as i tomb it a and that a a mica joint inch do on altar says the police aether once who need to change they have to calm the situation peter says the police are doing their charge do not know why when the police arrest people for fighting or breaking stuff its treat us mere it is a legal sol arrested no drive tat the to a a nibodygover go coma avacomalilf athlete me jonathan says of yes arrested tut how much forced us the police need to use sometimes the person just asks the police a question and they still get arrested or eaten wo people who are already on the ground newton subdued they still get been i adman peter does not respond t legatos then they argue openly argue for the first time about one of the protestors main the hands something the government refused to butch onto start an independent investigation into police behavior consider a but but toga invited e are peter keeps repeating the same thing over and over like heaven back into a corner that there is no need for independent investigation ow we on the right time mi you tho let arose sales the yoga the sheeted already has a system in place or to investigate complaints about the police coming which you on your gum mi yow tat to d they talk a little longer but it does not go anywhere altar tells me later she had other things she could have brought up but decided against it she did not want her husbands a few traps the word she used was say calk which translates as that corner no place to go preserving the family was more important to her than trying to win an arguments later jonathan told me he still loves his that but he is given up hope that his father could be a reasonable human being at least when it comes to the police when i starathan this i was kind of i e i thought maybe jonathan and his mother and father people who actually want to understand each the we talk about this in a productive manner and that if they could maybe they was hoped that the rest of us could but now i do not have lot of for to new here normally report o beware we we so pulse chinnistan is by the cress and alba and out in seriously

patriotic about china is kind of donkey moreover i always my friend si would never one a live in china because at there's a low things in china that a i can a sat if i were to before to live in china the two things he cynical that we and of talking about are the lack of free speech and sensors access to the inner not on but the truth is i liven honor and i get to retain my almost in check freedom for twenty more years and is such a sweet bayou for honor people and we did od to him that after twenty eight years its very possible is freedoms pul disappear us freedom when he had the same response that i heard from other people who do not the her tests us he was well sure i maybe well i less i you talking me to a prepare the young us prospect is but a ha but in a change for the freedom that the fie for the recon have i and there destroying long order and a an the balance o tit a if i with a use between this if chance i e no to have on order i will need to sacrifice to freedom the say much

way they do in china to satin n it is a big on from i could never live in china too i would sacrifices my freedom dust get us to to but the intensity of the protests and his frustration was whet hes experiencing in the city have driven him to at least trinal on this extreme idea angels party works in finials he lived in the oust for twelve years he is of a ruffian reads for the ciao bears as he likes the tonatials needs he says he was in politically in loved for out best wen to one of the big people product last raingmarta watch then to prisons it pain but that change one may when he was lac in a live stream of the young protestors storming the ledgesplat of come uncles he was surprised how ferocious they seemed sow even the police officers looked a little scaring that at that moment i someday realism a we a to their close to the revolution the could happen just never occur to me that hon con with go through that this both stun and anxiety about unknown an did with thinks things can change abruptly if there resent a revolution is can force the hand of the chines government to crack down on it violently an and that t anything can happen but i i could lose all the privilege i have i hon con to this protection of commolaw freedom of speech but also feed must speech protect by common law and tot not nobody chant enjoy these freedom but if the guess too my a if it get to to in pointing we can lose on of these privileges which i treasure he woke up the next morning to see that the porridge was wall to wall about police brutality to dance it seemed every one was leaving out the fact that the protesters had started at which seemed deeply on just to the police and ta that when i stop at the turning blue when ta when i felt that the police work me unfairly i to my did i chose to be on the police idea other people sited against the protest for different reasons a big one i heard was the disruption the cause the security guard told me he had to transfer four times get home one night because of some washin downs a women thing to get cast out of an team that had been destroyed by protesters said if you proud of the government take it out on the government the only heading people me a man said to me sadly honking is our how why are they destroying the crowd on the bout finishes eating out the national anthem the second time when suddenly everyone rushes to the realize i a a a a a a a everyone cram together on one side in a position that is a little precarious that kind of angels wore and right now he felt pleased to choose a team it are not these are his new people he does not think them exactly but he feels more alined with these chines nationalists on this boat waving at the police than with the angry protester is going up on them even if those carpenters ultimately on the something he does to preserve their freedoms in hoo e all sitting on the ever deck of the a hide this was actually the first time dance had ever sung the national anthem

to cannons already were quite a lot of people around me our living he every one or finding away out of here do you have any feeling of relief this has been going on for long with no end in sight but if this low kicks in in the way that you are saying do now you area a point where you could say o a we have done everything we can do it is impossible to do anything else we know where not going to make progress and we have to stop do you feel any relief from that no it will not be i cannot be a relief was we are been so less that we cannot speak tit that can not be in relief that is something that is more a suppression even stranger suppression that cannot be a relief ism asking that question because a manual take to somebody in hon long and that is what they said they said a say well if this is how is can to end well it we said relief that it is over ye i do think that the are people thinking in this way that that is i now we we call it coking e frock in the pot with worm mortar i no house tot being scrap it in no a a we we have that same thing in english tad yet wit were the water gets warmer and beer ye and then en then the long never really realizes a i should get out of the pot and then that an give also red may be that is not even true may be i do jump out of t but you to then i do ten the some people or this in this way like that the be mu think at least were tried something that that but for me myself that cannot be a relief of the movement is the is some thing that we worn our next aeration to remember this has actually happened hong hon that cannot be a relief i will never feel relit you in the far we talked about how how it felt there this this is cock and this sort of fifty year count down to hong con losing it is a economy do you think by protesting o you made this change happen faster than it would have happened to me ones i i e think ta may bee manitou thing he way that i thinking is that power we bitterly and wat make the tiny taut on the not t do anything be cast of the in national feels international penman in national support we tough tat them i ta i low down the cone ton of us o half expect to that i will fastening up you started the movement to slow the out down and you did not think it would make it go faster yet ye i i us suppose to happen on a fifty year tike the fifties were but that maybe wit that tiny scattering ambition it was going to happen in the for teas year but then now it is even earlier this totally out of expectation and much worse yet do you regret protesting seeing them ye now really on i not regret for doing it as we all knew that we were on by one tiny change a even if we fail that we we tried shut insure a we could not get what we wanted the situation is even worst wore is ten the time that we started the hole wit men but then everything wit be tea is now i cannot say it is la tad best this one er have changed many people in good way or et o that way i i one say it is wasn't the politico scoping hongonis totally changed how people the e chief and the society changed ego yo is still worth it and we have wanted that declaration to the world the we do not won hi that taco that is to payment that we are kit even though we failed even go we are be controlled by the movement i to want let out o few that at we wanted we in of it no we don't we we thought against just that we

a quick warning there are curse words that her beeped in today's episode of the show if you prefer a beamed version you can find that at our website this america life out work started is something that she was doing in her spare time and kind of took over her life lisle yellow birds searches for missing people people nobody else is looking for people the police have given up looking for a reporter sera crane mudra matlesson twenty fourteen one sierra was looking into the disappearance of a young white oil worker case clerk he vanished couple years before on the reservation wishes from in northtocoda lyssa was investigating it to she had just gotten out of prison she was looking for a distraction awaits state over and and she billy opened up her files to me and allowed me to see the degree to whit she had involved herself in this case and she had actually spend years and she cracked that case through really re not traditional means by busily waging this campaign against the person who she believed hen murder case clerk she mailed tens and tens of thousands of fliers around western north the coda the fire a beware with the photo of the guy she thought murder cabin car and his wife in they did turn people against him but at the same time list e friend of the one they were testing each other almost every day and they were talking on constantly and she had this really intimate window into the lives of these people she was trying to investigate and through that window she was able to see their owner ability the same time that she was maintaining this to friendship with this woman she was also completely under mining her and her husband and the case broke open sera spent years with lyssa watching this play out an ended up writing a book about lyssa in the case they got close sierra would stylus's apartment for months they drive through the bad lands running down weeds talked for hours every week when sierra wasn't a north cocoa enduring this years this thing happen native america family started asking lyssa to look for their loved once liver's a record remember the man can ho dots a rikeranation member lyssa was just kine of inventing how she did this for for this she would been a welder a prison guard social worker this warm forcemeat work and study criminal justice and college but she would also been a drugdeiler lyssa has lived on both sides of the law which is what makes her good at what she does and she is gone to prison she she knows how on foremen operates from a perpetrator's point of view as well in dozens of cases now sometimes an around sometimes with down foremen lyssa has deployed the same doggedness and resourcefulness that she marshalled in that first case like were example when a woman named o livid alone were when missing from list's reservation in twenty seventeen there was this national search for her bliss's theory was she might not be far from home when she was last seen one day she decide to take a boat out on the near olive's house was the fishing sonar that she bought years or lie thinking some day it might come in handy to find missing people she just launched the boat and at within about ten minutes her younger relative spotted some sheep on the fishing sooner and said hearty what is that and a with the looked at it and it was a truck and and a bulimia was inside once we were this miss a and liver's family the tried to convince on foreman authorities to look in that way lot am f america to miss and i never found but even have good statistics on this hes her cases are under reported and poorly tract big part of the problem there these federal laws that limit who can investigate cases and how they can investigate them on reservations which leads you a jurisdictional tangle it is often not cheer which can foreman agency is supposed to take a case if you do not know if they disappeared from nor reservation or offer reservation it is really hard to say whose responsibility that cases o the reservation triable police wot the federal authorities off the reservation side your county or state police but because it is unclear those cases can become a lot lower priority or those cases can be ignored by all jurisdictions and and that is where lyssa yellow bird comes in she searches for the per who slip through these turn ti tonal crafts is is sure you not to tell don't two thousand sixteen misses own nose went missing and this was the first time that she when searching for someone who was not a stranger she just never expected that it would happen to her own relative am but this cases really remarkable for a lot of reasons a for one she figured it out in just five days am she also recorded all of her conversation which is something that was at does a lot she saves everything she photocrafts everything she records everything and less ha gave me these phone calls that she recorded over the course of these five days and they were just incredible a because they really showed con how she was able to break this case open an a meed it by minute way there says another thing about this case she unless a talk for hours all the time about everything but after this five days when little was work in this case she just come went quiet about it we did not talk about it for years which just really unusual because list is always talking about her cases am she just never talked about this case again though and i i knew that i i knew because she was quiet about it and i knew also because it was own her own relative that it had affected her in a way that no other case had am i but i did not really know why entirely i thought there was something else going on and three years passed am and that was when she finally said ski ye ism ready to talk about it and she wanted to talk about it shoes it guess to doing a story lis is said yes she wanted people to hear it and that is what wee bringing you to day we this tan and on the ex exceptional investigator miss a yellow bird the som cops to they are really amazing she just knows how to read people and how to pool information out of them that other people cannot get we hear a crack this case in five very intense days o be easy chico which this america life i mir a glad and before we get to this story heads up the streammage ins violent including sexual violence her sera crane burdock the last time i saw list we were at her grandma's house on the forebirthold in in reservation this was in february her mamma called her over to find their missing cat not something was i usually searches for it but she drove over right away in her hot pink pajamas and where everyone is eating breakfast the walks to the window stares out with binoculars lyssa thinks some coyotes got the cat a few days earlier her mam bought a hunting rifle and everyone is cracking up at the idea wish is mam retired professor who does not to be outside and who never had a gun taking to the porch with her rifle lyssa asks her nephew mercury to teach her mam how to us it ye it is is try icurrlissa goes to the bedroom to get the rifle she comes back holding at the tar case an hands to mercury regret auto a ten i can i was a girl et was a fender a tar to el her wit the chair jo see my b can would get the last o day the hello birds are really close at any time you will find four generations of them just hanging out on this is grammar's house for days on end and i was at this house every one eating laughing watching television whet they last saw lists niece carnal yellow bird before she went missing that's an august of twenty sixteen at first they were not that worried carl did not live with a yellow birds she lived about two hours away off the reservation but she was always stopping by sometimes stayed the night she was twenty seven had lots of energy confident she would walk into her family's house slugger phone into their speakers and start jamming huppah and it was an unusual for carnal to take off for a few days not answer when they called when she stopped coming around her family told list do not worry nearly will she u sell doing a thing i pull to wink som she should not be sol an i shall come on list was starting to worry though carnal was the daughter of one of wit's favor relatives uncle chuck he died a few years earlier when of the last things he would asked list was to look out for carnal then one morning list had a dream about chuck it was not long he just kind of appeared and he said you need to go get carnal now lis called her family and found out the night before they dosed a holy woman to come to the house and pray for carnal they had not wanted to telllisa and all it would mean you an a ceremony if you guys didn't think anything was wrong what would you be having a ceremony for and i should look somebody needs to come clean with me and tell me what the hell's really going on harm told her they actually were really worried at this point no one had heard from carnal in weeks and i did you i is light me well we did not lie we do not want you to put all this stuff on sociamedia an we know let us probably what will happen visa's family told her they did not want it on social media out of protectiveness for carnal carnal had been in some legal trouble she was addicted to math they don't want to make things harder for her list thought may be they were also embarrassed in the yellow bird family our professors anthropologists social workers all very aware of the stereotypes used to shame native communities being drunken being filthy being all these labels at the give us that when something of that nature takes over here of our family members the last thing we want to admit is that it is hid us rat i think what it boils down to is shiny keep a good reputation i think that play a major roll of shame list seen this first hand with the family treated her she was addicted to math spent three years in prison for dealing for a while her family avoided her even now lisuspensover fifteen years and they do not to talk about it lists mam does not even use the word person she calls visa's other college list could not disagree more with ti latitude she believes that when some one goes missing that is the worst possible time to hide the facts often the thing some one is trying to cover up can be part of what let them to go missing in the first place list called calla's mam biretta biretta lived a few hours away on another reservation and the yellow birds did not know her very well calla's parents were not together long for told lis as shed reported carl missing a few weeks earlier this offered to help find carl and loretda said yes solid got to work one of the first people she called was the officer responsible for the case aril lose a detective for the city of maiden where carl lived aprilsaid she learned that in the days before carl disappeared cargo was on the forperthold reservation and she might have gone to a second reservation called spirit lake but aril did not have jurisdiction on reservations she was a city cop this is another part of the jurisdiction a tangle in these cases aril was trying to follow every lead but she could only go far to interview suspects on the reservation she needed the cooperation of on forcemeat there it is part of the bureau of india affairs but no one was calling her back she did tell me you'll this stands five states and three reservations my hands are tight and i should my car hell go wherever this is my ease silica did exactly the thing her family did not want her to do

let me just tell you what happened a we years before cargo an missing chuck moved him with his ma less us grandma list would visit him a lot spend hours in his bedroom they would flip through books together and talk about them chuck did not have as many graduate degrees as others in his family but every one said he was the smartest yellow bird it made miss i feel good to keep up with him she liked proving to herself and to chuck that she had not totally fried her brain with drugs they spent lots of time debating this mass of book he kept by his bed the code of federal regulations title twenty five it spells out how the us government is supposed to fulfil its obligations to tribes in exchange for taking their land how would suppose to always act in their best interest for the baleen obligations the government has ignored in all kinds of ways both lessen chuck witness themselves chuck was four years old during a major event in their tribe the you as government bit a dirham floated out most of the reservation forced every one including the yellow birds to below a they were farmers self sufficient but the land that government move them to was farmable they was huge an employment a lot of people left the reservation for cities chuck and most of his generation were sent away to boarding schools where a lot of them were abused in his room chuck also had stacks of articles about an emerging science called epiganetics that shown how dramatic stress can change the way upper sons lane's behaves and how those changes canaffect your kids cans make it likelier that they develop illnesses depression or pitiably chuck put into words of pattern less i had observed her whole life that she and the people she would laid her help had been delivered into his sister where they had no chance a sister that kept taking from them until they died and their bodies are dragged behind bushes or left to drift at the bottoms of revers and lakes and few people bother to look for them to fish them out chuck himself was not doing well he was an alcoholic he was in his early sixties and he had serosas one night when chuck was drinking he got violentand his mom kicked him out of the h use la

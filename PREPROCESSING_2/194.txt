from b my chico it is this america life aware a glass back in twenty twelve we ran this completely outrageous story about some stuff that the f b i did about an undercover informant who spied on america museums for for a year and i went badly spectacularly badly and some of those people who rare spied on some the people in the story sud the u as government because of it staking years to wine through the courts be just last month it was argued before the u s supreme court up to day i went to pay you the story and also talk about the court case a little some contact for history before we start it is about f p i surveillance of muslin ever since nine eleven there is been a ton of that and just to give a sense of what that means are original episode open in queens on york city one sturdy night at a community center three does not people show up the kids ran around before its start coffee in the back it is a workshop men by two layers rummy possum in the ala chimes who with the project called clear from city university of new york glosscools then is free legal ad to muscles who get caught up in counterturrism surveillance in destinations we want to do to day is nothing controversial we just want o arm you with the knowledge of your rights that how to respond when you find yourself if you find yourself lass on a halo and that really uncomfortable situation where you have enough i we at your door or an we pity thetactive at your work place asking the talk this is common it happens often of the possum in champs told me that sometimes they asked for a show hands in the workshops and they learn that every single person in the rooms his other been visited by on foremen this or know somebody who has order the to attorneys a start with the demonstration of what happens in one of those encounters the alaschimas place to plain clothes f b i in who comes to the door yuks rusty possum was the guy at home and we are first on to doing the wrongs isles how a this interaction should not have not not yes ego i i on is the son ready costs oeisgr am commands us come in a our of course ye coming place ant who are you on ad oh i mam i my name is yeti a and wit the aft i to s asking couple question oh well if b i o k am a sir nothing away mow o k standard we getting to knower the neighbor i an you years o later in the discussion afterwards the audience points out that this was a mistake he should have ask her id before letting the f bi age cone to his home i isn't aft to answer any questions you could have even asked for a warrant some see crates points out that he seems very nervous another mistake says did you go to that mas don theaters ah yes that ado that a do a a o and am who's them there am we why why why are you h i just curious it is bite of

volunteering of him for m rs a that the a right because i was pain it a friendly and the and why waiting you longer that intimation if you do not think thing you none anything wrong the prove without the two lawyers now they crowd tats that the more you say the more you could accidentally being criminating or saline especially dangerous they say wit there is moments in the demonstration were possum was nervously stumbling around not to what to say trying to remember pacific under a federal on the united states lying to a federal age is a federal offense it is a crime and it is a crime that is being charged since nine eleven this proportionately against muscles the moment that you have that interaction with the federal agon let us say i did not remember something all asks me question oh your friends with gyrus o we were you last tuesday and i say all i think we were camping but maybe she spoke the cars before and crus tat something different all of a sudden there's a dis there is a discrepancy either ism in trouble or gyrus is in trouble and even having that very basic conversation because of this he tells the group over and over he says this if the f b i or in why p d comes around asking these general questions it is best to get a lawyer we are not saying never talk to them that is not a we say wo were saying is do it in a way that is responsible and it is nothing controversial it is what wars the steward does when she was approached by the ebb i should in talked to them directly she remand lawyers he present canton was under investigation he had it seem of lawyers that is the safe responsible way to do it i it is not being uncooperative it is actually the most america thing to do this particular workshop happening twenty twelve but clear and other organizations still give workshops it to day got around to a bunch of lawyers from different group sand i do no i had assumed that twenty years since nine eleven the surveillance of muscle communities would slowed some they ready told me the same thing it is the same to day or greater than it is been in the pass the council in america atomic relation's office since sudden californium has more cases a lawnforcement knocking up peoples does pus in addition to that a real explosion and muscle travellers being questioned at the air port when i reached rummy possum this week on the phone the lawyer from that workshop in twenty twelve y so pointed out that er porter o be veal these days the thing surreal at our ports for people traveling back from wo were for the gory country o having there a conic the bit on complicated not the dated dome they being question a r port an ekandaris great is it legal to take somebody is phone if there an america citizen and the crossing into the country and take the data it the really question the can tat the question you will we fought in port the lovely take the position that at the port the men a would not apply at the border that in the import i e border an its be claim that your your hon yet id her the dona om e position a proadministration that your hone it just a yo k e they osiers and that is your crown or not order tit they have the right it the byte the can take it they can say i tor their date the i they can share but partners of that their position easily what happen was in the years after nine eleven the of be bit an inform structure produce survelence and look for terces pots an now that it is in place it just cone a chug along an your constitution the first amendment's freedom of religion it would be illegal for the government to go target somebody for surveillance just as they practice a particular oaken the cannot go an nock on the door to ask of you questions the cannot stop them at the air port the can investigate sold because the muslin and the case your about to here the case it was argued o the spring port last month got fa e verses fashion that is hard is about that it is a landmark case about whether the government's actions gathering information or muscle citizens since nine eleven have been constitutional the tactics used by the epic in this particular a are a tactics that the often us when they survey muscle communities using informant last time the f b i publicly stated how many informant it had the number was fifteen thousand ut in a bunch always this case is not tickle it is an outlier case when we can watch everything a wrong thatch is in the point of view of the people being survey the informant is in happy hat worked out and we presume the fa cannot be two pleased either for reasons at yo here count all that like said it is compelling and very weird case stay with him than am rat this happened in orange county californium two thousand six an at that point at least one homegrown terrorist had come out of an orange county mosque and gone to work with soma bingoton was on the f b is most wanted terrorist less and relations between the f b i and muscles in orange count californium were already on edge before this story began on adds that the head of the f b i for lot angels seven dwell decided the should do a town meeting at a mosque in orange county was the atomic center of refine wry said emphatically that the f b i was not monitoring muscle student groups in the area with the mosque itself the crowd did not by this somebody in the audience told dwell it would be naive for them to believe that the f b was not monitoring the mosque every one should understand that they were being monster he said did well interrupted wo o o a o more we will will we the and in the audience replied you will send your agents without anybody knowing a b i we will for o men we o a m that was tune fifth two thousand six as best we can determine people at the mosque and from testimony in cost two months after dwell reassured them hat the f b i would not honor to them without tying them the f b i placed an under covering formant in the mosque this weary story began san black as our reporter the informant in this story is name dragon say and a lot of people who founder cover to catch criminals he used to be a criminal himself he is done time for forging check in bellmen and grand sett at one point he made a living stealing cocaine from drug dealers as i reported this story people who know him described tom as a snake a comedian a thug scamartist and quote a peaceful and crags hays some pretty far fetch things this list of alibis he told me he used all of these and under cover things italic drugdealer incant dead a russia hetman by the name of van turnyanko clubman drugdealer pedreau hernandis a vulgarian drug dealer by the name of sir i gird also i went by polish names one was a luck desk it one clear of any of these are real but some of the unlikely things crag says do check out the fact that he worked on a counter terrors an operation for the f b i the bureau has conferments and he does not sex the f b i enlisted him to go under cover the catch people who recruiting in training terrors crag says at all began in a strip mall startups we he met with two f b a agents pal allay and cevenarmstrong he says they told them they wanted to go under cover they would pay him to infiltrate the muslin community in orange county which is a funny thought because craggy not the most inconspicuous guy ism six to two hundred sixty pounds it is not fat it is lean body mass i fence five hundred pounds i have twenty one a half inch arms but according to crag the f i wanted to use his lean body mass to their advantage i was too lore muscle male into the him using my physique i to see what actually is the real pulse of the muscle community they told me what i did was vital to america national security and to do exactly what they said and did they have particular target in the muscle community in mind no they said the targets would come to me the bi i would not talked me for this story because the operation is still classified and because it is the subject of a loss but the f b i later confirmed in court the crag was an under cover in former a district attorney also stated in court the crag did work with agent haven armstrong and that crag had given me fix duo very very valuable information the a also confirm one other thing the name of crag's operation operation flex f l e x one thursday in august to that and six crag shared up at the atomic center of even when the biggest mosques and orange county and met with the demon there craggy told him that he wanted to convert to son the next day after fridge prayers craggy stood on the stage in front of hundreds of people and the cleared that he was now a muscle with the new muslin name fork aliases people who were in the mosque that day remember it well the first time they saw this new convert freak picture a three hundred pound blind backer that has a ridiculously wide frame and an huge massive legs he is basis would just my my old my he be since just he was a big my at the beginning i was count anal conks from him he was can escaping to me looking over the next few weeks crag started showing up at the nearby twenty four hour fitness a him were allow the guises from the ermine mosque would work out and when he was not at the him he was at the mosque he intended prayer five times a day one of the people who noticed crag was an egyptian find in men he asked the not use his last thing every day you would see him in the every day you would see him but he would be sitting alow you do not know if he has friends or if if he is a struggling to understand what is going on you feel bad this guy he was he is a nutcase lam probably either he is afraid or curious or something i do not know you do not know he just wont to be as as friendly as you can i men lived in the house just around the corner from the mosque with a few other egyptians one day he decided to introduce himself to crag i believe it was of tor of tor the our pray which is tot one at tone o'clock i went to him and i said they it is all to equal a piece upon you basically and hay my name's men he says been about four weeks right your still here crag remembers this too i say yes he said well you've people just new converts at a few weeks sagest they leave the fall by the wayside a swell not me i ma marillaslem and i told him he is my number and i do not my number on a piece of paper if you have any any question about anything in your head about the the vision or or if you need anything that can help you wat the would left to he said well no where egyptian we get together on them after a prayer on fridges and hough the week an s and we all a a baba to have food together may been come by will will talk to more about a your faith in how you can grow as a listen from there when i went home i thought i really in craggy in new friend iron lived with four unmarried egyptian men blinder lay twenties early thirties one was not a counting another worked for a logistics company there was a guy who worked in firmasuticls and an item consultant the each travelled occasionally sometimes for work or sometimes back home to egypt craggy says his at hammers suspected the roommates might be a terror sell that would radicalize him he arrived at their house ready for anything e first ago they mix me egypt food which is very good delicious food and we sell the couch for about ma be cup of hours s et conversation am and they would play the expo while were have the conversation in a very compete way i was engaged at the time but but play more i ex box and spending time was my we on say it is eighty percent box and everything else comes second that and again he n his friends were ridiculously obsessed with expo they play torments for five hours a day and the only played one game of a hacker as he can we played a lot if he for we still play a lot of few the aster at delrahem was one of mind's roommates a tall athletic guy who worked as a neck consultant he would lived in the you asked for about ten years the at and iron considered their house of brotherhood but as he told me in my producer bring read not really the militant terror see kind crag was looking for we would all just hang out together in ta i lot of my friends would actually canna not come in and say this kind of the frat house right but obviously we a drank it a frat house without outcohall a cosher fat house yes craggy plan work the aster and minds tarted inviting him over more and more they would hang out together get coffee go the movies when crag got sick they went to his house to keep him company they brought him books about slow and brought him back gifts from their trips to egypt here is iron and an master the was he was super cool my you knot he shape conversation we we talk about to e was very comfortable round as he was very cool round as he would job around he would tell us about what he did some of they ad he was going through he said hews none through some our patches from a family perfect i con er deform we tried book to speak and arabia as much the the when he is around bus we did not want to gegivhim any feeling that he is in comfortable anything that we would asked about the him we went worked out together obviously when you see a big bulky go you ought it mean that is just that is very wite but y can let's five pounds we watch t was sometimes o watch arc movie and cause he b be interesting actually seeing some of that we never treated him as an outsider say he seem one of the boys the crag was at work watching taking notes and recording with a hidden microphone hey beyond the whole day i would get to my car in my garage i would turn in device i would say something fork ladies may fourth two thousand twelve five forty five am and i am hat man is beginning the after i as publicly confirmed that crag recorded aloin idea during this operation that means presumably the smack the egyptians talk during expo torments the discussions of movies in their personal lives the exercise tips that craggy gave them at the him the egyptians would play pick up sacker on the week ends with a bunch of other muslin guises crag went to some of these games but he never played instead craggy says he used the opportunity to jot down license plate numbers and film a game as hammers could see who associated with whom according to crag he also brought his handlers things from the egyptian's house that might have their dona or finger prints they they struck me to get is i was smoked i cigarette bat from his aster of room and a her idlers was bath room like to paste to you would sink around their house and steal these things from their rooms yes meeting man in asses it was hard to imagine when the bi was catering them they just seem normal gives the f be i of course would not talk about the case and they would not even talking he general way separate from this case about how they choose who they are going to investigate i call trover erranson to help me make sense of operation plants he isn't investigative journalist whosanalized over five hundred pi terrorism convictions looking at how informants are used to fine suspects survival them and build cases i told trover what crag said that the be i went into the muscle community without any specific suspects trover said that is possible but it is also possible that crag wasn't told tho the targets were possible that the bi had information that crag is not aware in the cases we have looked at it is really uncommon that the pi wits then lots of time with someone who was on fruitful y knows is if their spending months and months and alter doing this playing soccer the it i will move on you know if crag was spending that much time with them it is worth noting that most likely they had enough for what they call cratiget which is reason that they were investigating them be to that they there was a come call the was overheard of some con of correspondence with some one over sees on that the lies monitoring that made them made at thegn suspicions of this particular group in addition to traveler might producer and i talk to five long time big agents now retired who all over sine formats they could not common on operation fleet specifically and none of the new first hand about these egyptian guises tut they gave us similar theories masencally they said if the fa a has even the smallest reason to suspect you a reason you might not even be aware of your self they have to check you out maybe you happened to phone some when the abs catering maybe they got a bad time one of the as a be gean said to me o innocent people get investigated sure every day they cannot weave them out without looking at them though one agent said it was possible that this was a case that just when are that was badly managed and did not follow bi brother calls months passed people noticed that rag was acting more trout he began deciding prayers aloud dressing in traditional robes and showing up early for five an prayers that he get there before the person who unlock the most every morning they also notice something else its slowly in surely enough some during sometimes o when we have coffee a came the question of ghat y tosser one of the egyptians had actually been asked questions about had before non muscles bring it out with them sometimes like he will be on the plain in the person next to m will ask about it he and his friends told crag what they always tell people the g hod is not what you see in the news g hod is really by the each persons internal striving to be a good muscle it is not whole war here is mind that the therapist is if am nuts lam i would be very curious about these stuff to it would be very curious about this stuff that is what the media talks about old the time he must be very courteous see n o the no if you mention is lam that i think there was a survey if you bench at is lam the second thing that you think about in the sing the america slightly was terrorist you know it was for me was somehow normal that he is if you look at it from a cress curiosity view point but he was'norma how insist he was with it until went we we start being this guy is a the something very very to about this person b he just tod bring these odd things in the middle of the conversation out of nowhere for instance the guise would be talking about food or sports but yet he would always bring politics in the conversation as ye had inside bomber it was what you wane at i for example and being wasting what you wan at eat for what do you think about horn marc you knowhant i mean he he just out of nowhere craggy talk to his arabia teacher ashamed el c c about his new obsession too the invited me once to lunch yes and i he focus the topic in the lunch about that and i i keep ism i turning his attention into into into the the the the t scene of his shaman he keep again bringing back told y hat and kep asking about had over and over and over and i told him far get over it get over to ice it alarmed all of them and one point laser confronted for it is crag i even told him my crud this needs the top because this is not the right direction the nowt what hi slums about somebody is teaching the let me know because we can to correct that immediately a and did he seem receptive he did he say he did right and i told him i told him ill at this point people are certainly gad to wonder about what is going on where your learning the stuff from mi wane kind understanding is yam on i can talk to any abut about this do not know maybe i was reading somecorrect staff the craggy did not listen he did not stop talking about jehad he says this is what the ate i wanted because he says he was great at it i would have to in the very strategic way get your views on jehad and the a good at it in their view that they wanted to enhance i was to speak to in ten listens to day regarding jehad since the embed is not commenting i ran this by treverarinson the journalist who examined about five hundred counter tarries cases to see if he was possible he said then all of those hundreds of cases he is never heard of a coil this the ex efbiagents i spoke with had either the trover says that once a thing operation gets going it is common for under operations and informants the bate suspects by asking him about had that happens in almost every under overstaying operation i can tell you that in many of the cases have looked at that is mentioned in the criminal a a did have a avid in some way and i i think when that submitted at trial that is a really damning piece of evidence i for jerry to day crag took the stray and ran with it hammed the arabia teacher heard complaints from his friends it was the to to to the limit that one of them told me he called he keeps calling hi by for and keep sink to him go g was you o wain a minute he would whispered g ha train the for i ask crag do that happen probably i ism not denying it i may have been we conversation or something and i had done something ridiculous that but that i don't deny it a ism sure i probably did o we but we try to a accomplish with that whatever individual heard that and they did not quickly report me the i madly a suspect every steal conversation is a converse son at the fix or prosecute told say well you heard him say this numerous times and get you git into the following that we were trying to do of course if you did not think crag could get any less settle here is another tactic he would try i a lets withies meat tomorrow after is e him will work out together i teacher some things the hodgigger reforms shaped a little better you yo basis stronger bigger and at these work outs i would ask very sensitive question regarding is slum for example what do you think about about about e setup loved man was working on his beeps when craggy ask in this like to it o k some of be leading is a badly he is that he is a mother i what i mean old what we are suffering for m right now is because it fosemablati you question right now as because it fosemaba that what i m mean all of these new laws that the star acting about just searching we an sticking of whether thing an you is because it fosemaba lot he tell him ye is something that is by baguio b one day a gin him we ads serve shown up at the him it the from we as had own tho holdall c f c slash talcoboul near by cry hopped off his stationary by and introduced himself to real as a fellow muscle here is real that i left i left to go stretch out that i came back and then he he leans to us and then he said son if i met i met the shake en ago gan stand thus shake the shake a yet that i met the big my or the shake a nougat stand what did you think when he said i we we knew that his ref no son devoted we was bragging he was a smiling that he met the shake ye i came very clear hit to to us craggy told us he has never been to afcanstin but he was trying to see if these guys at the him who he never met for he would be cool to hang out with a same ben on they did not think that would be instead read says he want to get craggy to leave him alone every time he saw him he would tell him the dirtiest jokes he could come up with but i lit i don't him till i think is a i mason is yeti his goa as too but to gesinvalv i something that we were not involved with what did you tell him i did you hear about the doctor who was having sect with his patience and he said no i s he's a very interesting doctor and the he looked at me he is a vegetarian it worked craggy left him alone after that about eight months an operation fix craggy hays his hammers told him to start talking to people about an actual terrors plot a plan to blow up buildings and southern californium that happens in lots kenaf be i stings the informant suggests the plot to the suspect not the other way round a cording to treverarinson again who studied hundreds of terrors am convictions a about five hundred tears om cases since tot eleven about fifty defenders have been involved in case is where the informant came up with the idea and provided all the means but exafbi agents i talk to so that in a well rung operation the informant is not supposed to suggest the plot at the bloom first the suspect would have to declare his intention to commit an act violence without that the whole case could get thrown out of court as an treatment the person craggy suggested his plot to was a guy name imetineasy the as he is the only person we know of the craggy help catch the only person the of be i arrested as result of operation flax crag had met the as e one night at the ermine most ashamed crags arabia teacher introduced them the she was a family man very different from the egyptian ex plot players he had a wife and two young kids and taught in a near by language school he as he grew up went of gangsta but he have lived in californium for eight years he in cried went out for coffee and the hid it off the star to hanging out a lot sometimes with hammed one fridge the three of them were driving to a most where hammed was subdural to give a sermon he as he did not wanted to an interview for our story but here is hammed easy was sitting in the back seat and a frug was sitting in the passenger and i was driving and here is crag a k a for run and as started to bring up new what what should we really do as muscles now that our brothers son sis o been blown up a gangsta and the rock in is olden frug where living in ermine the most peaceful city and merry is you n why i just do not the way that ten i making government is handing situations you kalitside himself in was liking oka and what are we supposed to stay here watch our natural champs should games play box everything else while our brothers been killed and you stop talking about som than i became very aggressive and is in thru what to is trying to get into exactly i say we should carry out a terrace attack in this country because ism tired to staying around with nothing have got a access to weapons i doll had do things we should boy something silence was mud day on the car i did not say a word until we arrive to the mosque i refused to talk at all i the first thing that came into my mind that i i i thought tatisaa straight shot turns and at that at that point i i fill conscaps from him he scared me hammed glance into the rear view mir and sane as taring back at him you look shock crag's head was down he was now playing with his phone no one said anything for the remaining twenty minutes of the ride to the mosque the drive back home was the same after they parted ways with rang hammed in the as he talked about what had just happened they decided they had to do something they did what all america are supposed to do in the situation but can foremen if fesses tell us we should do when some one says he has access to weapons and wants to use them they reported crime to be f b i as a potential terrorist coming am what happens exactly when you turn in someone to the f b who is working for the f b i sand black story continues in a minute from chico pubic radio when our program continues is america li from or glass to day's program the convert the stray of an f b i under cove reparation from two thousand six that wen very badly is i think a fair way to say it and the uneasy relationship between some muscles in the f b i and why that might be and as i said to the top of the shall we first round to day's program back in twenty twelve and when eventing at to day because the case that the documents was argued had the supreme coria last month it is tar to say ism what exactly constitutes failure if your government informant but i think that being turned over to authorities has a possible trash yourself by the people who you think our terrace that is got to be on the last stride that is not red sand back picks up our story where we left off hammed in the ans he wanted to report cry to the f b but they were not sure who to call or haw to do it they reached at to human a lousy husamas director of the council on america illogic relations in southern californium now is car and well known member of the muslin community there just hours after the corrade he got a phone call for hammed here is human he was terrified i means the a did not know what to do wit nervous he told me i know you deed wit the f be and i know you wok with please what do i do know hammed was with nisi they were both the afraid that if fragment ahead with his plot they would somehow be responsible he pass the phone to nisi he was also panicking crazy i ma both of them did not know what us a told him theory about it cam dam is you are not responsible for anything your doing the right thing you calling the authorities even if the gay is planning on anything you e you have nothing to worry what you are not accomplices what did you what what did you think was going on when you got this calm the are three possibilities either he is recruited by casa or his a on wolf doing things on his own or he is do not get for somebody else as as as an a propmen either way is bad news must told hammed in the ai that he would cell me f be for years he would been intending monthly meetings with agents who toped to to the good relationship with the muslin community and he was friends wit stove towel head of the f bees an laaffist whusamad actually organized the outreach meeting you heard about earlier the one were tibwell promise that the f pig would not send people in the mosques an announced human called tibwell on hisseltan and told him what had happened to hammed in the ai they thought this guy in the car might be series again here is human well you don't thanks human you you doing the right thing than these gentlemen this is exactly why were proud of walking with he most some community and headband i did mention i shots as you kris a white guy a white convert an evil said oh that is what he said oh oke thank you has that that is thus great in formation and the willwill let what happens say away with it do not do not you need his name cause i had his name and i have his address because they did you where he lived he said well dory about it ana we work closely with even pity and the we will take care from it wold take care of it from from here thou about it i thus thus one my doubts thought it you don't playing in my heads i felt the was something strange tibwell would not speak to me for this story i do not know what he thought when his own informant was reported to him as a terrorist but not long after this phone calm the f be launched in investigation in the crag which no matter how you look at it was a very strange undertaking f bi agents we are going around asking questions about an f be in formal treating him as an actual suspect they were investigating be special agents not only interview hammed in the ai they also questioned other people who been hanging out with crag i taught to five people who willingly took part in these interviews at the time they thought they were helping catch a dangerous person managed in ghazi even when in front of the judge in orange skinny superior court and got a restraining order against crag that he could not come within two hundred yards of the mosque but looking back the people the fix interviewed told me there was something weird about the way the agents were acting through this whole ordeal they just did not seem tat concerned the air one of the egyptians said the was not what he imagined would happen when you call in the feds on a possible terrorist my picture in my head as if you go and bring that up it is o let us go it is find s person let us make sure were stop and ham they would be at his dor immediately dirty car is tea move style and i break and let us get this a that was not reaction i i was not to reaction her again that the agents did ask questions about keg how often did he come to the mosque who else did the hang out with what kinds of things did he say but with the over and others they gradually began to ask more personal questions how many times did you talk with frug about glad what do you things g he means when did you come did the united states again laser the is know exactly what was gone on they knew he was there informant i think it was just another way for that o kind's get a say and talked to them some people were visited by the fix more than once hammed one day bi agents surprised am at his house he asked them how the investigation into frug was going the told him freak was the dangerous my and he would be in trouble soon but hammed says the agents were there to talk about some one else the as macalld questions about ma no how much information i know about him i i told my i i do not know anything about him an as except that he is a person that comes an printing the mountain to most and a enormous tough the community i any known before that i i do not know very much information with him they said enol we just want a to collect more information about that person i told him i i told you what i know about him that is all this was strange for hammed the ai was the one who would helped him report crag why were the agents asking about him by the spring of two demand seven the f b i had hunted in on ghazi it is unclear exactly why but court records reveal one thing that got their attention one of the a sisters was married to a man named a mean a hah a hath was designated as ta derris by the as

a designated terrorist they also charged him for using inconsistenfersions of his full name on official forms and for not disclosing two trips he would made to pack as ten years earlier but was interesting about neap's arrest is what he was not charged with he was not charged with associating with terrorist himself he was not charged with plotting an attack and he was not charged for anything he would ever said to crag over the course of months of recorded conversations still at neap's bad hearing the prosecutor argued that he was a danger to the community to prove that she called

supposedly instigated the conversations with was kragmonte i asked crag about it did near ever instigate this kind of conversation with you no no i did every time craggy has changed his story on this when the ai was arrested in two thousand nine he basically said to complete opposite he said ghazi recruited him for a terraced operation but crag says now he is telling the truth he says what really happened is that he went after near more aggressively than any one ghazi wanted a friend and he tolerated rag's g had talk more than most that anybody ai was he try to impress me he is five five or and i i was somewhat intimidating to him he gutted listen along with what i said he say he wanted to be a parton this but he did not say to me no i do not this very bad to n do when you be recorded did he feel have got this got his ideologically leaning towards g had what i thought was i can bring him there he is afraid he look that he was scared which is what i wanted him to be and my haters told me try bring real him in more and he was his clip mesmerize by me i talked to people who know near and they backed this out near went toward craggy but at the same time he was enthralled by him at least until the moment when he and hammed decided to turn drag in to the f p e the government kept name under house rest for more than a year with a curfew an an ankle bracelet hen i reached out to near for this story he set me a statement it says in part when the f b a agent threatened to make my life the living hell unless i became an informant which i refuse the f b i made true its promise and really did make my life o living hell in the past few years my family and i have been struggling very hard to piece back together our lives the government eventually decided it did not want to pursue neap's case it filed emotion to dismiss all of the charges operation flax ended without a single known conviction one person did go to jail bell kragmonte six months after crag was reported as a potential terrorist the urine police arrested him for a bazaar unrelated crime it turned out that during operation fly he been running a side hustle calming two women out of more than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in a scheme to traffic human growth form he met the women at the same gems where he was modeling muslin he went to prison for eight months craggy sued the f eye over this claiming the whole thing was part of an pi drug sting and that his hammers conspired to have him arrested after he became useless an operation flex ta judge recently through the case out you can probably imagine what operation flex and its aftermath did two relations between the f p i and the mouton community nor edge county who saw ma loge the head of care and southern californium remembers the moment at neap's bail hearing when the fix revealed that craggy was an undercover foremen who say was in the courtroom is almost a dagger in my back i felt betrayed the whole common not just me we felt betrayed because we talk about a partnership if you see something reported you suspect e criminal behavior call the police people were saying why should we do it we got o be the one the talked of the investigation the reality is the never thought of us for them we were always suspect we were always deemed a suspect or potential tears operation flies did not just make people suspicious of law enforcement it made them suspicious of each other many people i talk to ta they stay away from new conference now they have a hard time believing people are who they say they are here is man the egyptian i who first befriended drag really what they i is they lead everybody that in the moss look trust everybody nobody nobody would talk about it but nobody would yo would see weird looks e load me people are looking at each other wert i i do not low may be i was sensitive or e know but but i can till tat thou the way they looked at me we just different in one of the most awkward developments of this story the muslin community is now teeming up with kragmonta the council on americanslomic relations care along with the all u is suing the fix over operation flags the government is arguing in response that allowing the case to go forward would reveal state secrets and harm national security drag is cares primary resource in the case he is now helping the people he used to spy on and he is been apologizing to some of them too he sees them often because he still lives around the corner from the ermine mosque and works out in the same him he made a special point of calling camera dellrehim when the first people he got close to ah i i i really appreciate the fact they called it an that he apologize for it but the damage his done i ow i do not know what to do i reave do not i now have a fear that i be mongered all the time i do not know how you can change that crag's not the only one apologizing after teazle's charges were dismissed he went to the court house to retrieve some of the property that the fix had seized from his house homes rope was there the talked for about twenty minutes remember role is the agent who legibly threaten ghazi we later arrested him and he then testified in court that he was a danger to society i spoke to the court employe who accompanied near to this meeting before they laughed rope went over to near an struck his hand he told piazza that mistakes have been made we are all human he said ism sorry san law he the dak mite fell maker o sit his one kingdom of silence that mate salty journalist japan kachogy is trimming on showtime be sat earlier this to pein court case that come out of these events was argued last month the ventilation in the case afpiivers is physaga is whether the epic was spying of people just because they were muslin which if true would be unconstitutional but the same quiet was not hearing arguments on that question at fall this time the quietism has not gotten to that question cause the government is trying to get the case thrown out government says the epic had good reasons to sail all these people but amount of proper defense and ex lain what those reasons are they would have to reveal secret information state secrets they would compromise national security and the saying that because their state secrets involved the courts should throw out the case entirely the lawyers bringing the suit on behalf of the muscle community an ermine argued before the supreme court the this got too far they are have to throw out the case there are ways the case can to move forward one of them there is a law the foreign intelligence surveillance act or fish they would allow a judge to look at the classified materials the takes secret still would not be public the judge could see them nobody else could and then the judge would come to a decision in the case wore the lawyers say the courts could just let the case proceed without any secret evidence at all just leave that stuff out o the case the bigger principal here in their view is tat there should be away for people to get their day and court even in a case where the government claims there are state secrets if the spring sort does allow the case to go forward the lawyer who argued the case for the muslin community glen a relax on them said ultimately if they win they wen all the information gathered in the surveillance operation to be destroyed and that is really important to the people in this community they really were upset that the government spied on them while they were just living their lives going to most in the morning they are hanging out your yeses after m playing expo a no fife with his remains and it is really deeply offensive to people that the government spit got all that information at sitting somewhere in

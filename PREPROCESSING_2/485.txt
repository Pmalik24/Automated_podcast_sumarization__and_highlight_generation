welcome to the superman la science science was ton li may indeed supermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero coss to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is for stigmatic for stigmatic is a wellness company that makes mushroom coffee and if you are asking yourself why would you want to book mushrooms in coffee first of all let me tell you these are not psychedelic mushrooms and know the coffee does not taste mushrooms the coffee is delicious and you do not taste mushrooms at all i know this because have been using for stigmatic coffee and been stocking into my laboratory for several years now long before i ever had the podcast or for stigmatic was a sponsor the two kinds of mushrooms that are in for stigmatic coffee are lions mane and choral mushrooms both of which have been shown to have a slight antibiotic effect to reduce anxiety and lions man has also been shown in several studies to lower the symptoms of depression just slightly although i would not consider it a treatment for depression that is an attractive benefit as well as have some effect at offset in connive do cline it'll be it slightly the effects were real in the studies a that have found if you would to try for stigmatic you can go to four stigmatic dot calm slash supermen that is f o you are s i g m a t i c doc calm slash supermen and if you do that you will get forty per cent off your order plus reshipping on mushroom coffee bundles that is for stigmatic dot calm slash supermen for up to forty per cent off and reshipping to day's episode is also brought to us by blinking blinkisis snap that has thousands of nonfiction books condense down to just fifteen minutes of keytakeways that you can read or listen to i may big reader and ism a big consumer of nonfiction and most of the time i consume books in their traditional form a book where you flip the pages and forth i also listen to full length audio books however over time we know that we forget lots of things and even though sometimes i think i got all the critical information from a book when i list in to blankest and i get the fifteen minute run down either in audio or in written form what i find is there see points that oftentimes i mist and it is a great way for me to both jog my memory and to bring forward ideas that i had not considered previously they have thousands of nonfiction titles and some really terrific ones in the science category for example avid elements book live wired which came out recently as a book i read in full length form and have listened to the blankest version of it as well live wired is a book about negro plasticity the brainsability to change in response to experience i get many questions and requests for books about neral plasticity in my opinion live wired is the most recent and up to day the and the best one to date that is there davits in player's book life span avid as many as as many of is a professor of genetics at harbor medical school lifespan is this terrific book about aging as a disease and the future and present of longevity treatments very interesting book as well as mat walkers book why we sleep mat of course is a professor t you see burly and why we sleep is a terrific book about we we sleep the science of sleeping and things you can do to improve your sleep all of those are on blinking but with blinks you get unlimited access to their massive library of non fiction if you to try blinking right now they have a special offer just for our audience just for superman lab pod cast listeners you can go to blinking dot come slash superman and you can try blinking are for seven d that zero cost and you will get twenty five per cent off your

superman this episode is also brought to us by monk pack monk pack is a company that makes quite friendly snacks that tasting credible but have just one gram of sugar or less as have said before in this pot cast i m not in mitosis ism not quitogenic i do not advocate or follow any one particular diet for me what works is to fast in the early part of the day and to eat lo care and quite is throughout the day that is for alertness and attention i can work and focus and i do not feel sluggish or brain fog and then at night and in the evening as when i tend to eat my carbohydrates to aid the transition to sleep that is what works for me monk pack bars are trifid snack wether not your quite all the time whether not your lo carbon even if you are not they are absolutely delicious and i do not say that lightly ism not a big fan of bars in general most bars to me takes a commination of a metal bumper mixed with some cardboard and some long trimmings and some artificial sugar on pack bars when they are sent me on cigaret it'll try them i tried it oh this is a problem cause i them very very much and and when i say it is a problem it really is a prom i actually keep the monk pack boxes in my basement that i do not tear through them all at once i may huge fan of the camail peasant flavor delicious of talking about it makes me hungry for one but they also have salt dart chocolate pin a butter dark chocolate they are terrific in addition of being quite friendly there also gluten are plant bast nongiamo nose a transfer sugar a calls or artificial colors s all the bad stuff that you do not want and as i mention before their quite less than one gram of sugar if you want a try monk pack you can go to monk pack do come that is m u n k pack do coat and enter the cot superman at check out and you'll get twenty per cent off your first purchase of any monk pack product that is m u n k p c do come and enter the cot superman oh neck out to get twenty percent off your purchase this month we have been talking all about hormones which are these absolutely incredible chemicals in our brain and body they impact are entire life span from the time that we are in the womb they are controlling the development of our brain and our bodies after we are born they are still controlling the development of our brain and bodies and i did say development and that is because contrary to what most people thing development last the entire life span from the time you are conceived until the time you die you are developing you are changing and hormones are constantly updating and changing the different functions of your body they have two major kinds of effects one are immediate effects they can actually bind too or con parkin parking spots on cells and impact all sorts of things the growth of cells et camera they also can control gene expression this is the way that hormones during puberty control body hair growth and abreast development and growth of muscles and limbs and height an all sorts of things they are incredible we have talked about testosterone and estrogen we talked about insolent and glucagon and somebothe other things to day we are going to talk about metabolism mainly going to talk about thyroid hormone and growth hormone and some other related pathways ism going to explain to you the logic of how thyroid hormone and growth hormone work it will become obvious why have paired thyroid and growth hormone together in the same episode and i will of course talk about tools that you can use to elevate or reduce thyroid hormone there are cases where people want to reduce thyroid horn i will talk about toolstat you can use to elevate growth hormone there rare cases where people want to reduce growth hormone most people are interested in increasing growth horn to day is going to be rich with information rich with actionable tools and as always the idea is to spell out and organizational logic you income away from this episode and infant the entire month on hormones really understanding at some level what these things we call hormones are and how they work and that is really to arm you to encounter information going forward whether not comes for me or from somebody else a book or a course some place else on line to make sense of how to work with these incredible chemicals we call hormones before we begin to talk about thyroid and growth hormone and how are metabolism works and how to control metabolism i want to answer a few questions that i received from you from the audience every once and while someone will send me hey quite earnest question about something they saw on the internet and one of the things have heard about quite a bit in the last coup of weeks we have been talking about hormones and food in take and how shows interact is this question of are certain foods particularly good for certain organs of the body and can that be predicted on the basis of the shape of those foods first of all i want to acknowledge the question as a valid one because the the i see this every once in a while out there people will say well walnuts are in the shape of the brain and therefore they are good for your brain or a particular fruit the beat often looks a heart in its good for your heart and i certainly invite questions of all kinds provided the sincere questions however i am not aware of any science whatsoever supporting the idea that the shape of a given food or object for that matter is relevant to its functional role in the body in reference to biology now beats contain something thatweregongto talk about to day that contain a substance called argentine which actually can control the dilation of blood vessels and arteries it has some relationship to heart and heart health walnuts contain various fatyacids that may be i wane not underscore maybe beneficial for certain aspects of brain health but there is no evidence whatsoever that the shape of the food itself is relevant and i think whats happened is is that a people have gone out there and found foods that contain certain substances carrots and vidomanae or walnuts and particular fatyacids or a beats and argentine and they have selected the foods that happen to be in the shape of the thing a the organ that the particular substance videmonae or fadiacids and forth might benefit or support but of course therefore many many other sources of the nutrients that do not come from walnuts or from beats a or from carrots and i guess the short way to put it is that the idea that the shape of some some food om is in indication of whether not that food would be healthy for particular organ in the bodies absolutely unfounded i do not know of any evidence for it and ism not out to quashanybodies o great love of these foods i enjoy all the foods i just described but the shape of things in the physical universe bears very little a if any on relevant to the neutrinos that it can that it contains and therefore the organs that its supports thank you for your question but o if you see that out there om i would a i do not even this you need to tell the person whose putting that information out to the world i would just back away slowly one other thing before we move into to days material last episode i talked about the problems with mollifies in highly process foods and the way that they can strip the mucosa lining of the gut and they can limit the signaling of hormones c c k that can signal to the brain in satiety this signal to stop eating and then we got into a discussion about artificial sweeteners and i throughout stein as an artificial sweetener and several people reached out to correct me that stein is not an artificial sweetener it is a non colonic sweetener and you are correct i lumped artificial and non colonic sweeteners together and thanks to many of you that also send me some references it does not appear that stein can negatively impact the gut mocrobyum it does seem unique among non colonic sweeteners they are probably others out there the other thing that we discuss is how stein can lead to slight increases in blood glucose but can also improve insolent management just slightly probably cancels to zero an terms of its impact on blood glucose provided stenotic concentrations that are supersupersweet ingestion of anything that is very sweet whether not contains calories or not artificial or not will create an insolent response in fact just walking past a bakery and smelling delicious back baked goods can increase your insolent secretion and just wanted point that out thank you for the information and the references that you found ply send additional ones if you do find them and i appreciate that you allow me to make corrections everyone swims be here and the opportunimate corrections keeps us all on the same page and please do keep any feet back that you have about particular things i cover here coming my way there is much interest in metabolism we hereabout having a high or a low metabolism there are some people out there who would to reduce their metabolism they simply cannot eat enough to maintain their weight most people however struggle with the opposite issue they struggle to maintain a healthy weight and or their metabolism is too low now their a variety of reasons why metabolism can below today we are going to talk about two hormones thyroid hormone and its related pathways and growth hormone and its related pathways which arguably are the two hormones and to systems in the body that are most significant for setting your overall level of metabolism before we dive into those i just one to cover a little bit of what metabolism is and i want to talk about which organs in your body use the most energy metabolism is the consumption of energy not severely eating but it is the use of energy in the cells of the body for growth of tissues for repair of tissues and also just for dated maintenance of function a good example of maintenance of function would be your brain most of your metabolic needs your called banal or resting metabolic needs are for your brain for thinking if you are to just sit in a bed all day and do nothing but think that consumes about seventy five per cent of your m tabloid needs now there is also moving around if you have a job that requires the lot of have you labor or lifting things or your new parent in your carrying kids around you are going up and down the stairs or back and fort through to the refrigerator for formula et camera well then your burning more energy burning more calories but even if you are very physically active unless you are and ultramarithoner or a marathoner chances are that seventy five per cent of your metabolic needs are coming just from your brain and that is because neurons consume a lot of energy r on of course ere just the nerve cells of your brain these two hormones thyroid hormone and growth hormone we think of as related to metabolism of things in the body keeping body fat low and keeping muscles strong and tendon strong and repairing themselves et camera but they are also key for brain function for the ability to maintain connive function throughout the life spin the big theme it'd to introduce is that metabolism is not just about losing weight but having a high metabolism provided s not too high is great it means that you will have more lean tissue more bone and muscle and less adapt tissue fat and we know that that is healthy how much fat and how much muscle well that varies in the numbers on this are always shifting but in general muscle and it is related tissues burns more energy than does adipose tissue or fat and the water in your body does not consume any energy metabolism can be increased simply by adding muscle to your body and reducing fat or adjusting the ratio of the two but regardless even if you are not interested in changing body composition these two hormones thyroid hormone ad growth hormone are super important from metabolism of all kinds including tissue repair after injury including maintaining connive function and well being and the ability to think clearly as you age offsetting timensia and forth the big theme here really includes the previous episodes you do not have to have seen those episodes but for the last three episodes and to day as well wee been talking about hormones these substances that are release from one location the body that go and act at other locations in the body i man tell you how that works for thyroid and growth hormone but now that you have heard about testosterone and estrogen and and you're going to hear about theroid in growth hormone i want you to realize that there is a repeating logic first of all their neurons in your brain and an recall the hypothalamus which is just means its below the thalamus hypo it sits at the base your brain in the front share the foreman more or less above the roof your mouth may be about a centimeter or and then about a centimeter forward in most people and neurons in the hypothalamus release hormones that are called releasing hormones we have talked in previous episodes about for instance canada tropic releasing homo n those are little neurons that then signal another brain area call the pituitary to release other hormones today organ to see this again in the brain you have neurons that release third tropic or thyroid releasing hormone you also have growth hormone releasing hormones any time you hear releasing chances are those are neurons that are in your brain and the extend little wires we call axons into your pituitary and the pituitary releases a bunch o hormones into the blood stream and the pituitary releases things that most often have the name of stimulating hormone because they stimulate or organs in keeping with the theme of thyroid hormone you have thyroid releasing hormone in the brain tells the pituitary to release thyroid stimulating hormone and then the thyroid which will talk about in moment releases thyroid hormones in the testosterone and estrogen episode we talked both yo have ganatatrop in releasing hormone there is the releasing again up in the brain remember releasing hormone comes from the brain then you had things utilizing hormone and physical stimulating hormone which wherein the pituitary and those travel to the ovaries ore the testes and acted on those tissues oke please try and inbred this logic if you hear the word releasing hormone it is coming from the brain and that makes it actionable in certain ways that will return too later in addition the pituitaries is letting go of all these hormones into the bloodstream that are stimulating different tissues for thyroid its thyroid stimulating hormone and then it goes to the thyroid and the thyroid is a little butterfly shaped gland that is right around the atom's apple if you want to sea or not directly cause it is got skin over it what you would do as you would take a sip water you look in the mirror and you would swallow and the thing that moves up and down that is your thyroid now some people call t your atom's apple because it sits right near this precision in the train which is the atom's apple no matter whether not your male female or regardless what your chormozomo background is everyone has in atom's apple it tends to be more pronounced in people they got a surge of testosterone early in development because it has a testosterone sensitivity to it and that actually controls the timber the called deepness of the voice the thyroid gland sits right there and it is got four little bumps behind it call the parathyroid gland and it releases two hormones into the blood to stimulate different tissues and their metabolism when those hormones are called the for and the three this is already sounding a lot of information really easy i promise releasing hormone comes from the brain stimulating hormone comes from the pituitary and in this case where talking about the thyroid binding up that stimulating hormone and saying o i need a release something that releases the for in tee three ad guess what you can basely forget about tee for for it is not completely inactive it has some rolls but the three is the one that is more less active now what does theroid hormone do not of people think o theroid its ikemetabolism and people were hypothyroid ill have bulging eyes and a real thin and people have hypothyroid are overweight and they have their eyes are are you now half clothes or something and indeed spheroid hormone controls a lot of the features of the face and the eyes and on and it con control amounts of adipose tissue and forth but the main roll of theroid hormone of t three is to promote metabolism and that does not just mean the consumption of energy it means the utilization of energy including the build up of tissues it acts on all sorts of target tissues in the body it acts on muscle it acts on the liver it acts on the cartilage it acts on the bone and it is not just involved in using energy its also converting energy i do realize i said that twice it is involved in taking fats and breaking them down into fatiacids and converting those into eight p which is in important thing for cells to use energy it is also involved in taking sugars and turning those into energy and yes it goes to adapt tissue to fat we have different kinds of fact that all talk about today but it goes to white fat and it liberates or helps liberate some of the fats from those fat cells and use them for energy and this is why her theroid is associated with leaner bodies lower theroid is associated with deplane bodies one thing that is absolute see and is actionable were right there already in discussing tools is iodine iodine comes from things in the ocean right and here couple interesting facts about iodine and the we will talk about weather not you should be supplementing iodine or not first of all iodine is most common in desalt in help and in s weed and most people can get enough iodine from the food they eat end or the table salt they consume almost all table salt from all over the world regardless of where you are contains iodine the spheroid needs iodine in order to produce theroid hormone and you need sufficient levels of theroid hormone not too much but you need it chances are you are getting enough iodine although you might not especially those of you falling a particularly quoting duo clean diet might not be getting enough iodine here is the deal with iodine iodine combines within a monoacid that we have talked about before called ell tyrosine ell thyroxine comes from meat from nuts there are some plant sources as well it is the precursor to dopamine but in the theroid iodine combines or works with ell tyrosine to produce t three an t for a the thyroid hormones you absolutely need sufficient iodine you need sufficient a hircine and then you also need something else which is called selenium and will talk about selenium in a moment there is a condition that shows up in little pockets in the world it is not supercommon but where tit meaning it is not very wide spread but in certain areas that are airway from the ocean at one point this was historically in the midwestern stay to the united states in some mountain regions of other countries in some ere is of a africa there were far from from the ocean people would get extremely swollen bulges in their necks and this was called guitar and the reason they were getting those swollen bulges is because the third itself was hypertiphine it was growing in an attempt to turn out more theroid and because it was getting a lot of stimulating hormone from the pituitary but and i soft want to go too far off track here but as you recall the brain and he pituitary are paying attention in a cellar sense to the levels of hormones in the blood and when those hormones get too high they shut off the stimulating hormwhen they shut down the signal to make more coolie a thermostat when the levels are too low there is not enough to stopstrone in the blood stream where there is not enough estrin the brain will continue to push out the signal to make more similarly if there is not enough theroid circulating or there is not enough iodine to make theroid therefore not enough theroid hormone circulating the thyroid gland itself is not getting shut down there is tons of stimulating hormone and releasing hormone coming from the brain release release release in there is no way they can make thyroid hormones to the gangers gets bigger and bigger and bigger and of people get gaiter this is one other reasons i table salt has iodine in it although there are other foods to have iodine in it as well how much joined you need well you do not need a whole lot some people who are hypothiroidal might and i want emphasized might you absolute you talk to your doctor this is a serious matter any time your talking about a hormones ore manipulating levels of third you absolute one talk your doctor some people benefit from supplementing iodine it is contained in most salts it is in hemalaean salt not always but often i know these dasthereis a lot of a excitement about pink salts and peasants and lot the kind of artisan salt thing has kind of taken off a in the footy land which is great some of them a are actually quite taste you can just take its directly if you the taste of salt a but iodine can be supplemented through things kelp and seaweed and kelp tablets now if you are hop earthiroidle you make too much third that action can be a problem really the best way to figure thisout is to get your blood levels tested of theroid hormone but there is much iodine in the ocean that believe it or not p people that live near the coast can actually just absorb it through the air just by breathing ocean air that gives you a sense of just how little iodine you acting you to consume in food or in salt if you are within a few miles of the ocean or you visit the ocean from time to time your probably getting plenty it does have to come together as i mention with altyrisine and this is why foods that contain a tyrosine and provided that you have sufficient iodine in your diet and if you have sufficient selenium in your diet does serve to increase your metabolism and that is again is for the growth and repair of tissues and that is really important it is not just about keeping your metabolism high that you can be on the leaner side of things or just your body weigh as us me your a body composition rations the way you repair of injuries repair of brain tissue clearance of any damage from neurons clearance of any damage it that to the body is also going to depend on theroid again metabolism being this kind of rate of fuel consumption and use in the body generally not just about body massindexes and things that sort let us talk about selenium because it is really important and even though most people are getting a lot of a sufficient iodine and most people are probably getting enough altrisine ism guessing most people may not be getting enough selenium if their goal is to increase fibroid home on at least that is what the the literature says without going in to the big chemistry selenium is important in order for fibroid hormone to be made because of the way that it allows el turbine and iodine to interact and the thing is most people are not getting enough selenium because they do not eat foods that are high in selenium now the how much selenium you need will depend on where you live at actually varies country by country some countries i found a say that you should get a hundred microgram some say two hundred some ay a hundred an fifty five the average was about a hundred n fifty five micrograms the countries i looked at people who are trying to increase third levels might want t a consume more selenium and if you consume a video in of course you want a make sure a if it has selenium that you are not overdoing it by consuming a lot of selenium rich foods either but none the less i think it is fair to say that most people probably could do well by ingesting slightly more selenium than they currently are although of course always talk to your doctor brazil nuts are the heavyweight champion of foods to get selenium from it has very high concentrations of selenium in just six or eight a brazil nuts contain something five hundred and fifty micrograms of selenium it is also present in fish certain fish yellowing tuna am although nowadays whenever i mention tuna or shellfish which is the other a rich source of selenium people am will tell me immediately the there all sorts of issues around farm not farm mercury at camera a have never particularly eating i sh cause the way it taste am that is why i avoid it but for those of you the a it sure your much more skilled in ism knowing which fish stobuyn which fish not to buy ham of all things a contains a lot of selenium a for whatevereason port does ism not a be consume report o beef has some selenium but what is interesting if you look at the sources pork beef turkey chicken pottage shes eggs brown rice the what you want to understand is that brazil nuts sixtape brazil nuts has five hundred and fifty micrograms of selenium and all the other foods i mention at much greater portion size than equivalent to sit or eight o brazil nuts either by volume or by a calories they they have something thirty to fifty micrograms of selenium if you are not eating brazil nuts of messing most people are not then and you are not eating a lot of a animal based foods which i know many of you are not then your probably not getting enough selenium and again you can have these o levels measured or you can just check what you are consuming and figure out whither to your meeting the ration that you need in order to get healthy levels of thyroid it is present in things mushrooms but again in at bowl of mushrooms the what is the equivalent a a bowl of mushrooms twelve micrograms of selenium and if the daily ration is something in the hundreds to two hundred range again look it up for the air you are you can see really quickly why thing even though things mushrooms and spinach and milk and over in lentils and cashes amour into the vegetarian a semen in the list that i constructed you probably not getting enough selenium give an interesting thing if you're an experimenter you and you get the clearance from your doctor you could try increasing your selenium levels and see how that impacts your metabolism again brazil nuts are probably can to be the most direct a way to get sufficient selenium levels but because levels are high in brazil nuts it also means that you could overdo it as well ism not really aware of what the a consequences are of a getting too much selenium though you can get too much of anything and ism guessing those a consequences are not good i also want to mention that for children their daily requirements of selenium are much lower as low as thirty or forty micrograms for kids of fourteen years or younger an in some areas i really one underscore this the amount of delirium that is recommended daily is as low as fifty five micrograms it is not that you should be shooting for thousands or even hundred you now high levels of hundreds of of micrograms of selenium and again that micrograms not kilograms again look into what you need but if you are somebody who is interested in keeping thyroid function healthy and productive then you certainly want to make sure you are getting enough high don you are getting enough selenium andyou are getting enough a kerosene and it is interesting when you start looking at the various foods especially highly process foods then you start to realize that perhaps many people may you are not not incidentally selenium has some other effects on health that can be quite positive and even though these do not relate to throw to growth harmony function specifically think you might a want to know about them given that were on the topic of selenium the first is that there the studies all of which showed very high efficacy for reducing the risk of something called are eclampsia preexpose me are eclampsia a eclampsia is seizures that are related to blood pressure issues during or or around the delivery of a new baby and ashy it is a rare is condition but on inaction can be quite deadly o and the fact that selenium is important for offsetting are eclampsia risk is interesting i do not know the exact mechanism and ism guessing there only a few of you out there that are either pregnant or thinking of of conceiving soon but on that is worth noting obviously anything relate to pregnancy or lactation especially talk to your doctor o ism guessing that selenium is probably in a lot of prenatal formulas but o that is one clear benefit of having sufficient selenium the other is a reduced prostate cancer risk another a study showing that having sufficient selenium can reduce a prostate chance risk and there is some evidence that if you consume foods from areas with soil that is low and selenium that can be a problem and last episode we talked about all these issues related to a soil quality a things that are making their way into food their disrupting an a hormones and forth on but having sufficient selenium from food could offset the low content in any soil and that apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk it is a minor effect but it is a statistically significant one and the other one is a reduction in any which is interesting it on guessing that that probably has to do with the thyroid harmony pathway because of the way thyroid harmony can impact ta liver and it turns out that the liver and various a big chemical reactions in the liver can impact acne and that is eolian episode all into itself but those are just some additional a benefits of getting sufficient selenium case we are already keeping to tools related to making sure that you have sufficient selenium iodine and el tiracene in order to make enough fibroid hormones that can support your metabolic processes in your liver your muscles your tendons for whatever purpose keeping your metabolism high o for body composition reasons or for healing o for keeping your brain working well earlier i mention there are people who are following very clean diets these are people that consume no process foods any starch they might eat is going to be it may be a rice or a grain or o an any proline they might consume is going to be either from let us hope from a humanely raise a animal sources or maybe their pure plant based believe or not those folks are actually very susceptible to lo iodine because it turns out that diets that are very meat rich and do not have many vegetables as well as diets that are very vegetable rich but do not have many meats or salts are at risk of lowering thyroid hormone by way of the iodine pathway and other pathways and delete trine simplify this for you chances are if people are doing the all meat diet they are not sprinkling they are not wrapping those stakes in seaweed am and they may or may not be supplementing with iodine a chances are there probably consuming iodine salt but there there requirements go up if they are it consuming vegetables people who are consuming vegetables have interesting we always here that we should have our cruciferous vegetables and those are important but there actually substances a compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables that can interfere with thyroid harmony function if you are eating a lot of that stuff a lot of cabbages and you will just look up your other i think brolly as a cruciferousivegetable and i will not read off the whole miss you could just a put into the inner net but if you are you know we are always told to eat a lot of the dark leafy green stuff well unless that dark leafy green stuff is kelp am or seaweed chances are that we are not getting enough iodine unless we are adding salt to our food and chances are that we may be lowering the total amount of thyroid that we are making as well as the fact that in plant rich diets it is hard to get enough el tirasene and i do not want that you now e not here to inflame any of the a the vegans or the carnivore folks i do not take a stance either way on any of that just learning turn report the science the point i want a make is your health is important if you are purely plant base and you are eating a lot of cruciferous vegetables make sure you regretting enough iodine it does seem the cruciferousivegetables can increase the need for further iodine and something if you are purely you are on this all meat dieter you are quite and you are not a investing many vegetables i always thought that the cleaner the diet the better but it turns and probably that is true from the standpoint of of a hormone regulation a estrogen and testator on another and other hormones the highly process foods really are terrible am there much evidence for that the sallies in plastics and the process foods and the emulsifiers all the stuff we talked about previous episode but it does seem to be that am people that are not getting enough iodine for whatever reason really meed too check out whether or not the iodine levels need to be increased because of the fact that they are consuming many plants or many meats and not and in some cases plants that actually lower third hormone and not to beat a dead horse or cabbage but there are a number of things that iodine can do that are positive that are s ort of there related cothieroid not directly there kind of offshoots to the theroid pathway on their down stream of it we would say on interns how they impactmentabolic function one of those is to reduce something called a reactive proline some of you may have heard of sarge or a reactive proline we reactive proline is something that you want to keep at modestly low levels its associate with inflammation and various forms of heart disease in even i disease macula degeneration it does appear that a iodine supplementation or getting sufficient iodine from food either works a is associated with a reduce levels of a reactive prone in the blood and an anting inflammatory effect in the ant an inflammatory effect brings us back to our old friend inter can six remember there these inflammatory sidakinds there yo have many many names because there are many many of them interlunar ten is the one that is anti an inflammatory interlunar six is the one that is inflammatory any time you see i el six that usually means that there is an inflammatory response there is a wound ah there is inflammation of the brain somebody is either sleep deprived or had a brain injury or their dealing with some sort of a infection lie six is kind of a catchall for inflammation and it does appear that iodine supplementation can reduce circulating isle six associated with a inflammation in that sense iodine can have an anti inflammatory effect by now it should be abundantly clear if you care about spheroid harmony if you care about the pathways that it impacts having a highlevelmtabolism which i guess if for no other reasons attractivecaus tan you can eat more and still maintain a a healthy body composition but also for brain health cognac function tissue repair all that stuff keeping we reactive proline low keeping isles sic slow mature a getting enough iodine selenium an altirisine if your curious how theroid actually increases metabolism allows you to eat more et camera it relates to something recovered last issue which is glucose remember when you eat something blood sugar goes up insolent is secreted from the pancreas and it make sure that blood glucose does not go too high which can damage tissues or too low which you make you hypoglycemic theroid increases glucose uptake by various tissues in particular muscle and bone it actually can increase bone mineral density which is a really good thing as you get older injuries any when i say older i mean easily thirty and older you the the reason you can recover more quickly from injuries if you have a healthy spheroid and healthy thyroid pathways is because you can conconsume energy that energy is diverted toward bone repair and muscle repair in cartilage repair and the way it does this again is by increasing a t p but the whole idea here is that iodine selenium althirocine allow hero to be healthy levels that theroid then can take glucose in the blood and divert it to tissues for it to be used in particular your brain and that is why these things that we are talking about supplementing your getting from food can actually in prove or support brain function people are always ask me what is the food that i should eat for my brain our blueberries good for your brain or they do ask me our wellness good for your brain cause the looks a brain we talk by that earlier the fact of the matter is that what you need our nutrients that support hormones and biological pathways that support the brain that is the way to think about it and i realize when people ask what should i eat to support my brain that is basically what they are asking in short form keeping your theroid harmony healthy at healthy levels that is is going to be terrific for your brain because seems ifiperos in your metabolism is from your brain the ability of your brain to use gluecosts or ketones for that matter is going to be aided by having healthy theroid do the things take the things eat the things that a can allow you to have healthy levels of theroid harmony ism sure a number of you are out there wondering do i have healthy levels of hieroyid harmony those can be measured from the blood there's some tell tels that signs of having really high theroid or really low theroid and i could start listing those off there easy to find on line as well things bulging eyes inability maintain weight shaky anxiety that is on a hyper theroid of thinning of hair this kind of thing i i do not want to get into diagnosing hypo thieroydism and hyper thieroydism it is just in possiblecause they are you are there and ism here and we are cone a shouting back and forth through a tunnel of video and comments if you are concerned about having excessively high or excessively low levels of theroid harmony absolutely a look up what the symptoms are talk to your physician u and there are a number of good treatments i did not talk about prescription drugs that can improve symptoms related to hypo or hyper theroid of course they have emphasized theroid if you do not make enough theroid you can take theroid its my prescription if you take have too much theroid sometimes they will take out the theroid gland or they can administer drugs that will either block receptors or will interfere with some of the pathways from the brain on to the pituitaries from the pituitary to the theroid in order to adjust thought theroid harmony that way there are that the big guns o in terms of the treatments for different third disorders u but we are not tuning about third disorders we are talking about how to get and maintain theroid levels in healthy ranges and some straightforward ways to do that through diet and supplementation there is also a lot of evidence that for people who menstruate levels of theroid harmony can fluctuate dramatically across the menstrual cycle that is really going to be a process of experimentation i do not know that you could nest you could in theory take blood at different phases of your chycoll and figure out weather not your theroid harmony was successively higher low at different phases of the cycle that is can be pretty tough to do if you haven't enter chronologist that is willing to a do that with you terrify i think most people are going to have to figure out how supplementing the sorts of things that we talked about before or getting them from foods relates to different aspects of their cycle in general the first half of the cycle before ovulation people a crate carbohydrates and sweets more related to the and that makes total sense a based on the biology of the menstrual cycle a thyroid hormone is going to go up as you as any one male or female menstruating or not increases more starch carbohydrates this is interesting because keitogenic diets have been shown to slightly lower thyroid levels and that makes sense because in erogenic diets blood glucose levels are very low and thyroid hormone is secreted in large part in proportion to how much glucose is in the bloodstream and how much that bluclos glucose use me needs to be regulated ism not thing to demonize the ketogenicdiet i think its i defiantly has its place there are twenty two studies now showing that it can dramatically reduced blood glucose and about a third of those show that thyroid hormone levels are slightly reduced sometimes significantly if not a more in the biogenic diet that may explain i want a highlight may explain the fact that when people go back to a more traditional diet if they have been on a ketogenicdiet for a long time that oftentimes they will gainsaid very quickly as they bring carbohydrates back into their diet some people are cycling between keitogenic and on qeitogenic every three four days call cycle keitogenicdites somepeople saying keitogenic for long periods of time some people stays on one day off as a huge variation there the point is that carbohydrates starch carbohydrates an reticular support the healthy production of keithree and tee for and if you're very low carbohydrate you're going to have a reduction in three and tee for and if you arguing to bring carbohydrates back in to your diet than you might want do it more gradually and for those of you that menstruate and are craving carbohydrates in the early part of the cycle that is actually associated with having a healthy cycle if any of you have had a a healthy cycle on a keitogenicdit that would be interesting may be let me know through the comments or or point in the direction of some research if your aware of it as you can start to tee there this really beautiful interplay between the different hormones between insolent and glucose between estrogen and thyroid between thyroid and a blood glucose and the keitogenicdites it's all starts to fit together in ways that make a lot of cents once you understand just cold of the core elements of what the hormones are and the variety of tissues that they work on the simple version of this is if you have not had a carbohydrate for a year then your the three tee four levels are going to be pretty low and ism sure there some keitonistoes out there they can say wait no thyroid hormone levels go up with kept that might be true for other reasons indirect reasons related to hormone pathways that ere cascade from being in ketosis for long periods of time great but for most people that do not consume any carbohydrate tee three terror on to go down and when they start to consume foods that require thyroid metabolism in order to work with to metabylaz than wait gain can sometimes happen more quickly is just something to consider and it of something to work with carefully if you are going to be split keetogenic long turn keetogenic and if you are not keetogenic and your consuming carbohydrates and the three things that we talked about earlier selenium kerosene and iodine chances are unless there is an underlying condition there that your levels of thyroid are going to be in healthy range next we are going to talk about growth harmony growth hormone has received a ton of attention in the last twenty years act you remember when it was for sequence this was a huge deal there is a huge patent drama i will not mention the universities of the people involved there were companies and monster patents and pay outs and it was really interesting you can now look that up when line if you are interest n some o the scientific history growth hormone is a pretty straightforward one for you to understand now because it allows the exact same logic as thyroid harmony in fact their functions are closely overlapping on the you known we first look at the face of it that your prolegane thing than why do you have these two systems just very briefly can growth hormone releasing hormone remember releasing means it comes from the brain comes from the brain and tells the pituitary to release growth harmony and then growth hormone is released into the bloodstream where it goes and acts on a ton of tissues morsel ligaments on fat et camera to increase metabolism it sounds just thyroid harmony and they do work in parallel that is why we have lump them together in the same episode they increase metabolism and repair and growth of tissues conversation about growth hormone would be in complete if we did not talk about the kind of extremes there are certain people who are born that do not make enough growth harmony and they and up very short in stature there are certain people who make a ton of growth harmony and they and up very very large they can't have very large appendages they have something called a acromagalley it is coming a ridging of the on of the forehead is such my a bone ridge they are giant and off it used to be called giantism and most people of course are in a range of height and a appendage length that does not imply that there is a growth harmony disruption there growth hormone received a lot of attention after it was sequenced because that meant the opportunity to inject growth harmony and replace grow hormone that was lost and there was actually lot of cases of people taking there kids and trying to get them to be taller for whatever reason a injecting growth harmony to day we are on to talk about the things that any one can do to increase growth harmony and there reasons why certain peoplewoul want to do that people w over produce growth harm certainly would not want to do that people underproduce it would of would probably want to do that people that make normal quit and quoth levels of growth hormone might want to do that as they age because during purity and development the pituitaries churning out tons of growth hormone its responsible for the growth not surprising of the body and all its features height just being one of those and as we age we make less growth hormone and that is one of the reasons why we recover more slowly from injuries it is one of the reasons why we accumulate body fat and it is one of the reason why are metabolism slows and growth hormone replacement therapy has been tremendously popular in the last twenty years is not to say it does not carry its problems it does here is one of the major problems with injecting growth hormone not saying people should not do this if the doctor has approved it or its of in keeping with their particular life goals but growth hormone if its in levels that are too high will cause growth of all tissues not just muscle not just reduction of nobody fat by metabolizing o but by allowing a fhatiacids to be pulled out a storage and used for a to but it will also cause increase in growth of the heart and the lungs and the liver and the spleen and this is the concern with abuse of growth hormone were not can we talking about abuse of growth hormone we will however talk about tools that anyone can use too increase levels of growth hormone some of them are behavioral some of them are supplement based and some of them interact with behaviors and supplements and what is cool about the discussion about growth hormone is that the tools that exist out there to increase growth hormone are very actionable most people can do these without the need for any equipment or even any supplement although there are some supplement related o themes for tools for growth hormone increase and also the increases that one can get in growth hormone are substantial normally when you talk about the difference between taking something as an exogenous substance o testastronor astern verses using supplements are behaviors to increase them you are talking about tenfold differences from i now administering the prescription compound in terms of growth hormone their things that can increase growth hormone three four five hundred per cent or more and even though that is a short live t increase they can have very powerful effects on metabolism and on repair of tissues at talk about those of let us go step by step in terms of the things that any one perhaps every one should be doing in order to maintain healthy growth hormone levels or increase growth hormone levels unless you have over production of growth hormone chances are these things are going to benefit to you however as always i want to emphasize talk to a doctor before you do any thing including remove any treatments anything you would add or take away that is responsibility of you and sure healthcare provider i do not you say that a protect me i say that to protect you first of all growth hormone is released every night when you go to sleep and it is released in the early part of sleep during called slow wave sleep the two conditions that have to be met in order for growthhormon to be secreted regularly for tissue repair et camera are you need to get into slow wave sleep that called deep sleep and you need blood in skin and glucose to be relatively low eating within two hours of sleep excuse me eating within two hours of going to sleep is going to suppress growth hormone release that is very clear however some people are going to have problems falling asleep if they are too hungry you have to work with that and decide what you are going to eat and when you are going to eat that thing that you are not hungry that your having trouble falling asleep the episodes on sleep that were covered in episodes to three and four of the superman podcast as i believe more tools there than a you and ever want or make use of in terms of how to optimize sleeps you can refer to those if you do not eat too close to sleep and then get into slow wave sleep and as i talked about in one of those earlier episodes the first half of the night slow wave sleep and deep sleep predominate the second half the night it is another kind flee we call red sleep what is special about this early phase of sleep this is how you should be thinking if you listen to this podcast you should be thinking of i hear that something is important it is related it is in the pathway but mechanistically when we say get into slow wave sleep get into deep sleep that is when growthhormona secreted the question you should be asking yourselves as scientists of yourselves is wait why slow wave sleep what in particular about slow wave deep sleep allows the pituitary to release growth hormone what what is it because if you can understand that if you can understand a little bit of mechanism there are actually ways that you can increase the amount of growthhormon that your release both in sleep and out of sleep the answer is it is delta wave activity in the brain delta waves are these big giant waves of activity in the brain that a correlate with slow waves sleep as supposed faster waves of activity that associate with japan i movement sleep slow wave sleep and the delta activity actually triggers the neurons in the brain the releasing hormone right growthhormon releasing hormone neurons to to signal to the pituitary now how do i know this is true and what can you do with this well we know this is true because researchers have taken people and sleep deprive them and they just asked well is it just one period of time every twenty four hours and then the pituitary releases growth hormone if that were the a we that would say that growth hormone is just released in the called circadian dependent way every twenty four hours is the pulse of it but no it is always relating to slow wave deep sleep and delta waves and this is cool because what it means is that even if you are not measuring your brainwaves during sleep which most you probably are not you might be measuring slow wave sleep or deep sleep using a a device a whoop er infra and even if you are not what this means is that during the day there's the potential to also increase growth hormone release if you can get the brain into the called delta waves and it turns out the are things you can do in waking as well to increase growth hormone release organ talk about those next but as a tool and to just really make sure it we put brackets around this try and have blood glucose not too high if you do need o eat close to bed you wouldn't one et anything the would increase blood glucose too much try and not eat too close to bedtime get into deep sleep early in the night get the growth hormone release and understand that it is the delta waves of activity these sweeping big waves of activity in the neurons that stimulate the brain to stimulate the pituitary cause once you understand that then you have something to anchor to in terms of thinking what are the things i can do in waking that will allow me to release more growth hormone which for most people is going to be a good thing several times before on this podcast have talked about the fact that ism not a big fan of melatonin supplementation for most purposes it might be helpful under conditions of jet lag however there are gotta reasons why i personally do not melatonin it interacts with the reproductive hormones to stostron and estrogen and that whole axis in was that are unattractive least to me it suppresses puberty during development it is present in much much higher doses in most supplements then one would normally make hundredfold three hundredfold however to day man to talk about an instance where very low levels of melatonin supplementation might actually be advantageous and that is aiding the transition to the delta waves slow wave sleep i just described because that is the pattern of sleep and brainwave for activity that triggers growth hormone release whereas most melatonin supplements are one telegram three telegrams twelve telegrams this kind of thing that is superphysiological there are some data showing that microgram may be five hundred micrograms of melanoma half a telegram can be beneficial in shifting the pattern of early night sleep toward more of the slow wave deep sleep delta activity and improving growth hormone release not a lot of studies but the ones that i saw are quality om they were done in subjects that a both sexes om sufficient numbers et camera this s interesting if you are interested in e melatonin supplementation you might think about it just in tern yet very low levels mi hundreds of micrograms that suppose to the telegram dosages most of the one's out there are going to be in telegram dosages that is one way that some studies a have shown that you can increase the amount of growth hormone that secreted in early phases of sleep now the dealt away of activity and the slow way of activity in the brain being very important for growthormon release and growthormon release being important for metabolic functions and pealing away unwanted body fat and repairing tissues et camera forces us to ask wet what other things can we do in waking in order to increase growth hormone release let us start with the ones that have a a potentially big effect but are little bit harder to access and for that i want a point toward a book which is really kind of interesting it is not focus on growth hormone but the book is called altered traits this is the book om it is an excellent book on alter traits by bellman and davidson science reveals how meditation changes your mine brain and body very interesting book a for those of either interesting meditation and perhaps those of you who are not but are considering it they what they talk about in this book is the fact that meditation has two separate lines of effects one of those lines of effects are things that change your state your street you sit down you meditate and you relax in you going to particular state the other are the changes that occur over time and those are changes in trait personality can actually change with long bouts of of of t m meditation or repeated meditation in any case the reason were talking about alter traits to day is because certain types of meditation can get people's brains into states that very closely mimic slow wave sleep if you hear snoring in the background cops stelhois semsicies in slowly sleep these big dilatory snores o that he is in twenty three point six hours per day what this means is for for people that are interested in increasing growth hormone a meditation practise that allows you to get into these slowwave delta type frequency a activity in the brain may be very beneficial because as i mention before that is what is gating growth hormone release it is not just the circadian phenomenon its actually control by these a brainwaves i did look up by normal beats i get many questions about by normal beats and it is a really attractive idea right by normal beats for those you do not know you listen to one frequency of tone do in one ear and another frequency of tone an the other yare potato and then the the brain essentially takes the average of the to or there some there some other wiring in the brainstorm that makes it not quite the average but takes the the average of the to for sake of discussion and that frequency is what the brain in train wins or maps on to there a are a lot of acts that are claiming that you can get the brain into delta waves using by normal beats i could not find quality pure review studies supporting that but i know their lot of fans out there of by normal beats if of any literature that is independent of the company that makes the by normal beat technology unbiased research please send it my way but in alter traits on woman and davidson talk about the fact that people who do twenty minutes of sitting meditation per day can access these slow waves sleep a reinstates now have talked a lot on here about non sleep deep rest on things yogonedra and hypnosis ism not aware that those will put people into slow waves sleep per say ore delta waves person we talking about twenty minutes of more traditional type meditation o case o we talked about very low doses of maletonan as a way to trigger delta waves and more growthhormon release in sleep their science to support that were were now talked about a waking behavior of twenty minutes of of what i pul call standard meditation are just sitting there concentrating on one's breathing to try and access delta waves mineral beats no science yet who knows maybe their science to support it if you are aware of it let me know now let us move to the things that one can do that have been shown to have what is less just beyond just i pretty enormous effects on growthhormon release in waking and these are things that are very actionable one of the things that can have a dramatic effect on levels of growthhormon release in waking as well as in sleep the following night is exercise but the key is the type of exercise and the duration now there is a logic to this there are hundreds if not thousands of studies measuring growth hormone both during or sometimes after exercise or the following night and the conclusion that one takes away from all these is that exercise has to be of particular duration and intensity in order to get growth hormone release first imjuscan to tell you what i found to be the maximum amount of growthhormon release as it relates to a particular form of exercise the particular form of exercise is either weight training or it can be endurance training but the endurance training and the weight training actually have to be limited to about sixty minutes not much longer now this is important because it is been shown over and over again that if one exercises too long with waits or endurance exercise that cortex all levels go high enough that it starts to inhibit the testosterone and even the estrogen pathways this is why i believe people who over exercise or exercise a lot can lose their menstrual cycles they stop menstruating s why you get suppression in to stastrone if people train too lo no in too hard the cut off has always been sixty to seventy five minutes of the hard work part it is gotten a very a lot from person a person but in terms of growth hormone the conditions that seem to lead to the greatest growthrorman release it are one get warm this is interesting were in talk about temperature a proper warm up seems to accelerate the release of growth hormone once the hard work phase starts a ten minutes of warm up or was the number that i extracted from all these studies is a beautiful review on this by the way a growth hormone responses wavering do ascus me growthhormn argentine and exercise will talk about argentine in a few minutes that is by cannily ka a n a l e we it was publish in current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic clay the current opinion journals are are generally of pretty high quality in terms of the reviews just because they tend to be pretty resent and then the references therein a are also quite good what does this mean this means warm up and when you say warm up it does not mean just warm up the limbs and tissues thatyou are going to use you do not get injured actually warm o the body there was actually some discussion about whether not in cold winter months people should wear a a stocking cap bringing the conditions a of making the room warm getting the body warm as a warm up seems to be important because temperature of the body seems to be an important condition or prerequisite for certain patterns of exercise to maximize growthhormon release since really interesting to me i have an obsession with how body temperature light exercise and food interact we are going right there with the fact that if you get warm you bring up the body temperature a degree or too or may be three and then start exercise it does appear that high intensity exercise but not again as in discussed in a previous episode not exercise that brings muscles to failure but close to it if it is weight bearing exercise it would be getting close to that a final repetitions where you cannot complete them but not pushing through those or even going to failure but getting close leads to anywhere from three hundred to five hundred per cent increases in resting growthhormon levels and three hundred to five hundred per cent increases in growth hormone the following night when you go to sleep which is incredible now i wane to dissect this properly o case one of the other conditions that seem to be important again was to have relatively low blood glucose it looks looking a lot the conditions you need for sleep in order to get maximum growthhormon release in sleep not having blood glucose too high or too low that is a discussion unto itself you want o have sufficient energy to do the exercise but getting warm not having blood glucose too higher too lot are probably not eating too close to exercise or n to in jesting a lot of sugars during the exercise that was supported by the fact that ingestion of a sport strength that contains colonic sugar immediately flat lined the growth hormone levels really interesting relationship between insolent glucose and growth hormone then doing the training for anywhere from sixty to seventy five minutes to maximize growthhormon release and then the other interesting thing was that even after the exercise taking body temperature back down to normal levels relatively quickly seem to be associated with these big spikes in growth hormone otherwise what would happens get these big spikes in growth hormone but if the exercise went too long or if body temperature remain too high for too long then you did not get the second increase in growth harmony the following night is i hope i made that abundantly clear warm up well get body temperature up exercise sixty to seventy five minutes do not go to absolute failure if your interest is in growth harm o release both during the exercise and later that night and if you can bring body temperature back down to normal levels by cooling off may be cool shower may the ice pack or something or may be just turning a off the heat in the room ore going outside whatever it is then you increase the probability the you are going to increase growth hormone the following night as well and again these are big increases three hundred of five hundred per cent it is almost you are getting a second sleep during the day but if the exercise is too hard if body temperature stays too high for too long you disrupt the whole process and you do not get the effect of increased growth hormone growth hormone is really powerful but it does not work alone i fact a lot of the effects of growthhormn are mediated by its effects on the liver growth hormones release got to the liver and then the liver release is something called i f one insolent growth factor one insolent growth fact or one was popular and the neuroscience community as an area focus because of its ability to trigger improvements in memory and learning after exercise and indeed exercise tigers both the release of growth hormone and if one if one seems responsible for a lot of the effects of improved memory some people a report that that is due to increase number of neurons or autogenesis birth of newnerons it is pretty clear than humans that is not what is happening yes and animals not in human's igeif one none the less has positive effects on memory and cognition and a great way to trigger igeif one release in growth hormone release is through exercise now the interesting thing and the reason o bringing up if one here is that certain patterns of exercise acute duration of exercise have different effects on get one and growth hormone depending on whether or not the exercise is done by men or women there is what we call a sex dependent effect and this extopetinent effect is as follows in this particular study and several others what they what they did as they had people exercise they measured growth form n and i a one levels from the blood before during and after exercise and they could see when there the greatest increase has occurred this was standard a sorts of resistance exercise some squats a there was a a there was a a springlike activity it does not really matter what the what the specific a exercises were ism none of them were to failure these were in kind of the ten repetition or less range a sunsets again a standard weight training stuff that am any one might do a but what was interesting is that women were able to access the biggest peak in growth hormone and chief one early in the exercise who in the first thirty minutes what this means is even a if you just have thirty minutes a at least for women there is going to be a big increase in growth hormone and if one in the first thirty minutes for men the biggest increase occurred later in the a in the exercise a which was a sixty minutes or total and a these sex dependent effects are interesting they point to the fact that things cortex all testeraostron and estrogen which course very indifferent levels and men in women are going to impact the release of things chief one and growth hormone and yes they did control for all sorts of things diet and they controlled for weight and prior experience its usually quite nice study if you to check it out it is by a pierce at all a growth hormone insolent glofactor one molecular way i form response to resistance exercise are sex dependent in frontiers and into chronology find journal in twenty twenty it is quite recent what does this mean this means if you are exercising and you want growth hormone release warm up do the type of exercise we have been discussing women in the first thirty minutes as when you are into get the maximum benefit in terms of growth harmony and get one men you have to keep going for the entire a sixty minutes do not tap out early if you are interested in getting the grow hormone and get one release and the same conditions apply about then cooling down and not making the exercise last long the you do not get the increasing growth hormone the following night my experience thus far in doing this podcast is that people fall into one of two categories there are the just tell me what to take people the people that are really eager to try supplements and maybe in prescription compounds and then the are people who alibi more shy about supplementation they are worth focused on what they can do with diet and behaviors and things of that sort out of a bias either way i try and off for tools ism that are supported by the scientific literature and i always point to safety margins a there are supplements that can increase growth hormone to a considerable degree and no these are not growth hormone itself although that of course will increase growth hormone to considerable degrees we will talk about prescription drugs at the end not just growth hormone but some other things that are quite prominently in use right now in parties her in the entertainment industry am therein is pretty interesting compounds but listless talk about supplements this been known about for some time but am arginine the monoacid argentine as well as the monoacid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially now argentine has a number of effects you can get it from food you can get it from supplements some people take it in piliform or capsid form some people will actiutake it by ivy but interveneously the levels and the amounts of grow arginine required to get big growthhormon release increases is pretty substantial some people will take argentine before bedtime some people take it before exercise the prerequisite again is low blood glucose bluglucosis high its can a quash the effect the amounts of argentine that people take are anywhere from three grams to ten grams are sometimes even more although this is define a case of more is not better there is a threshold at which growthhormon releases actually blunted by taking more than nine grams of genie now nine grams of argentine only is a lot of pills is at minimum nine pills and it can cause some get disturbance hit people can feel cautious some people throw it up some people get some a constipation or diarrhoea et camera or just stomach aces ism certainly not suggesting people do this that there not a that they take arginine but that is the reason why most of the studies that looked at the roll of argentine on growthromon levels did it by am ivy intravenous infusion what is interesting however is that weather not its by mouth or by vain taking argentine can dramatically increase growthhormon release and the levels or the amount of increase raise a was anywhere from one hundred on the low end but anywhere from basically from four hundred to six hundred percent above baseline these are huge increases in growth hormone now have never tried argentine am argentine is out there for a number of different purposes one of them is to increase growthormon an some of the supplements out there a to increase growthroman include argentine and ornithine argentine does have the effect of of dilating arterial and it basely increases blood supply argon the argentine pathways involved in veto dilation it is actually the pathway that is down stream of a lot of drugs that are used to a treat things a reptile is function and a any time people have problems with a primeval blood flow of any kind they a focus on compounds that will either disrupt the enzymes or will adjust the levels of menaces to get more vas o dilation taking argentine for the purpose of increasing growth hormone will also have the effect of dilating blood vessels and for you will blood excuse me with heart conditions that that actually can be a a serious issue now here is something really important and interesting to note which is that increasing argentine levels with the specific goal of increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit the effects of exercise on growth hormonsseveral studies i looked at looked at the interaction of taking argentine end the exercise or just the argentine or just the exercise alone and you do not a unfortunately if growthormon increases your goal you do not unfortunately get to increase growth hormone eight hundred percent by taking argentine an exercising it always seems to be clamped at about three hundred five hundred percent increases still large increases i make that point for several reasons first of all be aware that argentine has these other effects on vas of dilation take those seriously if you have a hart condition or take them seriously in any case second of all you can supplement with argentine not exercise end get these big increases in growthormon by taking them before sleep but if your taking the argentine before exercise you are going to short circuit or clamped the effects of exercise on growth hormone it something that one could use but it does not a have a synergistic effect with exercise and the two a more o less cancel each other out om not to zero but you end up with the same effect you would had you done one or the other fully that is clear the other thing is if one's goal is really to increase argentine in the blood for whatever reason argentine may not actually be the best way to do that because of the way its metabolized in the gut it does not have access or get access to the tissues that your most interested in in terms of increasing growth hormone orcas a dilation for that matter and in that case there something else called elcitraline which has powerful effects on on vase o dilation powerful effects on a potentially on a growthormon levels vie the argentine pathway but easily elcituraline acts a sort of a done or lets its count of a biological prerequisite for argentine and can lead to even bigger argentine increases then you would get if you took argentine itself and are a elsecitrline is out there keep in mind that anything that dilates the blood vessels will lower blood pressure else cituraline yes will lead to increase blood flow for whatever purpose you only use it for on whetheranot that pumps in the gamer whatever om it also can lead to big increases in argentine and growth hormone but it will lower blood pressure be aware of that but a and understand that the biology is not straightforward else cituraline may actually be t e better way to get argentine increases than argentine itself and ornithine can also increase growth hormone although that is also through an indirect pathway and nowadays there is not a lot of focus on ornithine as a way to increase growth hormone that was all the rage in the nineties not much any more nowadays that people are really in the no for the stuff ten to focus on el waterline and if your interested in elcitreline or argentine i highly recommend you go to our old friend good friends examine dot calm because there you can put it in to the list you can just put search and its totally free and it will tell you that blood pressure will be slightly decreased power output in the get will increase there is very strong effects on blood locos fatigue is reduced notably big increases in dioxide that is also related to the increase in vast dilation plasma argentine very high eat the excuse me notable effects on very high support for studies which allow people more training volume wrote big exercise arterial stiffness is brought down there is a huge list of things increase in growth hormone two studies showing a this was done double blind great you always once see double blind pluvial controlled this was only done in males not in females unfortunately just have a data from males but increases in growth hormone it is a small but a real significant effect and again from quality studied there is a huge number of effects there and some of the other kind of more interesting ones about elcitrline that you might not have thought about or things muck muscle oxygenation as we scroll down decreases in see reactive routine a lot of the same things that you might effect a expect souse me from the same sorts of compounds we saw before the take away here is if you want to increase growth hormone think about the argentine pathway but argentine itself might not be the best direct rout to get there ell citrine might be a better option but please do consider and take very seriously the effects on blood pressure we have been talking about big effects from supplementation or exercise on growth hormone this extremely powerful hormone and one thing to note is that the profile of growth harmony as we age changes i mention that earlier but it is ported understand how it changes when one thing that is particularly interesting to me as somebody was in is forties is that it is actually between ages thirty and forty that the amount of growth hormone that you release each night is reduced by to to threefold that is really incredible you we hear much about testosterone levels going down as we age or estrogen levels going down but if you recall from the testosterone and estrogen episode talked about the fact that if you really look at the data just for instance on testosterone there are men in their nineties and they are not rare it turns out that are making as much testosterone and d h t dihydrotistocteron as they were in their twenties we hear much now days about how testosterone levels are dropping sperm levels are dropping et camera and i do not dispute that i i talked about that in that episode but it is clear that testosterone levels very tremendously from person to person and just getting older does not necessarily mean that testosterone levels are dropping growth hormone levels it seems are dropping when people are in their thirties and forties and there dropping substantially and that is seems to be the case across the bordyou just nock in a fine people in their forties fifties and sixties that are making as much growth hormone as they were in their teens in twenties and as somebody who i feel really good but as somebody who um refill notice that as i got into my forties that even if i slept the same amount i was not feeling quite as i would say um able to recover from exercise or wound healing even with the same amount of sleep and of try to optimize a great number of things this business of growth hormone became of particular interest to me and since the ways to manipulate growth hormone in men an women are straight forward and since everybody goes through this age related to cline very dramatically it seems to me that the things that were supposed to be doing anyway exercising tribute too close to bedtime try to optimize sleep all of these are wonderful tools that we should be pursuing and perhaps using and they can actually offset the two to threefold decrease right if we are talking bout a two to threefold decrease for people there in the thirties and forties and them were talking about increases from exercise or from may be from supplementation but certainly from exercise of three hundred o five hundred percent well then all of a sudden we are in a position to actually offset the age related to clinging growth hormone completely just through behaviors and i think that is quite interesting and quite powerful now it'd to discuss a way that any one can increase their levels of growth hormone dramatically and when i say dramatically i mean dramatically it'll get to the numbers in a couple minutes but we have to remember how growth hormone is released in the first place remember it all starts in the brain in the hypothalamus the hypothalamus is a brainarea that controls things sexual behavior temperature regulation circadian behavior meaning when you want to be awaken when you want to be asleep aggression all of that there are other brainaryas involve too but it has a rich collection of different irons involved in all these very basic functions now s we talked about the releasing hormones the growth hormone releasing hormone comes from irons in the hypothalamus those then communicate with the pituitary in the pituitary releases growth hormone and then the growth hormone acts on all the different tissues muscle liver cartilage et camera body fat makes the use energy while you lose body fat when growth hormone levels are high makes you grow muscle strengthens bones et camera now one of the things that has a profound effect on growth hormone levels growthhormon release is temperature now the date on this are very strong and the data come from both animal studies and human studies there are number of studies that have explored how making animals cold or hot can increase growth hormone and if you are guessing which direction this scan to go you can probably imagine that making animals or people warmer is the way to go if you want to increase growth hormone now any time you are going to increase temperature of your self or any one else or an animal it is risky i want to be really clear about this not everyone should engage in the behaviors i am about to describe but than i should just say the reason at so risky is it does not take much of a temperature increase in the brain to cook the brain to cook means and after that point anurans cannot come back and people can die from hyper thermic we have a much greater range in terms of cold you can also die of hypothermia you can grease to death but you have a much greater range of getting cold than you do warming up the brain however there really strong data pointing to the fact that sand a a deliberate hyperthermia not too high however that sand can increase the release of growth hormone and other hormones and what dramatic about this literature is the size of the effects that are reported first what let us talk about these temperature increases and yes i will refer to things that people can do even if you do not own sand because i realize not everybody has a san in their back yard or has access to assay first of all recall our study about exercise where warming up a few degrees before the exercise led to bigger and quicker increases in growth hormone during the exercise bout itself that already point in the direction that temperature was important now that the degrees noon intended that we are talking about increasing body temperature is by entering sands that are somewhere between a hundred and seventy six degrees farenheit that its eighty degrees sepsis am and all the way up to two hundred and ten two hundred and fifteen degrees ferenheit i personally know people that go even higher than that but they have train themselves to deal with with very high heats and gain high is dangerous you must clear this with your doctor now what happens in high heat couple things happen in hit first of all you start getting bigger stroke volume of the heart unlike an exercise once you get well trained in endurance activity or stroke volume the amount of blood that your harkenpomp each time gets larger you dilate the blood vessels right there are lot of things t happen also your sweating your bodies time a unload heat dilation of blood vessels argentine increases in heat were starting to see and here a common theme but it appears that getting into a nothing getting the body up to two hundred twelve degrees farenheiht one be very clear not talking about getting the body up to hundred degrees sepsis that would be terrible m you would die but entering environments where it is very hot for short periods of time anywhere from twenty minutes to thirty minutes where the temperature is eighty degrees sepsis to a hundred degrees sepsis or a hundred and seventy five degrees saran height more less to about two hundred ten degrees fair an height more or less has been shown to increase growth hormone release sixteen fold that is right sixteenfold that is one thousand six hundred per cent now therefore also effects on other hormones prolactin quarts all et camera the pattern that was described in this study there be many studies now undergrad effects of reseda sand we are we are done in seventeen humans this was from doing this repeatedly it was not the first time they did this they had to she had to do this three days in a row and the pattern was to get into the sand for twenty minutes followed by a thirty minute cooling period remember you do not want to spend long periods of time at high heat you can cook your brain and other tissues be very careful as you approach this if you decide to but thirty minutes a excuse me twenty minuteman followed by thirty minutes of cooling follow by twenty minutesona again led to a fivefold increasing growth hormone and then by doing that day after day after day on the third day you would see these huge increases of sixteenfold up to sixteenfold and there are now many studies this this was described a few years ago but since then there have been a number of other studies that have pointed in the direction of deliberate hyperthermia but not too hot that you kill yourself in order to increase growth homo and i know i keep high lighting the dangers there but again any time you are going to mess with heat you have to be cautious you have to be careful standard sand can can be useful if you do not have access to assay one way that people do this we have to look to our friends the wrestlers right they wear plastics which are basically body suits that are fairly inexpensive that you can buy on a any on line purchase platform i should say some people in the old days before a they had these plastics things readily available a action to people that wrap themselves in garbage bags and then throw on sweats in a hood and then go out for a jog again you out to be really careful special on a hot day overheating and acquire to death but that is another way to heat up you do not actually need a sand have known people who will do this in homerooms while their traveling they will turn on the heat the you will make a hot bath they will not actually get in the bath but they will fill the room with steam and heat and they will put on a goodie and some sweatshirt a sweat pants and they will sit there with with won season and they will get warm for twenty minutes than they'll take a cool shower and then they will do it again i guess when the hotels playing the water bill you do not don't worry about it too much some people corse own sands their pathways through that of friends whoa in the military who made sands out of cars while they were oversees all sorts of things you do have to be careful i know said it many many times that just on any whole to hurt themselves but these increases in growth hormone are tremendous and what they probably stem from or increased activity of neurons within the hypothalamus that stimulate growth hormone release from the pituitary and that is probably because the growth hormone releasing hormone neurons in the hypothalamus sit very closely and may even be intermixed with some of the neurons in the hypothalamus that regulate heat and body temperature remember metabolism is in part a heat it is a furnace of how much energy you are consuming and using for building or for on energy usage purposes sand can be very very interesting and again its twenty minutes thirty minute cooling twenty minutes again on proceed with extreme caution but none the less these are pretty extreme effects in terms of their a abilities to increase growth hormone levels along the lines of temperature in hormones i just want to mention a very recent study just came out march aril twenty twenty one undergrad effects of repeated hot thermal stress and cold water immersion in young adult men unfortunate was just in men they did not look at women but none the less i think the date are relevant to to everybody as a general theme this is pod task at all i will put a link to the study in the caption and they looked at testastron placed in cortical et camera and what they found was that the sand does indeed lead to a significant decrease in cortical a stress hormone a hormone that you want to be released early in the day when you wake up but sand definitely led to a significant decrease in cortical but did not change testastron dirtier or prolactin levels that is interesting and it turns out that the cold did effect some of these hormones but the results there were a little bit more mixed the take away here is that heat seems to have positive effects on growth hormone big effects it seems to have positive effects on reducing cortical levels and it does not seem to have effects on things testosterone dixie or prolactin directly you can imagine that a shift in any hormones gan alter the levels of other hormones dawn the lines or indirect effects but in terms direct effects on just during or immediately after the sunbath there w there were no effects we have talked about diet supplement ton behavioral tools and of course we talked about the underlying biology and logic and holy you heard the safety precautions for all of those now it'd to just briefly talk about the prescriptioncide of all this there are as we know many people taking growth hormone because it is been prescribed to them by a doctor presumably there r people ton growth hormone even though it has not been prescribed by a doctor which is none of my business but the point here is that most all of the hormones that we make have been synthesized there are versions of them in little bottles or little ampuls that people can inject your couple important things to consider if you are going to go that rout first of all talk to a physician right they actually are only legally available through a physician second of all any time you are injecting something you are going to shut down your own production that is the way that the hormone system works if you take there at hormone you will not make thyroid horn at least in the long run if you take testastron you will shut down your own production of testosterone you take estrogen the systems like more resilient but eventually you will shut down your production of estrogen and the same is true for growth hormone a decision to go that route of taking something is often not always a decision to do it forever however if you are willing to sustain a period of being without a given hormone some people can do things and then take a a stop taking them and then wide out the period in which they are not making testosterone estrogen or growth hormone and then it will come back sometimes and sometimes it wont there is a kind of new area that is developing now that i think deserves are attention not because ism encouraging it but because it is happening and in keeping with the science and in keeping with a trying to keep things modern a it is worth us discussing and those are peptides these days you here a lot about peptides to clarify little bit about what peptides are peptides is a really huge category of biological compounds peptides are just strings of a mind acids rights we have talked about altiricine argentine breathing those are amino acids which are individual mind acids and those are put together into little small peptides or there what toe called jolly peptides which are just longer peptides turns out that for any substance grothhormon or growth horn releasing hormone it is made up of different amino acids and different sequences just your genes are made up of aged asangesan cesantees nucleotides and different sequences it is a recipe peptides tend to be short sequences of amino acids that resemble a hormone enough or resemble some other peptide enough that it can lead to the similar same effects when you inject them for example we make growth homo n releasing hormone from our brain which stimulates growthormon from the photo start your probably getting tired of m here as saying that by now but people now will take things sermorilin s e r m o r e l i n sirmorilin which is not the entire peptide sequent of growth hormone releasing hormone but it is a subset of those and when people inject it before they go to sleep at night is typically how it is done on an empty stomach then that stimulates the release of growthormon from the partuitory this is not taking growth hormone this is taking the stimulating hormone or what is often called a secretagog or a mimic aright causes a a secretion of the hormone that one wants people do this for thyroid hormone to some people are doing this by prescription with a real medical need other people are doing it for just longevity reasons which can can not falls into that gray on of they would not die without it but they not enhance their life and they're doing that because they believe it is the right thing for them prescription sirmorilin is prescription do they work yes do they shut down your natural production of growth hormone releasing hormone will there the answer is yes but some of these peptides actually have the effect of changing gene expression remember way back to the beginning when a tug about hormones they can actually change gene expression and they can actually set pathways in motion for continued production of a hormone even if you stop taking the compound now that can be good or that can be bad because as you recall growthormon in big a big increases in growthormon that are short lived sand or i you now i should say exercise or argentine or sand it scions has this huge effects om or early nights first phases of sleep early in the night these sorts of things those are transient but when one is injecting over and over a constant level you can put into action gene expression programs that can be long lived and let say you have of particular tumor in the body tumors will grow when they see growthormon even if that tumor is unhealthy for you right you have got growth of tissues all over the body again ism not saying whether not people should do these things are not doing them one thing i do know is that they are in very prominent use o in the moviandustry people who want a peel off body fact quickly they do increase recovery time the increase healing rates people are also injecting things gastric peptides there actually stomach peptides that we talk about the previous episode things related to the gremlin pathway and other things from the liver that can improve the rate of tissue and wound healing you can bet that in the upcoming olympics lot of people are using peptides and compounds and ism not pointing fingers that any one in particular just this is separate from hormone augmentation of injecting g sure injecting testosterone people are now working further up the pathways other names of some of the peptides or things ipermorilin om tesamorilin some of these have c nival uses others have just been made as compounds for people in the kind of a longevity field or the a self augmentation field if you will again not promoting their use but there define out there and now if you hereabout them or some one's talking about them now hopeful y have a better understanding about their underlying biology and you can think rationally about whether not they are the right decision for you one once again covered an enormous amount of material hopefully now you understand fibroid hormone and what it does and a little bit about its mechanism or may be a lot and growth hormone and what it does and how both of them take care of our metabolism if they dictate how many nutria's we can eat and make use of they can pull from body fat stores reparmuscle repair cartilage they really are incredible compounds and they are actionable there things that we can do getting that early phase of sleep perhaps supplementing with argent may be not hopefully getting adequate exercise warming up properly not making the exercise too long or to intend will help may be sand or things it your deliberate safe hyperthermia the emphasis unsafe might be things that are of use regardless even if you're not interested in the fibroid or the growth hormone pathways this brings to a close our month on hormones and now hopefully you understand not just fibroid and growth hormone but the logic that underlies thirotormon growth hormone estrogen testosterone why we eat why we stop eating colossus a dining green if these names do not mean anything to you then perhaps go back and listen to those episodes but regardless i hope that you come away from this with a deeper understanding about these hormones which are powerful in controlling the way our brain functions and the interplay between the brain and hormones because it is really a by directional conversation the brain is telling the body what hormones to make the hormones are influencing all the tissues of the body but also telling the brain whether not to eat more growmore think more et camera i really appreciate your time and attention if you this podcast and you are finding it useful please recommend it

welcome to the supermen to science scienceayto to ism endercubermen and om r professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor lane north doctor north is one of the foremost experts in propene metabolism fat loss and nutrition he did his degrees in bile chemistry and nutritional sciences and is considered one of the world experts and understanding how we extract energy from our food and how exercise and what we eat combine to impact things body composition and over all health to day we discuss an enormous number of topics under the umbrella of nutrition and fitness including for instance what is energy balance that is how do we actually extract energy from our food we also discuss the somewhat controversial topic of artificial sweeteners whether not they are safe or not and wether r not they are an effective tool for weight loss in particular for people suffering from ability and different types of diabetes we also talk about got health that is the got mycrobiom and how it is impacted by food and how it can actually impact the metabolism of the foods that we eat we also discuss fasting or called interment in fasting or time restricted feeding what it does and what it does not do in terms of how effective it is for weight loss and perhaps even for health and longevity we so talk about proline and to find very clearly how much proline each and all of us need depending on our daily activities and life demands we discuss the various types of diets that you probably heard about including erogenic diets vegan diets vegetarian diets and pure carnivore dits as well as more typical omnivore diets and how to make sure that you get all of the essentially monoacid that are critical for healthy weight maintenance weight loss or directed muscle gang we also talk about supplements in particular the supplements for which there is an immense amount of science pointing to their safety and efficacy for fitness and for over all body composition what ism sure will become clear to you as you hear line talk about each in every one of these topics is that he has an incredible ability to both understand the mechanistic science but also the real world applications of the various discoveries that are made in particular papers and in particular in the randomized controlled trials that i when a given scientific hypothesis as been raised he is extremely good at understanding why it was raised but also at a valuating whether or not it works in the real world which is what i believe most everybody out there is concerned with i think this is one of the things that really distinguishes him from the other voices in the nutritional landscape i assure you that by the end of to day's discussion you will have a much clear understanding about what the science says about nutrition about fitness end about how different diets and fitness programs combine to achieve the results that you want before we begin i to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however r part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science in science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electorolikte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called currants in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electronics need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back to lectrolikte ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doom slash supermen and now for my discussion would doctor lane north lane doctor north thank you much for being here this is a long time coming and have to say ism really excited because have seen you in the social media sphere have also listened to a number of your other podcast and as a fellow oh d scientist i feel a great kinship with you i know you have tremendous experience in in fitness in nutrition and number of areas we also got a lot of questions from our audience and ism really looking for to talking with you to day excited to me this you is been something en talking about for long time as gallery l make it happen ya indeed and am i think some of the audience has requested a debate or a battle and i can hah ha is not on to hap and actually one of the things that brought lane and i together i in conversation on line and then via text et camera was the fact that i love to be corrected and that is what happened i i did oppose about artificial sweeteners which we will talk about a ltlebit later in the episode and lane pointed out some areas of the study that i had missed or maybe misunderstood and i promise my opinions and i think it is wonderful and other studies hove come out since then hopefully our conversation will serve as a as a message of how a science and action will science can can be perceived and and and that it does not always have to be a battle but hey if we get into it we get into it i will not get physical because we know you would we ha a ha ha a ha in any case it'd to start with something that is rather basic and yet can be pretty complex and that is this issue of one ray balance and energy utilization i think must people have heard of a carry i assuming that most people do not action know what that is in terms of how it works what it represents and some made you could just explain for people what happens when we eat food of any kind and how is that actual converted into energy as a way of framing up the discussion around weight lost weight maintenance weight gain and body composition we great question and you said this is one of those things where now people use the term calories an calories out they said well that is way too simplistic ism if you look at what actually makes up calories an calories out it is actually very complicated right let us dead with the a what you mentioned first what is a carry because i think a old people do not quite understand this carry just refers to a unit of energy of heat specifically and what does that have to do with food what is that have to do with what we digest and eat really what you are talking about is the potential chemical energy that is in the bonds of the machronutriats of food right and by digesting assimilating and metabolizing those neutrino we are able to create energy and the introduce of that mostly is e t p a a denizen try phosphate which is your bodies energy currency to understand e t p to try to think about if you are trying to power these various reactions in your body you talk about tens of thousands of enzymes that require a t p am it does not make sense that yo would have to create a munch of micro explosions right you want something that can transfer high energy phosphates to power these reactions to give up essentially it is energy to power something that might otherwise be unfavorable a lot of metabolism is simply creating e t p which the in of the line of that like f a kind of work backwards is what is called orate of respiration that happens the monichondre ere but is heard mnicondrea power house of the cell and that is done a through essentially creating a hydrogen ion gradin across the mitacondrea which powers the production of ah t p by converting free phosphate plus mighty p to e t p now the way that hydrogen ion grating is created is through a creating hydrology hydrogen ions be donated through the recycle now the crew cycle is linked to lipolysis we about care hydrate metabolism cromhydrates basically other than fructose get converted into glucose which can go n t like callus his and you can produce some high t piece through lipolysis and then it bolls down to private then a septal say which goes to the recycle produces a lot more high t pies from that i you tomb you proline prolines a but different because proline i gets converted to ametoacids much can be used for muscle proline synthesis or proline genesis another tissues a but it also can be converted through glicanegenesis to glucose and there also are some keetogenica menaces as well a and you can have a few different ways to get to the crew cycle a either being through a assets cop or through glue cops going trout the c glycolysis to private then you have fadiacids which a are able to create energy through what is called bate oxidation where essentially are taking these fatyacids in your lopping them off to carbons at a time to produce the steal copy which again can go in toe crew cycle produce those hundred lions the can ten power the production of eight t p that is kind of at the salvo level of how this stuff works but stepping back and taken it back out what does that have to do with weight loss for might gain ran well when you think about the balance of energy and verses energy out sounds very simple but let us look at what any makes up energy and verse energy out first of all you've got to realize that the energy inside the equation is more difficult to tract than people think right one a food labels which we to think is being from upon high a can have up to a twenty per cent air in them really oh yet a hundred gallery something miss is a hundred calories preserving it could what is actin in there can be be here hundred and twenty right exactly that is one aspect of it the second aspect is there is what is called your energy but the shows also matabolizable energy rights if you have a food stuff with a lot of insoluble fire typically insoluble fiber as not really digestible and you could have quite a bit of carnal hydrate but if you cannot extract the energy from it and typically this is because instable fire from plant material the carnal hydrate or and even some the proline is bound up in the a plant structure which makes it inaccessible to digestive insides and this is what adds bolster school school what not but again reduces the matabolizable energy in the and there is some evidence that based on peoples individual gut macrobiom that some people may any be better and extracting energy out of fiber compared to other people just starting off right there orca there there is quite a bit of play in the energy inside of things now one of things people will say is well see that is why inion where about tracking galleries cause of the food labs can be twenty per cent off and what it'll say is loci that is a that is i understand we are coming from but typically if it is office could be consistently off and if you are consistent with how you track it eventually you will be able to know kind of what you are taking in and it is got that is kind of saying well do not worry about tracking if you are i olio use financial a examples you know we know that to save money or you if to earn more money than you spend well you cannot exactly know how much money you are earning at a time cause there is inflation and then there is ah if you have investments those can be different interest rates and what not say o cate but you are you noifyouhave a budget you've a reasonable idea of what it is going to be and you make you make certain the sumption but you can relatively guess now that is a good example right now let us look at the energy outside of the equation which is act you way more complicated right and say you are energy out is a few different a buckets the first one in the biggest one is your resting metabolic rate your armor and that for most people is anywhere from fifty to seventy per cent of your total daily energy expenditure now people use the term metabolic rate and energy expenditure kind of interchangeably but they are not the same thing you are total daily energy expenditure is the summation of all the energy you expend in a day racking upstairs exercise if you do it fidgeting yet plus our resting menabolicry right resting meatball hate is a big part of that but it is not the only thing that chooses about fifty to seventy per cent and sedentary people will be on the higher end of that ' be a bigger proportion whereas people who are more active it will be a but lower not because they metal rate is lower but because they are expending a greater percent of the calories from physical activity then you have something called the thermic effect of food which is a relatively small percentage of your told daily energy expenditure it is about five to ten per cent ah and very difficult to measure and usually what researchers do when they are kind of looking at the stuff as they just kind of make an assumption about it they use a constant ah but that is about five to ten per cent of your daily energy expenditure and that refers to the amount of energy it takes to extract the energy out of food think about your body kind of a car right you do not just have gas and your tank and its spontaneously starts out right coif to have a batteries you put in energies woe can get the energy out of the the petrol at you have in your car similar with with food you cannot just eat food and then it just appears in your selves and you start doing stuff it has to be systematically broken down and put into forms that can actually produce energy and you have to put some energy and to achieve that and a lot of times people will say something well not all calories are crated equal that's not true because calories just an unit of measurement right that would be saying not all seconds on a c lock a creative equal yes they are all sources of calories may have different shall effects on energy expenditure and appetite if we look at something am fat for example the t f of fat is not hurt three per cent meaning if you would a hundred carries from fat you are it will be about ninety seven to a hundred said the process of breaking down that fat i such hero tracts some of the the calories away because you used it in creating energy core breaking those chemical bonds to create e they correct direct you have for example some invites tat require eight p to run these processes now fat is actually the easiest thing to convert into energy then you have trouble hydrate which has a t f of five to ten per cent you eat hundred colors from corbehydrte and voice the libra content makes a big difference on this but you eat hundred calories you will net ninety to ninety five protein is about a twenty to thirty per cent t f if you would hundred callous from preaching you are only netting seventy to eighty now you are still net people say while you cannot eat too much proline well people will ask will con preaching bestortos fat the carbons from preaching it is unlikely toucan a wind up an autopsy tissue but if you are eating a lot of preaching over all part of a lot of calories it does it has to be oxidized and a cannot provide a carry cushion for other things to be stored in fat but preaching itself does provide a net positive for calories but less than arbiter or fat and tensity more satiating again when people talk about are all calories create equal yes but all sources of calories may have differential effects on energy expeniturant appetite that is the t f bucket and the b i or bucket then we go to physical activity and physical activity is essentially two parts there is exercise which is kind of your purposeful movements you one for a walk you do training session whatever any purposeful activity and then you have what is called neat which is non exercise activity throw agenesis which i think it is actually really cool it is fascinated it is it is i was actually hanging out with somebody last night and i was noticing them they they were fidgeting their feet and their their fingers and i said now if you always been pretty lean and ere yet i never really had a pro problem maintaining leanness and when you look at the jobs resistant fend type people think they have high b am a or they exercise lot and really wanted it it seems to be as net they ten to if they over eat they just spontaneously increased their physical activity now people get neat confused have heard people say while man got for a walk to get my neat up that is not neat neat is not something you can consciously modify but you are doing there if it is purposeful its exercise for example if it what ism talking if ism waving around my hands if i tapping my feet if ism whatever that is neat but trying to get yourself ism just good a tap my f ut more well now if ism consciously having to do this than my for is me you how the brain works very hard to do you do not really do two things it dance sori you kind of switch quickly between tats i rightly can i quickly ask a was the person that you are referring to our friend a ben brunt now now yours he is fidgety amazing on line fitness channel a he is a freakishly strong individual i a ya and a am i cannot remember whether not ben your a fidget or not but anyway off to go go check and will measure your fidgeting am about a non exercising you sermagasis neat a my understanding of the old papers on this old be i guess back to the midinettes ya tat the gallery burn from neat is actually pretty significant we are not talking about a hundred calories with you one calls pray were drying about in some cases hundreds of thousand rescue a hundreds to maybe even close to a thousand calories pray could you liberate on the yes there as action really classic study i think from one says from levin in nineteen ninety five is menfolk word study and hopple i do not butcher the study because ism trying to pulpit out of my brain i do not expect you to have must say you have it a i quite extensive a pulled idea a grab bag in there try to bring the receipts a i try to being the receipt we can but we will put a link to this study in the shown fashion a a people can praise it if they i believe they had people over eat n i think it was by a thousand calories day and i think per six weeks en i mean this is the medal lie word they are this is very tightly controlled it is as tight as you get and what was interesting is of course on average people gained weight and gained amass but some people gained more than expected and there was one person in particular who only gained just over half a kilo right they should have gained i think it was something three to four kilos it was was predicted and what they found is this binge of individual just spontaneously increased their physical activity that e did not purposely do it it just happened and i mean you no anecdotally have seen people who are again very lean even eat a meal sit down and start sweating and be very fidgety there is a a natural bodyblr back in the day named him cordovan and this my was just very lean all the time and he was exactly that biotype he would walk up a flight of stairs and all the sunny sweating sit down can to meal he sweating hurst he is a furnace just expending energy and what is very interesting about neat is that seems to be the most modifiable i mean exercise very modifiable cause you can be intentional with that but of you do not be amour t e f and neat neat seems to be far more modifiable even a bodyweight reduction of ten per cent they observed a decrease and neat of almost five hundred calories a day for for a ten per cent a reduction at bodiwait now you also do get a decline and bear when you lose way one because you are just in a smaller body now and it takes less energy to a locator a but also there is what is called metal capitation which is a further reduction in your bazar then expected from the loss of body mass and that is on average usually round fifteen per cent but it does seem to be there is new evidence coming out on the metal capitation from bazar and it seems to be a kilobit a kind of in the transition cases if you if you start to diet within the first few weeks you will have a reduction and bazar that then kind of just a thereafter any further reduction is mostly from the amount of body mass you lose and then if you for example finish o diet moved your calories to maintenance a within a few weeks bear kind of starts to come back up there is still a small reduction a but i used to be somebody who thought the bazar the metabalcaaptation was a big reason why people stopped losing wait or plateau and now i think it is much more to do with meat interesting and you have said that it cannot be conscious am because that will distract us from other activities i do not knife you have had chance to look at this study and it'll send it you may be id be fun to do a kind of an on line journal club about this at some point sumebut there is a study it came out a universe used an recently having people do now this is a long pert of time four hours a day a basely a loveliest push up which may see a heal rays cave a seeded calf rays with one who at not waited and then they looked it a bunch things about locos metabolism and glucose clearance and insolent levels and they did not conclude that people burned ta ton of calories but what they concluded was that a bloodshuger regulation improved greatly and i think there is a lot of excitement about this am at some level but base on everything you are telling me this it fits perfectly with what is known about meat this sort fellow somewhere in between with a in betweenscus me a to a deliberate exercise and spontaneous movement i guys they have try to make that spontaneous movement a little bit more conscious what it'll tell people as if if you are worried about see one thing you can do these watches for example li people all what told me i burn this many calories the they are not accurate for energy expenditure i meat it is there was a reanalysis in two thousand and eighteen i one to say between a went eight and ninety three per cent over estimation of energy expenditure by these watch to this distracts over those are you listening where are not ghetto name the brand but a fitness trackers that is a rest warn fitness that and this witness is across the board a depending on the brand it could be be know more or less but they all over estimated the mount of ex the calories you burn from exercise this is act a great example were people go well calories in calories out does not work for me cause i ante ta callorydeffs on i didn't loose weight an no when i talk to them usually it is they went to an all mine calculator it is ane is to few things they went than all ism calculator put in their information it is it spat out some calories to eat and they ait that n den loose weight nit is will but he thinks more likely that you are defying the loss of conservation of energy or that your you might have not got in the right number for you the r the measurementual was off no now the next thing is a lot of people weigh verysparatically and it'll tell people if you are go to make an intentional weight loss of goal and again this can be different for different people but typically i tell people way and first thing the morning or after yo the bathroom do it every day and take the average of that for the week and then compare that to the next week's average can ask one qritsarydan thou but when great question about them we say go to the bathroom not to get at you detailed i her for unnecessarily better e talking about urination and limiting your bowels i have nearly because you gelatin big meal the night before yet yet got it wake up i use the bathroom in all all forms that tat you ready and then and then get on the scale take that measurement average that across the week and then maybe every money you take that value y and the reason i i recommend doing that is if you are just conosparatically weighing in as somebody who weighs themselves pretty pretty regularly i mew my weight with fluctuate you know five six pounds and not seemingly changing much and that is just those short term changes are fluid i have had it before where week to week my average did not change but between the lowest way and from a previous week and the highest way in might have been eight pounds right if you are somebody who just randomly is weighing in and you are eating in a gallery deficit and you just weigh in one day where you have just whatever reason holding some more fluid then you all see this is not working when a reality you are average might be dropping that is one of the reasons and actually believe t are not a weight fluctuations are actually identified is a major reason why people get discouraged from weight loss m that i kind of stops the buying when they have a fluctuation up that is one of the reasons are marlin one of reasons early on the low carbide's tend to work really wells cause people lose a lot of water weight really quickly and they get that buying right to all this is working ow we can return to that roll bit have theories as to how that when people eat less carbamate they street more water and they will see for the first time they will see some definition in their absent o we to tho stilts amazing and the fluid loss does hold that promise i think flue loss can do some other things on my people lit make people literally feel lighter a all the gan i have some negative effects i do ever one quick question and and u i do want well return to met in a moment but when yo say the colonic burn as a consequence of exercise want to ask about the colonic burn during that exercise coherence and somebodies on the tread mill and they will see cat they burn in four hundred calories ash i think this is a month where a number of prominent pod casters but cruiser tom cigar jo rogue and others and they call sober october but in addition to avoiding all call they they are burning five hundred calories pray during the exercise ever went they're measuring it a lot of people do this they think they take track of whether excuse me take stock of how many calories they burned my understanding is that if that particular form of exercise is a muscle building form of exercise that that some point later there might be an increase in muscle if you did it everything right you everything right and then you will burn more energy is a consequence of adding that tissue that is a long processes as and we will discuss but i have heard about this post exercise induced increase in oxidate of metabolism i probably to using the right a languaging here you if i were to go out for instance once sprint some spring run hard for a minute jog for a minute run harder men do that ten times over they let us assume my burn four hundred calories during that a exercise about but my understanding is that in the hours that follow my bail metabolic rate will have increased is that true and is it significant enough to care about answer both those questions a yes there does seem to be a small increase a metabolic rate and no it does not appear to be enough to action make it difference when they look at and again this is where a i tell people i think have a good perspective on this because i my undergraduate degrees about committed degree a is very into mechanisms you do not it mean it was all if we just do this and this will get this right and then i did nutrition is a graduate degree and then my adviser was great because you could do something over here and he could tell you how up effect video an de metabolism over hers is on lame ye do not an he would always can say the have what is the outcome good to be right this is actually one of things i change my mind on was i used to be very much while i think high intensity interval training is probably better because you get this post exercise energy burn which they do see in some of these studies but in the kind of met analysis and more tightly controlled studies where they a quite work between high intend intervals and modern or low intensity a cardie a quoting work a they do not see differences in the loss of body fat and to me if ism looking i that is the example of a mechanism which is ora were seeing this small increase in basemen a colic rate that should lead to increased loss of body fat but again remember you are capturing it a snap shot in time right but we do not see a difference in the loss of bodyfelt what may be happening and again ism just speculating but a way to explain it could be you might have an inch ease another you might actually have a decrease the tends to just gonna wash it out i have imagine some forms of exercise this would be highly individual but i we will spike appetite more than others fer instance if i go out for a forty five minute jog or which i do o forty five to sixty minute higher jog once a week i just make it appoint to do that or ruck or something that thrown away vast and hike after that i find i a very thirsty i want to hydrate but ism not that hungry that is true of most all party of vascular exercise for me but after i wait train about sixty to ninety minutes later i want to eat the refrigerator and obviously calories in calories out dictates that that will play in important rolls to whether not i gainer's weight et camera is it safe to say that the specific form of exercise that people choose i needs to be take in in consideration calories in calories out to how much is burn during the exercise also how much that exercise tens to stimulate appetite i not nowhither not people explore this and in the rigorous studies t and whether not that form of exercise actually increases lean muscle mass or not i it id now we take an exercise and split it into a number of different dimensions but this is what i you are masterful at is really parking how the different components work individually and together if you would just am expand on that i love to know what you are thinking yet this is actually fascinating thing i first thing i want i wanted just go back to talking about for example burton tom and and job er n to fainer calories to day on whatever is those apparatuses do not measure those things effectively either right just these watches but we the one thing i will say is if you are for example if i do to ours resistance training typically this will say d burned about a thousand galleries notes a lot of resistanctermy wary might weight work outselects are warm up for ten minutes and then one hour of work done i just i love to than okay it is an and you can recover from my recovery question is pretty low have been training for thirty plus years and have found that if i do more than an hour of hard work in the gem meaning resistance train if seventy five minutes maybe out moray but pass that i have to take two maybe en three days off before anything in my nervous system just does not tolerate it well i i minute to an hour i know but an ha that to remember is have kin o built up to that over a long pet o time right ill could not just pose somebody in the star haven do to ours day as nocking to go well for them it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called g one is a vote i in mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundation of nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve am delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there is my starry taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets to be i the probiatics that i need for got health ire got is very important its populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the mean system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those probiatics about lentic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition i lentic greens contains a number of adaptions fitments and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastesgrit if you to try both lentic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road and the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitamin d the k too again that is athletic green stop cam slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a vote mind the k to but i we will say about the gallery trackers is if ism used to i usually burn about a thousand calories according to this it is not accurate but if i go in to morrow and i do thirteen hundred it may not be accurate i do not know what the exact number is but i can be relatively confident that it is more than the previous session right and in terms of comparison it might be o k you don't cone ut within subject a and in the other thing i on a circle around i was if you we are not neat tracking your steps can be helpful because peopleill step counts can spontaneously decrease when none a fat lost i than e realize it and and that again not a complete measure of neat but what we have had some clients to wet are tee smiling coaches is they will say o say your at eight thousand steps right now we are not going to add any purposeful cardie but what ever you need to do to maintain that eight thousand steps do that and sometimes they have to add fifteen twenty thirty minutes of cardie because their spontaneous activity that they're not even where of goes down that is a really excellent point at i have heard you no the ten thousand steps per day number was a we all heard that and then i learned that ten thousand s con o thrown out as in a terry number else at hour intermit in fastingthing that is a story behind that is a spoke to such in and it turns out that the graduate student in is late that did that initial study which was on my by the way a was limited to being in lab for a bout eight hours by their significant other the eight hour feeling window as actually the consequence of this person's relationship a that is that is a really great point that people do not realize when they a lot of people will try to copy scientific studies and ill it'll tell people that lessen scientific studies are confined you you need to be very careful with how broadly you apply what is in there right the they are a very big hammers the kind the way a look at it o ka they are not a scowl they big hammer and i think a lot of times an terms of coaching scientific studies will tell you what not to do rather than what to do right i be getting back to your question about exercise appetite first if ism not really aware if there is evident showing differential effects of different forms of exercise on appetite it is possible am but again it also could be a placebo effect right because we for sample you and i grew up in an air a with a muscle magazines it was well soon as you finish your work out you'd have your biggest meal the day right and when i say placebo effect i think people have the wrong idea what the placebo effect is they think that is just a feeling plusibo effect can actually change your physiology people do not people do not realize this a there is research showing that a placebo where the power of suggestion is basically as powerful as some former suitable and one of the the great examples i to use is ictus t was a study we just covered in our research for view on creation where they did am four groups not supplement with creation told they were not supplement of creation not supplemented told they were supplemented supplemented told they were supplemented told they were basically it just matters what they told them really go u this is incredible am i have to get this study wo it is we can link to a college of mine that stambershe is been on the pod casts i love introduce you to cause i think he is we a really rear first rout she was a former de on the am and then is a it runs a last tampering psychology is is a sacrum and she is an group am it in the very athletic obviously and very very smart and her laboratory folks on these belief slash placebo effects where if you tell people all the horrible things that straits due to you interns your memory and coolant functioning they give them a memory's they they perform well below baseline you tell them that stress sharpens them in the short term and that it adrenalin is this powerful molecule that can a really tune out by number of memory systems memory improves and it mints remarkable am and it is consistent and a and this end they've done this for any number of different things in pagan ease word clergies for instance it incredible results in any case i ism i glad you are bringing the out m i take creating monohidrate a and have for years fivegrams a day i do not cat's great and am and it is great and i believe it is grates it her compound office of believing its great and it actually nigh not in this study but i think the thing to point out people will misinterpret that as creation does not work and that is not what that says what it says is your beliefs about what it does are probably just as powerful as what it does right they would actually to a study do not have the citation but it was think within last ten years when they told people they were putting them on animal steroids and would not it they had better gains even though they were not actually on animal steroids they had better gains than people that they did not tell errand ofoxteroids and that is hard out come strength lean body masts o those sorts of things when people say well i would not felt for the placebo effect its eh you do not have to fall for it if if you believe it to be true the power of belief is very very powerful and as a scientist i wish sometimes i was ignorant that i could subject myself to little see defect more often a some ram kind of getting back to that is just a possible explanation of maybe why and ism the same way i get don with a work out i c resist the training session already to eat right now if you look at the literature over all on exercise an appetite it is not always what you would expect consistently it seems to show that exercise textually has an appetites suppressant effect a people do not tend a compensate at least fully for the amount of movement they do and there is some evidence that you have probably heard people say what exercise a really poor weight loss tool right it if you figure out how many calories you should be burning from it and you do that you an up getting less weight loss than you then you would predict have a family member who is perfectly happen to eat lest but does not loathe exercise dislike senors yean they and there of healthy weight but ism always encouraging them to exercise morinecicisn on going battle in up in our sibling relationship well one thing i would say is that exercise independent of anything that happens with your bodyweight you will be healthier exercise is one of the only things will actually improve your bile markers of health without even losing weight there is it it prove your intellect sensitivity inflammation all that stop ever big out there looking for a hack to be healthier exercise is the hack riveshal point and our am a mutual friend doctor peter to a thin has gone on record several times now saying that of all the things that one could take and a men et camera met forming of a regard us of whether not one takes those or does not take those that the plosive effects on on levity by way of bar by markers from regular exercise is far out ways all of those things combine not that those things do not necessarily work we are not going through them in detail now but that exercise is by far the best thing we can do for healtspan in life scansion absolutely i hundrpercent agree and when you are talking about weight loss people miss the point of exercise i think there is some worth that came out from a heroin posers well that basely showed well if you do a hundred calories from exercise you have a twenty eight carry reduction in your basil metabolic rate in a response to that it is kind of this constrained energy expenditure model right but what i would says ink can wite tare still a net of seventy too right its still it is still o ka and the other thing is i think the effects of exercise on weight loss a actually more due to what it does to appetite a if you look at people who lose weight and keep it off for a number of years kind of outliers because most people do not keep it off for years over seventy percent of them engage in regular exercise of people who do not keep weight loss maintain weight loss less than thirty per cent exercise regularly now that is just a correlation that does not es prove causation but there are some pretty compelling studies showing that exercise increases your sensitivity to society signals basely would have the same satiety signals but you are more sensitive to them when you exercise and there is actual really classic study i from the nineteen fifties and been golly workers where they looked at basically four different quadrants of activity shed sedentary lightly active moderately active heavily active basely base on o their job choice and they did not have an intervention they just one detract them an and see how much you no how many calories to the actually eat it was a jay shaped curve the sedentary actually ate more food than the lightly active are moderately active but from lightly active to heavily active they almost perfectly compensated how many calories they should be eating to me that suggests when you become active you can actually deregulate your appetite appropriately or much more appropriately than if your sedentary and do you think this has to do with changes in the brain brain centers that respond to society signals from the priory am and or do you think it has to do with a changes in it blood sugar regulation what i was taught and i do not know if this is no confer true is that now spikes in blood sugar will trigger or desire to eat more even though it is got of exactly the opposite what you need when you have a spiking blood sugar and there is this kind of and will get into this point out about artificial sweetness this his idea in mind i think i adopted perhaps falsely that now eat something that sweeter that tastes really good and and you are suddenly on the train of wanting to eat more am and i can imagine how exercise am if it is increasing the society signals a could be working in a number of different ways ye i i think it is am i think the effect is probably mostly at the brain level am that the effects on blood sugar the research out there is not very compelling for blood sugar driving a appetite now if you become hypogly seems yes you will you will get hungary but it is a different kind of hunger then your normal i feel con empty and my stomachs growling those are they can go together but usually the hypogly seem is i am hot i feel hen to pass out you want it eats something not because your stomach crawling but because that you just neat some fuel s your getting cold under oh ye asualliimere been there when give a then longer fast something i do not do any more and drank a lot of black coffee this probably an electrolight effect the because coffee as you excrete soda him another electrolytes and then just feeling i needed something this whole thing i need something has have desperation and i never want to be back here again hyprogrise then man is very on it's not fun again when they any when then when they look at you now actual randomize control trials of implementing some exercise were there pretty controlled environment they typically see people if if anything they eat less as supposed to eating more now some people again that is u know studies report averages right and there is individual data points there are some people who at least anecdotally report that exercise makes them were hungry that is completely valid it is now it could be there believe surrounded it could be of number different things but it is important understand that there is individual variability and i think one o the things that have learn to appreciate more is not trying to separate psychology and physiology we would we do this a lot its while one enough the physiology do not care about the psychology of it and now ism kind of appreciating more psychology is physiology that with most things now we have kind of the big psycho social model and ill give an example this lot of people get really caught up with appetite and if we could just suppress people's appetite that is part of it but people do not just we cause their hungry the for a lot of different reasons social reasons especially can you remember the lost social event y ever went to the did not have food right i you look a dinner plates from the eighteen hundreds about this big now how bigger dinner plates the whole offal i rite i if you there is a situational cues right your sitting down to watch t t o grandson popcorn grab some snack whatever i even see this with that how i one personal pick up the pheon and then ever one piss up their for i think there is a similar effect with food no and and same thing right how many times have we either done it ourselves or been a experience people saying owe should have some you should have t lie about call specially right people a i was saying out of somebody last night and i had a beer and they just had a water and ism i feel now need to try and convince them to do that with me what i mean but as humans we are were kind of hurt animals we do not want to be doing something out an isolation o our own now i this is a very tenuous i guess belief of mine but doing things alone in isolation during kind of ancestral times that is going to set off your alarm system cause if you do not have other people you cannot protect yourself right typically things were done together in groups and i think that is the lot of the reason why we tend to be just triple in nature about a lot of things right the whole point to that is on the list of reasons why people eat me have gotten the poi where i think that hunger is actually not even the main reason people eat i stress ah lackasleep or word ye absolutely unless we can do something that addresses all those things ah this that there is a line from a review paper this reviepever came out two thousand elevens by research or me a clean and it is the best review paper have ever read i was called biology's response to dieting the impetus for weight regain and basely went through all the mechanisms of these agitations that happened during fat lost diets and how biology's response is to try to drive you back to your your previous and ism in a butcher tho quote but at the end of the study he said basically the bodies systems are comprehensive redundant and well focussed on restoring to pleaded energy reserves and any attempt or an kind of strategy for weight loss that does not attempt to address a broad spectrum of these things is going to fail and that is why when people say will just do low care you will not be hungry mu you've it people do not just eat because they are hungry i think really trying to get outside the box and and think about these things and especially when you read some of the litter tried i recently read a a systematic review of successful weight lost maintainers which i thought was really interesting ah they took people who had lost to significant about a bodyweightn't kept it off firs for i think it his three years and it basely asked him questions and tried to identify commonalities and there were some thingsthat i expected cognitive restraint self monitoring ah i exercise and then one of the things they sad that i found really fascinating was pretty you biquitists between people they said i had to develop a new identity you are you sear with then simply no then is a actor he is been remember the titans and a america history ax i certainly saw america history ex yes he was he was very large he was five hundred fifty pounds and now he is too thirty and jacket but you life he was how five hundred fifty pounds well ah and he have whenever he puts up post on his histogram of him training it will say i killed my clone to day and i asked him is this whit your talking about creating a new identity he said this is exactly what ism talking about because i had to kill who i was because there was no way i was going t be able to make long term changes if i just did not become a new person because there is i mean an attics talk about this right am people who were alcoholics they had to get new friends they had to hang out at different places because there entire life had been set up a round the life style for alcohol and i would actually argue that eating disorders or disordering patterns is much harder to break then other forms of edition and he about food edition well in some ways bulimia and and arerecy are still addictions you cannot stop eating i you are alcoholic you can abstain from alcohol if you become addicted to psycocane you can abstain from that you can never abstain from food and now imagine tongue of gambling attic well you have got to play the slot in a couple times to day but no more that is that is really challenging yet i just all this stuff it is important to be comprehensive with how we treat these things i these are incredibly important points and to my knowledge i do not think any one has really described it in a cohesive way the way that you are doing here important for people understand this because vas we is a hero scientists i think now the nervous system is creating our thoughts our thoughts are and feelings are relate to psychology and therefore of course our physiology in our psychology are one in the same by directional now there is nowadays here is a lot of interest in brain body in particular got bring a access and we we can talk about that but i i really appreciate that your spelling out how there are these different variables each one can account for a number of different things exercise clearly has a remarkably potent to fact both during the exercise and arms of colonic were over all health and bile markers and then this is wonderful to learn that it can increase the sensitivity to a to society signals i think that make at least my mind place is very high on the list of things that people should absolutely do but that there are other factors too and the identity piece is fascinating it reminds me also your story reminds me also a davigogins who is lye you do not he talks about his former very overweighitself almost as if it was a different person and he uses language that ism not any severe you've inlet avid know avid a bend he is he is every bit is intense and driven as and remarkable human being as he appears to be on line he is that guy but it does seem he had to for less kill off of a former version of himself and and continues to do that every day and i think it what your point about that this other fellow who did u does it does it through a similar process i the word to day seems to really matter it is not you a defeat this former version of yourself and then that that that person is buried and gone you said i killed my clone to day and that is the way that avid talks about it also this is a daily process and i think this is not just a small detail in ting together all these things i think that what you are describing is is fundamental because we can pull on each one of these variables and talk about each one of them but the other day were cohesive whole as it is an individual in ism a sorry you re us t gets that is gasaxiono em i my favorite topics which is you know why do we have such a hard time with losing weight but more keeping it off because of o beast people six out of every seven o beast people will lose the significant about a bodyweight in their life why do we stolen o beauty prom they do not keep it off why do not they keep it off when you look at the see search basically what it suggests is because people think about i am going to do a diet and when lose this weight and they do not give any thought to what happens afterwards right it is think about if you have some canochronic disease r a dick right you you cannot just take insolent once and that is it right you got it take it continuously other wise you are going have problems ism if you do a diet and you lose thirty pounds fantastic but if you then just go back to all your old habits you are going to go back to where you were if not more you cannot you cannot create a new version of yourself while dragging your old habits and behaviors behind you what it'll tell people is as people say what ism doing a cart of for diet or ism doing this diet or that diet and it'll say that is fine do you see yourself doing that for the rest o your life and if the answers yes if you if you really believe that that is con to be staled for you and plenty people lo care and went fasting what whatever they say up felt easy you now i could do this forever great what if you are going to lose weight you have to invoke some form of restriction whether it is a nutrient restriction low car lo fat a time restriction internment fasting any former time restricted eating or salon restriction tracking mack rob whatever you get you get to pick the form of restriction pick the form of restriction that feels the least restrictive to you as an individual and also do not assume that it will feel the same for everybody else because i made this mistake where is lie i i track things i i allow myself to eat severity foods i allow myself to eat some fun foods a but i track everything and ism able to modify my body composition on being good health doing that now does not feel hard for me at part of it is have just been doing it for long but the other people that is very stressful they do not want to they a we'd rather just not eat for we know sixteen hours if that fells easy for them do that because the one thing that there is a couple of reanalysis on a popular diets and basely what they showed was they're all equally terrible for for long turn weight loss but when they stratified them by adherents and none of them were better for adherent over all but when they stratified people just according from lowest adherents to best adherents it was a linear of fact on weight loss really what it says is what is the diet that is going to be easiest for you to adhere to in the long term and you should probably do that and people again this is where i step back and take the ten thousand foot view somebody's say haul do kit genic because i want increase my fat oxidation and i want to do this another talking always mechanisms an everything and that is great can you do it for thrust your life right is that is this going o be something sustainable for you and if the answer is no you probably need to rethink what youreproaches on to be it is incredibly important message basically that by the high light if there was a aversion of highlight or bold face and underline in a in the podcast face i i would highlight boldface and underline what you just said and for those of youth heard it i listen to it twice and then go forward because it is absolutely key i think it also explains a lot of the called controversy that exists out there i think am it also crosses over with the placebo effect i almost want to say pick the the nutrition plan that you think you can a stick to for for a long aperitif time i really forever and picture placebo too because there is there is a lot up with silo woven in t each and every one of these things internment fasting a kit probably even vicar verses ominaboriversis carnivore well even talk about the diet honeymoon period it we you go into a diet you are all fired up about it your verist merit and in what happens with every single diet without exception in research studies is once you get past a few months adherents to starts waiting think going off here we are really talking about a form of relationship ism not id not saying that to be tongue in cheek actually we had a guest early on in the podcast doctor call diceroth he is a psychiatric and um by engineer at stampfored am tremendously successful laser a word winter et camera and he talked about love as a sort of a a an interesting aspect of our psychology where it is a story that you to create with somebody but that you live in to the future of that story when you tie part with somebody that we as referring to romantic love that there is the sort of mutual agreement to create this this idea that you are going to live in to is notch as about how you feeling the moment it is also that you project into the future quite a lot ism seeing a lot of parallels with am a highly functional and effective diet and u and i love it ism not as setting this parallel up artificially a ism setting out because i think that ultimately it was that down to what you said earlier which is that the brain in our decisions about what we are going to stick to are tremendously powerful and i think one thing i will say as i keep in mind when you look at the research take of the medanalysies on say time restricted eating verses non when calories are equated does not seem to be a difference and in wait loss fat loss and most by a marker's health same thing for blow car verses loaf at few quit calories in proline there is there is a reanalysis on by even hall back in to tho seventeen where they looked at the and again actual loss of body fat and another important point was there was i think there is twenty two studies an this but all of them provided food to the participants right that some portent because that make in sure at adherents we much higher in those studies where is various free living studies sometimes you can see funky results people are sneaking food or or there just not really it is very diving away that the study would i really have them unless unless the person is getting continuous support studies were they have a dietician talk to people every week ten acts you have pretty god adherence but h mean that is expensive to have done the studying again lie what limits studies money money and money right m but the low car for soft preaching and cowers are quoted basically no difference in follows now some people get up set about this but it is what to me that is this is great because you get to pick the tool you want the one tool it does not seem to be that much better than another pick the one that works for you i whatever lever you have got a pool you have got a bunch of different options mention a picking something you can stick to for a period of time is there ever a case for some one saying look i to eat low care or even quite for six months and then switch to a more standard motive or cleric maintenance time diet and then switch back isothere any downside to doing that for sake of howl for or weight loss over a time or weight maintenance overtomgess here realms not everyone is trying to lose weight ism then i deftly want to talk about it some want how to eat to maintain wait is i think there are a significant a fraction people out there who are trying to do that yes there anything is there any downside to being a dabbler quite for a few months and then ism never for a few months et camera i think that is i h a great thing especially to mad be find what you feel is easiest for you right a but in terms of as strategy i mean i guess some people a this mike get into dopamine but change and get something new and you fell but more positive in on artier model see i exactly i do not think it is how i would used set things up initially for somebody but if somebody tot hay i just to have some variety and an changed it up as long as there still there behaviors in the doing portion control or whatever it is and there able to sustain a carry defined or to pitting one of their goal is i do not think there is really any downside to it i do think the one than to keep a mind is when you look at going between extremes a low fat to lo care or or vice averse a there can be in that transition period a little bit of weirdness for o better term for example if you been on a cut genic diet and all the sudden you move to a higher care diet you will be basically insolent resistant for just a short period of time now is that going o cause any health problems probably not in the long term it is it as lot especially if you're till controlling calories but just because your body has kind of unregulated these systems dealing most we mostly with fat and glucose production rather than glucose metabolism now if you start taking glucose or carbhidered back in are sonly use some or glucose tolerates test after they ben on quite the do pretty terribly at it but that does not last that long about how long few weeks i think that is hat important for people to know because i have a feeling during those first few weeks are the period of time when a lot of people go running back to what they were doing previously which is not to say that they should not but i certainly done that i to have tried a very lo carbon hydrate diet and i would have assumed and now i know ism completely wrong but i assumed that i was carbohydrate starved for long that my insolent sensitivity which is a good thing by the way folks it would have gone through the of and i would be able to just son shop every bit of glucose that i would have invested through carbohydrate i did indeed switch over and i felt a pretty terrible brain fog i even got some gutters and i thought what is this my blood sugar was low before now my blood sugar should be in more moderate territory but they some what you just said it'd unregulated the enzymes and systems in the body for fatmatabolism on the quite diet and then switching over am there was a basically a camping of of the of the the moles involved in a resembling n black calls transition period and m thing about if you have not weight train before and you start weight training you would feel pretty terrible right you and be sore and stiff and a con o stuff but will say you are not necessarily wrong in what you said about being more insolent sensitive because it depends on how you measure insolent sensitivity if you measure with something am fasting but glucose or fasting insolent or even home i are those ten to be pretty good on low care but that if you do in old glucose tolerances test it sends be pretty bad and it depends on your specific measure right am i i think that the idea that quite makes you to glucose and tolerant are insolent resistant i think again it just a transition period and ism not too worried about it but there is something important to keep in mind and what the reasons like count some mas to transition out of quite typically if like ism working with them or one our coaches ore working with them welkin of instruct them to do it slowly in kind of systematically over a four to eight week period that way hopefully you know they are not having that period of two weeks for the o man why why i feel terrible very important point i want to go to the other end a literally in figuratively and talk about got health because until now and certainly which you dad certainly in the last a few minutes we been talking a lot about her top down processes that the brain the psychology placebo of facts but the very real aspects of those not that i can imagine two thousand colonies as thousand calories and somehow changed the law of third montinamats cannot do that but we been sort of top down in integrating a lot of different ideas into weight lost maintenance and and weight gain but got health least the the more popular studies on got health have blown a lot of things out of the water for instance this idea that you could take jobs mice and let literally give them eagle transplants from lean mice and yes that sounds what it sounds i i feel transplants stealing am inserted through the same end in which it comes out and i point the out beat a lot of people ask me they you know it was conniscari to me i thought yes this is not about investing f sees this as they ay they literally do a a transplant of hes from lean mice in to jobs mice and the jobs mice get lean and yes this has been done in humans limited number of studies and observe ism some pretty impressive effects on weight loss that i have to assume could be related to placebo of fact they might have told these o be people i look yore going to get lean through this people transplant from lean people but more likely it had some effect on their corphysiology i do not know which aspects although i can speculate which ones and they became leaner they lost weight and that is in some sense miraculous when especially given the important roll of psychology and exercise and society signals because ism going to assume that they controlled for a number of those other variables although no study is perfect what are your thoughts about got health as it relates to metabolism energyulization and balance as for the first i all say is ism not a got got heal expert but i well i feel tell to the comfortable talking about it based on conversations have had with people who are experts i one being i stand of coda lose out more well she is sort of a final in this area from what i answers as actually do her masters when i was do my p h t and layman's lab she was scene my playmates for i and the other thing to say is even got health experts and sustain will tell you this they you do not talk to me in twenty years we we just know little i think that is an overall thing the people do understand is the scientific incenses moves very very slow and probably for good reason because if we just flipped our scientific senses based on one study i mean you it would be a mess right it is on to take time before you really understand the implications a the got and what it means when it comes to went loss there probably is a roll in there may we have seen that there is something going on now whether that is it i something were my got back microbial make up that is more ones resistant a perhaps it extracts less calories out of the food you eat we i or perhaps it is elevating be a although i i think that that is probably some one unlikely do you think it it impact the way society signals sir that is to me o back to the brain again that we know that there is a link in the they got brain access and my suspicion is that it probably is working the appetite regulation that the mean if we look at a if we look at the most effective am o beauty treatments out there which is someglutide ai mean you consistently see a yo know fifteen percent we know an average loss of bodywayt which is massive and people keep it off a that is a go p one memetic which is a author on and it basically just as a very very powerful appetite suppress it it'd not well i guess ism interrupting but hopefully with a purpose em but there is this really interesting study and it is in mice admittedly but a publishing a euro sins journal recently and the easily to take away is that many things in nurse science it the get up one works in two parallel pathways in the brain it seems to impact neurons on the hypithelemis that control society exactly what you are saying and in the got it seems to create a am the inactivation of the mechanic sensors in the god so the perception is that the god is full even were full her i should say not full because i think people who take bsomicuti do not feel loaded unless i do not know mat they might but that one feels as if there got is actually fuller because these mechanic sensors that send scratch our sending signals to the brain oh act ye have some food ism not empty down there it am ay rat i ism tickled by this result mostly because every time i hear about a a drug or a romolecul having effect we think it has an effect at one location men it is kind of interesting that especially for something am appetite regulation that it would be impacting body and brain in parallel an we forgive me i notes a gate ism i thing really excited about this and an here you are telling an grow scientist me that a lot perhaps circles back to these brain mechanisms of society i mean i think that an especially looking at the research leapt in we used to think oke me abolish is mostly liver base and then there is a there is you do not metabolism atipesite and skull muscle but none of the stuff exists in isolation there is much cross talk between these pathways and that is when we get into mechanisms the one things i love mechanisms but one things i tell people is keep in mind that when you are dealing with an outcome right when i say outcome base were talk about physical outcomes wait loss fat loss changes in blood markers whatever though that is the summation of thousands of different mechanisms sure sometimes you can effect a mechanistic pathway and you g it con a straight down the line outcome but not always youknow whenever you make a treatment or kind of anything into the system it is throwing a pebble in a lake right creates ripples and we do not always know what those are going to be right a and that is why what may we have seen certain drugs wat works on this pathway and then they list off all the side effects you go how would it create that many side affected because nothing for the most part they do not just work in one place there is multitude of places it works a in in to your point about a me guide and the effects on a methanol censers it is probably while od people report actually kind no low grate nausea a it when there using me outside because of that because if your you know that feeling is usually not a real comfortable feeling be mean that will get you to not eat i think there is absolutely likely a connection a but we have not fully elucidated how that works and we think about how complicated the gut is i think i heard something there is more youknow tar's more cells in our microbic by far than there are in our body we are any more and terms of a sell per cell level we are actually more bacteria than we are you carry out i there is a just in sonunberg who one of the world experts on microbes he is in the lab up stairs from mine at stamford and a he is this idea it is just an idea that because we are indeed more bacteria than we are sells the questions whose the host and who the passenger maybe we e are just maybe there exploiting us to take them around and interact because they interact and grow on one another ans of this idea this freaks people to let freedmen will of this that maybe human beings are just actually the vehicles for the microfiche other way or out anyway kind of a a scary thought a do you do anything specifically to support your got microfilm are you a robotic guy or a fermented foods gyre a fiber guy again ism cannot go straight down the line from whatever from sudan another experts if you want to improve gut health one of the biggest levers the three biggest levers you can pull is not eating too many calories exercising there is that there is a connection between exercise and the gut and fiber we it is of the things we know dithery fiber seems to positively impact the gut because it is a what is called a pretonic you are gut microbioda can take especially soluble fiber although there is actually some evidence at least in mice that they it might be able to use some insoluble fire as well i think usance was doing a study looking an himmycelulos an actually seeing that some specific forms of microbioda flourish with jimmy cellulose suggesting that they may actually be getting some kind of fuel out of it which is really interesting a begin in mi just huge cannot you are got microfilm can produce these short chained fadiacids from a by fermenting a this the the soluble fire and there is quite a bit of evidence that these volatile fadiacids which can be then actually a reabsorbed in through the liver that they have some positive effects ism for example butyrate when they have done berate supplementation the have actually seen positive effects on insolent sensitivity what we seem to understand is that more diversity seems to be better fiber seems to be positive prebodics seem to work much better than protonic supplemented prebiono yes if the problem of most the probionics is there typically not concentrated enough to actually colonize and even if you do colonize what happens is tit let say you colonize am some microbiota that you did not really have much of if you are not fueling it with the appropriate fire it is not going to stay anyway because it is essentially going to starve the research seems to really clearly suggest that eating in a fiber at which is again a periodic that that is a better way to get a healthier got per say then robotic what fiber sources do you use and i think i most i realize there is a huge array of choices out there but people will want have some ideas as to how they could perhaps medic what you are doing yet and i was to say diversity i a some there is there is various evidence from versus different fire sources am forts in vegetables obviously am we know grains some whole grains a some cereals a and then various other sources this is one of the things where we do not really have a good idea if this one source of fires better than another source of fiber we just know that fiber over all pretty good and one they it'll tell people is if you want a long levity hack i mean fiber is kind of longevity hackie if you look at some of these cohort studies ore is a actual recent really large reanalysis of over a million subjects am and basically what it showed was that for every ten gram increase in fire there was a ten per cent reduction in the risk of mortality and that extended specifically also to cardiovasculases and cancer one things it'll tell people when they get really into you nowhither tenement staying or you know all a is son thingsthey that is great that is great are you eating over fifty sixty grams of fibraday and i ti conceptualize fifty sixty gram treaty a a a but a what is to say i quarter plate of richly a and the brolly sin stack to the ceiling hen richly is is reasonably a stacked on their a proximally how many grams of fibers that if it is a a two cups archly is a a flout two in grams of brolly person would probably five six grams of fiber and i need to get how much pray well i only say i would typically what the recommended dose is is fifteen grams per thousand calories and take because i your eating low calories it is it is difficult to get in a fiber in a but based on and again these are cohort studies but you cannot do twenty your long randomize human control trials unfortunately the does not really appear to be a top end at least for the benefits of fire that it probably bawls down to how much you can tolerate without feeling uncomfortable right because if your eating a ton of fiber i mean it at some point it is not can be very comfortable exercise becomes uncomfortable and wore hazardous ye and as ye kind of touching on that because it is important a you a log people have kind of in the carnie ore comments said well you do not need fire you poop just find without it and always say will pooping is the last reason to have fire tat yes it does help it does seem to make a elimination easier i can you do not do it more frequently at bulk to stool but that is that why you should eat fiber why should eat fire is because of the effects of mortality and some of the bushbuck will be hell this is healthy usurious and what all say is meaning healthy people do this and therefore how people more fire on there for and i mean at there is there something to that but if it was just healthy user by us typical you would see some disagreement between the studies and an great example that is red meat not every study shows red meat has an associates with answer in mortality there's there is differences doping on the population house depending on what they to find us hired meat lowered meat wither its process on process but i have not found a study on fire and cart of ask disease and cancer and mortality were it did not show improvements from hire fiber to me that suggest that that that effect is real a and again as much fiber as you can get in comfortably i would try to do it a because it seems have some really powerful effects and is good for the got microfilm the other thing that may be a consideration for microfilm is there is some evidence that saturated fat may not be great for he microfilm that it a reduces the a the prevalence of some some of the more positive strange of bacteria and that appears to be a not much from the saturated fact itself but from the bile in products that combined with saturated fat seems to have a negative effect on some of these more am healthy reforms have got microbiota but again this is really difficult because we do not even know necessarily yet which species of got microbiona or positive or negative and that is landing this gets in to some of these studies where they may call it disposes sound scary but dismiss is just means that the got changed it does not necessary it does not tell you anything qualitative about whether the change was bad or good and these are just things i think we need to keep o mind we talk about this stuff that this stuff is still very much in its infancy but in terms the big lever levers i mean it is pretty much fits with what we know about healthy life style exercise do not eat too much consume a good amount of fiber from diferdiver sources fantastic a fantastic because it fits with what i to think of its con the center of mass of evidence right and i ism trying to get some window into what your process is around selection of studies and no one study being holy but when you look at as you mention all the studies on fiber having it a a positive fact to some degree er another it is pretty hard to refute that there is not something really interesting there i will not they hot tell people's one study i mean sometimes it'll change my opinion base on a single studywhents really well done and very powerful but usually one studies just can move me just a little bit ten may be if another one comes on to me obit more right and they very slowly in when it gets i men my my experience with we'll deal claustral this some mi change to mind on a while back o when i was younger but circus two thousand five getting into grad school cold of the prevailing thought was well it is not much the ell yell it is the radio of elder to h dell that is what matters and probably about five years ago and i was i was pretty strong about that opinion and in five years ago looking at these mandolin randomization studies a kind of went i cannot hold this position any more what is certain what is your advised position on else if you look at the research h dells important because it is a marker of metabolic health if you have high h deal it suggests that you are metabolically quite healthy you very rarely will you have high h ell and high s r p which is inflammatory marker or deregulated bluglucose almost exclusively people who have high h dell will have good bile markers of a metabolic health but if you take drugs that raise h dell it does not reduceurisk cry basket disease in mend in mendillian randomization studies which pencilling randomization basely uses natural randomization some people are in the case of h dell naturally higher secretes or naturally lower secretor of h dell and we talked about how you cannot really do at twenty our human randomized control trial and when you are trying to examine something heart disease i mean that is a life time exposure issue it is very unlikely that you are going to pick out differences between treatments and two years or even five years i mean people do not develop typically do not develop heart disease until there in there know fifty sixties and seventies womendilling randomization allows is to say o k we have these people who naturally secrete more or less we can stratify those and look at what is their risk if you look at people who are lost crew f hotel verses high secretor of wheel with holding some of the other key variables consistent elder you do not see an effect on hart disease really of elder of tell got it of but when you look at elder and you look at the lifetime exposure to elder it is a linear effect on heart disease and we we know that it is actually not much elder butts for i able lip proline b but that tends to track with elder just in general and if you look at the mechanism when we know that elder can penetrate the intithelium a there is the mechanism is present if we look at the epidemiology its supports that it is a an independentrous factor and en again these mandolin ranivization studies where we can kind of look at people's exposure over a lifetime and then we see that line or kind of dose dependent a fact to me that was convincing enough to change my mind on that particular topic and then if you look at some of the frammingham data look at am hi if you stratify hide verses lo h deal both groups looking at hi elder and low elder if you have high heel lo evil you will still be lowers factor than somebody was hotel and hieoldiel right to the rase does matter stheracio does by same thing with with inflammation if you look at people who a lo inflammation lo elder they will have a lowest then people who are low inflammation hioldiel again that was kind of sufficient for me to change my mind but it is took it was not just one study came out it was look an then there is another study and then another study and another study and in a certain point i go of well now i other have to change my mind or ism basically just got a be cognitively discitat and say no i do not believe all that and and i think that is one of the things to keep in my people we will say a you are your saying this is a bad study very rarely we i call something a bad study because data is just data but the issue becomes how it is presented and how broadly it is applied and the mainstream media or by you people on fitted influences and what it'll do is try to step in and say of let us consider explain z is well and then it is not a bad study but let just be careful bout how broadly we imply the interpretation w and i i think you are in a very unique and important position to be able to place things into their proper contact because of this for lack a better word holistic view of how the psychology placebo facts also carrot a quarphysiology relate to one another and on in fact i think that your training as about comes and then training as a am in nutrition with somebody who donlayman who was pushing you too focus on outcomes anything that is a beautiful am caps r of the the continuum at which one can look at something because for those a you do not know out there it lot of laboratory studies on mice an humans for instance in the mobile chemistry or in beer studied you will see a change in some molecule can be quite dramatic and then the assumption is oh yo just take you take the drug that will change that molecule on a particular direction and then you will get the effect you want it that at the whole organism level the person will lose weight the person will gain muscle the animal will ism not i have alshimers et camera buy just dozen work that way because of the redone an see and this interplay well great example of that is my research was actually in roans all my all my studies on preaching metabolism and an loosing in particulars what we are studying well we know if you give loosing increases muscle proving synthesis but we also know if you supplement with loosing people do not get more muscular i was at as li as long a you to do a supplement wen lost night an i write and how is that possible when you know muscle building is not just proline synthesis it is also the balance between synthesis and degradation i an degradation just happens to be very very difficult to measure but a a great example and again here the cool things won my paged was a pal changed the way i ate i which i thing is interesting before i had been a it eight mill it at every two hours tod feels a day that when i can under at in that thirty grams are preaching you came that a men drip going in was the idea right i just have an ivy hooked up of menolascis not really folks not really debut that that was cone toe concept but the first study i did we basically looked at o k a lot of people had measured the amplitude of proving thesis in response to camel we wanted to see how long does this last and where is at peak right and my thought was of will it a lobby track with plasmaloosing you give for those that are not familiar loosing is the mean acid that is almost exclusively responsible for increasing muscle proline synthesis when you eat proline it is it is one of the branch chiminoascis we wanted to see one gallons this effect last we we fed these animals a way proving and again i thought oka will have or long plasbelosine stays up that will be how long i probings of the mistakes up and we got the probings of the estate aback and it was piled at ninety minutes are sorry piqued from forty five to ninety minutes and then was back dow to massive by hundred eighty minutes and when i went to do the plasbolosing analysis mi shock was at three hours plboloosing was still plateaued out is of well when i look at the initiation factors that will show me something i for those not familiar am this is part of the more signaling pathway one of the two of the targets of tour when its stimulate loosing stimulates i tour two of the targets of into are a approaching compound called fort e b p one and then another one is call old a ride is all proving as six ka i don't want to get into the specifics about it because it is count be on the scope but basically when these things are phosphorelated by more a it increases a the rate of translation initiation which translation initiation is basely the process of the ribosome hooking on to the imam in a and then starting proline synthesis i i was looking at the phosphor relation before a buy on and our p as six as i go ka well it'll probably see these things come down it at three hours still plateau and then it was what is what is going on heres i kept actually kept rerunning the data and rerunning the data and rerunning the data and it'll never forget i went into layman's office and this is no six months after we have done the study cause hi analysis six time an the where are we with this duration study i hi i just got to run the plasma data again because it is not right and he is well why is it not right and i well just does not make any sense and i kind of went through he is a won described to me your technique how are you doing this i described it in what how is your standard ere i told him what the numbers were said it sounds its good data he said it sounds you are trying to get the data to fit your conclusion and you need not change your conclusion to fit the data and that statement this is why we do gets why yet you neon an adviser this is why ism skeptical of everything because i have had many of my ideas crushed by my own data right we ox in it up this this am this kind of e fact as this phenomenon is called a muscle proline synthetic refractory period basically once you trigger the system kind of runs for define period of time and then it takes time to es mentally reset for lack of a better term it is also been referred to is the muscle full effect a but i looked at that and said why am i eating every two hours then then there was even a study out of wolf's lab back in ninety nine i think were they infused to me essential monoacid for six hours proving synthesis went up peed at sixty minutes came back down a hand and twenty and never went back up again maybe ism being naive but i would have thought that if proving synthesis goes up and then comes back down that eating more often would be exactly the thing you and want to do if your goal was to get increased proline synthesis because you be pinging the system periodically but that but the problem is the plasma nuaciters till elevated it is essentially eating the whole way through right from the perspective of lose on the sells up that was one of those things were i said what ism hexagon to eat less often because if ism eating and three hours later have still got capped out plasma me no acids and we looked at all kinds of stuff we looked at interests la scene just to make sure that thou know that was not falling off it was not we looked at all the plasma essential men a ids because you were thinking well maybe proving synthesis's you sucking somebodies of a menaces out of the plasma and their dropping and that is causing it to kind a short circuit the system that was not the case it just essentially what the evidence suggest i think whether only once to show this far ism not rate to say that this is a real effect because i hold out the idea the date artifacts do exist and you cannot be tolly sure but we saw a an increase in amp kinase kind of around this mark where proving to the to started falling off we also saw a decrease in interest or eight p and proving synthesis is an eh t p dependent process and what we think might be happening is you are consuming proline and you are up you are increasing muscle proving thesis and then it a certain point it is has enough effect on your you in energy metabolism in yourselves that a kind of short a not short circuits it but it kind of cuts it off right again we are the only once to show that that ism aware of and that was again in rats i i i i was taught by data those date ism willing to bet my my tow on my foot on my leg on in my life on it'd probably barely bet the end of my little tow on that one ism not quite sure but it is interesting none the less for causing that is a great example of o k we are looking at this mechanism of into signalling and if we just looked at that we would say will prating thesis can to stay elevated for no past three hours but that is not what we saw yet i think it is again that is why i really try o get people to say willets mechanisms are important it is in especially if your seeing an outcome it is important to identify mechanisms that may explain that but let us the back from the mechanisms from trying to chase mechanisms let us look it chasing outcomes in terms of what we recommend the people excellent point in terms of a chasing outcomes a number of people a knower interested in weight loss or weight maintenance and several times throughout to days conversation we have come back to this issue of a society signals whether not their brain base body base or both not wanting to eat more is a great way to maintain or lose weight because you simply do not want to i heard you mention earlier that proline and maybe specific types of proline or sources of proline may provide better study signals than other mackronuw trance could you briefly talk about how mackerel trains including proline but also curb hydrates and fats in pacts society and from the standpoint of somebody who for instance would to conical lose a few pounds right probably would be happy to gain a legit of lean body mass provided it was you k o particular location on their body that seems to be a a thing now directed hypertrophy if you will and how much theyshould focus on proline as a quart component of creating this diet assuming everything else as being done correctly they going o hit the right number of calories relative to their am their output neat et camera how something about protein i subtlety signals and are animal sources ofproatine indeed we by available tricking a word a and forsake a muscle building but also for sake of somebody who just would to lose body fat they do not wont lose muscle and they to bring their weight down a few pounds lot o things one or more meet law things to unpack there of the macro tread's preaching is deftly the biggest lever that you can pull because even if you know it does not take a ton approaching to get about the muscle building benefits i mean to think the benefit is really start to plateau out around one point six grams for kilogram of body weight there is some evidence that may be even up to two point for or two point high grahams for kilo may give a little bit more benefit i think it probably looks something an as tope in terms of a curve where you as you put more into the system you always get a little bit more but it just gets to the point where it is infintessibly small benefit that it is for all intensive purpose is no benefit but you mention one point six grahams approbating porkilegram of body weight is it would you consider that at a threshold that most people should try an achieve daily i think i see very few downsides to hitting that i mean i know some people an the sugingto get into a supper conversation by dispeople say while i do not want a stimulate more because as can make me die early and i think one of the things to keep in mind is if you look at this kind this thought process out there that if your stimulating him try that proatingeis can make you i early and first off we have very little human outcome day to support that claim and the second thing is if you look at any macronutrian isolation i can make a mechanistic argument that it is can to kill you fat if you take in fat in decreases flomedia dilation flowing that dilation is important for heart health in the short term copydrates stimulate insolent insolent pro in inflammatory and all these other things and i can make an argument for any single macron the and to be negative prolong levity i what i really want people this is something that even scientists get wrong they look at an acute response of something and assume that that is going to relate to long term outcomes in signaling let us just take exercise for example if i if you didn't know anything about exercise and i said to you and you men to do something that is going to make you your heart ran go up your blood pressure go up your inflammatory mark rest go up your reactive oxygen species increase you are going to say as to damage your muscles you are gong to say ism not doing that that sounds horrible but it does all those things in the short term but what is the long term effective exercise you actually get he their all all those things improve now's not saying that you don't prating is a along levity hack or anything that but what ism saying is i think some of the arguments out there based on mechanistic this increases intort therefore we do not want to do it i think it is a much more complicated argument than than just that there is that preaching is the biggest lever i would shoot for one point six grams for kilogram if you can do more great there does not see to be really downsides to it even up to very high levels opportune a hose anionic to the study the was a your long randomize control trial i and again it just one year but they were looking at all sorts of different big markers and basically even up to forearms for kilogram approving they could not really find any negative health out comes from it other than people were just satiated they ended up eating less calories a preaching is a big lave lever because one it has a higher thermic effect of food getting but more gallery burn prepay even though it is not ton because t e f is a pretty small percentage of your over all energy expenditure but still benefit you are getting the effects on lean bodymass it is going t if you are in a diets can help preserve in bodymass if you are at maintenance it is can to help build a preserve line bodymasson if your in a surplus can help bill preserving bodymass then you get the effects an appetite now on to be careful because appetite effects tend to be very specific to individual foods right you can take a high proline food and make it not very a not very satiating take for example a really tasty prating bar which a when we were getting into this the no such thing existed a now you have preaching bars i shake pretty darn good but if yo one of them i mean are you really satiated i i do not really feel satiate after my proving bars my premial snack right right why because i mean it is process to refined and i made to be very palatable ki but take something a two hundred gram chicken breast very satiating right i an its whiten people say wall carnal hydrates are t very satiating depends on the care hydrate i mean when you look at them the satidyan decks a plain bake potato is about as satiating as it gets i i eat a bowl of oatmeal i feel pretty good afterward a for a while right i mean at i usually it'll eat that along with some other things but i i i completely agree am the see your saying that the deform that it comes in may been how much chewing as required how good it smells the r at all hod all associations as to me a stake is it an incredible meal like i mean if i had to pick one food that i can eat even ism not pure carnivore for the rest of my life it would be that because i think it would get me where i need to go and then it'd probably have to sneak some fire but i it is an excellent point i i have a question that i don't want to take us off track but it'd hoping it relates enough that you can answer it now the context of this if ism going to eat lets say two grahams ism prkilegram body weight proline and ism not eating multiple meals polite maybe ideating two or three male per day ism certainly going to be eating more than the thirty graham threshold that was thrown around for a long time that we can only a him late thirty grams of proline per meal she just not worry about that some of it is going to go towards the thermic a affect of food as some of that might be convert into glucose of all things through luconagenesis should i worry about this thirty graham cut off because i think balancing that the one point six gram for kilogram body weight threshold with number of meals with the need o exercise and work and live my life and sleep at steer up pretty soon you you you run into bottle next thou you just cannot do it all on a your spending much time time o folks o ad atomize all the than out at the same time you would lose your mind and your body ism what what what is necessary in terms of ism frequency in if one is getting enough proline and then tied into that question is there any reality to this idea that if you eat one meal prepay or your fasting and then you eat a you willie say a two hundred grahams of prone in a single feeding that you can assimilate more because you were are proline starved is that is that a real thing most the studies with proline are after a fast ism because a to assess it with stable stope you have to be in a study state ism we have not observed that it does not appear that fasting really kind of a lows you to a simulate more proline after a fast this gets into a core of one of the things i looked at my age t which is does proline distribution matter because most america get about sixty five to seventy per cent of the proline at dinner i breakfast tend to be pretty minable prone a foods to any culture's actually eat a big breakfast and not a big luncheon dinner i get on o we'll honer that tat was ideal will get into circadian timing an men does any one actually do that stake an eggs for breakfast and then tavern off the rest of the day i know german culturetons to have a big breakfast but also to to be sugary foods and what not as far as telilogically ism not ism actually not sure about that ism if you look at that and then you consider that proline does not really have a storage mechanism i people ill say well lean tissue is a storage mechanism i that is saying a house is a storage facility for wood dunno ye if your house as mane out of wood you could get wood out of it but that is not while you build the house i your building the house out of a demand same thing for muscle tissue ism there is a free pool of a mental acids but it is very very small when you consider things fat which basically has unlimited storage capacity rob hydrate a rest of the large storage capacity you can store me fore five hundrgrams of cryohydrate between your liver and muscles and then proline which almost has no storage calpac the a the idea that o a you could make up for low proline at one meal by over consuming another meal did not make sense to me one of the studies we did and again in rats we took a both groups were getting weir proline high quality proline they were getting thesactsim in a calories exacts mount of nitrogen exact same macros everything was same only difference was one group basically got kind of three meals of similar amounts of proline dinner was a bullbat bigger because we wanted to keep it somewhat someone he people eat but each meal was could be over the threshold a simulate muscle proline synthesis were as the other group i constructed it the first two meals of the day should not stimulate muscle proline synthesis it should be under that threshold and in the last meal was about seventy percent of the to daily proline and we had am eat those for eleven weeks and it'll it'll never forget this this is how obsessive i became about it is there's a hundred ten animals in the study and i made all the diets and i weight out exactly every single meal for every single animal for eleven weeks i was in there at six i m i was in there at noon and was in there at six p m got a page design that favors dream a gan a dreams mud also at the end of eleven weeks we looked at lean body mass we looked at body fat we looked at a hinds limb weights we generally see differences in lean body mass but what we did see was a difference in hind land weights an was not massive but there was a significant difference in the size of the muscles of the hind land of these animals and as interesting that there was not a a difference and lean body mass and what we found at least with the liver the animals that were eating a the one meal with really high proline actually had bigger livers a not a huge amount and not something to havecanciterun safe but they it was a statistically significant difference and to me at least con trying to explain no difference and lean body mass but at a difference in these hind land weights maybe there is some sequestering of the that that is fueling a little but more approaching synthesis of the splainnic tissues rather than cause your capping out sell muscle proline synthesis and we do know that the splinting tissues are more sensitive or have a greater rate of proline clothes pray the rate of skeletal muscle proline synthesis in humans is about one per cent per day it takes a hundred days to turn over shall muscle were is your entire got your entire g i will turn itself over in two to three days rights but her really and the liver also has a very high amount of proline synthesis which is one o the recent is acting on the most metabolically active organs s o all that to say it has not it is been there is been one human study that showed something similar am and then there's been a couple others that did not and then then the ferment fasting studies which s maybe a good tool to look at compared to continuous feeding it one thing i will say is at looks the sixteen eight interment in fasting style there is been a couple studies with grant tensely and this is something have changed my mind not as well grantinsley has done a couple studies where they did used the sixteen eight protocol they had them train during their feeding window and they had them eat i think it was at least three proline containing meals during that set hours a humans these documents and they saw no difference in lean body mass at the end of the study compared to people who were eating you you know as many times do they one throughout the day now if you look at some of the more ah extreme forms of fasting alternate day fasting or twenty two two or twenty four there are some studies where you do start to see difference as an lean body mass my suspicion is and i i ism just guessing this is tenuous my suspicion is probably if you are getting two to three high quality proline meals in a day a you are getting the vast majority of the benefits of proline that the most importanthing it is getting enough total ah and then secondarily trying to get at least two or three male with high quality proline in but if you are going pretty extremely alternate day fasting or maybe only one meal a day then i think there may be some effects on lean body mass but again the can be unmitigated as well if you are doing in hard resistance training typically that is the biggest lever in terms of lean body mass yes proline distribution may make a difference but ism trying to put in contacts of people on fill i thington to go on eat you four meals o day am but again what i would say is some of the more milder forms of time restricted eating appears to be fine for lean body mass now that the avoid is the following one or the nice things by animal studies is when you consider if you one to have a high subject number high level of control in a long duration it is pretty much your only option right a i have a in our research review a raps i created a then diagram which basically is three am circles crossing over one is study duration one is am level of control and the other one is subject number and to get all three of those circles to cross over it almost hast to be in animals right in this entraps is not it is a news letter or a book its it is our monthly research re view try every month we review five am studies the come out and fitness a nutrition well used do at least one nutrition one training in one supplement per per month w i will put a link to where the can sign out this is a a sign out you or mat gran up love its we script subscription base service basically when people might look it my study we why did you see difference and and muscle weights where's some of these other studies do not see a difference i wide out every single meal for eleven weeks an keep in mind that eleven weeks in a roman life span is a really long time that is about an eighth of their total life span is it that there is no effect or is it that the effect is relatively small and would take a really long time and very high level of control to see in humans i do not know but i think what i would say relatively confidently is if you are going to do a sixteen eight interment and fasting you are probably fine especially and again what is the goal right if you are a body builder looking to be the most massive person you possibly can or you areole a football player you are some in some feel that having as much lean body mass as possible is really important for you then i would say we're not really gaining a whole lot by doing some form of time restricted eating i think most of he people listening to this do not do not fall into that cat right then must be want to maintain or lose weight they would it perhaps ad a lit of cotton cop shape or muscle to pas vicarial of their body and lose body fat it and i think you are normal forms of time restricting in your nobly perfectly find for that right and again if i do not want somebody to think while i do i also a day fasting there is no point to be resisted training cause ism gan to lose muscle mass non noon no you can still build muscle doing that you just might not build as much muscle as you would if you were eating in a more traditional format but if that is something that works for you in your goals an e special if it is fat laws or you no control your calories then again it is ha it is about the diarchy of what is important right to answer your question i do think that timing and frequency matters a not much frequency but distribution more i i thing the distribution matters but it is a it is a much smaller lever than just getting enough total routine in and then as far as animal very is plant i use to be in the camp of there is no way somebody can build as much muscle on a plant base my it and now i think have come back to you can it just requires a but more planning i and i do not wat to say always but it is very difficult to do without an isolated source of prating unless you are gong to supreme with an isolated plant source of prating it is very difficult to get enough without going over on total calories because you can figure that especially take somebody who may be calorically restricted training enough preaching from whole intact plant sources you have got a few different thing's working against you one the sources approaching your consuming also have coma hydrate and ore fat i too it is a less be of legal form of routine and three it she lower quality of praying in terms of it has typically less looking less branching muoacis unless essential menoacice you answer the question that i almost interrupted you to ask which was does it well down to the lupine content and a it sounds that is one of the components and that a a lot of the vegan vegetarian sources of excellent proline am that excellent proline vegetarian a began source is package with calories from arbor hydrates and or fat that make it heart to stay stay under which i for threshold whereas a stake is i not an visit for people might one who boy that forathical reasons first that is a different matter entirely but a stake or a piece of chicken or an egg is while negouno has a yoke which is there is fat there but is most a pure proline fat source there is no cargo hydrate along for the it i think what i would say is you you can do it take little more planning am and your almost always if you are a vegan especially you can be better off something with some isolated form of proline a vegan for approaching now this word gets in to people say w one about the limiting amioacids and those sorts of things it is a consideration am some of the better forms of a vegan praying an terms of a menace content are soy now i can everybody hear everybody screaming on line about the testostro levels in terms of actual outcomes and looking at testosterone there is a recent reanalysis looking at soy and i think if it is your only source of procaine then maybe the dosages high enough to cause some weird effects a but if you are just using it once or twice a day does not seem have an effect on testostronor estrogen that can be a decent source of roaring because it is a complete procaine source i it does have a peaty cops of one which poetics is basically a a measure a praying quality based on does it provide enough of all the monoacid that none are limiting and soy is one of the only vegan source that does that interestingly potato praying isolate actually has a similar essential menaced content to way isolated protect approaching it is just really hard to find have be n no been trying to e aging in to take no vegetarians take not because a vegan's rather cause way is vegetarian am an way is very a hi quality ratings very hi pop proving orating directing a creating way now out of am i think it is i may is characterizes but i believe they are able to produce an ow yeast or something that that a be no for vegans now this is a great option because you can have way that is not animal base that is going to be every bit as good as an animal base way i think that is great am getting to the loosing megabuck sorry another reason that the using an isolate approaching can be helpful is am because it is more bile of elbow as well once been isolate tout when it is the prating to me up in the actual plant material it tends to be less bile of bible now cooking can help increase the bow of ell bounty a bi of ell obillitecause it break some of those bonds and and what not but it still seems to be lower and you do not it is really interesting there is a recent study where they did ay a corn wheat and peeling of proline verses way and basely the outcome was a thirty grams of each similar stimulated voting synthesis to a similar degree but the plasmosome no acids in the a plant base prating still did not get as high as with way now it may be that that is just it does not matter because what she get to a certain level you get all the benefits a bastille found it interesting none the less that did not quite get as high a the other thing to consider with the vegan'sources sprouting is the loosing content one of the studio we did was we looked at wheat soy egg and way i son trogenist meaning we actuated prating between the groups i sick work we accreted we actuated calories and we looked at muscle routine synthesis and i think this was the mules were fifteen present of total energy from proline a your food guide pyramid level of proline and we saw that in the wheat and soy group a they did not increase muscle proving synthesis but the egg and way group increased muscle proving synthesis now what is really interesting as we went back and we took wheat and added free loosing to it to match the loosing content of way and the proving synthetic response was identical again i i do not to simplify things too much but loosing appears to really be driving this ship and it'll never forget a lawman call me is office one day and he would always do these thought experiments a he he liked to think about we something occurs the way it does dangerous dangerous territory yes he would say one day it'll e fraise e lane why do you think the body evolve to just sense loosing for muscle proline synthesis and of course ism oh it'll no may i just work here just trying to get my the a to a and my say we think about it you would want something that really was not extensively metabolized by the gotten liver because you would want its show up in the blood in values that reflect what you just at make sense and you would wanted to have passive diffusion across the muscle cell because you want to be concentration dependent which it is get into the tissues involves that need it most right t you do not not having active transport but rather passive transport a soli thought that that was really interesting the way broke that down you few different options for the vegan folks out there you can use an isolated source of of proline and again those can be good options coming because this plant based way s can to be a great motion for folks ism you can add free loosing to it to whatever your source of preaching is just by supplemented using my housing now it taste horrible yet think i her that maybe have even tried it as completely non puller does not dissolve in anything is not a capital roast it cannot be put no capitals ye you could take a capsid for example if your eating your normal meal you could just take a capsid of one gram of losing is public to bump you off bump you up enough that you are gong to be good to go m and then there is there is options i bless especially with corn corn is actually very high and loosing as a percentage of its profit they got a remember you go not eat corn on a cob and you are getting two grams of total proving as not that much loosing but if you isolate out the proving put into a powder well now when you are getting eighty ninety per cent of the weight is now proving corn is actual about twelve per cent loosing in terms of the proving great force of loosing it is almost frank deficient some other meal acids but you can blend it with a few other source of preaching you could blend it with a soy aha pe and you can create these complimentary bless they would actually have quite a bit of loosing but also some heather essential me to laid there are options out there for plant base folks and may we have seen people who are plant based i you do not built impress of bouts of muscle ears quite a few body boxers or plant based sunderance athletes it and even though i we tale about muscle meeting about muscle building oft and i performance in endurant sports and also just performance for the typical person who is doing some party of vascular training hopefully some resistance training also and just living life i in many wont people now seems are begin a at least of waiting meat in particular red meat ism not one of those people i limit the amount and i certainly focus on the quality what i but i do red meat which brings me to question i about just generally in terms of food choice i can we come up with a relatively short summary at of the following tell me f this is i correct or not that most of us should be focussed on for forsake of health he span and life spend i should be focussed on in jesting minimal non process an kindly process foods you ay be even cooking our own food i realize that is heresy now but ideal we do some that and and really trying to avoid foods that ism or highly process and have lots of sugar and amusingnuss as a seaway to get into e question that i really want your answer to give been dying to ask you this which is if a sugar in take is not actually going up i as much as people think it is wire people getting much fatter i what what you think about um just a general statement that we should try and eat foods that are lo to no mentally to not process for about eighty per cent of our foods is that of yes the number it is hard tracts you get you no completely unprocessed food cause almost everything goes through some from a processing inking and anything in would not survive long i on we o so for rats ye on a shell that an apple over banners omen ground oats to me as losers in a bunch of other seventheyewould be minimal process a a stake is not really process although it is cut off that the animal it a there is h there is a few steps in there but am that sort that is what ism yet and i think everybody kind gets the just it's probably will but pedantic when it comes to the stuff o ti is good o on things i appreciate mate appreciate about you is on that i get tease a lot by a people close to me which is the caveats and the insistent on precision is really important because especially when on line a communications these days is a run away train know what will you is too easy to is interpret what your say very easy misinterpret and the misinterpretations are often used to leverage whole new ideas about what is not is not true must about what is a i really appreciate the new aunts and this is what a long form podcast fray allows us to do is is catch every every curve i would a hundred per cent agree with what you said that if you were going to make a broad stroke that trying to for us some manly process foods is very important the one avion i would say is i think it is important understand why because otherwise people can make this heard association that if i eat any mental or any process food it is going to kill me or every time i eat it it is am smoking a cigarette my health my long cavities declining based on the studies we have it is mostly about the energy that process food just gets people to spontaneously eat more and and a kevenhole showed this and his study that was very he design some f the most elegant studies in nutrition gray and they basically took people from a manly process food diet and then gave them access to ultra process foods her very few instruction just eat to you feel satisfied and they spontaneously increase their carry and take my five hundred calorie to day i mean that is that is massive there is something we quite haven't quite figured it out your people walls is it is car its sugar it does not appear to be sugar in terms are just an isolation i went is fats then's appear to be fats nicely most the combination of sugar and fat hardly what is the commination of sugar fat and salt hardly but there is some kind of overall magic to the texture and the mouth feel an just overall palatability of stuff which is always why i say there is right and wrong way to the different diets for example like shoe's right way do plantable and then there is what is in some of the documentaries where they are eating plantmakes mack and cheese you knowhow get i love good mack cheese but that should not form li that shouldn't be pitched is a healthy diet just because it is plant base right because i mean you are eating a highly process food that is very potable and easy to over eat same thing for keep you have now got keep ice creams and you have got you know keep cookies ad all these sorts of things doglike y and if you look at him the expo have more calories than the normal stuff an unlike yet t is is completely missing the point here you are actually just taking yourself the whole point of those diets is the reason you ten to lose weight is originally good luck ten years ago doing a keep diet eating process food right you just could not do it really now you can but the prom is it is not can to work becauseyour con to be still consuming many calories because even though it is keep what are thy doing whether try to make it more palpable tor try to make a better mouth feel which i guys if you are being keep for the sake of being keep great but if there is if you have hopes of body composition modification hat's going to you are really negatively impact yes i think minimizing the amount of process food you con som cannot be important now that being said it depends on the individual and their goals if you are goal is to for example build muscle or maintain a high bodyweight for a sport for example an inougfell offense of linemen or ore something of that nature or if you are i worked with a an enviateen when they were kind of i cannot disclose anything but they were looking at drafting a certain player ism and for them process foods may actually be a tool or a teen ages don't we all want young people to eat an more healthfully i think it all great habits but some of them their cleric meet are high high that if they were eating what i an we're going to am dissolve into not they are just waste away so i i describe this again with a financial example its a budget right if i make a million dollars year for example ism is no came for me to buy a hundred thousand all reports once assumed at lonesdo not exist right is no came for me to buy a hundred thousand dollar sports car if i still am able to pay my mortgage and pay my utilities and take care of my responsibilities the things i should do is no a if i do that if it makes me feel good and it is fun on me yes fine right you fits in your budget if my if i have if i make fifty grand a year should i be going out an buying a sports car probably not because ism not can be able to pay my mortgage and all the other responsibilities to your your proceed your fiber you are my entrance these your responsibilities but those become much easier to hit when you have higher calories right if you are if you are eating four thousand calories to day for whatever goal you have ism you are probably could have some left over and good luck eating four thousand calories from mentally process foods you i quite frankly you will be is miserable because your lounging have such got fill the you arguing to fill you cannot even move and again now it becomes o a was there is something inherent to that food processing is there something that we can pick out we know o c we this is going to be a negative effect on health even body composition stuff aside and i would say there is not really great evidence of that far and a great example of that is sugar i mean i she just wrote a really long article on my web side about why i think sugar was not the route cause of the obesity epidemic and you kind of mention sugar and takin the last when ye rs actually gone down will but i a on take well if you look on the whole it might have gone up a little bit but it certain and certainly in the man sector it is gone way down drinking used to be for there was a five o'clock people drinking all day now people smoking a lot less am there i thing it is a real puzzle it'd left o know what you are am as making to that copy in of opposition because nicotine action appetites at us isn't pressed also increases foals the promise it often arrives in a delivery device that can kill you ye bucketing itself is a powerful agent it also can offset age rally connive decamp decline not entirely but it is it makes the brain work better have got a body who a does not coffin and he just takes those nicotine pouches and basic we has one and almost all day because he is a a he has a very trustful job and is a high performer yet ivy bee careful how you deliver it but is a noble prize wining nor a scientists that i will chew five or six pieces of nicer an hour which i do not command an but when he quit smoking he just simply count function as well and he knows the one who pointed me to the literature on offsetting age related connive decline an our on maintenance and it is pretty interesting it is a pretty it is a pretty impressive neurotic the out to be honest am now the first thing it realizes we were time out consumption data this is based on actual production basically there assuming that o c were producing this amount of these food we can assume the consumption that can the fall that it is not a direct measurement a but it has been value o the fou different studies we know the oil consumption has gone up that tat that is that is the to that is one of the the big ones is in this kind of forms the crus of the the seadoils or van the route of stewing on quaint that i an a e o a come into you house and kick your dog and puncher mob and all kinds of stuff ah and ism happy to address those but i calories have still gone up a the does some people who claim that they have gone they have con o plateau i think the day does seems to suggest the gallery and take is still increasing and the nothing to keep in mind is even if it is plateau it is still a high enough level theta obesity's public on the continue to increase up to a point where plot plateau if calories are what about energy ut i leaving aside meat because that sounds highly individual i mean people are the people we know ore focussing on exercise there are a lot of folks t how do not exert and and and energy output has gone down over the a some inn and it is very obvious when you look at how people work now compared to even thirty forty years ago it is it is much different lesson an talking also i learned recently that ism kids in high school do not take pe class in may schools pan we had to suit up and run and set up and if you did not bring your change of clothes or you did not wash them in which case you be better off to not where i nothing the smell of a boy's lockeroom after a week and wo know i as can still remember it and it is not ism it is not pleasant that you had to run and do your push ups with everybody else are play bollybl in your in your regular schooldays clothes say that i my understanding is that physical education is not part of the the basic education any longer i buy depends on the state but i i know many states have done away with it just are a budget cuts for activities going down clerk and take its going up maybe platsoinglame bat going is that sufficient to explain the be sit epidemic a taste what have seen it i i think it is pretty sufficient it might not be that big of a mystery after all no i now they get's a big mystery i think that ism people do not the concept if energy balance and i think because they insert judgment into it which is ski if your gaining want over time at a fundamental level it means you are eating you are consuming more energy than your expending people in set the judgment which is you are lazy you are a sloth your whatever it is and i think there is a lo people ought the who actually think that i i ho remember talking to somebody was why would never hire n beast person for a job because it is just obvious that the lazy and i justremembered going are youserious there are plenty of very very smart high achieving people who are bees an tike it is not this is what happens when you just put people in buckets people are much more complicated than this yes there is there is some read personal responsibility but then when you lookthough the data and you take there is a study done and be women when they found that women who were a beasts were fifty per cent more likely to have had some form of sexual salt drama in their past right i we know that people from lower income areas are more prone to be bees ism there is several people who have a higher a score i believe which is kind of measures dramatic childhood events i believe the there is a study showing them more likely to be bees there is yes it is an energy in balance problem but just saying eat less move more that is telling broke people will just are not more money than you spent it is technically right but it is very in helpful right what is more helpful is to descry i and implement the habits and behaviors that will allow them to achieve that right kind of i realized we bonding off track of it circling back to sugar stirk a two thousand five i believe that sugar was fattening and bad for your health independent of any other valuable independent rusfactor and again i will not be very clear about what independent means independent means independent of all o the variables this thing is bad for your health and a body composition on its own independent of weather r not for instance eating reason hunger and appetite right or or caloric intake right i was in a graduate school minor and one of the professors there with somebody who had done research on hyfrictos corn syrup and fructose specifically as well and he was talking to another professor and he had done this study in a notes where you fed think was sixty or seventy per cent of their calories from fructose and they saw some really weird things happened in the liver with the nova diagenesis and all thiscetistoff and the other professor is saying to him let's pretty obvious that hyfrictos corn syrup is you know fattening and this professor who had done this research said ya because it is people read and as i do not you think there is something inherent to it he said now i think it just calories be treating to many calories he is we we did a proof of concept looking it ye could we try eating om seventy prercentnyour daily collapse from fructose you actually cannot do it hyfrictos corn sure is only fifty five per cent fructose if you ate nothing but hydric to corn sure you would still not get to this level that they fed in this study that got me kind of questioning my beliefs about it then i went through and i want oke let us take out the epotymeology not that epotymiologies useless but people who eat more sugar are also likely eat more calories then i looked for the randomizes control trials were they you do not match calories and vary the amount of sugar and it does not seem to make a difference at least from fat loss or fat gain but what about health for ideas if somebody om and i know somebody this who eat loves sweets is thin get some exercise not ton but my concern is that a significant fraction of their calories are coming from these sugary foods and therefore they are not getting enough fiber i puma be protein et camera let us look at epotmiology for a second and it'll address this more directly we look at etymology people who eat hireamounts of sugar ten to be to more beast they said to have we know worst bylmarkers of health tut peoplewho eat fruit a lot of fruit sugar do not have those same association why is that as fruit has fiber with it right i started to kind of believe they som the data i was looking at that high sugar and take was not the problem per say the problem was that high sugary foods typically are very low an fire but if you are getting enough fire is sugar or problem there as a classic study o by suit in nineteen ninety seven i think it still the best studies of this day looking at this i know that people say shall was done night to night to seven pesto relevant i know if it is a good study it is a good study i someday er time fence can if like they have greater n go back and undo the discovery of d a cause it was you know sixty years ago whatever it is they they looked at an eleven hundred carry diets o locally diet one group was eating over a hundred ten grams of sugar a day sucrose the other group was eating about ten grams of sugar pray calories proline cars fats all matched right and they provided all the meals to these participants very tightly controlled and it was over six weeks both groups lost the exacts amountabody fat does not seem about of for body composition in terms o sugar per set then they also looked at some bilemarkers of health blood lipids and blood sugar and some other things again there was no real differences of the only difference was all the bilemarkis improved in both groups the only real difference was a small difference in elder the group eating low sugar had a better improvement slightly in evil and but that is probably because they were eating ore fire and we know fiber can you will bind a cluster on lower radio calutron is now want up i want a cannot this sugar probably does not have any positive health of facts there is that right and and nutrition is an exchange if you are eating one thing you are not eating another thing right i but what i would tell people is focus probably less on sugar focus more on fire if you are eating thirty forty fifty sixty grams of libra day but your sugars eighty ninety grams i i would not be that worried about it especially if you are controlling calories as well you know what i would be worried about is if you are eating just a decent amount of calories and not getting enough fiber and in general right and even in studies there is a few metanalosies out now looking at ice energetic exchange of different carnal hydrates with sugar care hydrates fructose and glucose and euros now while is important well again you if you are not quite when i say ice energetic that means equal in energy equal in calories basically when they exchange either sucrose or glucose or fruits for other forms of carnal hydrate do they see difference in these markers of health high b one see a fasting bud glucose blood lipids and with rare exceptions and i i cannot member all the day to points exactly but the to take home is does not really seem to make a difference now before anybody out there straw man's by argument i am not advocating for sugar consumption but i think it is important for people to not create where associations in their minds because one of the things have observed specially the fitness industry is when people feel they cannot eat something i it is one thing if you say i am choosing not to eat this just because ism choosing to but is a very different thing when you are purposely restricting because you feel something is bad and this this me the human brain is in many ways amazing in many ways really dumb a when you purposely try to restrict something but tends to happen is your more prone to beige on it people who will try to while ism never going to eat you ow sugar again or ism n o trying limit sugar this isn't the case for everybody but they have actually show now in studies people who are purposely restricting a specific neutrino they tend to crave bore that neutral and if they do get exposed to it they are more likely to have what is called a disinibition reflects which is basely avenge response because the thinking goes while this is bad any and there is no context on dosage making the poison this is just bad in general if i have it have already screwed up i might as well just have as much as i want and i a pension odulskis comparisons is no that is you will getting a flat and go out slashing yourother three tires because you ow you might as well i i really i try to come from that perspective of have seen many people struggle with may be not and eating disorder but disorder to eating patterns because of these kind of associations they have made in their mind and that is why ism pedantic and a stickler about say oh ye yes it is a good idea to yet the mentally process food and try to avoid process foods but not because process foods are bad person but what the out come tends to be from a lot of process food consumption which is over consuming calories and then therefore energytoccicity nearly contributing to your health yet seems ti get again returns this the a potential for a positive negative or neutral behavior a change and perceptional change of craving of food all the time that you cannot have as is terrible it is a terrible state to begin and a this i think is a perfect away for something that first brought us together which o which you is witnessing about artificial sweeteners and lemme just a for the record a be very clear i have long ingested foods with artificial sweeteners i throughout graduate school i did not have the best habits the healthier now than they were beck than but i would drink you i cover to per day i still have the occasional i cop ism not completely am a verse to u to drink something that has artificial sweetener u although i do avoid scrolls for reasons that may be i get into obit later but a lot of the things i consume contained stein which is not artificial plant but it is a plant base non coloricslein er locollerk sweeter u and i do not have a problem with that i began very interesting artificial sweetness because of the animal data ism pointing to the idea that they may disrupt the a microbus and then disrupt the got from i corium as you pointed out as a very broad statement we do not really know the percentages of lacked o basilisk at o basilisk of whatever basil whatever silks a ills in there om the all seem to end in ills is ideal and in fact a lot of these companies that are having people send in there a stool samples for analysis of the microbyom i mean take note we do not really know what a healthy microbus looks but we know what an unhealthy microbus might look and it is one that does not have a lot of diversity in there i was interested in that then there is the recent human study which i we should deftly get in to but i was mostly interesting artificial sweeteners for the reason that there is this food conditioning a fact and you see it in animals in you see it inhuman that if you invest will coffees are really good example coffee does not actually taste good folks even though i it but when you taste coffee for the first time most people think it is bitter in disgusting most everybody ninety five per cent of people say this does not taste good shyer but people learn to associate the state of being culminated which most people in order to just feel normal i having on the few drugs we an just just to feel ourselves enough that soon myself included really look forward to an enjoy a cup of coffee it is it is a powerful example in my opinion of the food conditioning a fact it is a pavylovian things if salivating you crave i and it did seem that this study from damn a small slab which madly was a small noon intended study itself not very many subjects show that if you invested artificial sweeteners along with food that contained glucose that you could for i maven get a heightened gluecosts response just from the artificial sweeteners after a while you and i connected over this study on comet you pointed out that the if that this design the study was not superb there was there will to coco consumption of glucose which made it complicate we can go into that but the reason ism spouting off all this contact is artificial sweetness are many things it'd to talk about their effects on blood sugar in the ace sense and according to what we might invest them with what and how they might be changing blood sugar regulation at the level brain under a body and then though got microbus date i think are interesting enough to disgust and i have changed my view on artificial sweeteners based on what you have taught me this is a case where have completely changed my view which is that now i do not i do not have any problem with the what soever based on the current data which is not to say that ism gulping down cupful's of suit but i feel of in jesting some stein and some ascertain and ism not too worried about it i i think con stepping back from a broad view we have to think about again the hierarchy of importance and what are you replacing with there is no situation where it is not a net positive to take somebody who drink sugar sweeten beverages and have them drink an artificially sweeten beverage the in the reanalysis r was lick recent network met analysis looking at atom markers aboutaposity i you h b one see a bunch different health markers and when you substitute we will call it non nutritive sweeteners since stein is not artificial but when you substitute in an s for the sugar sweeten beverages you see improvements and a lot of different things k what was really interesting about this network met analysis was they also looked at water substitution in place of sugar sweeten beverages and the effect was not as powerful as in these are randomize control trials artificial sweet her containing beverages are more beneficial were were were better for adiposity for improving adiposity and then in e health markers if as kind of a wash water and i water and anon nutritive sweetener beverages performed a similar but they ware better than sugar sweeten beverage's obviously they then based on a network reanalysis is kind of word you can compare two things that did not get compared directly there is not many studies comparing in an s for sis water directly but if you have a common comparator if you compare at be and be gets compared to see you can pare stay based on how they interacted with be bothering it a little bit but that is kind of the crux of a network met analysis they looked at a in an s verses water and found that actually in an s was slightly better for improving adiposity and an s of course be non nutritive sweetener is now again ism i if you drinking water and you you do not want ism not trying to convince anybody too do that what that seems to suggest is there is a little bit of an appetite suppressing effect from these artificial sweeteners or non nutritive sweetness now this gets a little more complicated because if these were people drinking sugar sweeten beverages maybe the already developed the sweet taste and trying to go to water is too much of a jump for them and going to having something intermediate is a but better there is a lot wrapped up in this but these are the randomize control trials which are a list but more highly controlled which i i tend to default to a little but more than i do the epotymeology which epotymeologies to messy because sure u know not nutritive sweetener consumption may be associated with different things but there is also a whole other set of life style on habits they are tied up in that i tend to hang my candlelit more on the run to ask control trials understanding that coquet now all things being equal understanding that this is a tool that may help some people and whenever i post about nondrutes one sweeteners in the comments there is always one or two or three people who say all i did was cut out soda and i drank diets instead no lost fifty pounds i lost seventy five pounds i even have one per lost a hundred pounds that is the only thing i did well i mean that the pretty mass of lever to pull if you considers somebody who might be having i mean five or six cops to day i mean that is we are talking is serious about a galleries and that also means that by replacing with the artificial sweetener containing beverages they did not replace the soda with food correct let us now let us talk about right this is where we can get into the microanalysis but is that boy's person who lost a hundred pounds by doing that do i really care about may be a small alteration to their begot microbus now because there got micro by m is actually much more healthy now by them having lost all that excess outpost tissue again the ranking of what ism worried about can change depending on the specific situation now let us take something me whose lean am and does normally have u no any half promise ism aware of am what about artificial sweeteners for me well for me i kind of got using them because of body but in contest prep because it was about the only appetites suppressed that work for me am but do i think that they are health full probably not a do i think there unhealthy i would say base one the current data i do not think that there unhealthy now the information on blood locos there there is some of the problems with some of these men analysis or these these reviews is the cut a lump all the nonnutritive sweetness together and then they may say where there is no effect on this that as an effect on this while the promise is these probably are dirties are different molecules than they can interact differently ascertain very clearly seems to have no effect on blood sugar or insolent a that has been repeatedly shown am stein does not appear to have much effect sacred and sucrilos that the jury is kind of mixed now there was the study that we first connected on which a i think they're primer outcome measures actually they were looking it kind of of sweet taste how it affected sweet taste what they did was the group that was getting the scrolls was also pared with multodextron the control group was getting sucrose which the is an appropriate way to compare the sweet taste because multodestron is not as sweet as sucrose when you are trying to combine sucreloshs which is already sweet with another form of croberhirat you would want something less sweet compared to your control but for the outcome measure of a insolent and blood blue cost probably not as appropriate because we know multodestron has a much higher glyceric index than mucro sit they they appropriately controlled for for taste but not for the effect of the the sweet news and i think that the was i key common it and i think yet the the part of that study that intrigued me ism actually was ism in a talk version of that because at that study drove me to watch a talk that and well get can a small one on the pogges some point hopefully was that they had they had kids do this study and they shad to cease the study because a couple of the kids became red a bad echameit seem there were soothing hazardous about this is a male school medicine's good place om mind have you on there i arrange everywhere but i it just seem there is something about sweet taste that if taken to the extreme might be able to impact blood sugar to this is impacted am my sort of behavior in i trying to i try to avoid really sweet things unless there exceptionally delicious or the occasion calls for them because i do think that it increases my craving for sweet things we it might not be nearly craving but it just programs you let's your taste buds are extremely adaptable take for example i india food if you bring india people over to america and have them eats more food they think it taste extremely bland because they are used to such spicy food that unless they have a certain level spicily hardly even tasted if you ever done a high sodium diet and then gone to a low sodium diet it feels very bland that is a stale but your your over time your tasted to just sweet is the same thing if you are used to eating a lot of sweet i you get kind of desensitize to it and then if you go to something less sweet i i can kind of i taste bland at first over time it will get better but i think it is one of those things that again it depends on the situation right if somebody is o be and they said well this is going to help me you do not eliminate sugar sweet en beverage like why would you want to take that tool away from m that is a a great lever to pull i mean of somebody can lose literally a hundred pounds from just one change in lifestyle that is not even really that inconvenient of a change that is that is powerful but again is it the most healthy thing they can do and i think that is kind of what tends to get asked we do not know is it healthy er the water probably not may be as healthy as it who knows now the but i really make all those carrots because you do not want to have people who could use this is a tool think was the i cannot do this cause it is achy bad for me right if it helps you lose fifty pounds or seventy five pounds or whatever it is it trust me its not bad for you right what does hem to increasing tiny signals woad you think about the microfilm effects in this recent study is the recent study i think had some nice features to it and you have done a detailed am description of the studies for for those that ans it ask is this two weeks study were the yo ting study ye and will provided link you did an excellent video on this on your you two channel that really parses each bees but they compared the various artificial sweeteners and looked at the glucose response looked at microbus a number different measures what was your general and this was in humans for the for i think for the first time looking at microbus in humans you artificial sweetener there is it is there are few studies on the microbus in humans with artificial sweets the first two that came out showed pretty much no effect a but they were lo a shorter n duration they two to four weeks and again at depends what what material getting measured right the many different kinds of bacteria they could just be measuring one that did not change and then there was a ten week study that came out the they got a lot o press a and they showed i think it was sequels i think they showed an effect of change on the got microbus now what was interesting us when i went into the species that change the the species that change the most compared the control was a species called am a butcher the tam but looks bloody a coconuts i think it is i i must say for those that work on the microbus it is it is difficult to fer bounce an you need nomenclature committee and you need acronyms son already your killing us o best that and easy thank you work in a start the nomen glacier committed t you do not do it soon they they notice that this went ut by three to fourfold i i kind of went down the rabbit hole on this interestingly that particular species f bacterias actually associated with lower adiposity better insolent sensitivity and people who are o be in children who ill be ten t have less of it i said well bast on that study you can actually argue that may be sucres actually improve that got microbus now get ism not making that claim because we have a hard time understanding what a healthy microfilm looks already what this last study that came out my my biggest take home was i think it safe to say that some of these non nutritive sweetness are not metabolically inert that there there are some effects now are those effects good bad or neutral i think has yet to be f fully lust stated now the the i focussed more on the blood glucose responses in my analysis in that ten week study they looked at a they did not work glucose tolerates less and there conclusion i did not really feel fit their data to the conclusion was that and i again i think it was sucualos that it elevated a blood locos in this is where statistics can get cut a tricky mi take home was the aria under the curve the incremental area under the curve which is looking at the basically the entire glucose response was not different between the control and the sucuelos croup to me that is the biggest take home there was one time point at the find of the study in the suckles croup the thirty minute time point that was statistically significantly higher blood locos than the control group it is kind of one of those things where go cam was at one time point it is thististically significant but even then we have seen things be statistically significant that in at being date artofactcas are not reproduced not saying that is what is happening here but again the overall are under the curve was not different to me that was the biggest take home and papers that we should a prevention are published because of effects generally not lack of effect hardened upon o hypothesis does it it it is actually really unfortunate because a not hypothesis is just as useful data as the the nominal hypothesis but your right there is a very strong publication by us towards a showing in affect i verst is not unless you can flip a field on its head entirely by showing something did not happen am typically the positive result out does the negative result in plosive being you see a result am and then of course it is one study and yes and i think that as you talked about earlier the center of mass of data in a given felt are probably the best basis for what we should do it in terms of and ism not changing my behavior around the intake of artificial sweetness i personally still going to consume stein and ascertain in relatively small amounts i but am now ism thinking will cave something contain suckles i do not have to perhaps actively avoid it whereas before i was i was actively avoiding it the the the new study i thought was very elegantly toes it very involved i mean be quite frank some of the animal stuff they did was extremely impressive there was extra two arms the study one was a human arm a was the anymore i i access much more on the human side of it am basically this was a two week study and the really unique aspect of this which i think is both the strength and a weakness they had almost fourteen hundred people a apply for this study and t my only had a hundred and twenty i think that actually went into it because they did a very detailed food analysis of these folks all these people said that they avoided artificial sweeteners where did not consume them and i think people realize how you ubiquitous sweeteners are prior to the study these people were it was jury selection they would never yes si not ever hearing of that the plaintive in the defending these right s are these mutant people who have never had an artificial sweetener right the strength is now you do not have a lot of are existing effects that may be clouding what would actually happen when you add tin for example if you have people were already consuming artificial sweetness and then you have em consume artificial sweeteners the likelihood things are gong to change is pretty low right i think that that is a strength it is also a weakness and on be really careful because i think people took my words o list too far which means i probably din do a good job of being new lost enough there is the possibility for a placebo effect are to me if somebody has gone through that much painstaking care to avoid artificial sweetness it is likely they have a preconceived notion that those ware bad for you to because they are difficult to avoid a yes it is possible for eating very minable process dirt that they just not exposed to the then that is very truths well ah but the other thing that the researchers acknowledged was they were not able to blind the study because if you have never had an artificial sweeter before your only justice like regular sugar and you have an artificial sweetener you taste i it is still sweet but as out the same sweet and there is an interesting effect there were a lot of people do not the taste of ascertain the first time the can quit drinking died soda for a while thinking i should and then had one it tasted really i can only described as kind of artificial commie and then pretty soon tasted great again and there is some attenuation there and whether not that central meaning within the brain or primero i do not know but very interesting why i see you as a playing a critical role in defining what is in what is in what still needs to be determine am in terms of this landscape an and the entire landscape really of nutrition when in that study did change my opinion in terms of ora i i think we can clearly say now the these are these are not neutral urstright that they are not in ert right that that was the thought process before was wealthy are not digested or r what not that they must be an ert that does not appear to be the case am but again like we look at the the blood luck state a there is and ism not saying this is what happened i won to be very clear not saying this is what happened ism saying it is possible this happened and this is why we need more studies to verify if these people had a preconceived notion that artifice sweeteners were bad for them it is possible knowing their investing artificial sweeteners the they could have had a a blood locos despots now then my push back on my own point there would be then we should have expected to see it in all the a and all the natures of sweetness which they did not it was just in solos and macron it was kind of a grand effect where saris an macron showed the most dramatic change yet a and stein and a few of the others did not and the o the other issue i took with it maybe its a tricky tack thing was they are primary outcome measure was a blood glucose o the or glucose tolerates test but they had people ad minister their own or glucose toleratestst which basely they gave em they said okay drink to drink and they're were not continuous glucose makers which should been find am but again to me and m on being tricky take and again i know all studies are limited by funding i think over all this was a great study but i would have liked to seen them a monster the the a or glucose tolerates test at do minister an were after a you want to know that they did not invest this set id in ya those those two things but the other one of the cannot is it was a two week study right's we got be really careful how much we interpreted this because it is also possible ha this is a tracing effect right and maybe it goes away over time we do not know but again i think it is we can clearly say it is not inert right now how much emphasis we put on that on a two week study ism i still will say o we maybe if your worried do not consume surplus right but if your hundred pounds over weight and you wanted use some silos as a replacement to help you lose weight i would say do not let this study detour you from doing that because the net effect to sit to be more positive then you not losing the weight right f it is tool at helps you fine but i do hold open the idea that well there could be negative effects from it as well but again we are were looking it what is the what is the over all outcome right and then when i looked at am they examined some of the a different things that were increased with these different a sweetness and again this work it is messy because one of things they saw was a big increase in butyrate production from the change in they got macrobyum porously well as we discussed early berates easier associated with positive outcomes and turns of insolent sensitivity an inflammation and some other things i just i onto be real cautious before people say where there is a change the macrobiumit must be a bad change we do not know it is possible and again if we have you knot ten more studies come out and start to show this than i will start to shift my personal opinion of artificial sweetness in anticipation of sitting down today i did solicit a for questions on social media and one of the questions that got a lot of votes i likes if if you will was it one that i think raises interesting questions about short turban long turn health and it is the following think it is a commencenario a number o people want to know what is the healthiest way to approach a kind of rapid weight loss and hear what i think is happening is somebody has an event coming up or they are just tired of being the weight they are carrying the amount of autopsy issue they are and they wanted to know whether or not it is safe to for instance lose three pounds a week for a few weeks in anticipation of a wedding or some other event and whether or not straight cleric restriction and increasing activity a is the best way to approach that a with the understanding that they may gain back a little afterwards they might make think ideally they would to maintain it afterwards but what d you think of that sort of approach you know cutting clerk in takin half for instance and then doubling and also doubling your physical output it is interesting because the you might be surprised by whole on to say which is the researched act tends to suggest the people who are o bees who lose a lot more weight early are more likely to keep it off which seems the little but con contradictory right well that does not seem very sustainable but again your your weighing competing things there sustain a build aspect with then is also buy in is huge for sustainability right for a lot of merit or beast people if they start a dit they do not see something quickly they cunt a bail on it because it it is not working whereas that they see some rapid results pretty quickly they buy an even harder right and i think that the conversation especially for if there is any coaches or trainers out there is just presenting that as the door my ferrite lines as there are no solutions or sonly trade offs i think homes soul that you are your having a trade off here i it is yes you are little lose fat faster you might lose lean hassle but faster too which can be a problem but i will say the more at a post tissue you have the more aggressively you can diet without negative consequences somebody me doing a regressive diet is not going to be good for my lean mass one have a highly mass the normal to have a lower body fat the normal as your body fat goes down the percentage of weight loss from lean mass goes up ism people who are very bees because they have much out post tissue to pull from there is very little reason for the body to catabolite lean tissue now that being said if you go on a people misinterpret they we a in bodied on and were a decks a done and have lost two pounds of lean mass and they have know they have lost twenty pounds over all wo cue mine out post tissue itself is thirteen per cent lean mass there is actually u no protein component to the structural compose of the outpost tissue and it does have some water it is about eighty seven per cent lipid but the other part is lean at in of em you should expect a thirteen per cent production and lean mass when you diet and then when you consider you lose body water over all which is registers is lean mass ism and you lose a your splaintic tissues can shrink a little bit it is normal to lose for the average person to lose twenty five or thirty per cent of the weight that they lose from lean mass but that does not mean skellidle mussel tissue and again that the more outpost you have the more aggressively you can approach the diet without really negative long term consequences to lean master over all health but balance that with o cay if i when to do this i need to understand that ism not going to be dieting this way forever ism doing this to give myself a loose o the beginning and i have to be one at some point with transitioning to something the syllable more sustainable bay somewhat you just said it minds me of the a satiety signal effect of exercise you mention earlier that exercising can improve a our sense of when we have had enough to eat i just want it briefly mention that when ally drum was on the pots she mention that they have been doing a study that i i i have to pair you to and have i hear the conversation as a fly on the wall because when she was telling me was that if people believe that of food is nutritious for them then eating less of it a register says more satiating whereas if people view dieting as a deprivation system old oh dating as hard in the food sons and it is terrible well then they crave all sorts of other things whereas they can they actually observe in their studies where people report reduced craving if they are told for insane a chicken breast and rocket and some all of oil and rice is actually quite nourishing it that you really good for you then people eat that and they feel that tee actually eaten more this tidy signalling goes out it is just not just a point that ally mad o to are not mi the dirty is impressive because even the rate at which you eat and right down to the size of the plate and the color of the plate the contrast an color really they they see i cannot remember exactly i think it is if the plate is a similar color to the food i i think people eat more whereas if it is a bigger contrast they eat less even plate color can make a difference on how much eat again human brain very amazing but also very dumb in some ways right i t an optimized altar the i always always joke of people just look t how stupid humans are you put some water in front of the you though the ocean the o it'll pay ten times more for this et li but it is is we kind of ire that way the the reward signaling pathways in the brain run one chemical mainly dopamine the are others of course but and very few algorithms its sort of a intermittent reinforcement is on random reinforce but in the end that there are not many algorithms and we we are probably not optic i certainly not optimized for our own health because people will eat themselves to death drug themselves to death et camera simply because something felt a good at one point the it is it proves your point one things i tell people i i said the son and if for sofa's podcast was interestingly the economy of life is if you do what is easy in the short term your life will be hard if you do what is hard in the short term your life will get easier it is very strange and actually even split had a great example of this when he was over five hundred pounds he said the amount of work i had to do to construct my life that i could just live was much more work then just going to the him for a couple hours a day he is the him work is hard he is i look back how much work i had to do to sustain that life sol first is just going to the him and be to restricting calories he is to maintain the life style of being five under valence was infinitely more difficult than what i do now and ice get great example short term hard going to the him gallery restriction long term life'seasier just really interesting economy i think about in and i cannot be restated often enough seed oils people want to ask con seed old and for at and f and for those of you that are listening who are wondering aware words for a chuckling already i shall mention that both in the twitter sphere and in serum and on line that there is there these very polarized views that probably are not worth focussing on for too long but there are a number of a folks out there were arguing that seed oils are the source of all hour the'besity epidemic a e inflammation et camera aluminum everything and then there are those that would argue just the opposite that meat is the source of all problems et camera and i think we have thanks to your new aunts and and expert easy we a hopefully appropriately frame things that it is never that black and white it is simply not really rarely i love olive oil i no i realize that does not fit exactly into the seed oil category i love aloft oil i use it in moderation i do also consume some butter in moderation i et camera but are there any dada on seed oils and here i good example i think would be canola oil which comes from the rape seed that literally was renamed cool oil because rape seed oil is not good marketing leno now exactly am the first thing it'll say is seagulls have have negatively contributed to our over health because people in the last me no twenty thirty years what they have tend to added to add into their diet that has increased the overall carry load is oil a these various a mostly frumseet oils but when we look at one to one replacement with other fats and i if you look at the epidemiology yet you can find sanepedymeology showing people who consume more seat have more negative healthful comes problem is again tied up with multitude of other behaviors and then you can find mechanisms and the the idea is well these have there jolly on saturated which means in the fatyacid chain there is multiple double bonds which those double bonds can be oxidized a when there exposed to heat and some other things and the idea s well when you cook with these things and they get i they get a ox they make at oxidized and ascot cause inflammation your body that is a a plausible mechanism as always i defer to the human randomized control trials and what you tend to find is when you substitute pollen saturated fats er when you substitute saturated fats for pollen saturated fats it is either neutral or positive and terms of the effects on a inflammation is basically neutral there there is some studies that show a positive effect of doing a pollen saturated fats but it probably depends on the individual polygon saturated fat andthat is h no thing i i do not believe is difficult because your you are categorizing everything in this one bucket and there are some differences between individual fatyacids even with saturated fat a for example a steric acid does not tend to raise aldol collesterall whereas seen saturated fat as a whole tends to raise the dial cllusterall but there are some saturated fats that do not again it is it is were putting things in buckets and its simile more new its than that then if you look at a the effects of a no pylon saturated fats on markers of curly of vascular disease again tends to either be a neutral or positive office when you substitute saturated fat for pylon saturated fat now if you want to get its monsoon saturated for pollen saturated there is some there is quite a bit disagreement between the studies what i would say base on the human camize control trials is that your probably better off consuming monsoon saturated n polygon saturated in place of saturated fat but again if the idea is well that means molly's in saturate are good for me ism just going to couple bunch oil on everything and now you are up in your can rays well that's that that is a negative now right because you have to do wit the bigger problem of over all energy toxicity ism not somebody who likes to demonize individual neutriance i just have not seen really compelling evidence that seedily are the route cause of the proms aware being suggested and i think this is a good example of kind of whenever there is a something that pops up in the finest industry there is always the opposite thing that pops up and is the reactionary extreme reaction to whatever this thing was over here an i think this over seeing with some of the the seedily stuff is its it is mostly people who are trying to con dispose the virtues of saturated fat and listen i think it is fine to consume some saturated fat but again i think limiting it to seven to ten per cent of your daily carry and take us probably wise again base on them the all the consensus of the evidence have seem and once again were struggling with this can we have got the sepetymeology in the mechanisms that sound good but then what act happens when we we do some human randomize control trials and and far i just have it seem the evidence to suggest that seedily are independently bad for you independent the calories they contain you said the words over all energy toxicity and i just on a highlight that i think that a fabulous term i do not ut i do not think enough people think about that because they they are primed or we are all prime to think of case seedily might be bad or artificial sweetness might be bad or this particular component of blood work might represent something good or bad without taking into account over all energy toxicity of the toxicity of over consuming calories energy and a thank you for a pointing out that most of the date a point to the fact that saturated fat should make up about no more than seven o ten per cent of total daily close can take is there a lower an threshold that can be problematic a for instance have noticed that my blood profiles especially in terms of hormones improve when ism getting sufficient saturated fat maybe ism a mutiny but years ago because ism a product of growing up in the nineyeas i try to low fat died i its certainly crushed my androgen levels i start adding some butter back in and i was right back in the in the in the sweet zone i where i wanted to be i u a seven or ten per cent of tolly a daily color can take as ism guessing is probably about what i do now it'll have to check but is there danger to going too low in saturated fats again no solutions only trade offs right what maximize is out testosterone might not be the best thing for longevity right in advice averse ism not ism not making that claim specifically by then etsimportant understand this that i think we all have this idea that this is one i conic diet out there that is going to be the best it for building muscle and burning fat and a preventing cancer an heart disease and the reality is there is over all healthy dietary patterns that we see there are good for those things but we get down into the weeds there is probably some push pull here as well right when it comes to saturated fat am there is some evidence that if you are too low on it t yes you can have a reduction and testosterone now is that reduction in testostrom let us say fifteen twenty per cent whatever it may be is the sufficient actually cause loss of lean mass that we do not know that is that is never been shown interestingly a just remember this there was one study that was comparing am pollen saturated fat versus saturated fat a and they equated total fat and one of the really interesting things was the group going the plan saturated fat had more lean mass at the end of the study compared to the group getting saturated fat now's only one study have never seen this replicated i ism very this is the situational i i say i would to find out what the mechanism of that is because this could just be random am but if that gets shown over and over what i might say is o k well what is the what are we if pollen saturated are somehow increasing lean mass compared to saturated fat who cares what opens with testosterone ism less that reduction testostro is causing some kind of impudent e impotence for your life right am all that is say i do not really know and a by the way that something a for those watching and listening a real experts every once all you should hear them say the following words i do not know i your adviser was exceptional that anus and she was brilliant i a and then in terms of a claustral synthesis you really need a very very small amount of saturated fat for aldol cloistral said the sister your liver can synthesize the amount a deal cluster all or collateral that your body requires is small in terms of just living and being healthy i do not think you at need to worry about that and from a card of actual to ease standpoint there is some evidence that even taking people who have cuotonco local lo aldol of no eighty or ninety and taking them down to thirty or forty that there is still a a a benefit for the risk of rot vaster disease again your your waging need these two buckets right that i say you no for do in seventeen per cent from from saturated fat you are probably fin received a lot of questions about whether or not there are female specific die an exercise protocols and realizes is a vast landscape but ism some of those questions related to menopause and premed apausit and some related to the menstrual cycle most related to variations across the menstrual cycle in terms of am let us you say diet a maintenance or subchloride diet are there any hins that you have observed and we will talk a bit later about am the this wonderful a that you have produces caught carbon a which helps people a manage their energy and take and a number of other things a sense o there you have a sort of at a back or at least inexperience pace and then ism guessing the probably also studies exploring male verses female differences in terms of adherence in what sorts of diets work as it are there any general themes that one can extra from that this can be really unpopular segment for the women am does not em to make a big difference talk they may be relieved to hear that as it make sorting through the information space and certainly the information we have covered in this pots up til now simpler it means that everything is not different for them n if you look at the male verses female studies relation to diet they seem to respond to some similar way a smear cover carry deficit seems to produce similar results am if you do low car high car regardless it seems to boil down to the same principles now training wise we do know that female the muscle fibers adapt a little bit differently to training but it without getting too far to the weeds it does not really change the way you should train am because for the most part building muscle there is a lot of different ways to build muscle we know that light loads up to may be thirty raps as long as it is taken close to failure have basically the same effect on building muscle least in the short term as heavy loads for low raps it is mostly about taking the muscle close to fatigue or failure you will have to go you'd hove to go too failure but getting close within a few raps am if you are between one rap in thirty raps you regretting close to failure seem to produce similar results a begin great you can pick with whichever form of discomfort you you prefer right am when it comes to female specific training again females actually this is one thing the like do not know they aptly put on a similar amount of lean mass as a percentage of their starting lean mass as men in fact there is no statistically significant difference and the amount of lean mass they put on now the absolute amount of lean mass that is added will be greater for men because they started with a greater amount of lean mass but the relative increase in lean mass is pretty much the same from similar training now females that there is some differences libra types that females ten to be a but less fatigable than then men they can they can go a but garlic longer and there is also some evidence that they recover but better but that also could be simply to to the fact that they are not able to use as heavy of loads to i to induce hypertrophy i kind to have this theory that wile as a percentagyour wonder at mass you can program things i think absolute load matters when you look at the most delete power lifters the superheavy weights are not squatting three or four times a week because there squatting eight nine hundred pounds i think that there is an over all recovery of fact there i gan have no dato to back this up this is just my my observation but when you get into the lighter weight classes and this goes for men too you do see quite a few people who do many training sessions at high arise and seem to be able to recover from that i do think the absolute load makes a difference now when it comes to menstrual cycle this is one of those things were i kind it tell people do what you prefer there is some people have said you should program yo should kind of smudge your training around your menstrual cycle which is a whenever you are going through menstrual cycle reduce the intensity reduce the volume because you are you are not on a feel as good you no c train as well what i would say is just ought to regulate that if you go in and you are on your period but you you feel good and you are doing well that day than i do not think you reselling you to back it off and there there was one study the kind of supported that notion but if you go and you feel terrible and you feel you could use a reduction and intensity in volume than it is tolly fine to out o regulate that when i say ought to regulation ism ought regulation means you are regulating the individual training session base on your performance a i ought to regulate in far as ism ism ism a superheated i have a a velocity novice i can actually attached to the bar and see how fast the load moves and i know it various different warm up weights what velocities i should be hitting if i hit my last warm up and my velocities about ten percent higher than usual a i can be pretty confident that that is can be good day for me if it is lower that i can back at off a little bit in fact that worlds i hit my last deadline it was thirty per cent my last my last death warm up it was thirty per cent faster than i usually hid in the him an i turn to look tot my coach i said the i were going to get this to day i do nowhere is various forms of wast out to regulate but again women if you are on your period but you feel good i do not thin there any reason you you to back off but if you are to feeling good than it is tolly appropriate tobacco raver says cookbooks people wanted to know a whether not for instance you know you ay may raw apple overs i donors any one cook apples i git is tat an people was to bake at ever bake dapples was e desert when i was again it was count of the let down desert say now belike not also unless it at a scup of scree minute raven they may me not also but anyway rovers is cooked am obviously if you burn a piece of meat to the point where it is pure charcoal that is too much in if you there is a small movement a surrounding eating raw meats that is not something i particularly enjoy frankly sushi is the only raw food i i personally en jest an able i am very careful about the source frankly a reputable places a is there anything you know real about this in terms of being able to extract the monoacid by demons an minerals from the food a robbery's cooked it just looks cool for instagram a when you cook foods the action to become in terms a prating containing foods they tend to become more digestible not less a eggs are this way meats to this way a people well you know what you when you heat proline you do nature it and i think they hear that word to nature and they think destroy and that is not what you nature means prolines fold up in to three see dimensional structures this of course a basin there you monoacid sequent and their specific energies of those o melascids am when you heat proline or ad acid it starts to unfold that a that proving structure that happens during digestion anyway always chuckle when the hive seen some companies come out with way that you can cook with right that that is nocking to you know destroy they mulacids i you mean regular way right a at cook typically cooking act makes a monoacid more bile available not less now am i would stay away from charring your meat a because there is some evidence that charring creates apolliermatic hydro carbons which at least in animals when they give those a they appear to be carsonagetic if you do chasing me by accident i would just cut off the charred portions am and then you should be fine the chatter is delicious a ha ha not not of its charge too much but there is something about a charred cross on o me my dad's argentine i a good a are i a what about a people referred to them in their questions as carbon blockers but i thing what they referring tour things berberine and some of the glue scavengers and am one glue scavenger id left for you to comment on is this assertion that taking a brisk walk after a meal or maybe even a slow walk after a meal some movement can help am down shift the amount of circulating glucose in some way have heard that am not a lot of people but some are starting to pay attention to this idea of taking things berberine or even mat formal am can scavenge bluecoat i personally cannot take barber if i take it i get massive headaches unless have ingested hons of sugar in carbohydrates just do not massuround with it but i i know the re number if people out there that want to know whether not these glue avengers can be useful i think that is really major in the miners of my being honest mas far as like the car blockers was some white kitty being extract and this sorts of things they can tam they do block the digestion of care hydrate some when i say block that is those watching were listening a metabolism is typically not on an offswitches o case n resin when we say things block or a tenueight or inhibit typically were we are not talking about just a switch on the wall that you press it and everything turns off were talk about a dimmer switch no i you it just changes the emphasis a but these car blockers can reduce the absorption of carnal hydrate now they do not seem to cause weight loss it when when you just do it a normal dight now why is that well all it does is once those carnal hydrates get to the a large an testing and your bacteria get a hold of hem they start permitting em to volatolfatiacids which could reabsorb into your liver you do not get the increase in bluglucost but you still get almost all the calories from it because it just in a different form it if car blockers if they actually worked really well i mean if you block something from being absorbed your g i typically does not just let undigested material sitting there you get diarrhoea i mean that would be the outcome it is also how i debunk the whole thirtygrams approaching at a meal you can absorb any more than that ism if that was the case the when you ate a stake you would just start having diarrhoea every time you went over that thirtygram threshold right i remember during college sos to be early nineties there was the olestra craze was idea of putting in nondigestible a thing in two things potato chips that it would ism clear through a that the g i tract faster not absorb as many galleries it does raise this went nowhere obviously you do not her about this any more but it does raise an interesting question relate to energy balance which is gastric emptying time i an obviously in in the landscape of eating disorders in particular anemic ya abusive lack use in abuse a laxatives is a way in which people will in an unhealthy way a trying control their wait there is a lot of promise with that a approach but i what about gastric emptying time is this one way that people could control they're energy balance in a healthy way an where does libra come into play a fiber tins to improve i trains at time because it adds bulk your your g i system is basically to and it has peristalsis which is wave contractions that moves the food down to the to well if you have more bulked the food with fiber you can move it through a little better now in the gastric the stomach specifically fiber tends to delay gastric emptying and slow it a bit i probable cause it congeals a little bit i now this kind of gets into the glisemic index argument right if you do o if you do lo g i foods you will have a slower release of glue come am it is a slower gastric emptying time does that affect energy balance and there are quite a few studies looking at log versus hug i foods am in the studies where they do not control calories lo g i tens to out perform hug i but when they control calories there is no difference and s wit that tends to what i think that suggests is log i food just by their nature tend to be hirer in fire and i think it it just mini comes back to the fiber issue got it i to ask you about supplements for a moment it is an enormous landscape but i believe there are a few things that you believe in meaning they exist and and there are decent data to support their use maybe even some panic total data based on your own experience as long as we highlighted as such could be interesting have heard you talk about to in particular a one that ism very familiar with with us creating mono hydrate you share your thoughts on that not just for muscle building but maybe any other purposes for it am and the other one is one that ism frankly am learning more about all the time now thanks to your prompt which is regalia road think i pronounce that correctly and and why that might be interesting or of use to people yes touching on creating it is the most tested safe and effective sport supplement we have i mean it just there are thousands of studies on creation monk hydrate now and i i would i would say very clearly too am if you using any other form of create i think your wasting your money am creation hydra chloride has some am hope around id it is apparently little more soluble am the claim is that you need less am but there is only couple studies on it and it is more expensive it i mono hydrate is not particularly expense no is be by therein budgets but it is not it does not land it is not a gabion brake yet it is gotten more expensive because of covin supply change issues even the there is forms a creating that appear to be as good hydra chloride but it is more expensive and in things like great an ether ester has been shown to be worse than creation monk hydrate a buffer create is as good or worse and it is much more expensive i tell people just take creation monk hydrate it is tried in true it is been shown to saturate the mussel cells one hundred per cent with posse creation and that is what you want create i works the free different methodologies one through increasing fossil creates in content which helps i prove exercise performance am it also appears to reprove in cover it appears to improve recovery and it creases lean mass a lot of which is through bringing water into the mussel cells but that is mean mussel cells are mostly water when peoples o each this water that is what mussel cells mostly are a and a it also in creases strength and s me other metrics now it also has been show in studies that people tend to get a decrease in body fat percentage now that is probably because they regretting in increase in lean mass and the relative is a decrease in body fat percentage but there are a few studies to show at decrease in fat mass as well i only the creating a fat burner i think that people are able to train harder build more lean tissue and that is probably having an effect on fat mass then the factually shown more recently some cogulive benefits to create which i find really interesting as well but the only knock on creation that anybody's been able to come up because they at they have debunk the kidney stuff they have drunk the liver studied it there is no evidence the the harm healthy couldn't cidneyor liver a is hair loss what about hairless cause there was one study in two thousand nine that showed that creates an increase d h gigue a but they did not really show an effect on any other sex forgot it is kind of strange you would think if there is an increase in d h t there would be something else that changes as well a and it is only one study and again did not directly measure hair loss measure d h t which we know as involved in the loss of the flock the logical what i would say is that i am not convinced it is only one study never been replicated to my knowledge and it was looking in a mechanism rather than an outcome ah if you if you are somebody whose prone air loss and you want avoid creatine because of that i understand but for most people y i do not think it is a i do not this it something to worry about you ememphasizea the classic loading of creatine taking in a bunch of times pray and then backing off or just taking at consistently at the i think fivegrams pray is con a typical a dose that people take again no solutions only trade offs am you can load it and you will saturate your falsphor creating phosphor create an stores faster usually within a week a if you just take phiogramhs per day it will take two three four weeks ah but you will get to the same place and your probably on have a much lower risk of g i issues some people it creating can be a got irritant a if it is for some folks i recommend splitting it into multiple doses may be multiple to one or two grampuses per day and define do not load it if you are somebody who has guy i issues from it as far as a real road the research is stole its infancy i was just reading a a new systematic review that kind of concluded that we need more high quality research but the research that is out there seems to suggest that not only does it reduce physical fatigue but also reduces the perception of fatigue and may also enhance a memory an cognition as well and it is referred to as an adaptegen i i really it am my anecdotal experience is when i combined that with canine it tends to kind of smooth out the effects of caffeine it is a more pleasant ex experience and there is also some evidence that if you were coming off affine that it can reduce the ah the negative side effects to faffing withdraw which by the way i i didn't really believe in that until i actually did a cold turkey a castle before meat i will cut out affine for seven days because you can basically reset your affine tolerance in seven days and two days and i mean ism groggy have got the head aches usually it'll get body aches that come up because affine is actual a mild analgesic am and was sos very interesting to it by slope a baby it'll tell you that i to a o a gaffing priority to your silent to the meat i you really want the maximum punch to ye that is why you do that yet and a said a radio at tends to it does not eliminate those those negative effects but they tend to tends the damp on i a little bit i really it again would to see more research on it but there is a lot more stuff coming out a ashregon does another thing that looks pretty promising a seems to increase testostro an modest sleep interesting am i do not think it is they have shown increases in lean mass i do not think the increase in testosterone ah explains the increase in lean massage just not a big enough increase could it be the decreasing quarters all people at talked about possible it does it decrease stress stress hormones it it also has been shown to helpless sleep a but i would to see more research looking at mechanistically how it is increasingly mass before i kind of say conclusively that this is the youknow the next creation there is more research in these to come out n then there some other things that that have an effect am stray mallet there there as a new reanalysis that show that sitrlyn mallet can reduce fatigue and a increase i think time to fatigue an may ax yo have some small recovery benefits as well am different forms of carnage carnation connactully have recovery benefits and actually interesting am i think it is carnations portrait actually has been shown a volley publish to study e actually show that increased antigen receptor density an muscle smells says interesting now of carnations and it is other forms at a pretty i then there is good evidence that they can improve a mspermanag health for people are looking to conceal interesting yet there am surprising number of studies oneness in inhuman am but yet androgen receptor density and that that is from well carnations peering castles not injecting directly to muscled then you have got things obviously the other most effective supplement out there problem fine i mean if you look a the research studies affine produces very consistently improvements in performance a that is nothewent some people the effect of safe not s of say but i would not know cops at never come off it exactly exactly why interestingly they they do show that the effect appears to be consistent that that even if your a habitual affine user you do still get a benefit every time you take it but you sake yours use to it am the o there those thin s you thin you've got things a made flamen which for it is in our it is in our rework out probably not superhelpful for a most people for resistance training it does seem to have some a benefits for high intensely you get out know more than forty five seconds or sixty seconds of rally hard training it does appear to help with the laying fatigue for that ism and then love got things a b take re also called trymothali seen which there is some evidence it can improve lean mass am there is some evidence that it can i improve power out put there a few things out there but most the stuff is not very good ah i think that that is those kinds of supplements very useful a but a get i will never tell people they need supplements again even something cries and is going to be a very small effect compared to proper new tuition recovery and hard training ya one f the things i i was one talking ben brunt the other day and i said some people will ask me how does this person make progress because o another programming as is not evidence based or or o the skyhouse he this exercise or dumb and i it'll say yet but they train really hard for twenty years none commonality you see between really successful athletes or body builders is they train really hard and one of the things i have observed is the more and o the weeds people tend to get and again this is just my own anecdote observation the more in the weeds they tend to get the less hard i see them train and one of the things i really that a mike israeltoll said who is got a p h t and is a bobble er himself he said you cannot out science hard training that if you are looking to build muscle an your looking improver body composition t the main thing is just doing the work over time sits y and the hard work and i would add to that and this is true a academic endeavors i to of course i think i hope you will agree ism absolutely i which is tat yah the other thing has given the mental side o earlier we are talking about how society signals and the brain and what you think about foods can be relevant learning to really enjoy training hard in addition to learning to really enjoy eating well not just for the effects that has on body composition it composition excuse me those to of course but just learning to really enjoy the process of training hard and a and a really hard work out or really hard ism paper that you have the sort through or really digging through a book that is challenging learning to really enjoy that i think is is a if there is a power to go out there it is it is the psychological and and i think a lot of that is getting the confidence of doing something hard that there is a pay off at the end in a lot o people i gun asked a lot my cunts how do g t more confident how i become more confident it'll tell people you have to do yet there dares no hack you cannot read about you got to get nhearena and i do not mean compete in sports necessarily but doing a party or doing something just something hard where you are putting yourself out there you are saying this is my goal when ism in togo for it you just learn much by doing that about yourself i and just what you said i will frame things in my mind when bad things happen from it is not e sad never get stressed out cause i do and it is not to say that i never get down because i do cause ism a human but when something bad happened i should post about this my store to day what something bad happens i very rarely any more to i go woe is me why do this happen to me because you are in the universe random bad things are in to happen in's head i say will if ism not dead it is that i say well what an exciting opportunity to overcome an obstacle and i bat because in the spirits of my life the biggest lessons and the best things of my life have actually come out of the most challenging worst things that have happen and again this is i would never have been able to do these sorts of things if i had not taken up weight lifting because weight lifting taught me much about perseverance the laid gratification overcoming obstacles and that is why love sting even to this day and it'll still get butterflies when i go in for a squatsession even though have been doing it for twenty three years it is wonderful what is clear that you embrace hard things and i for people listening to this a obbyusey does not have to be weight lifting thinking hard things learning and instrument earing in language ism challenge is saris a absolute builder and the factual shown a those sorts of things when you challenge yourself and also mentally that i i think there was a new study that came out easily showing a reduction in the risk of allshimers and other age really the cog decline to ben basically use it or lose it right have that the the will the desire and the will ism to persevere i no doubt translates to this thing we we call the will to live right it is it is related to the will to live well i think that what you just said you on beautifully embodies what most people are aspiring to which is to i think most people actually want to do hard things i they do not just want to have a the results i think that must been deep down under have some understanding that there reward system works that way i must say this conversation for me as been tremendously rewarding first of all allow me to meetyou in person for the first time shave really enjoyed ism certain this will not be a last interaction on this podcast and and elsewhere i also the amount of knowledge that you contain inside you is is astonishing and there is lot stuff rattle around her and and we all benefit because you are ability to pull from the mechanistic side again i think in not limited to but relate to your backgrounding to chemistry all the way through to the the impact in humans animal studies being able to understand where those sit relative to one another and then you are obviously a practitioner of a you practise what you preach and what you talk about pertains to men to women younger people older people people who are vegan veto carnivore you really are able to net a tremendous number of ideas while staying really now once and data driven and s o ut say for myself and non behalf the listeners really appreciate you coming in here to day and and sharing with us your knowledge we will absolutely point people in the direction of i where they can learn more about you and one of the places a that i one i doubly one to mention before we we part however is this carbon a and i should just mention ism not this is not a paid promotion or anything that sort actually one of our podcasttee members is has been using carbon for a long time this is an a that you devised which allows people to navigate the exercise nutrition energy balance space for wait lost muscle gain fat lost weight maintenance i would just to briefly ask you about that before we con clue without necessarily telling us everything that is in the carbon a it'd love to know what are the major things that it does and is good for and then what were some of the key things that you wanted to make sure were in there when you built it what what is the sort of logical backbone behind it cause i think they're a lot of am food counting gallery counting exercise as out there u everyone have talk you that uses carbon i including our mutual friend cigar and petty this member of my podcast et camera raves about it what is carbon and and but what is it do and what was your mind set in building it what did you really want to see there that yo did not see elsewhere those those thing may not know but i really i started on line coaching people for nutrition back in two thousand five and that was the the vast majority of my business all the way up until two thousand seventeen and i had a lot of success for that where whether whether it be just average folks look into lose weight or build muscle and right up to silly level a competitors and physiquesport i kind o had this idea i was not i the idea a few people have the idea what if we could take what i do in coaching and try to automate as much of that as possible cause you do not by the time i was becoming a really popular coach a an i was expensive you though you're looking it me to me charging i got the point my charging about a thousand dollars a month for coaching right and not ill most people cannot afford that and i would to not just coach rich people you do not i man would to be able to help other people the idea was to create an a that could do some of the stuff now there is always a place for human interaction but for people who cannot afford that our a is basely ten bucks a month and basely what we wanted to do was set up an a were think about if you went to patrician coach but what would they do they would probably ask you some questions about your goals a take some anthrometrics a and they would use that informant may be dietary preference and then use that information to count of formulate a baseline plan that is what carbon does we ask you i think there is eight questions in the sign up flow about your activity am your exercise your life stile your body weight your body fat percentage and if you do not know it we hop you calculated it is not perfect but it is better than nothing a and then you dietary preferences and we use that to come up with kind of your baseline and your baseline will be your calories you reproaching your pirates and fats and what is different about our a is apelike a you now my fitness powered will do that as well ah what is different about ours is you we encourage people to log their weight daily for the reasons that we talked about earlier and then you can also track your food in the a and modestly i think our food tracker is actually water to use then most of not there are are whet we typically get great rave reviews about is how use our friendly our interfaces that it makes into it of sense and you track your food try to hit these these backhoes that your prescribed and each week you will be prompted to check in with the coach on your checking day and then you you put in some information and then based on how your progressing the a will a just or not a just base on higher progressing for example if your hitting aweightlost plateau it will since that and it will younowl reduce your calories or or if your trying to gain weight and your hit plateau ill increasoure carries and there is a lot of you o back and algorithm stuff that it takes care of this but the fundamental trucks of the a is we we try to determine your total daily energy expenditure because hat's long to tell us the first big thing we need to know which is how many calories do you need to be eating for your goal right on the front end we we basically am do our best guess base on your athromatrics not can be perfect but it'll give us in the ball park and if you do know some people area while i know what i maintain my body weight on there is almost not we can manmanually enter that during the sign flow that is helpful for people who are superheroes me a but then if your just people will ask what you do you take apple watch data you take this you take that and know for the reasons we talked about that it over estimates energy expenditure what our apt does is it is an algebra equation if you because your body weight your your maintenance calories is your total daily energy expenditure your average calories that you eat to me stain your body weight will be the same as you are told daily energy expenditure if we know how body weight is changing and we know how many calories the persons consuming we can actually solve for what energy expenditure is h and you can see in the a that will others ta kind of a a maintenance carry tracker or energy expenditure tracker and typically after about three to four weeks even if the a was off at first it will have you pretty darn close because let let us say somebody a comes on and they their goal is to lose pound and half a week or something that and the first week they lose three pounds now the a actually accounts for the fact that you can lose more water weight the first weeks they probably would not get an adjustment but let us say the next week they lose three pounds the a will since that and a just their calories up because it will be estimating that their energy expenditures to acid higher then what id previously estimated based on the amount of weight there losing and the same thing goes in reverse if there not losing the amount of weight thither suppose to ah it will lower them base on the fact that it may have overestimated their energy expenditure but a that is the first crux of it is tracking that energy expenditure and then the next thing is preaching when the the back end alarm them stuff has happening calories are set first based on your energy expenditure and your goal for example if you haven a you restive diet a your calories long to be lower even if your energy expenditure my people but high a just because of you tried o loose two pounds a week i mean you argon to be in a pretty aggress of carry deficit the us tat the calories first then it will set procaine base on your lean body mass then the calories that are left over will be allotted to care hydrate and fat depending on your dietary preference and we have a few different dietary preferences there is balanced which is a about fifty fifty to sixty forty crobahydrate to fat of the remaining calories then you have low fat which is obviously higher rate of carbohydrate you have low care you have a see tonic diet which is very very low care and then there is also a plant based option and within each of those options still you can go in and actually shimmy the backhoes a little bit within a certain range that you can kind of dial in what your specific dietary preferences because again if we go back to what is going to produce the best long term results it is whatever the person can adhere to we really try to start with the concept of adherence by allowing people to have the dietary preference that they want and there is another appsout there that are good as a for example we gat slot with the donor a and the renaissance periodization a and they have a great a abut there is is kind more rigid and still say you do not your need this many meals and you can have these foods at these times work on the opposite we want to give you maxim flexibility now for some people they would prefer the the rigid structure at first but we find that for most people giving them more flexibility a typically improves it here and over the long run that is kind of how the a works and again there is multiple different goals is not just await lot a there is a maintenance there is a musslibiliting a you have got all kinds of different goals that can be accommodated different rates of each of those goals and i mean have used the a for over three years now to do my body a and i mean what i say that it is died me and because i ism very regimented with met o logging in and and logging my weight what i targeted to weigh in at worlds i got down to the point one kilogram it's here's pretty cool to be able to use a tool that i hope develop to actually coach me it is a great tool i we we we did some statistics we pull twenty five hundred members and ow one of the questions we ask is would you recommend this to a friend and ninety one per cent said yes we we are our average i think our average retention is seven months which for an apt that costendollars a month is is really great was i mention a number of people i know use it this is not a pap promotion i but i think people need guidance and tools and what we know about the human brain as that winging it can work but that a the brain will cheat itself often am what there is a fine men quote about this and it'll get it wrong and always bad to try and quote firemen because he said it much better but that we are the easiest o you it is easy to fool ourselves baby is what he was say easy yes to absolutely sounds grape we will put a link to it that people can of check it out again at sounds o a wonderful tool and an a tool that eats a lot of the the principles that sit as i major seems for weight loss went gain i would assume a directed a lean muscle a lean tissue gain is what most people are after yon went saints because a number of people would to just maintain listen i really appreciate your time and all that you are

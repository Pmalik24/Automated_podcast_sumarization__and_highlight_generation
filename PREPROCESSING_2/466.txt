welcome to the supermen law science sciencetay to i may interhuberman and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are going to talk all about healthy and disordered eating and indeed we are going to talk about clinical eating disorders such as anorexia ballerina and ingesting disorder as well as some other related eating disorders however before we get into this material i want to emphasize that to days discussion will include what it is to have a healthy relationship with food we are going to talk about metabolism we are going to talk about how eating frequency and what one eats influences things appetite and satiety as well as whether not we have a healthy psychological relationship to food and our body weight and called body composition the ratio of muscle to fat to bone et camera as we march into this conversation i to share with you some interesting and what i believe our important findings in the realm of nutrition and human behavior i know these days many people are excited about or curious about called intermittent fasting intermittent fasting is as the name implies simply restricting ones feeling behavior eating to a particular phase of the twenty four hour or called circadian cycle other forms of intermittent fasting involve not eating for extended periods of time for entire days or some people extend to two days or three days typically and hopefully they will drink water during those times sometimes referred to as water fasting which means that they are ingesting fluids and hopefully they are ingesting electrolytes such as salt potassium and magnesium as well because while one can survive for some period of time without ingesting calories it is extremely important to continue to ingest plenty of fluids and electrolytes and the reason for that is that the neurons of your brain an body that control your movements your thoughts clarity of thinking in general et camera is critically dependent on the presents of adequate levels of sodium potassium and magnesium the electrolytes in that is because neurons can only be electrically active by way of movement of particular ions which include things sodium potassium and magnesium without those you cannot think you cannot function and it actually can be quite dangerous who all the excitement about intermittent fasting well a lot of the excitement relates to work that was done by a former colleague of mine down at the salt institute for biological studies in santiago name such panda scans lab identified some very important and impactful health benefits of restricting one's feeding window to particular times within the twenty f or our cycle or even to having extended fasts that go for a day or two days or man even three days what they saw was an improvement in liver en times an improvement in insolent sensitivity which is something that is good it means that you can utilize the calories and the blood sugar that you happen have being insolent insensitive is not good and is actually a form of diabetes what such and lab and subsequently other lab showed was that restricting one's feeding window t anywhere from for to eight or even twelve hours during each twenty four hour cycle was beneficial in mice and some studies in humans have also shown that it can be beneficial for various health parameters however the excitement about intermitting fasting seems to be related to the foundational truth about metabolism and weight lost in weight maintenance and weight gain which is that regardless of whether not you intermitting fast or whether or not you eat small meals all day long or you eat one meal in the evening and snack up until then it really does not matter in the sense that the calories that you invest from whatever source are going to be filter through the calories that you burn by way of exercise bail metabolic rate which is just the calories that you happen to burn just being alive and thinking and breathing and your heart beating et camera and the reason why many people prefer intermitting fasting to other forms of lest just call it what it is diet or nutritional framework is that many people find easier to not eat then to limit their portion size and here ism not talking necessarily about eating disorders ism talking about the general population i think that is one reason why their much excitement about intermitting fasting now within the contacts of intermit fasting on a circadian time scale once every twenty four hours you generally find two categories of people people who prefer to not eat in the morning either because they are not hungry in the morning or because they find it relatively straightforward to just drink things coffee or water et camera and push their feeding window out to noon or two p m or three p m and then they will eat between say one p m and eight p m or nine p m it depends on the individual other groups of people find that they are very hungry when they wake up in the morning they do not feel well if they do not eat breakfast and they prefer to eat early in the day but then they limit their feeding windows such that they cut off their food intake or stop investing any calories of any kind somewhere around five p m or six p m et camera the duration of the feeding window has not been broken down into the kind of new ants type of information that one would really want at least not n human studies saying well a six hour feeding wen or in eight hour feeling window is ideal it really is going to vary based on life style in circumstances for instance some families really want to eat dinner together every night do you want to be the person that sitting there watching everybody eat because your fasting from five p m onward i do not know that is an individual difference what you can startidentify however that people tend to fall into either one category the other people who prefer to skip eating in the morning or people that prefer to or mansion skip eating in the evening and there has been no evidence thus far that one is better or worse at least in terms of weight loss a over all health parameters now you can imagine that some people might eat breakfast and dinner and indeed i have several many colleagues in fact who just choose to skip lunch because they are busy during the day they breakfast in dinner that does not afford the long fast associated with sleep what i mean by that well if you went to sleep at eleven p m and you wake up at six a m by extending your fast until one p m in the afternoon you get quite a long period of no investing any calories whereas when you do not eat during the middle of the day you are getting a fasting period that is probably anywhere from four to seven hours but it is not linked to the longer fasting period of not eating while you are asleep because most all people and i want emphasize most do not eat while they are asleep but we are going to talk about an eating disorder that does exist where people actually eat in their sleep i know it sounds pretty wild but indeed a it that eating disorder does exist and has a very interesting underlying mechanism why are we talking about this and in particular where we talking about this during an episode that includes a discussion about eating disorders the reason is nobody not the government no nutritionist no individual no matter how knowledgeable they are about food and nutrition and food intake can define the best plan for eating for any one individual o my repeat that nobody knows what truly healthy eating is we only know the measurements we can take liver en times bloodlippered profiles body weight athletic performance mental performance whether not your cranky all day whether not your feeling relaxed nobody knows how to define these and these have strong cultural and familial and social social influence if you hang out with people that interment fast all day that will seem normal if you spend time with people have never heard of interementin fasting interment fasting is going to seem very abnormal now we are going to talk about eating disorders that really fall into the category of clinically die noticeable eating disorders for which there is actually serious health hazards and even the serious risk of death you will get to that topic but for the time being i want to emphasize a new set of findings that i think many people will find interesting and at least will want to cons her in light of their current nutritional plan or pattern of eating whether not your intermitting fasting or not and i want a cue up an important frame work for the rest of the conversation on healthy and disordered eating which includes and understanding of thinking decision making and what we call homeostatic processes meaning regulation of things that are going on in our brain an body and reward mechanism someone a return to that in a moment but first i one a share with you these new findings that were just published in the journal sell report to sell press journal excellent journal this was a study that was performed both in mice and it included across overstudy with a human population the human population was women but it relates to a previous study that was also carried out in men ism in a simplify this study we will provide a link to the full studies who can explore it in more detail and if you are really excited about the results i would encourage you to explore some of the references within that paper as well what was the study the study looked at giving mice or humans two meals and explored whether r not putting those meals early in the day er late in the day had an impact on muscle hypertrophy muscle growth and over all proline synthesis of muscle when we eat the emmenoacids from various foods are broken down and synthesized into different types of tissues they can be utilized for energy yon burned up for moving about and thinking et camera or it can be synches those amenoacids can be synthesized into skeletal muscle the sorts of skill to muscles that allow you to move your limbs this study explored how proline in take which included what are called branch chainamenoacids and a monoacid lupine which are important for muscle proline synthesis it explored whether or not emphasizing or skewing the proline in take toward early day or late day was better in terms of muscle hypertrophy and they also looked at some parameters of strength grip strength now mice are nocturnal before you say way mice or nocturnal how did they look during the day and its completely it does not apply cause it is in mice of course they knew that and they looked during them the mine's active phase of their circadian cycle which corresponds to our day and in humans they looked at whether r not eating most of one's proline early in the day was better than if the protean take an these prance chanominoacids were placed later in the day and yes they had the mice due resistance training they did that by emphasizing overload to one limb of the mouse and that actually generates hypertrophy its a form of resistance training in mice s they do not have them weight training they were not doing you no curls in dipping squats and things that sort they were moving their own body weight but they skewed that distribution of bodyweight by re striating a limb and proving them to use one limb that did indeed grow in response to that and then in humans there was an exploration of grip strength and then with resistance training that was all carried out through a puerperal study basically the take away from the study was that mice and humans can utilize a monoacid that are invested early in the day better than they can utilize a monoacid in jested later in the day in particular tired muscle hypertrophy and growth or maintenance of muscle which for those of you that are not interested in much muscle hypertrophy that are not try to grow your muscles have talked before in the episode on building strength and hypertrophy that maintaining muscle regardless of one's athletic prowess regardless of one's age is extremely important because loss of skill to muscle is one of the major causes of injury as we age its one of the major causes believe it or not of cognitive and metabolic dephisids as we age maintaining muscle is important building muscle might be important to some of you but what they found was in jesting proline early in the day and these a monoacid early in the day led to more muscle hypertrophy than if the majority of a monoacid in prolines were invested late in the day this translates to intermit an fasting such that if you are interested muscle hypertrophy you might and one emphasize might consider making sure that your getting sufficient proline and take early in the day what sources of proline you use as can be highly individual some of you a meat eaters some of you do not eat red meat some of you eat chicken and miss an egg some of you do not some of your vegans it has been shown that the monoacid lysine is vital for the sell growth process including muscle growth because of its relationship to the called m tore pathway mammalian target of rapaminison yo talk about that more if you in a future episode this means that if your somebody who wants to maintain or increase the amount of muscle mac that you have investing a hypnotize meal early in the day ought to be beneficial for that does it mean that you should not eat proline in the afternoon an evening no i think a lot of people might have misinterpreted this study and i do not want that to happen this is only pointing out the fact that in jesting sufficient quality a monoacid including lousing early in the day can be beneficial for maintenance and growth of muscle tissue it does not say that you should avoid proline later in the day now for you intermittent faster this could be relevant i for instance with somebody who for a very long time skipped breakfast my first meal the day would be in the early afternoon mostly proline and salad in my case animal proline cause that in alinement with my values than in the evening i would eat post vegetables et camera i might have some proline some small piece of fish or chicken or something that butaten't really emphasized that on the basis of these results i am experimenting with i one emphasize experimenting with agent completely tossed out my old a protocol but ism experimenting with eating prolines early in the day and eating lunch and then dinner might be a light supper of some sort but not much proline later in the evening again if you on y six meals a day one e round the clock ism not on a stop you're not telling anybody what to do as i mention earlier nobody knows exactly how to eat for one's particular goals but this study was really interesting because it really did show that we can utilize the prolines that are ingested early in the day better than we can utilize the prolines that ingested later in the day and of course there will be factors that can shift that princence if you work out very hard with resistance training later in the day resistance training is known to increase proline synthesis it stands to reason that in getting a monoacid after that training would be beneficial however in the study it did not seem to matter when the resistance training fell within the twenty four hours schedule the morning ingestion or early day in egestion of a monoacid seem to be beneficial howearly between the hours of about five a m and ten a m four humans now just a bit of mechanism to explain why this happens why would it be that in getting proline early in the day would lead to more synthesis of muscle then ingesting proline later in the day and the reason it turns out is related to the circadian clock mechanism that is present in all cells including muscle cells some muscles have fires i think most people are ware of that that your muscles are not just one big blob of tissue e lot of these will fibers that contract within those fires however there are cells with lucky i those lucky i contain d an a data is transcribed into area area is trains lated into prolines the data of your cells including these muscle cells are under strong circadian regulation each one has a pattern of gene expression that is different at different times during the twenty four hour cycle this is an inescapable reality of all cells in your body right from your hair cells to your brain cells to your retinal cells to your to on both feet these cells make a gene called b man b man b m a l is a clock gene and the expression of this clocking varies across the twenty four hour cycle and prolines that are downstream of this man gene influence proline synthesis the circadian regulation of this man give turns out to be vitally important for this proline synthesis mechanism how do we know that well in this particular study because they had a mouse that lacked man the gene was knocked out they had a bunch of these mice they were able to explore whether not this early day feeding effected was present or absent in these mice that lack the gene man and indeed it you s absent in other words the effect of increased proline synthesis early in the day was eliminated in the absence of the bemalgine what this means is that when you wake up in the morning assuming your following a standard schedule being asleep at night and awake during the day your muscle cells are primed to incorporate a mind acids and synthesize muscle regardless of weather not you wait trained the night before at eight p m where you do not wait train at all are you went train afterwards or before i said five to ten p m is the sort of critical window for this increase proline synthesis all this means is that if you are interested in maintaining or enhancing muscle tissue volume that you might one a consider eating quality proline and aminoacids early in the day you could train first you could train after you cannot train at all that is a entirely different discussion what is quality proline well quality proline is going to be approving that include most of the essential amino acids and in particular lupine there is a lot of debate as to whether not you can get all the essential monoacid from up purely plant the stet are wether not you need unjust animal base foods or not the term quality proline has no strict scientific definition some people to find quality proline as a proline that has a high essential mind acid to colonic ratio what that means is a small piece of chicken or stake or eggs for instance will have many essential mind acids with a low colorant content relative to say beans or plantable foods that can also get you essential mind acids but it requires more calories to access those essential mind acids now that is a debate that has many exceptions and nuances and i for one and perfectly respectful of the folks that just wanton just a plantable foods in order to get their high quality proline i think that actually can be done one has to be careful and thoughtful in their choices about to do that this really is not about animal base for sis non animal bastes foods this is about getting quality a mind acids early in the day from whatever foods are alignment with your particular values in your particular eating plan that is a lot of information but the retake ways are every cell in your muscles has a cocaine the cloccines very such that proline synthesis is greater early in the day than it is later in the day such that in both mice and in humans ingestion of quality prolines early in the day will be more sowing corporate into muscle than the prolines that invested late in the day and of course there are the caveats of if your training hard late in the day if you are adjusting your hormone status through whatever mechanism et camera proline synthesis can also be high later in the day but for most people it is going to taper off due to this circadian b imagine related macaw ism again we will provide a link to the study and the other retake always were that nobody knows nobody can tell you what healthy feeding windows are what the best feeding windows are there is absolute no information in that contact you talk to ten nutritionist or academics or trainers or individuals about what healthy eating is and you are going to get vastly different answers and that is one of the reasons why i believe that the internal in particular social media are filled with contradictory opinions but the calories in verses carry calories burned formula is the more or less wholly foundation of all things about nutrition eating and wait and as we transition to day into the discussion aby eating disorders it'd you to keep this in mind because for the treatment of eating disorders it does not matter what psychological or early drama based effects led to the eating disorder if the person is not adjusting their feeding behavior in a way that is going to ameliorate the symptoms of that disorder which is ultimately the goal before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve son delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and treason i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which are vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get thevitemens i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to truth lentic greens you can go to athletigreen stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you i free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of stand ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic restock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fire travel packs and the year supply of vitemendi three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar give talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration an and electrolier for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have soda magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those sells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is elements dotcam slash huberment and you get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want ta try element you can go to element element e dream slash supermen let us talk about eating disorders and as we do that i want to emphasize again that nobody can really define what healthy eating is with a single protocol however there is some general agreement about what unhealthy and disordered eating is there are clear criteria in the psychiatric and psychological communities to define things and erection anemia beengeating disorder all of which we will talk about dos we have that discussion i want to emphasize that self diagnosis can be both a terrific but also a very precarious thing we talked about the sylhobit in the episode about depression there is always a temptation as one learns about the symptomolodgy of a given disorder does not really matter what the disorder is to ask the question well do i have that does and that i know have that ah i see this sort of behavior or that pattern of thinking in that individual it is tempting to diagnose them end or ourselves as either having or not having a particular disorder however diagnoses really need to be carried out by people who are trained in that particular field and that have deep expertise in recognizing the symptomatology including some of the more subtle symptomatology of eating disorders if any of the symptoms resonate with you by way of you thinking that you have this particular disorder or one tat has a disorder i would take that seriously but i would take that information to a qualified health care professional that could diagnose or rule out any of these possible disorders i say that not to protect us but to protect you because information is valuable and i do believe that knowledge of knowledge can be very valuable in navigating any topic and improving our thoughts and behaviors around that topic but one does not want to were i should say one should not start to self diagnose simply on the basis of information without running that through the filter of a qualified professional what is in eating disorder well we have to take a step back and confess to the fact that every society of culture every family and every individual has a different relationship to food eaten disorders however have particular criteria that a low us to defend them and to think about different modes of treatment as it relates to the particular symptoms in particular the psycho logical and biological symptoms of those disorders now that is a mouthful no unintended what are the major eating disorders anorexia nervous most commonly refer to his anorexia is perhaps the most prevalent and the most dangerous of all eating disorders in fact anorexia is the most dangerous psychiatric disorder of all even more than depression the probability of death for untreated anorexia is very high and sadly the prevalence of anorexia is very high what is anorexia and how prevalent is it anorexia you look at up on line or you talk to a qualified professional is essentially a failure to eat enough to maintain a healthy weight you can see all sorts of very troubling symptoms of somebody whose been anorexic for some period of time my general loss of muscle mass because there in jesting fewer calories than they burn muscle is very metabolically active they can to lose a lot of muscle mass they will have a low heart rate this is the body entrains attempt to lower energy output they ill have low blood pressure they will sometimes have symptoms fainting they will have a sometimes even hair growth on the face something called lanugo which is essentially the bodies attempt to insulate the body because of loss of body heat when you are that thin loss of bonedensity onto paresis loss of periods in girls and women and all sorts of disrupted gut and immune functions there are just tons of terrible symptoms of anorexia that really place the anorexic into a very risky state which is why mortality from inertia gone untreated is extremely high now one of the misconceptions about anorexia is that it stems from an over emphasis on perfectionism were that because of all the images in sociamedia and in advertising of extremely thin and fit or muscular people that individuals are looking at themselves and comparing themselves to those images and thinking that they do not match up and developing anorexia that turns out to not be the case if you look at the prevalence or the rates of anorexia in the last ten years or twenty years and you compare that to when anorexia was first identified which was in the sixteen hundreds and perhaps even earlier what you find is that rates of anger exit are not going up this idea that the images that were being bombarded with are causing anorexia does not seem to be true now that is not to say that the images that we and particular young people are being bombarded with are healthy for their psychological state of mind but classically defined anorexia has existed as mentally the same prevalence for the last hundred two hundred three hundred and four hundred years which is incredible and really speaks to the likelihood that there is a strong biological contribution to what we call anorexia necrose anorexia or visa is extremely common its anywhere from one to two per cent of women and the typical onset is in adolescence close to purity but it can show up later in life as well in fact the identification in diagnosis of anorexia tends to be in the early twenties but if you look back at the history of those individuals there were typically signs of anorexia that stem back in to their early teens or may been before that now of course men can be anorexic as well but anereian orvosa does seem to occur at ten times the rate in women and young girls than it does in men and young boys while there does seem to be more of a prevalence of nterexia in boys and young men these days that is probably due to better diagnosis and detection than it is to some sort of society or shift related to imagery et camera later we will talk about body dimorphic and some of the images that are present in media and social media and hallows are impacting other forms of eating disorders but when you look at anteerexia nervous this failure to maintain weight even to healthy levels and often drops and weight that are very dangerous or even deadly that has existed for a very long time and seems to be somewhat hard wired into the biology of individuals that suffer from it now when is a hard wire that does not mean that it cannot be treated or cured and indeed it can ballerina which is defined as ingesting or over eating i may explain what that is ingesting is consuming vast amounts of calories in a short period of time over eating can be in jesting more calories than one needs but over an extended period of time both can exist of course but ballerina is also very common its more common in young girls and in women that it is in young boys and in men but it is present in both sexes ballerina and rates of ballerina might be increasing a sort of an interesting finding bits not quite clear whether or not its existed in its same form for a long periatife time or within other new forms that are evolving or showing up we are going to drill into ballerina and what what it actually is in what it represents but one thing i want to be clear about just as the perfectionists mind set has been associated with anorexia and it turns out that not the case it can be but it is not always associate with anorexia there was the idea that ballerina is associated with early drama an childhood in particular sexual drama and while that can be the case there is no direct correlation between the two now obviously psychological phenomena and drama and have a profound impact on the way that the brain wires up and the way that people approach food and other types of behaviors but the sort of classic idea was that all anorexics are perfectionists they want to perform well it is all about control and astronomy and ballemixs are can have deregulated an acting out against some early sexual drama those stereo types of the the psychological framework of anorexics and balletic does not hold up when you look at the data many many metanalysies have been done it just simply is not the case and in both instances both anorexia and ballerina their clear biological under winnings to what is driving the under eating or the over eating we are got to talk about the biology of underrating and overeating and appropriate levels of eating and by doing that we starts identify some of the mechanisms that serve as entry points for the treatment of both anorexia and ballerina and as some of you a probably aware anorexia and ballerina can be morbid they can exist with one another there are anorexics who will binge and then purge in order to maintain that unhealthily low weight there are balletic who fit the psychological criteria of inertia and there is a lot of overlap between those two categories a let us talk about the categorization for second and why the categorization has led to now a bunch of other eating disorders as defined by the psychiatric community one of the classic symptoms of anorexia is a loss of menstrual cycles loss of periods and the reason for that is when the body is under nourished the body fat stores send signals to the brain to inform that the body is under nourished or they turn off the signals that say look their enough body fat sells out here to support healthy metabolism and therefore lets shut down ovulation literally signal sent from the fat and muscle to the brain and the brain the hypothesis in pituitary will send signals down to the ovaries or they will turn off the signals heading to the ovaries to deploy eggs to maturation of eggs in the physical et camera there are instances in which people have anorexia or have ballerina but are still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles or at least menstrual cycles and that has led to it whole set of other camera nations of eating disorders ingesting disorder where there tends to be a lot of over eating but not the merging or categorizations of anorexia were in which people are underfeeding but they are not losing their periods and these have a number of different names and acronyms some of them include things ends ends is eating disorder not otherwise specified that is a subcategarization or offers offers is other specified feeling or eating disorder right now if you are to look on line or y looking to the a psychiatric and psychological textbooks whet you find as that there is a huge constellation of eating disorders to day were mainly going to talk about anorexia bellemia ingesting disorder and body dimorphic you can even find eating disorders pica where people actually in jest things dirt or rocks or metal because they have a genuine appetite for those things i certainly do not recommend a sampling any of those non food items as foods it's incredibly dangerous people often poison themselves they often a can cause structural blockages some people have died from those sorts of things but none the less there are aspects of our brain and biology that when disrupted can lead to very bazaar types of eating behavior sometimes pica s caused by mold nutrition but not always and today we are going to focus on the most prevalent eating disorders but we are going to build up toward that understanding by looking at what healthy metabolism and eating and satiety and hunger looks because one i realize that not everyone else there has an eating disorder and too i want people to understand this relationship between how they think the decisions they take about what they eat and how the body and the brain at subconscious levels are driving some of the these behaviors healthy or otherwise because i do think that it can lead us to a better understanding of what healthy eating is for most of us and to increase compassion and hopefully even increased improvement in treatment of eating disorders for those that are suffering from them what is hunger and what is satiety society of course being sated or feeling we have had enough food i one to remind people of the basic mechanisms by which the brain and body communicate this is vitally important not just for this discussion but for any discussion about how we think how we behave how we feel the body is communicating two types of information to the brain on a regular basis but in particular around feeding and those two types of information are mechanical information and chemical information what i mean by mechanical information wealth you take a deep breath o and you hold your breath what you will find as ha yo can hold your death a lot longer than if you exile all you're and you hold your death with lungs empty and the reason is not because when your lungs are full you have enough oxygen and therefore you can hold your breath it is because when your lungs are full a particular class of neurons called barrow receptors send information to the brain and say there is pressure in the lungs and that means that there is probably oxygen in here and the trigger to breathe is actually suppressed when your lungs are empty even if you have plenty of oxygen in your system those barrel receptors send a different signal to the brain which is there is no oxygen in here and you should breathe and the impulse to breathe comes earlier likewise when your stomach is full it send signals to your brain that are purely based on this mechanical fullness us nothing to do with nutrients that says ism full and therefore do not be as hungry do not motive ate to find or invest food whereas when our gut is empty even if we have plenty of nutrients or plenty of bodyfat stores we tend to focus on food a bit more volume and mechanical influences have a profound effect on how we think and what we consider doing our not doing likewise chemical effects when we invest food ore called blood sugar or blood locos levels go up that information is signal to the brain via neuronal pathways and hormonal pathways and in particular there are neurons within our gut that signal to areas of our brain stem that are involved in satiety in our sense of having enough that there is food in our system that is chemical information how a hunger and feeding and satiety regulated by way of mechanical and chemical signaling you have i have we all have neurons in our hypothalamus that trigger eating and neurons that trigger cessation or stopping of eating we have an accelerator on eating and we have a break and i covered all of this in a lot of detail in the episode on feeding in metabolism and hunger of you want a lot more detail see that episode but rage now ism just going ogive you the top contour of how all that works your hypothalamus is an area of your forebrain which tells you it is in the front but it is at the base of your forbransits or less above the roof for your mouth the hypothalamus contains lots of different kinds of neurons clouding neurons that stimulate sexual activity and desire regulate your body temperature and control appetite and ceasing of eating and appetite there two types of neurons within a particular area of your hypothalamus that are relevant here there are the called p o m c neurons c pro opioid mañana cotton neurons that tend two act is more of a break on appetite by way of another harmony call malanacite stimulating hormone and not incidentally when you are getting a lot of sunlight and your viewing a lot of sunlight that system is ramped up this is why appetite is lower in the summermonths than it is in the winter months is is true in animals and this is true in humans and you have a class of neurons called the a g a neurons the a are neurons are the ones that stimulate feeding and they create a sort of anxiety or excitement about food can be positive anxiety or it can be negative anxiety what do not i mean by that well the ever seen kids heading in to get ice cream they are absolutely excited you see people getting rays sit down and eat a big meal they are excited to eat sometimes that is due to social factors but they have an increase in over all levels of autonomic arousal and depending on the contacts they can feel excited or anxious but it is a camping up of energy these ago are generous are what cause that in fact much that if you eliminate or kill these neurons which has been done in experimental male models in the laboratory but also they are humans that have lesions or nerotoxic effects on these ago are generous and what you fine is that they do not want to eat they essentially become anorexic meaning they do not want in gest food they have no appetite for food whatsoever now that is not exactly what anorexia is but these ago are generous ore an accelerator on wanting to eat whereas if you stimulate these ago are generous or in humans that have say a small tumor near these ago are generous they become hyprophagic they will eat to the point of bursting both animals in humans that have elevated levels of these ago are generous are anxious they want to eat and they will ingest food to the point where they override those mechanical and chemical signals in the body and i know it sounds horrible and it is horrible they will eat until the until the point that they burst now they are signals coming back from the body to inform the brain about presence of different levels of nutrients and that generally comes from three sources first of all is body fat the more body fat we have the more we secrete a hormone called leaped in elf p t in leaped in from body fat leaped in goes to the brain and suppresses appetite this is a body to brain signaling mechanism that says look have had enough not incidentally leaped in signalling is disrupted in people that have bulletin and ability and certain forms of ingesting disorder that system is disrupted the have had enough signal or there is enough body fat here such that you do not need to eat more right here ism sort of in the voice of the body fat trying to talk to the brain that signal that dialogue is mixed up or messed up in some cases its absent entirely the body fat is signalling to the brain about how much reserve you have it sort of a saving's account for energy cause that is a body fat is got lipids in there and through lipolysis that can be metabolized fur inched in that process we both how to increase at end just generally how it works can see the episode on the science of fat loss the bodyfat is doing something else really interesting that relates to anorexia when there sufficient levels of body fat and leaped in circulating in the blood and that leaped in signal gets to the brain the hypofalmus and the pituitary gland register that signal and in a completely subconscious way trigger the deployment of eggs in females and the production of sperm in mails when body fat stores are very low the reason why periods shut off or sperm production is reduced or even shut off is because there is not enough leapt in getting to the hypothalamus and to the pituitary and they shut off the signals the hormones things conatetropen releasing hormone utilizing hormone fall stimulating homo all these hormones thy do not haft remember the names of if you do not want to that travel to the overload to the testees and cause very invested to ovulate ore to produce more sperm the reason why anorexic stop having periods when they stop cycling is because there is not sufficient leapt in in the bloodstream now there have been attempts to give leapt in to anorexic because lepton has been sequenced and the peptide as been synthesized into you can inject leptin into people there are studies where they have done that when you when that happens it does not tend to alleviate the anorexia does not cause people start eating again and that actually make sense because leapt in is all way of shutting off the hunger signals saying it is the body fats way of sang hay there is a lot a body fat hearer their sufficient body fat tor does even have to be a lot but it has in some cases been shown to rescue the menstrual cycling in some anorexics case body fat is signaling to the brain the gut is signaling to the brain there anurans inpour got that are primarily responding to meaning they fire electrical signals when the are sufficient fattyacids coming from fats you ins a mind acids coming from prolines you ingest and sugars coming from carbohydrates and sugars things fructose glucose et camera those signals are being sent from the fat and from the got up to the brain and therefore your body has multiple signals of directing you toward eating more or eating less of got two categories of anurans one that acts as an accelerator the agiarpeteron saying eat eat and gets you excited to eat and then you have a category of anurans the piomosinerons that are suppressing hunger there acting a break and the body is informing the brain all the time about the status of the body and whether not needs more food or not you might ask why is it that people who are overweight and have a lot of body fat why they would continue to eat a lot well pass to certain threshold the body fat that is when you stare getting into the called metabolic disorders where blood glucose metabolism is disrupted leapt in signaling is disrupted and the are all sorts of changes on both the brain side and the body end of things such that they are hungry despite the fact that the body has plenty of energy on reserve that i think is sufficient to explain that the basics of hunger and satiety and a kind of a biological mechanism and the importanthing again to remembers that their mechanical and chemical signals that come from fullness or absence of fulness that come from the presence of glucose in the blood or the absence of glucose in the blood when you have not eaten for a long time glucagon levels go up for instance jet pe one levels go of and those will drive you to seek out food and want food and then there are the signals the are coming from body fat and from grants in the gut sir's a lot of convergent signal lot of pathways i do not offer you all those pathways to confuse you i offer you those pathways to clarify the extent to which something as simple as eating or that decision to not eat is complicated were perhaps heard or have certainly heard that oh it takes about twenty minutes for satiety to set in see you should eat slowly that you will not realize that your full until about twenty minutes that is i you not true i soft know where that got started but we should probably all chew our food better and eat more slowly be more mindful of what were eating et camera anticipation of this episode i consulted extensively with a colleague of mine at stamford who sadly for us is going off to university of pennsylvania a our losses universe of pennsylvaniofs win u his name is doctor case halpurn he is a empty medical doctor and narrow surgeon and a oh t who studies injecting disorder and other types of eating disorders and how they arise in the brain and he is developed some really pioneering treatments for them the talk more about his work lo bit later in the episode but we got to the discussion of why a body that has sufficient energy levels would desire to eat more at all this is not just the case for ingesting disorder or for collegia but why that would be the case this is primitive biology that evolved over many tens of not hundreds of thousands of years you see to mice you see in humans very similar types of pathways and effects how is it that human beings who have plenty of fat on reserve and plenty of gliadin in their liver et camera another words plenty of energy why they would be hungry why they would eat at all seems that just should not happen and he had a very important and i think clear and intuitive way of framing up all this stuff around eating and motive ate behaviors and how they can go awry not just in eating disorders but in all of us basically what he said was from an evolutionary standpoint it makes sense that we should eat as often as we can as much as we can and as fast as we can that sounds crazy one was told to eat not too often not too much and to eat slowly an she my food but as doctor halpurn pointed out there are circuits in the brain to reward eating coffin eating fast and cramming as much food into as possible because from a purely evolutionary standpoint food was scarce and seeking food was dangerous whether or not it was from animal sources or not and it is always been competitive for those of ye that grow up in families with a lot of siblings this may resonate with you i just one sibling we were compete about certain things but typically not competitive about food but i had friends that had a lot of siblings it was really interesting to see how food was served up and how it was a taken in those households food would hit the table and it was just it absolute war for portions and who got what and how much and who got a slightly bigger piece of cake et camera turned out to be a frequent happening in these meals and at these birthday parties whereas the only children perhaps were used to having more food presented to them without having to compete with other members the species every animal including humans has a hard wired circuit that we were born with that pays attention to how much food is available how much we are getting now and how much we are likely to get in the future and without going down the rabbit whole of argue it nucleus biology in two sentences you have a hypothermic area called the arcuate nucleus it is a fascinating areas shall the area that houses these pianos anurans and these other types of durians that regulate hunger and society and these neurons in the arcuate nucleus start getting active when we see food and think about food they drive hunger and they drive hunger in a way that is responsive to what the food looks what it smells but also our prior history of interactions with that food and it takes in to account social contact wether or not we are going to get the whole piece to ourselves or whether or not they are going to be others that we are going to have to compete with there lot of signals that this arcuate nucleus in your brain are paying attention to doctor halpurn pointed out that you actually have an accelerator that increases your level of a awareness and anxiety and f constricts your field of view and all your senses any time you interact with food and is driving a primitive reflex to unjust as much food as you can as quickly as you can and then move on from there and presumably to do the same elsewhere that change the way that i think about eating behavior and eating disorders in fact we could think about eating disorders collegia as in unmasking of that mechanism without the call top down control without the mechanisms that we use to regulate our behavior and indeed bellemia and bingitin disorder are closely associated with impulsivity and with impulsive behaviors of other kinds something that we also will discuss more what is the pathway haw does this work what is doctor halpurn and its colleague's doing in order to try an treat things been eating disorder well you can frame all of behavior good decision making in bad decision making in a pretty simple box diagram model and i realize that many of you are listening to this not watching this in there is no diagram to look at it'll just explain it that you can conceptualize it in your mind we have knowledge of what we should do in one box we should eat that we should not eat that we should wait for dinner we should not wait for dinner and then we have what we actually do in another box now this is true for all behaviors we should say something or we want to say something but we do not we should not say something bat we do anyway that is the the knowledge that the kind of looping in your head i should do my homework i should go for on i should not do this right now i should not be on social media all those kinds of should and should not that are circulating your head that is one box then there is what you actually do the behavior whether not you suppress the behavior you turn off your phone and you go read a book ore you go to sleep or whether not you stay up all night or you stay up for another hour even five minutes in between those two boxes are two intervening forces and those intervening forces are critically important those intervening forces are homeostatic processes called by some processes same thing homeostatic processes that regulate the balance of different systems in your body hot and cold awake or asleep dotbamene and the desire to pursue things ceremonial and the desire to just relax in and chill homeostatic processes and reward systems and as we now move into discussion about interexian ballerina specifically what you will see is that anorexia and ballerina are not a breaking of the mind set of what one should do or should not do it is a disruption of these homeostatic and reward processes such that decision making is completely disrupted and in many cases is not available to the after acid or bulimic now i do not want be abstract here what ism saying is that the person who starves themselves to the point where they might die and in some cases sadly do die they can know perfectly well that their behavior is leading to bad outcomes in possibly even death and yet they are not able to intervene unless they get particular clinical help because the homeostatic processes the signals from the body and brain that say you need food those are not registering in the same way that they are for other individuals and for the balletic are the are the person that suffers from inviting disorder they do not necessarily want to eat that food they simply cannot help it it is a reflex for them because the hemostatic processes and the reward processes associate with food are such that they cannot intervene between the should do enquires or should not do expires and what their actual behavior is now this is not just a biological mechanistic plantation for what could have been summarize into sentences what this is is a road map of ware interventions can really mechadifference as we talk about different drug based interventions or behavioral interventions or social interventions it'd likeyou to think about whether not those interventions are breaking in to or tapping into this box of the thinking the sort f pattern of thinking around food whether not the behavior they actual ingestion or the restriction of food or whether're not its tapping into the homeostatic process the balance of energy systems and cold of getting enough but not too much or its tapping into the reward system and just as a little teaser of where were headed what you will find based on the date clinical data experiments done very carefully very well by excellent groups what you will find is that anorexics have a sort of switch that is been flipped such that their decision making is actually pretty darn good it might even be better than yours in terms of evaluating food nutritional content but their habits are disrupted they are not even consciously aware of the fact that they are making terrible and in some cases very dangerous food choices and turns out that habits and the way that we build and break and rebuild new habits is one of the most effective treatments for anterecia owlets talk about anorexia this failure to consume enough energy such that the individual is at risk of death and if not death then severe metabolic disorders lack of bondensity et camera mention earlier anorexia and things that almost certainly were and are anerexyo have been described as early as the sixteen hundreds and may be even earlier here are some records from the saints from the fourteen hundreds of people that refuse to ingest food another common myth is that anorexia is only the sort of thing that you see in rich societies these are spoiled children and with much food that they decide their only get a focus on how slim they are how they look in bathing suits et camera not true a careful analysis through medical epidemiology has shown that you fine anorexia even in cultures an societies where food is scarce that really speaks to biological mechanism now it is hard to unveil in societies where food is scarce because lot of people are starving and hungry but there are individuals that choose still to avoid food and seem to have some sort of reward mechanism that rewards them or makes them feel better if they do not eat despite the fact that there body is severely depleted of new trance that is very interesting and points again to some disruption in some biological mechanism now i want to make sure that ism emphasizing that ism not in favor of people in particular young children atdalessons and teen majors being bombarded we it unrealistic imagery about bodies but the idea that that is the cause of or is amplifying anorexia the data just do not seem to support that anorexia in its classic sense requires that there be an endocrine meaning a hormonal destruction menstrual abnormalities lack of sperm production or lotestastrone and mails in order to meet the classification for anorexia but as i mentioned earlier there now wants and new classifications of antereia that even for individuals that still menstruate or that maintain a sperm production that anorexia can still be considered a clinically diagnosable disorder now typically anorexia starts in adolescence rid around puberty let us take a look at what puberty is puberty at a very broad level is the most significant and dramatic developmental step any one goes through in their life span the body changes the brain changes perceptions change one's own self perception changes and most of those changes are driven by changes in circuitry within the hypothalamus neurons the controlling the production of the called steroid hormones things testosterone estrogen and related hormones prolactin et camera those are all changing at very rapid rates anorexia tends to show up around this time in a subset of individuals who on the face of it seem to find food aversive now the purely psychological theory of this is that they are fighting for autonomy they want control puberty is also a time in which children in parents are in a tug of war over control you were once a small child being told when to go to bed sent tour room now your child that can talk back and say i do not want to or i refuse to and that happens a lot in various households as ism sure you are familiar with adolescence and puberty is also when girl start menstruating typically or boys develop deeper voice the start producing sperm et camera there a lot of bodily changes that also drive perceptional changes and perceptional changes the drive bodily changes it is a dramatic shift for a young girl or boy that dozen nourish themselves sufficiently during that period there are number of downstream negative effects a list out some of them these are a just a subset of the effects hypogonatism that is the lack of sperm production or healthy beg production there is a venereal which is the lack of menstrual cycling of a failure to have a menstrual cycle reduced insolence secretion insolent as this hormone that is released in order to help shut glucose into various tissues for energy utilization that is down because energy levels are down much one of the symptoms that is a little more critic and that has actually interesting implications for sake of the collestral hypothesis is that anorexics who ingest very little food often have cosmically high levels of collestral including media lode's approaching olestra say how could that possibly be it we were all told and continue to be told from many sources that ingestion of dietary collestral is what drives high levels of bodily collestral cllestrals manufacture by the liver and in anorexics who consume very little food they often have cosmically high levels of collestral which is one of the kind of wrinkles in the call dietary collestral hypothesis that all of our collateral that we see on a blood panel is due to what we eat but the explanation for it is that under conditions where there is not sufficient collestral to synthesize the sex tor at hormones things testosterone an estrogen which are required in both males and females those are made from collateral that the body the liver will start generating its own collestral will often overshoot the the mark to a dramatic degree the blood lipid profiles in anorexics are often very unhealthy despite the fact that their eating very little food in addition they intend to have elevate levels of things vasopressin which are hormones that regulate body temperature and salt and but a blood volume intend have low blood pressure they can pass out i mention some of the other symptoms earlier in other words there are huge number of terrible things happening highroad levels are down tartrates are down it is if ism painting a very bleach picture here it is indeed a clique picture we have to ask ourselves what can be done for the anorexic right let us say it is a failure of the agarpenerons to stimulate appetite and feeding let us say it is too much anxiety around food let us say it is because of the way that food restriction was used for reward in the household right o making this up but you could imagine a hypothetical scenario were o the let us to say the mother of a particular individual is very vocal about her avoidance of food we have seen this before right you probably seem somebody who loves to cook and prepare food but then sits down and does not seem to eat and they always seem to in air quotes have eaten earlier i ate while i cooked i ate while i cook right these people that you never actually see eating we all know people this are they anorexic possibly we do not know a child observes that kind of behavior maybe that individuals being always being told how beautiful they look or how wonderful or fit they look what incredible meals they they produce and you could imagine a purely psychosocial said of ethenes that could lead a child to be anorexic that does not seem to be the case at least not in terms of driving classic anorexia of really extreme deprivation of oneself from food however there is a strong genetic component foranerexias you could imagine a mild form of anorexia in apparent that is supported or exacerbated by pray as that the person feels good from the praise their getting that ah they want to be a low body weight for whatever reason for aesthetic reasons or for whatever reasons that happen to appeal to them and the child has a genetic predisposition right we never think about genes in terms of controlling behavior genes bias probabilities for behavior count have a gene for depression of her scisophrania but it is not deterministic in the same way that there are genes that determine your eye color or your skin color or your hair color there is a genetic predisposition there and that genetic predisposition could exist such that if one is rewarded enough times for a particular behavior that behavior can start to watch it in to our neral circuitry because behavior drives neural changes called neural plasticity and you could imagine that that child could develop a full blown case of anorexia and this is why i raise to the beginning that no one really knows how to define healthy eating and therefore we have to rely on just identification of unhealthy behaviors but what do we point people to in terms of what healthy replacement behaviors would be rather than just look at anorexics and say they are not eating enough and there is this huge array of terrible things that they are doing to their body and they need to eat more we need to rescue them from themselves let us look under the hood let us look at what is known about the neral circuitry and the sorts of perceptions and behaviors of the neural circuitry is driving in order to understand what they are truly suffering from at the level of cause not jobs symptoms it is clear what their suffering from it the level of symptoms symptoms or how we diagnose at listed off a number of those things but let us look under the hood and try and identify were one could intervene in theory in order to try an rescue the anorexic or help the anorexic rescue themselves because it terns out that the answer or at least one of the answers of how to do that is not intuitive at all at least to me was very surprising i would be remiss if i did not start with the obvious which is is there a chemical defect meaning is there some disruption in one of the major chemical systems in the brain that makes anorexics anorexic and therefore can we replace that chemical or can reduce some chemical and essentially eliminate anorexia and the answer is not really sort of maybe no here is why there lot different chemicals in the brain and body but there are category of chemicals that are particularly important that if you listen to this podcast before even if you have not or going to come up again and again and again and that is the category of chemicals in the brain and body called the negro modulators demodulators are different the our transmitters in the sense that neuromodulators modulate or change the activity of brainareas in neural circuits you can think of them as microphones that are held between particular sets of connections in the brain that make those connections in the brain more likely to be active relative to others ha they make them louder to speak there are many neuremodulators but the ones that are important for sake of to day's discussion are the classic ones dopamine setocolin nor apineferon and serotonin let us focus on ceratonan ceratonan is a neuromodulator that tends to increase the activity of certain normal circuits including within the hypothalamus but also within the body that trigger a sense of satiety of having enough enough food enough warmth enough social connection enough of any motivated goal or drive or any type of thing or behavior that one would want more of cretonne tends to make those circuits quiet down now there are many categories of drugs that emphasize the ceratonurgic circuitry meaning they cause the release of or the efficiency of cereatonan in the brain and body things prosaic loft pail things of that variety those drugs have been used to some degree of success although not much to treat things anorexia nervous that should make sense because if these drugs increase ceratonan if their general effect is to increase ceratonan it will be to lower anxiety that sounds a great thing lot of anterexis are really anxious around food will talk about why lowering anxiety you might think would lead to ingestion of more food but that is not often what happens increasing ceratonan by way of some drug regimen will tend to make one less hungry because with heightened levels of ceretonan in the blood and brain there is not the desire to go seek out the things that will raise ceratonan on their own now some interexics do well or benefit from these ceratonurgic drugs these drugs that increase the activity these circuits that lead to society but if you think about the major goal of treating an anorexic it is to get them to have more hunger more appetite now i want a focus on some of the work that is been done around the habits and behaviors of anorexics because those turned out to be ideal places for intervention the work ism about to describe was done by doctor gonna stone glass and colleagues that colombia university in new york and there are other groups as well corse they're doing this type of work but they did what i think are really some beautiful experiments and som beautiful explorations of potential treatments for anterexixs that seem to have a quite high degree of of effectiveness when they are applied correctly first of all there is a challenge in studying anorexia because in anorexia what you're essentially studying is the absence of a behavior it is very hard to study the absence of a behavior as suppose to a behavior they did some experiments withinterexics giving them a gallery of pictures of different foods and allowing those interecic patients to arrange those foods according to preference about what they would select about food nutrient content about collorac content they essentially asses anorexics to a valuate food and in doing they were able to identify something that is very unique to anterexixs at the level of their perception of food what they found is the intermix rather than being anxious in the presence of food and that anxiety driving an avoidance of food what they found is the intermix have a hyperacidity a hyper awareness of the fat content of foods almost of the point of being sort of fat content savants now they do not necessarily know that their doing this they are not looking at anavacado in thinking oke that is ex number of grams of for of fat rather or looking at an caplin sancta that has no fat they start to do this for less reflectively now it is a well known symptom of anorexia especially young intermix that they have and of an objection with food collorac contents micronutrient rations meaning fat proline and o carbohydrate ratios they know colonic numbers but then they sort of pass that information into a memory system in their brain that allows their interactions with food to be very reflective in a way that they are actively avoiding high fat content foods carry rich foods and defaulting towards very low carry foods if they have to eat now this might seem an almost trivial result on the face of at you think oke they calling to eat when they do eat they at locator low fat foods doe but it is the way in which they are doing this subconsciously that they learn this information and they pass it off to a reflective habit and that is very important because what that means is that we need to look at what processes in the brain what brain areas what chemicals drive decision making and knowledge and we also need to look at the areas of the brain that drive habit formation and habit execution because for any of you that have habits and that means all of you the whole marked feature of a habit is that it is reflective yo we a mosquito bite on your leg you scratch it you did not necessarily even think i gin a scratch that in fact just to take a little bit of a a moment of respite and talk about habits in general the beautiful study that was done out of called university looking at the parking lot of ware people park in the morning without dosing parking spots and the trajectories that they use to walk to their offices in the mornings they put cameras up on the roof of called is cinching that that nerdy kids at called do i think it called if you calls some one a nertivethng its compliment my apologies to the nonnerds hat called i think there is one or two of you and for the curvy ones of you a called you are welcome they videotape the behaviors of these faculty and students and staff and what they found is that people follow trajectories from their car that it remarkably stereotype first of all they tend to park always in the same spot if they cannot they tend to get their car of course was in on the driver side or passenger side in the same place they turn and pivot their body at approximating the same rate everyday they close the door they put their bag on their shoulder or across their chests or howvord is that they carry the the brief case whatever it is and they follow trajectories on to campus that are stereotype that you would wonder if you just trace he line after line after line what you would find is that every day is almost exactly the same and you do this too you do not realize it because four being videotape to in this kind of behavior it is not being release to you but your behaviors are stereotype to the point where if you were to see them laid out in front of you in kind of diagrammatic format of the lines and the trajectories that you follow throughout the day the lifting of your mug and how frequently you you drink each hour you would be amazed and probably a little bit scared by how much of a robot we all are now that robotic aspect of our neral circuitry is vital because it is what allows us to think about other things and do other things and drive other behaviors but the work of doctor stone glass and colleague showed that in the case of the interecic those habits are exactly the place where things start to go are and that drive this very thisfunctional under eating behavior that sadly often leads to death or certainly bad medical outcomes and it turns out that the brainareas associate with habit formation and execution are the best point of intervention what doctors stone glass and colleagues did is they took anorectics and they of course had control groups and they put them in an effarmari scanner which are these brain scanners the y allow you to a value a which brainareas are active during particular tasks and because when you are in one of those scanners your actually you your have actually been in one of these things your biting down on a bite bar and your your most of the time in most all these scanners your your immobile also you are looking at things on a previous screen sometimes you can press buttons om to select choices and forth but you cannot really eat within those things ah what they found was that reward base decision making the drive to pursue a particular food or the drive to perform a particular task which is a lot of what we do throughout our day that was control by a ordinary call the ventrmedial prefrontal quarter let me simplify over to this bud mina simplified by giving little detail cause it is the superman ladpodcast and i believe in mechanism mechanism is the way that you get true understanding and that you can then be very quick and give over views of things but you need the mechanism o you have reflexes and you have neural process es that include what are called duration path and outcome type processes a duration path outcome tight process we can shorten with demo devil is for all types of got related behaviors for instance if you want to get a particular grade on exam you want to learn something you want to complete to work out you want go to the grocery store and pick some stuff up and then head home you are going to think duration how long do i have toque to have forty five minutes to get to the store how longs it take to get to the store path which way m i gan ta drive there which way m i gan a navigate throughthe grocery store outcome was i able to get in get the items i need and get home in time i deep duration path outcome it is a very conscious process you tend to take into account different criteria related to what is in what is preventing you from accomplishing what you want to do and what is helping you are assisting you of course as you get to the check outline in the grocery story is the shortest line for instance that is all deep stuffy requires decision making and its reward base you use these deep tight processes on in the short term to pick up groceries and pick a line of the grocery store and decide which trajectory to take home and you use them for navigating long extended processes in life trying to get a degree or raise children or i get through a particularly challenging year et camera duration path outcome and that entire process relies on your forebrain this prefrontal quarter the forefront of quarter is what allows you to take information from memory combine it with information about what is happening in the present context and then to direct your behavior your speech et camera toward particular outcomes and if all that sounds a mouthful it is and it is very metabolically demanding decision making is metabolically demanding it takes effort reflexes on the other hand do not involve the prefrontal quarters in the same way habits and reflexes once how to walk you get up and you walk you dot have to think about rightmost leftmost rightmost leftmost you just do it that does not rely on prefrontal quarter it is subconscious as it some times called but basically you do not have to use the parts of the brain theater involved in duration path and outcome type and halides in this particular study they examined brain activity inanorexex who are selecting different foods and as i mentioned earlier they have a hypericuity or awareness of which foods contain more or less calories than other foods and what the fat content of particular foods is in particular et camera they are doing all this while in a scanner and then they look at what sorts of brain areas are active after that task is done and what they found was really interesting what they found was that the dor lateral prefrontal u ten not surprisingly is involved in the decision making and the evaluation of this food which foods are going to be best to eat in this context which foods are going to be appropriate for at least that anorectics framework about what is okay to eat in what is not city and how much however there are areas often rain the were active after that decision making process and those of the brain areas that turn out to drive the habit of avoiding particular foods and approaching other foods and in that case it was not the dorsolateral prefrontal quartet it was an area of the brain called the dorsilateral stratum now the stratum is a big area in the brain it is involved in a lot o different things includes areas the caudate and putanum and i just want o mention as i throw out all these names you do not need to remember the names of these different structures there just there if you are interested in that level of detail but easily of a brain area and in er exist of or brain area that is involved in a valuating and decision making around food and then another brain area that is involved in the reflective consumption of particular foods and the reflects give avoidance of other foods you remember payback the beginning of the episode feel that was a long timagono when we talked about how you have these sorts of processes in the brain but there are always homeostatic and reward systems influencing this find of thing well in the brain of the anorexic it turns out that the reward systems have been attached to the execution of habits in a way that is unhealthy for bodyweight but at least from a purely neral circuit perspective the reward is now given this chemical reward in the brain is given for avoiding particular foods and only approaching these very lo carry lo fat foods the really does seem to be a flip in the switch in the anorexic brain that rewards them internally they feel good when they avoid certain foods and they approach others it is not a deprivation based model where they are coagulating themselves are masochistic or actively avoiding food in order to punish themselves which is interesting cause a lot of psychological theories support that idea rather once this transitions into a set of habits they are actually getting a sense of reward they feel good presume from the release of a different nerimodulator called dopamine by approaching foods that are low fat lo carry content and their whole brain circuitry is screwed toward avoiding particular things and they actually are rewarded for that and they feel good they feel better than if they were eating in a healthy weight supporting way now the dorsilateral stratum is structure that we should think about in a obit more depth it is p and of a set of circuits that are involved in what are called go logo tasks and i do not want to going to this in a lot of detail right now because it would take us too far down the rabbit hole of curl circuitry but basically in terms of behaviors we both have heliotype behaviors decision making reward base behaviors and we have habits that we learn and we acquire and then we just start to execute reflectively things walking things yawning when we are tired things taking a particular rout through the parking lot right we learn that the first time we go to a given parking lot of walk into a building but after that we tend to follow the exactsametragectory becomes very automatized it is just we just do it without thinking well the go logo circuitry is another aspect of our behavior where we both have to select behaviors to perform and we have to select behaviors to suppress and the anorexic brain seems to reward suppression of one set of behaviors ingestion of hickory foods and to reward focus or even hyperfocus and consumption of low fat lowcalory foods this homeostatic process that we learn about from high school onward that oh everything in your body is designed to keep everything in balance you stay awake firstborn meantime you want to sleep you do not eat for a while than you want to eat to maintain weight right eat too much than you ant to eat less those systems are disrupted and what beautiful about this work from the colombia group is that what it says is the place to intervene has to be the habit this stuff is already passed through all the learning its pass throughall the reward systems it is clearly not being overrun by the hemostatic processes the body there is very little body fat there is no lept in whatever neurons in the brain respond to lepta are starved for leptin periods of shut down sperm production and to stastrone is lowered bone density is down clearly this is overriding all those homeostatic processes all the signals that would say eat eat eat those do not matter in the brain of the anorexic the brain of the anorexic is just performing habits and there being rewarded for it when you come along and say look you should really eat this whole pie or this whole pizza you will feel better that is how she aversive to them since it appears to be a habit a reflex that is perpetuating the anorexic genotype as we say in science it is perpetuating anorexia in this individual and telling them about all this terrible stuff that is happening in the body will not work taking them away from all the images of thin people on line at camera that is not canal work what is going to work what is going to work is intervening in the curl circuitry that's related to the habit itself and turns out that there ways to do that how do you break a habit how toy rewire the brain circuitry that is literally c using a reflex and in this case causing a reflex that is killing the individual or at least leading to very bad health outcomes the way that you do that is through a connive mechanism where you teach the individual what is leading up to the habit this is low but similar to the way that somebody who suffers from a diction starts to put in different constraint type behaviors constraint type behaviors of the sorts of things were the alcoholic will call a hotel ahead of time and say listen i want the many bar am taken out of the room and want a television in the room et camera constraint type behaviors those are really ways of keeping oneself from the temptation but with these habits they work at such a subconscious level that what seems to work best is a commination of teaching the individual about their internal state and how to register their internal stay wat we call interception this ability of perceive your internal state that they can start to learn to associate the interactions with different types of food with the sorts of cues that are occurring within their body quickening of heart rate a hyperacidity of focus the we talked about earlier once they start to be able to notice that those things are happening then they can start to intervene let us talk about what those things are that lead into a habit because those to turn out to be the exact points of entry for changing and eliminating and rewiring habits toward more helped behaviors and i should highlight that this isn't just about rewiring habits for sake of the interexic these are also the same types of mechanisms that one would want to incorporate in order to rewire any habit of any kind their woman features of thinking that go in to the sorts of habits that interexics execute the first is something called weak central coherence weak sensual coherence is essentially an inability to see the forest through the trees it is a hyperacidity and focus on details within a given environment there is actually an interesting protest for anorexia that involves something akin to count of a wears wallow type a puzzle were an images put up a the one that i saw was one in which their their a big a ray of coffee beans actually they are all brown coffee beans and a and your job is to identify wear in that array of coffee beans there is a face and indeed there is a face embedded in there t looks little bit a coffee being but once you see it you realize its the face not a coffee being and it becomes very hard to not notice the face after that interexixs are very good at identifying the face they find it much faster then do non anorexics just really interesting right they somehow are able to home in on details and find those details and fixate on those details now eventually most if not all people find the face but once you do what you will find in whateverone finds is that you cannot find the face it just jumps out what essentially you have loss is the ability to see the whole picture because there some detail within that picture that your obsessed by this as kind of elements of obsessive compulsive disorder but its not really obsessive compulsive disorder person we call that weak central coherence it is ay hypericuity on one particular feature you miss the big picture the other is a challenge in set shifting that once you identify something that is of particular interest and that is driving some o f reward for the interexic that would be identifying the high fat foods or identifying the one food on the table that one could eat without any one hopefully noticing that their eating just the green being and not touching any of the other food if you ever had a meal with an ataraxic you might be familiar with is it is kind of uncomfortable to be around actually they go through a lot of elaborate procedures acorn of hide food to they'll sometimes even chew food hold it in their mouth and they go the bathroom and discard it things very elaborate very troubling types of things to hereabout in a be around but you will knows that they push food around their played a lot they become masterful actually at trying to keep peoples awareness away from what they are doing which is to home in on these low fat low carry foods and they cannot seem to set shift they cannot just relax and enjoy the meal because the meal for them is essentially this wares waldough or find the face in the coffee being task they are constantly monitoring how much people are observing them and trying to navigate this what would otherwise be a really pleasant circumstance for most people there try to navigate through this because remember for them the reward is in the avoidance of certain things and the acquiring of only the foods that there brain rewards them for because those of the foods that have been preselected in er now habit what is amazing and frankly also important are these findings that once you teach an eracixs what is happening to them that they are doing this they are able to intervene now they need support i and another form of therapy that seems to work well for anorexics that ideal is combined with this habit rewiring is a family based model family base models are trying to surface a lot now in various therapy settings there be base models in short are basically ware the entire family is made aware of the individuals challenges with a particular eating disorder or other disorder and in understanding some of the biology and psychology around it they stop condemning the individual they start to support that individual through a being them towards their own habits that they observe they give them some autonomy they realize that none of this changes overnight but they are taught about things natural plasticity and the ability to change one's brain in response to experience and there is a whole internal support network now for people that live alone this is not available to them this is not the kind thing that you share with your to workers you might involve a close friend er or a spouse but it is not the sort of thing that people that do not give in a family contact i can really benefit from all of these things fall under the umbrella of connive behavior therapy and i should mention that connive behavioral therapies are often done in conjunction with pharmacologic therapies i think that there's this idea of there that its either or when often its both cognize behavioral therapies are often combined with this habit recognition an read rewiring approach which is starting to become more an more common and i think the date on it look really good that especially when individuals are taught this early in adolescence that there are positive outcomes over time the relapse rate of interest is quite high about fifty per cent of individuals were relapse at some point often trigger by stressful circumstance but the commination of cognac behavioraltherapy that includes this family model or at least habit reformation seems to be fairly effective and at present might be chemist effective treatment now there are additional treatments starting to surface and that takes us into the realm of chemical treatments for anorexia and i just want to mention that there are clinical trials meaning legal clinical trials being done at john'shopkin school medicine by matter johns and others exploring how drugs m i ma which increases opening and serotonin to very high levels or sylocibon call magic mushrooms which increases ceratonan and other compounds to very high levels within the confines of a professionally supported therapeutic environment can help people rewire their brain such that they can get relief from major depression and various forms of aroma and now eating disorders are also being explored in the contact of m drama and sylisibon clinical trials i do want to emphasize that those are clinical trials the those compounds are not yet legal and in many cases most cases they are still illegal i do not think that they should be explored without a properly trained medical doctor that the clinical trials are essential to complete before one explores those compounds in particular because lately i get a lot of females about these compounds people telling me that they had amazing experiences and relief from various things not just eating disorders but depression et camera however i get an equal number of males from people saying that they worked with some self appointed guide this would be outside the clinical trials i was referring to and they are now experiencing chronic visual snow their getting genuine visual field deposits they are havering tics that they never had before they have chronic and sonic i am not passing judgment on any of these compounds are the people that are doing this sort of thing i just want to see the clinical data and i do believe that we should wait until these clinical trials are done before people start approaching the stuff and that is because they are serious come ounce they can open plasticity but whether not they work quotenquo for different types of eating disorders or depression in drama the date are looking promising but that the clinical trials are still not done and i know a number of people are going out of the you ask into other countries where the stuff is being done om more regularly and there too have gotten reports back of people doing called ibogain treatments some of you who are familiar with eating disorders will immediately be asking what what about abigail does it work does i work well the clinical trials in this country are not complete a have heard evidence direct have heard directly from people who have benefited from these sorts of things for treatment of eating disorders but have also heard of people that have developed chronic seizure disorders from pursuing things abigail for the treatment of eating disorders again ism not passing judgment i would dislike to see more data and it is very important that the safety a a aspects of safety be in place say this is defiling not something to get renegade about it appears that once intersex as established that habit breaking through self awareness of what the habits or is going to be a primary entry point that might seem kind of trivial you might say country have just told us that in one sentence but i want to return us to this model about homeostatic processes reward processes et camera that leads us to a place where the short answer is no you cannot simply say break the habit an individual needs to be informed about where that habit comes from in the fact that what currently seems a rewarded habit should actually be a punished habit now i do not mean by actual punishment but what i mean is within the brain there is been a switch and the anorexic needs to learn that there is been a switch such that what should be rewarding is now punished and what should be punish starvation is now rewarded the beauty of being a human being is that knowledge of knowledge can allow you to make better decisions it'll say that again the beauty of being a human being is that knowledge of knowledge can allow you to make better decisions now of course when we are anxious when we are tired when we are intoxicated we have less access to that ability to use knowledge of knowledge to intervene the anorexic will often do things that are in keeping with their habits such as overexercising this is of area that any one whose treated anorexics are interacted with anorexics is well aware of that they are constantly moving there constantly on the treadmill their constantly running they always want to be moving in burning calories that they can feel okay about interacting with food or because they have the distorted body image well does breaking a habit mean that they should stop moving around and exercising no not necessarily there some really interesting studies that show that shifting anger exits towards activities that for instance build muscle resistance training and allow them to eat a bit more food without necessarily losing wight but rather to put more muscle on their body can actually be beneficial not ism not talking about inter exits becoming body builders as a whole body dimorphic associate with body building but certain forms of exercise are just catabolic meaning they break down the amount of muscle they reduce body weight over all other types of exercises resistance training or anabolic they allow muscle to be put on and there some interesting studies not not a lot but some interesting studies trying to encourage anterecics not to stop exercising but rather to stop exercising in this ceramic catabolic way of breaking one self down but rather getting them shifted toward breaking habits of only approaching locator loft foods while also encouraging them to embark on resistance training and to start to learn and reward the relationship between exercise forsake of making one's body strong including the bones not just the muscles but the bones which is important especially in interexixs and then to see food as a weigh to nourish that process to building a body that could be of the stable weight hopefully the once the inter exit is of a healthy weight that their maintaining that weight but that they do not have to constantly beyond this tread mill no unintended of balancing whatever food in take they have with activity and along the lines of that during the episode on fat loss and metabolism as well i talked about this neat and non exercise induce their agenesis where people who tend to be thin tend to balance around a lot their kind of fidgety and that burns thousands of calories a day anywhere from eight hundred two thousand calories a day that can be beneficial for the folks that are overweight and want and have a healthy mind set about food but are trying to lose weight and they it turns out to bite literally fidgeting and bouncing round this the am doing this looks ridiculous you actually burn a lot of of body fat and calories that way provide you a in a coucolorctefpisit you your burn body fat because body fat is not jobs to passive tissue it actually receives input from neurons that release nor adrenaline an adrenaline and this neat ah has been described for several decades now and it actually as a pretty terrific weigh to burn off more calories with the inter exit you acute want to encourage them to not constantly be trying to burn off calories that can be very challenging shifting them toward activities weight bearing activities or resistance training that promote this more anabolic type of relationship to activity as suppose a catabolic can be beneficial before we move on to talking about ballerina and some related disorders when i talk about an aspect of anorexia that is very interesting quite troubling in fact but that has received a lot of attention and that is that distorted elf image now an that episode on depression we talked about a very powerful aspect of major depression which is this antisera confabulation the people who are depressed seem to genuinely believe and even confabulate about the fact that they are performing poorly in life and that they are no good or car worthless et camera it is literally a lie that they believe and their statements and their feelings in their behaviors start to reflect that lie they are not conscious of it that is what we call a confabulation anorexics often will see themselves as overweight or imperfect in ways that are of an obsession for them they will think o their arms are a little bit fat or the contour their face makes they do not the pictures of themselves are they what ism describing here is actually pretty typical behavior of a lot of people and how many people do that after you take a picture of them they say can i see the picture and then they tell you that you have to throw it away that does not as only mean their anorexic are their suffering from some sort of disorder that just means that there human being that cares about how they appear in the world we are not here to judge that in the case of the anorexic the problem seems to be that they have a genuine distortion of their self image much that they do not actually see themselves accurately their visual perceptions are off and the reason we know this ares because of some really important and beautiful studies that were done you might colic germany balanson's lab at stamphord he is in thedepartment of communications he is actually collaborated with a doctor halpurn that i mentioned earlier what is really interesting about these studies is they give us a window into the perceptual defect that anorexics have have usually done one of these experiments i ism fortunate to not be anorexic but have done some work with the hear lab over there and what you get to do as you get to a just this avatar of yourself to the point where you think it is as accurate is possibly y u be and anorexics really distort this avatar another words they create this serious mismatch between their perception of themselves and the reality indeed it does seem to be the case now what is relieving or i should say what is encouraging about some of the therapies that we talked about before the family base model the compony behavior old treatments yes and the drug treatments as well but this habit intervention model is that as one starts to shift those things it does appear that the perception of self seems to follow that the perception myself seems to shift along with the change in habits and that is a relief least i find that reassuring because changing one's perception is actually very hard as somebody whose work almost as entire career on visual perception and related things the perceptual apparatus of the brain are not very amenable to hero plastic man they do not change that easily whereas it appears that the circuitry that is related to habit formation and decision making and reward circuitry that stuff can be required and interecics as they progress at of their antarctic state into one which they are intervening in their reflexes gaining better habits around food eating more more accurately accessing foods and and environments that there in related to food as they change their behavior and they start to put on healthy weight may be their also doing the sorts of exercises that allow them to put on healthy weight and avoiding kind of extreme exercises of capitalism in breaking themselves down they also manage to somehow just as a consequence of all that rewire their perception of self it does not seem that chuck trying to tells when omigosheer thin oureallyn to eat that does not seem to work they just do not see themselves the same way that you see them and i offer that as a as a point of consideration if one that santerecic or if you look in an anterecti can you think how is it that they are still critical of the small even non exist in amount a body fat on their triceps or something how is that well it is literally that their brain as it relates to perception visual perceptions in particular at they are completely off and fortunately by changing habits you rewire those circuits as well o case let us talk about ballerina which is overeating and then purging on typically by self induce vomiting or by ingestion of laxatives sometimes also in concert with people taking stimulants and fat burners a overingestion of stimulate to try and burn off more energy and then we will also talk about inviting disorder which has a lot of the same features as ballerina but typically no purging not in e list off all the clinical criteria that would allow some one to be diagnosed as bellman or been getting disorder but the general features are that they ingest far more calories than they need am anywhere from ten to thirty times their daily chlordan take oftentimes within a two hour period which is just a staggering amount of food and nutrients in a short period of time oftentimes they overriding those mechanical signals from the body that their full am it is a really troubling thing to think about but people are literally gorging themselves with food is looks a lot a laboratory animal that has these agar peer on stimulated these neurons that will eat until they almost burst or burst you wonder is that these agar generous that are active almost certainly yes that there involved although i do not think that that is going to be the major point of intervention patch were going to talk about other times of interventions their number of clinical criteria for insane if somebody has one of these binges once a year does that make them bulimic gently no am but i certainly do not recommend people do this a if you are one of these people who has call cheat days right i some of you may be familiar with cheat days think there will less common now but the ideas you eat clean for six days or five days a week or two weeks and then you have a call cheat day where you dustcutting go wild and eat whatever you wanting whatever volumes is that ballerina e has some of the contour of of ballerina if you're vomiting afterwards or benjeating disorder if you are not does it constitute full blown ballet are nine disorder it is pretty hard to say a the criteria that were described to me is that if somebody's doing this at least once a month over a period of anywhere from two to three months than it likely would qualify and i certainly know people who do these cheat days and a by those criteria they have something benjeating disorder but in general one of the hallmark features of premium binding disorder is that people are unable to control their eating they are just simply they are not making the decision to have a cheat day they're not making the decision to overeat they are simply driven from the inside without question by way of nerd circuitry they are driven from the inside to unjust far more food then they need and in some cases then they would want to eat it is a lot the habit that we described for anorexia it is almost its turned into a relax once they get going all the homeostatic signals are being overridden all the signals from the body the leapt in the insulin the glue costs all that stuff is cosmically sky high and yet they are just what we beyond the the nerves i call hyperphagia there just eating crazy what is going on there well there been a lot of ideas about why the surprises there is the called thyroid harmony hypothesis that ones a tricky one it turns out that cortex all and third harmony concentrations very according to wen the binge purge happened there were some studies that looked at thirst harmony levels and they found elevated third harmony levels third harmony is involved in metabolism a and not just the burning of energy but the use of energy in converting into different tissues of the body cartilage bone ah that muscle et camera i did whole episode on hayward and growthormon by the way for interested in learning more about third t harmony but third harmony can also be depleted at other phases of the beige were cycle now without listening off all the terrible things that happen with this bend per cycle it there are a number of things that are that are really a worth pointing out one is that the vomiting itself the use of laxatives that can cause severe disruption to the a mucosa lining the mutts lining of the digestive tract can severely disrupt the got mycrobyon it can cause all sorts of e in a ulceration of the a esophagus and it just really terrible stuff a there is a lot of shame associated with ballerina a oftentimes because people are vomiting and its hard to hide that vomiting behavior a people are aware of it there some social isolation see recall from the beginning it does not appear that sexual drama s are prerequisite for balemialthough sometimes it can occur the the hallmarked feature of ballerina the distinguishes it from anorexia aside from the fact that is over eating as supposed to under eating is a lack of what they call in history control and that might come its no surprise a but first of all am the balletic unlike the anorexic is hyper impulsive and oftentimes has other types of impulse behaviors they might have a little bit of alcohol and then start to eat crazy or as normally there very restrictive that is a common feature of of ballerina sometimes they over in just alcohol during these binges sometimes they are sexually promiscuous not always but theta a general issue with satiety once they start eating and with impulse controlled generally and for that reason many of the treatments that you see for ballerina and inviting disorder are the sorts of treatments that do not seem to work well or at least most of the time for anorexia the drugs that increased the narmodulator ceretonan for instance flexitime also call prosaic pail et camera those things oftentimes can be effective in ballerina some of the drugs that are used to treat attention deficit hyper activity disorder in titer topic that were going to talk about in depth here on the on bassoon a some of those same drugs at a a a viveants and things of that sort can also be used to treat ballerina been getting disorder why would that work well now you are familiar withe prefrontal quarter you nobly no more about prefrontal quarter than you ever wanted to a just from this episode preform the quarters as involved in this analysis of duration path an outcome duration path and outcome is how we avoid impulsivity it is how we think ora if this than that if that than this you can imagine how for the obsessive compulsive or for the a anorexic these are circuits that are over active for the balletic this is the circuit that is going to essentially be underactive and is under conditions were they think ow i should not eat anything i should eat anything and then they just care the fregerator open and plot through that and then at that point their ploughing through the covers and then their ordering food and then their feeling horrible about themselves their defend to be the cycles of binman purge followed by feelings of real shame because they just cannot control their behavior and what is more embarrassing than not being able to control one's behavior as an adult or as a young adult really the polar opposite of what we in anterrexia this lack of impulsivity implies a lack of forefront or control what we call top down control why d we call top down because the prefrontal quartics is suppressing the activity of deeper limbic and hypothalamic circuitry and things of that sort any time you feel you want to say something really a offensive a and you do not that is top down control it's your prefrontal vortex any time some one says something in you but our tooth port outrank anything grittingyourteeth as topcontrol oke ah when you explode or first er say the wrong thing or say the thing that you should say or shoo the thing you should do that is lack of prefrontal control and indeed people have a front temporal dimension do to aging or a head injuries see this lot an a people play sports to get a front frontal damage am they become more impulsive bollix have an issue with impulsivity a and therefore drugs that can increase certonan and sometimes these drugs that increase dopamine and adrenalin also caught apinefron will increase the tone as we call it the dopominergic tone or the foreman its called adronergic but norepinefron levels in the brain allow for more lowdown control and that is also why they're used to treat et h t an intention office disorder they tend to create a hyperfocus they tend to push the brain in these drugs ten to create hyperofocus intend to push the brain and general mode of processing into one in which you think if this than that if this than that anticipating outcomes and for that reason drugs well button bropriron which is an anti to present which mainly increases the amount of dopamine and norepinefron and less serotonin that can also be effective for certain types of binging disorder is actually used to treat smoking to for promoting smoking cessation and for depression but also for certain forms of obesity related to inviting disorder and the date are pretty good and their time release forms of this and noontime release forms and i think am you have to consult with u sychatris in order to get these prescribe because they are prescription drugs but it is a very different constellation of neurochamicls and brain areas and and approaches for bohemian the treatment of binjidin disorder has been explored from a new standpoint recently and that is the work of this now sadly former colleague of mine a doctor case halpurn who at at universe pennsylvania a they mentioned earlier they are using deep brain stimulation in order to treat inviting disorder now why deep brain stimulation well work from doctor halpurn and others while at stamford showed that their are particular patterns of brain activity in both the forefront of quarter but also in an area of the rain called the nucleus current very important and a very relevant area of the brain in this contact and in any discussion about motivated behaviors of any kind feeding sex drug a drug rule behavior people exercise compulsively the nucleus accumbent is in a on going dialogue with the prefrontal quarter and the nucleus accumbent has no mind of its own but it is associate with dopamine release its part of this a called reward pathway and what doctor halpurn and colleagues discovered is that their particular patterns of activity that ripple through the brain through these prefrontal networks and through this nucleus accumbent area those areas are connected a it is called delta oscillations meltage is being a particular frequency of electrical activity for you pysionatas is one for hearts activity ah but in any case those felt oscillations in the nuclear accumbent are associate with food reward in both mice and humans somehow this revelatory activity creates a perception in the individual that food is here re rewarding that is interesting and as allowed them to use a targeted deep brain stimulation approach to treat injecting disorder and this deep brain stimulation is appearing to be a effective treatment their still more studies that need to be done actually if you think you have beenjeating disorder you can find the criteria for that and you could contact doctor halpurn he is as i mention is moving to universe pennsylvania they are recruiting patient through these studies all the time the studies are fairly invasive they involve a leftie approved a approach of literally placing a wire down into an area of the brain that a and allows the individual to stimulate a particular brainarea to offset some of these activity patterns that lead to a elevated sense of reward from food and injecting and the data look really promising now i realize that the very inventive approach not everybody is going to be a willing to have this wire inserted into the brain but for pool that suffer from injecting disorder this is a great and very exciting potential treatment because what i did tell you is that many people have injecting disorder are obese to the point where their health is greatly at risk now obesity causes all sorts of shifts in the dialogue between the brain and body some of which you'll recognize from earlier in the discussion for instance lept in signaling is disruptive of the fat there is lots of body fat but even though that bodyfat is secreting this hormone leapt in in that signal should shut down the desire to eat the receptors to leptin in the brain or totally screwed up and the signal to eat is there but the signal to stop eating is not there soganiav an accelerator n or break in its lie the accelerator is always pushed down some these brains ti mutation approaches seem to be able to by pass some of that and of course their all the metabolic centrums in the problems with having excess levels of body fat things insolent resist once type to diabetes i mean as am disturbing as is to hear a there are many individuals action know some who a are obis that they start getting bodily sores they they are not just bed forces but they have a a skin sores that are very disruptive to them they do not having these sores om an in addition to that they can get puerperal neropathies because their because of some of these metabolic issues there not eating enough a utilization of of the neutreence in the tissue because a the way that insolent is disrupted insolence in long they act my have to have certain portions of their limbs amputated and yet they continue to overeat this is not an issue of self control that a can easily be dealt with simply by telling the person look you have to stop eating or your going to die or you can have your legs amputated with inertia there is there is a distortion in the relationship to food but the homeostatic and the reward aspects are disrupted unlike inertia where it seems to be a habit based mechanism with collegia and ingesting disorder something deep within the naval circuitry is causing food to be hyper attractive and the break is off if you want develop some empathy for what these people are dealing with consider this it is driving a car you get on to a grade may but ten or fifteen a degree grade in your heading down and you figure well you will dispute the breaks ta little bit but there is no break rights you stare going faster and faster and faster and your only choices to use the accelerator r just a coast through it that is a century what is happening to these normal circuits the work of doctor halpurn and others i think is really exciting and even though it is highly invasive i think is going to lead to not just a some relief for the patients that do get that debate stimulation but also the identification of what sorts of receptors are present in those brain areas that could help what that means is that once we understand which brain areas are involved into disorder and we understand what receptors those brainareas express then there can start to be additional interventions by way of none invasive treatments things drug treatments due behavioral intervention's work for collegia in some cases yes provided that those interventions are done early enough regardless behavioral interventions coupled with drug based interventions are always more effective than either one alone fortunately there is a a decent sized kit of drugs that can help with bellemia i mention some of them before things proper on well burin some of the ceretonurgic drugs and some the drugs used to treat impulsivity we have on the one hand anorexia which seems to be a destruction in habit and a coupling of unhealthy habits in this case food restriction to the reward pathway and on the lipide we have beenjeating disorder and collegia where a very unhealthy habit of gorging oneself with food sometimes followed my purging is not necessarily couple to reward they feel terrible when they do that right the intersect it feels great about restricting their food in take they feel their winning some sort of game the circuitry is flip somehow that way with bulimia they feel horrible about the fact that their binging there is intense shame they cannot control themselves the reward is set up before the behavior the reward is set up in drawing them to food and in making food look something that is incredibly appetizing and there is no impulse break there is no way for them to stop that kind of behavior really kind of troubling thing to think about i on either case i think for those of us that no anterecxic sort of observed anorexia its hard to see somebody starve themselves to near death or to death what what more could be on disturbing well equally disturbing is somebody who has an abundance of food and is gorging themselves and then feels terrible about it a these are heavy topics an these are topics that frankly know one really wants to talk about unless they know someone who suffering from them or they themselves suffer from them what have tried to do to day is try and give you a window into what really underlies these things that we call eating disorders i hope have done that at the level of biology nerd circuitry mechanism ante chronology and some of the psychology as with any episode o this podcast but especially in this month where we are talking about mental health issues in mental health disorders behavioral disorders there is no way that i can exhaustively cover all the different forms of treatment you have the madly approach you have got all these different approaches to depression and to a interest et camera what have tried to do as give you a framework and in doing that have tried to give you a framework of understanding that also applies to this question that i think equally important and goes alongside the treatment of eating disorders is what in the world is healthy eating what in the world is a healthy relationship to food i to think that i have a healthy relationship to food i know the foods i i enjoy them there ten or fifteen foods in particular that i very much have mention of few of them on the podcast before a was sort of amused surprised and a a perplexed as to we for instance i do enjoy eating butter not in huge amounts but i do butter that seem to be pretty triggering for folks out there a a small selection of people decided that the ingestion of butter was a was a health concern look to me a investing butter in small quantities is something that ism comfortable with and my blood lipid profiles feel good they look good to me for other people that might not be the case for some people the idea of eating an animal based food is probably repulsive that it actually can make them feel physically sick and i think that we should be aware that that kind of mental phenotype exists ism not calling in a pathology for other people myself things butter an meat feel healthy now what quantities well i enjoy eating very much ism not shy about this have talked about in the podcast before enjoy eating some people have a very complicated relationship to food they do not think of it as nourishment they do not enjoy it socially it is distressful thing for them based on their personal history or maybe just general anxiety round food and i hope that in sharing this information about the fact that any time we approach food these neurons in our hin the arcuate are of our hypothalamus actually increase our levels of anxiety this is related to that point that doctor halpurn made which was that from an evolutionary standpoint it is advantageous to invest as much food as often as possible as quickly as possible we now know that to not be healthy in this age of abundance where calories are essentially everywhere and yet lot of people feel anxious in anticipation of a meal what could be useful to them well whether not they have needing disorder or not it is very clear that developing methods to calm oneself in the presence of any anxiety or fear inducing stimulus can be beneficial of talked about some of these and episodes relate distress things the physiological side two annals through the nose in a long entail things mindfulness meditation certainly can help there are data lot of studies out their showing that meditation practice can help people deal with eating related anxiety and disorders i think is a general rule trying to avoid approaching a meal are sitting down to eat ah in an anxious state is probably good idea but let us be realistic how often can we do that i think most of us are going to have circumstances where we are rushing around trying to just eat before we head out or get to a meal andthan we sit down and we find ourselves eating this is the one of the first times in human evolution where we mostly eat out of a desire to consume food not out of a neat for food most everybody could go a fairly long period of time just in jesting water and electrolytes and not them suggesting people do that but let us face it we largely eat nowadays because of a desire to eat not a need to eat and yet we need to eat on a fairly regular basis and no topic is more complicated and new ants then food and nutrition and in particulars it relates to eating disorder the major take always to day are we should all be asking the question what is healthy eating for us how do we develop a relationship to food that we can enjoy food hopefully both socially and on our own but that we are not nauraudic an compulsive about it for those of you that intermittent fast this also applies right what god forbid if you eat thirty minutes before your eating window starts what does that mean if it means something catastrophic you have an eating disorder i do not know m be e an anxiety disorder ah that is for you to explore ah if you do not manage to eat five meals a day and that is your obsession well then the same thing apple is these are questions that we can all ask ourselves to day we focus on the extremes of food related behaviors that really qualify is genuine disorders they are in the psychiatric manuals and they are diagnosable and and they are serious health concerns they are not just mentally troubling and concerning for the people suffering from them in the people round them but they are genuine health concerns just one to reiterate that anorectic nervous is the most deadly psychiatric disorder by a huge margin and if you look statistically at the number of people with eating disorders and that die of eating disorders it is not far off from the number of people that die from automobile accidents i know that that sounds e ridiculous number be can look this up this is particularly true in certain countries why that is we do not know but again this is noting new phenomenon this is not just related to ay body image issues that are created through social media media and as a final point on that many of you are probably asking what about plastic surgery what about all the steps that people are going to through excuse me to preen themselves and change themselves our people addicted to plastic surgery is that a form of body dismorphian indeed it is and we will do in episode on exercise related and plastic surgery related body dimorphic i think there is very little question that those types of disorders are clearly related to what were observing in social media and in media that this shift of for instance action heroes if you look at action heroes and the ladies there were very few men that were very large you had your terminate yet your stones in your short sniggers and a few others but the men in movies tended to be if they were muscular they were far more felt than they are now there is this kind of there is literally a hypertrophy of the imagery and likewise there is been hypertrophy of the female body shape as its persuade in the media there are body dismorphias that are related to those types of things and that relate to things plastic surgery steroid abuse diet drug abuse and on definitely important to think about and consider and definably deserving of its own episode you have learned a lot of narrow science to day i hope that was useful in thinking about these disorders and in thinking about other aspects of feeding and motivated behaviors i would love for you to take away this model that was handed off to me that i think is powerful for thinking about all sorts of things notorious eating but all kinds of behaviors and perceptions that you have one box for what you think one box for what you do and what is intervening between those why is it that you can n o better and not do better well it is because you also have to cope with these subconscious homeostatic possesses and reward prostessies and those oftentimes can be disrupted in ways that we find ourselves doing things that are not good for us are not good for other people but fortunately there is this great gift which is that knowledge of knowledge can allow you to do better without question and that knowledge of knowledge allowing you to do better over time leads to this incredible phenomenon called neral plostessity which essentially is translated into doing better over time even if difficult eventually makes doing better reflexive if your enjoying this podcast and learning

the bench parson ponder baexpressivepian protect our line privacy to day express veranda con flesh men in eighteen fifty nine a human it activist in henry to nans who later c found the red cross observed the aftermath of the battle of solferino between french pemontees and rusty and armies in northern italy whose shock by the treatment of wounded soldiers on the battle field he work diligently to bring together a variety of governments to sign on to a series of rule governing the treatment of captured and wounded soldiers sign in geneva an eighteen sixty four the use would become known as the first geneva conventions it to another eighty five years however before the world began to think about the treatment of civilians in war time in for at the german treatment of civilians during world war too the geneva conventions were expanded in nineteen forty nine to protect non combatants civilians this was accomplished in the fourth geneva convention designed to protect civilians by encouraging military actors to separate themselves from civilian populations the nineteen seventy seven edition protocols made clear the use of human shields was absolutely forbidden by the rules of war article twelve four states quote under no circumstances shall medical units be used in an attempt to shield military objectives from attack article fifty one seven states quote the presents or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be us to render certain points or areas immune from military operations in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield favor or impede military operations article eight two b of the nineteen ninety eight i c statutes has quote utilizing the presents of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points areas or military forces immune from military operations constitutes a war crime in international armed conflicts the purpose of outlawing human shields is perfectly obvious no country can be expected forego its military aims in order to protect civilians deliberately placed endanger by the enemy to immunize those who use human shields would incentive every one to take human shields which were then necessitate the death of more civilians in order to achieve military goals and yet the legacy media and the political left have been doing just that they know that compass has ben using human shields commas brags about it over the weaken is really defense forces discovered rocket launchers planted directly next to children pools and playgrounds can see the the children pilliausy rocket launchers located directly next to before rocket launchers utter directly located five meters from a children swimming pool is reason that they are doing this they also found rocket launchers located ti erectly next eightgian playground currently chassis preventing the evacuation of gossip civilians to the south of the god strip here is president of gaze admitting as much on tape s is good who sent us back we cannot reach the south on that is the first thing secondly there are cars ovattesa an do not allow you o go south we are between transitions between going out an staying here what can we do first of all wisent back in the northsays an idea officer another goes resident says lemme a c i cannot say the sent us back why cant set they will be killed the does the idea offsets but a lot o people left or the south an never came back the gowan residence hays they have cars that go around the to blocked away we do not have a car the dial officers hays have you seen or heard of this did you see or hear it got hays as talks about the schools talked about schools we are refugees in the schools commons is blocking people from leaving for the south now over the weekend is really force is struck an ambulance common immediately claimed that his real had been targeting the wounded the media then began to parrot this my here some the visit i can see these are awful pictures obviously well as it turns out the ambulance says has rails been used to transport terra which of course is well in line with compass practice in fact here state from twenty fourteen of come ass literally loading up an nebulas with terrace here it is ye can see it is areal footed try hes our terra fare leaving a house their arm is to go i p and they are getting on an ambulance is been long time practice and both to man sangria let bank the and in the bosses trip you e up up the ambulance has in order to transport specifically because they know that ten israel hits the ambullencs on world will pretend that is rats attempting to hit wounded meanwhile over the all shift hospital the home base for compasses military headquarters below which is likely stored hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel for use by terra the electricity is still on despite claims that the fuel has run out not only that large crowds of gazes have congregated around the hospital to cheer on footage of camass members firing on his rallies those against see that your seeing thousands of people watching a screen that is been put in place the electricity stolon is hit can see the is footage of come ass members firing on is really troops the giant crowd watching outside screaming alpha far you may notice the ages here is a old of young military age men who are standing outside right here predominantly and they are watching with full electricity available the tape of compass fighting israel and this is not shocking me ass not only keeps military headquarters under ground underneath hospitals it literally built one hospital the intonation hospital above terror in for structure it heard already built to capital off come of spent the week and attacking his daily troops as those is really troops where tempting to opening villain corridor from north to south the idea f was working to open the roads civilians could leave come ass began firing porters and antitank missiles of them the story here is actually very very simple israel wishes for reasons both moral and political to mini civilian casualties among gasman palisinian grabs come ass once more dead palisinian grabs the difference is why the idea has made twenty thousand phone calls dropped one point five million leaflets sens four point four million assumes and six million voice messages urging civilians in northern gaze to evacuate temporarily for their safety here you can see tape of them draping mass masses of leaflets and pamphlets telling people to leave the area when a is there dropping the sense huge palate of papers the a then are being air dropped on to cvilianarias telling people to lea ten the mooning downs an filling flow telling them to get out never in the history of war has something been done this in terms of warning civilians in this fashion net never has eight has one army opposing a military force send as many warnings two civilians to get out you literally cannot name another time the is happen no comas claims has some sixty five hundred female and child civilians have been killed thus far we haven't in verified any of those numbers because comas routine my lies about this sort of stuff comes advocates point of those numbers to suggest that israel is killing a dis proportionate number of civilians despite the fact that comas that wants them to kill the civilians in reality despite the insane situation i which israel finds itself israel is being asmaticulous in its use of military force as any military in human history but sake a few examples but s look down the road of history at least two million german civilians died during world war too at least three hundred fifty thousand were killed by strategic allied bombing up to eight hundred thousand cjapanese civilians died during world war too in the core an war estimates place caviling casualty numbers at one point to milia during the the atom war some three hundred sixty five thousand civilian stayed during the gulf war some between a thousand and two thousand civilians died at the hands allied forces during dato bombing of ugaslavia at least twelve hundred civilians were killed you mar member the merit was not attack before either of those last to engagements during the afghanistan war at least forty six thousand civilians died during the rock war those numbers were least two hundred thousand brakobama's drop war killed at least four hundred civilians his tibia war killed at ley six hundred the on uses may have killed several thousand civilians those are just wars involving he united states when it comes to military action in the maeleast more generally the numbers are astounding the studies have killed at least twenty thousand civilians in their bombing campaign an common wat least eighty five thousand children have died wit starvation during that conflict in syria at least three hundred thousand civilian to died at least twelve million people have been displace tpackastan right now is this moment deporting some one points have million affgancivilians not becaresabout any of that there's not be a single protest about any of that no one cares however hundreds of thousands millions nay billions of protests seem to care about the news even though the news are overtly attempting to avoid civilian casualties whilcomasies as many dad palistinian grabs as possible and yet the media continued pretend the comas is not to blame for civilians being killed that israel somehow has the magical undisclosed civility to kill terrorists without killing the civilians that terret use as their shields they have the hurry potter ability to cast spells that just killed the badges here is burn standers idiotically expressing just that idea were set his israel at destroy hamate post attack iris an instant to teliantan israel with out at herding killing and assent man wan man an cheltran when a hamate is hiding behind them and putting than an danger how does that work ran that is the exactly we right question t yes the military express which i am not one why clearly yo they ha is was a right to and e you mas as one that is what is noise the coin is re they got a dew with that why the got o beyond chatter way then killing thousand o men weren't chose a once again he immediate concern is you got u how the cops in the blooming that this amazing sufromburney sanders there openly saying that he as no idea what is really y supposed to do that he is not military man but he knows there has to be this very reminiscent of when jobidening company talk about police taking on advising to and to shoot him in the leg if you do not what the holier talking about this sounds good but if you do you sound the sounds a moron his burnesanders is in fact a moron because he has always been a moron this my at is really somehow being indiscriminate in its use of military forcemeat they have secretly a better way of just killing terra but not killing any one else well the thing is that that fury justifies everything up to an including the general octombersome of the tacks that is the point to create a retroactive justification for those attacks in the public mind if the news are the kinds of people who drop boys on grand babies just for fund then what is the big deal the compass shot babies directly in the face and rate their mothers before murdering them that is the case being made by the congress women from comasrocy to leap who spent the weaken defending commies genocidal slogans she treated out quote from the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom human rights and peaceful to existence not death destruction or hate this of course is a l from the river to the sea meaning jordan river to the mediterranean sea palatine must be free is a slogan about freedom in the same way that the nose slogan a bat much fry was about encouragement to work expect work makes free what hassle went those the of the sign over oushfitz the only side currently advocating genocide is the palestine inside of course it does not take much to get palisinian advocates to admit as much here for example was the palisinan ambassador to the cha explaining this weaken he would not condemn comastetrocities at all palsinian authority has not condemned mamas atequetly and to at tore stave attack and you want to clear the air and clearly condemned the attack and comas to day no i want to clear the else tessofon at the pakistan of the as not a the present poison an people also the piano its the pristine the petition on the position to

those o unit tin the consequences the tin cousin in sent because the almost far thousand a children i want to also clue of venison de this is de liberate and this has been is envy in the the cencsence its establishment yoga he is a liar and in evil human being he is literally saying that he will not condemn a compass massacre of innocence and then justifying that by claiming that israel is gardening's millions which is a lie again the only way to justify comes evil is to accuse israel of similar evil which is precisely what rachieta to leave is doing shoed put out an ad targeting jobidon is suggesting that he is supporting a genocide we stand with sire this is reshetesleap add of corsuggesting that israel is targeting civilian and that she shows much protest no piece on stolen

genesis and we tat that for an lav a but i is iris on a i want to thank pigeon baron or uni and the ad continues for wile than finally she just concludes by accusing hoiden of she she literally is putting in her own ad people chancing for the destruction of the take of israel and then claiming that israel is pursuing genocide accompanied by hoiden here is the thing the got for those who support come is not in the end to truly convince everyone that israel is morally inferior to its opponents because that is not possible you cannot convince any one that any one is morally inferior to comas is to convince everyone that cousin israel are morally equivalent that israel is on compasses level as to justify comes atrocities in that game commas is most ardent advocates are joined by politically say but morally despicable figures barakobama brakobama spent the week end pretending the responsibility for oases evolve with leave well it win with everyone here he is with his fellow dolts over at pad save america you have to take in the whole truth and you then have to admit nobody hands er claim then all of us are complicit to some degree i look at this an i think back what could i have done during my presidency to move this forward as hard as i to have got the scars to prove it but there is a parole that still sang one was there something else i could have done that is the conversation we should be had that just looking backward but looking forward now of course mama himself is guilty his hands are not clean he handed billions of dollars to the protean terror recipe he allowed them to spread the cash and their terror all over the middle east from common to lebanon while simultaneously giving israel the back of his hand in tune twenty fourteen when a camps kidnapped an murdered three is railyteen natures including one america due citizen barakalbama said nothing for three weeks then finally called on israel for restraints heels to lady shipment to hell fire missiles israel in the middle of israel twenty fourteen war with camps then on his way out of office agama abstain from boding on yuan security council resolution rather than redoing it that resolution demanded that israel stop building in all of judasamaria and isjerusalem and cred an invent of structure for the boycott and t e vest movement from the state of israel as an is rally official see of the time quote virus ad ministration secretly cooked up with the palistinians an extreme entire is daily resolution behind israel back which would be a tail wind for terror an boycotts an effectively make the western wall occupied palistonian territory mama's hatred for israel was in fact the significant factor in building up both iron and camps leading to the catastrophe of october seventh yes barakabama does personally bear a share of responsibility that is how at he means he means that every one is responsible for october seventh which means that camps is not responsible it is a cycle of violent a morally relativistic cycle of island requiring israel concessions this is the judo sophisticate take it is the radical seek take it is re seated by nearly all of those in the legacy media including for example nicholas wrist all get to him and his idiocy in just one moment first we are facing a threat of another blooming government shut down later this month the administration will ultimately

my friends over at birchgalls wo gan the autos to fistikit take in the foreign policy establishment is moral equivalents moral for nicholas kristof as piece over the near times a truly awful piece in which he ad midst the quiet part out lad in than tostignors its the pieces title losing hope in the west bank he says when i was a lost run backpacking through the middaleast in nineteen eighty two i met two palistonian university students on a local bust an west bank we got to chatting invited me to their homes i jumped off the basin spent ta day with them in the jumble dallies of the densely populated dish refuge ye camp the a good time together they told me about their arabia studied o bathlaham university outmatching a scheme to study arabia myself an kilo we were all excited by education and full of youth and dreams i wrote their names in my addresbook we never made contact again until now after forty one years i dug up my oldaddressbook and found their names i wondered awe they still alive have they moved abroad what do they think of israel shaman and america they located them their till living in the same at refuge he camp he said was wonderful to see them again be our reunion was allay window into palistonian frustrations the world has changed much in for degas but while have travelled the world and had fulfilling career they remained stateless stuck in refuge e camp fearful of his really settlers and soldiers worse they have much less freedom to day than when i met them in nineteen eighty two none of this leads him to think for just one sane weight wait wat change in nineteen get two and two thousand twenty three one thing that changed is the handing over all these areas of the wetback to the palisonian authority the same palsinian authority nicholas kristov wishes had more authority in nineteen eighty two the alsonian authority had n were authority in the called wetback israel had military rule over the entirety and in fact as you conceive from the statistics if you happened to live in the palistonian areas of the wetback under the governments of the palsinan authority or significantly poor than if born is rally arab living israel proper which we literally know rally arab wishes to leave and move into palisinian governed areas it nicholas kristov ignores all of thapicis an undercut his argument is as back then they could travel easily around israel and find work there on week they could relax on his rely beaches are to drive to tell of yet for the ay macho told me now they live under a stifling system of check points and passes that make traveled difficult even within the west bank a the october seventh comas terrain attack has made everything worse why do you think that happened why do you think that happened because of terrorism because of the palsonian authority because of comas the cause of palistonian islamic jehad nicholas kristov admits that these two men these supposed moderates his friends engage in all of the worst blood bibles backs quote when the conversation did touch on politics we frustrated each other they were certain that they explosion at gasps all ockhley arab hospital was a deliberate attack by israel we know that not true we literally know it it was a palstoniana's lomitcihadraket the fell on the hospital the conversation says ripstop became more tents when he got to the commas attack of october seventh quote people were happy all over the arab world not because of the wellington bloodshed but because it was the first time the gazes could achieve their dream of leaving gaze said one of them kristov said i push back and noted how ball comas terrain had been and how many is really civilians have ben captor killed salt and machmud said they corned the frailly deaths but wondered why the world was not equally outrage the palistinians had ben killed in cumulatively greater numbers they were disappointed by my focus on compasses barbarism we are not trouble makers they said we just want to live freely everyone else in the world i well clearly not since what your actually want is to destroy the state of israel and you side with comose sold there is that but nicholas christophic nor all of that in favor of moral equivalents all of this moral equivalents needs to violent comas knows all that has to do its get enough pallisini grabs killed in order to survive and preserve it'll the passing an authority by the way now the same thing terrorist know they're allies in the media in political circle to do their dirty work for them that is why they are brazen on the streets of our major cities they say the quiet part out loud all the damn time they know surisophisticats will part them we will down play their sins we will treat them as brave emissaries of a revolutionary cast they are freest pursue whatever evil they want because of their allies in the media because of their allies in politics and they do pursue those evils and more people die in just a second we will get to the streets of the west is re now dominated thy were dominated over the week end by hundreds of thousands of people where actively rooting for comas in actual honest godgennicidald do hating

west should be afraid because the west has been completely taken over completely and utterly taken over by enormous swathes of people who hate the west atleshhas been honeycombed most obvious example comes in onion hundreds a hundred thousand people maybe showed up in onion in relation to a pro compass rally bout eleven people were arrested but the footage shows fireworks being launched at the police it shows brutish flags being yanked down it shows it shows every monument in long in basically being taken over and by the way how do we know that in infatuation has taken place because apparently a police adviser one of the police advisers to the metropolitan police a person named aticmalike who cares the official advisryboard for scotland yard was leading the chance of from the river to the seat again the sit the a person who literally works with the met police he is an adviser to the cops and here he is chancing the genecitle slogan from the river to the sea ha a ha waaawha to yo o a no no a no a wanna way what to what o no a a a that is an adviser to the cops at the met police chancing that genecitle slogan here they were taking over trofalgar square y can see them raising the palestinian flag on the on the tube underground signs you can see them climbing on the fountains introfalgar square a gain look to the size of this crowd he is are all comaspans because those the people they are protesting in favor of member these protest began before israel as he ben doing anything in the gossistrip there done in response to literately to compass people are climbing the fountains introfalgars will wear the cops where the police they have any control of their streets over there and the all partan parcel of a radical series of protest that began across the world in twenty twenty when for interjectional coalition the gecolan eyes coalition hat was design to torrid part the west and western liberals are two blind to see that that coalition rides yet the battle way this coalitions been riding aether since the sixties pretending that this is something new is ridiculous the black panthers were standing up for palistonian terror back in the sixties there is nothing new under the sun mean while fireworks ore being fired at the cops introfalgar square as well just do can themshuing fireworks into the air some them wore shot at cops protesters shut down whitewall in great brain as well is i walking down some the most story streets of onion taking over the streets is a lot of people wo love terrace that is foreshore on the tube chance broke out of a from the river to the sea apparently people being harassed inside the subways as well e man what there is only one solution into fight a revolution ins fight by the ways a violent uprising the the people calling for violence in the center of onion is what they are and and lest you believe that these people are they do not commas not that they are really really compass one counter protestor showed up wit they sin the said compass is terrorist that time was promptly ripe down who's promptly assaulted by the crowd because of course they compass they are fully in favor of compass and it it would be very easy to make the cays there commas is really bad and to free the palcinans o require the comas surrender but no one's doing that have notice zero people no one is clamming compass should go away there all in love comas they are fine with compass pretending otherwise ignoring the evidence your own eyes and ears the sky sign ended up on the ground and at being torn apart by the crowd and just incase you do not believe me protestors we are bragging about compass there are a her some the protestors in onion amass the was e costa terra organization you think the you case by the on decision of course its no camps the derris its thamedica the derris no and that is titis terms em bahamas i amenities era we i they a freedom tithe no derris a the media prate to be o they their free that not the medius portraying them me sure they war go procameras to literally shoot children in the face the forty five men of idiot that is been seen by virtually no one far the the actual snuff thicko that was made by the compass terrace is egregious and unwatchable that almost no one can watching and does contain video of compass derris confronting small children were in dishy pajamas and then shooting them to erectly in the head if those people according to these people are not terra or s misunderstood what ad the send with wile the ended with the next morning they there is a monument called the senator in the center of onion it is supposed to be a warmemorial for the wars head in triton worlds words one and then eventually world for too it was decorated with a a bunch of it was decorate with the bunch of reeds and how the protestors made sure to take those deaths andthrow them on the ground because this is what they actually think of the weskit is not just bout israel about you it is anyone who belies in western values is their enemy it is why you heard that protestor a second go saying america is terrorist weresmblee ducats terrorist e meet ha not ta and they knocks reaches down by the way brutish police officers during this protest we are removing brutish flags from the streets their re counts of protestors wo shut up whoring military uniforms veterans presumably they show with brutish flags in the police told them you need to take away your brutish flags was not to offend the barbarians who are supporting comas the er oysters o giant s a i huge was s o r eland yet when ma a hundreds o hots thee flags you on have word re changes es re a there it is there is the see there is way more of them than there are of us that is the end of it the end of it is they are way more

protestors have gathered to call for a sees fire in washington you c as in as well as an other capital cities around the club and the are doing exactly the same things the you're seeing from protestors all over the world to firstvolly should see the size of the crowd it is enormous obviously huge huge crowd and not only that they were doing all the same things that you would expect from a huge procomass crowd for example hey ware to facing america monuments ring up to america monuments spray painting them decorating them with palistinian flags his to be a statue of am general perishing who is he general of the allied forces on will were one this would be a a a guy dress a terrorist whose attempting to a stands up on a statue of the arevolitiary founder here is som terrors who've a people dressing tears who have put palstinian flags in the hands of war monuments and on revolutionaries there there professing avidin gaze three gaze people covering their faces the have decorated ben franklin with the palistinian flag which i would be kind of astonishing i think the founders here they are what putting to few the terror symbol on benfranklin hard thing of anyone would be less in favor of the few than then ben franklin but does not matter where the cops by the way where the police this person of cops has at covered his face these are the people walking your streetsvokes these o the people in america many of them imported many of them left wing allies this is the coalition the coalition of people who hate western civilization an which to see it turndown and there just using the latest convenient excuse which is israel procomass protestors were chanting we do not want to state we want forty eight which is to say forty it was the stabishmen of the state of his real thy want that reversed again they just say all the quit parts out loud and then wait for suit sophisticates nick kristov or mass freedmen or barakobama to pretend moral equivalents i mean after all

calculus what soever he i the goes is imide in at your staff demands a ceasefire here are all federal staffers and these a congressional staffers all of whom are standing with commons yes should you be concerned about the west falling absolutely since all of the people who'd see it fall are our backing all this the goodness is they have many very intelligent people on their side speaking to the crowd including mackelmore then that is the thriftshop guy has not o anything sense there the for ti ti her t a i her of i see e a wort waif tie an e an the an ma to is they told me tie why they to me pyretic t s to i that ti tit i to e ta en i to en late e retie i oh he knows enough that it is a genocide me despite fact to dis clearly not a genocide he knows enough to note to genocide also i have to say that it seems we have now reached a point where if all if if it if it walks lie an antisemite and it is walks an antisemite it is probably in antisemite flash back to twenty fourteen it is what makelmore dressed up as in order to supposedly avoid the crowd he dressed up as a derstermere looking new long hook know beard hes did this are concern hours ripped on it at they had now's an mistake who just t it was it was in accident i i i have doubts now have some retro active doubts meanwhile the question is really in practical terms how much pressure can be brought on the by administration to push for some sort of thee seas for by what on is now pushing for a seaside which demonstrates exactly who wants to sense fire the answer as come ass here is deputy national secure master john miners angles and we disagreed the pressure campaign against bind well there can have to now have jasmine here the present has been under growing pressure from democrats here at home to do more and the fighting i seen protest as well probably the harshness is consent proceeded to leave a must show which he put up on rid to a mobile an support of the channiside of the palimony an people the america people will not forget by and support a sense fire now or do not count on us in twenty twenty four i response all look we we strongly disagree o we with some of that wasting and with some the terms used to describe this conflict but what i will say i is we know that this is a conflict about which there are strong views a on all sides including in the united states including a frankly even i within the united states of a divide administration about a a the conduct of this conflict wont it maybe show done they should a kicked out the anti a miles from your coalition be you decided instead to humor them an put them on the cover of magazines and now your stuck with them and that is a real problem because it let us be real about this on a realistic level this conflict is not going to end tomorrow it is going to take israel time all people ware urging israel to rushier understand the more israel rushes more civilians did the more meticulously planned israel can do this the slower they go the fear civilians my the faster they go the more civilians negus they gan any war here in fact is a member of the idea of the idea of spokes person major thrown seamen saying this is going to take time idea soldiers are set to be closing in a goa city right a how soon e major do you expect the idea will conclude it is operation against a mas in goa i think will not that its can a take a a a great deal of time and the reason on saying that is as worker to be we army provided in formation to morrow by the way weeping to be providing more information i to you into your viewers you walking unit your chasing ta cars wat you just got at our soldiers and the were bulging at person with at you chase them enjoy going with civilians and we do not want ta shoot i to their civilians there you open the door at hookers and you seek two shouts from ground wet no one that you look on with shout they go down forty fifty feet under the ground to a wat that is a a property in order for us to succeeding e eliminating them and trying to provides least casualties of course on our she have the gotten toiling this is the rede we difficult operation since israelsing over and over were trying to reduce cavilling casualties n the met to being but we but but we are angry you that you are doing that si we do not believe you meanwhile the by administration continues to simultaneous my push the line that israel case find itself and also to push the line it israel us to do more in order to avoids filing casuals the cow and all recommendations well let all recommendations welcome here is twenty binman doing this retain over the weapon we to day about the clear the a olistinin billion in to s this the wort es got right to the pony against them all derris organization the tacit run and the heres to a wit about polities people or theryution this his the same light the mean of our country tat wat is is goal an dot its sampan old si a this real muss the every possible meter remensibilin a this sort of language is stupid because again the implication is that if it were not tony blink and pulling the chain that israel be going hog wild just killing palsinians killings willing silly which of course is untrue a mere peat for the thousandth time israel has complete air superiority in this region complete there is no air force in the gosistrip there is no air force to speak of in lebanon egypt is not interested n going to war with israel which means israel has will newly air power over the strip if they wish to kill hundreds of thousands millions o people they have the power to do it they are not doing that her going their own soldiers killed in order to protect palcinians millions and meanwhile you have the west pretending that it is the posit why again to re establish that moral equivalents and just a second when gun get to the twenty twenty four race jo bisons palling numbers are terrible the reason is poling numbers are terrible is not because of this current conflict it is more because when you set the world on fire people ton not the it very much first the holidays not only alow us to spend time with family they re minder of how important up

again if every election has have set a thousand times the right frenum on one of the two parties right now the refund mas on bison when the worlds on fire when everybody is looking at the news what they see is an economy that seems to be stagnating at least may be on the precipice when they look at world politics they see an on going stale mate an new crane they see a conflagration the a least that largely created by america iron policy they see proms with china and titan domestically they see tremendous descent they see serious gaps between how many america think about pity much every issue of life and then look at the president and they see a very elderly man who does not see able to keep it together and right now feel the poles it is reflecting all of this according to a brand new new york times pull which is panicking the hell out f democrats the results currently show hoiden losing two donate trump by margins between four and ten percentage points among registered voters in arizona georgia michingan evade and pennsylvania his had only in wisconsin by two per centare points in evade he is down ten fifty two to forty one show don eleven in michigan he is down five to trump forty eight forty three in georgia he is down six to trump forty nine forty three in pensylvania he is down forty trump forty eight forty four in arizona he is down forty nine forty forth trump in wisconsin he is up two what that means is that if the election were held to day and these pulls were right dona trumpwould win with in access of three hundred electoral votes every sentence of this new times sand poll is horrible mews for jobidon voters under thirty favor widen by only a single per centare point his lead among his banning voters is down to single digest his advantage an urban areas is half of trumps edging rural regions women still favor bison but men prefer trump by twice as large a margin lack voters are now registering twenty two per cent support for trump in these states that is a level unseen in presidential politic for republican in modern times in a remarkable sign of gradual racial regiment again this is the you times between the two parties the more verse the swing state the farther bison was behind he led only in the whitest of the six the world is falling part under bison since spence or whites of fifty three earl's electrical substation specialist an pennsylvania who supported biding an twenty twenty but switch back to trump i much ma that much rather see somebody i feel can be a positive roll model leader for the country but at least sending trump has his white about him another ominous sign for democrats his voters across all in comelovels fell bison's policies had hit them personally voters gave trump a seventeen points advantage having help them and biding an eighteen point disadvantage foraging hurt them seventy one n per cent of those poles had he was too old to be an effective president that is n pinion shared across every single demographic and geographic ruin the pole including fifty four per cent that people say the voting for bison a hes tool for the job only nineteen per cent of supporters of trump views to two old only thirty nine per cent of the electric over all feels the same sixty two per cent of voters say bison does not have the mental sharpness to be effective voters fifty nine to thirty seven said they better trusted trump over bison on the economy that is the largest gap on all issues that twenty two per cent positive margin for trump and by the way nearly twice as many voters says economic issues would determined their twenty twenty for vote compared with social issues a portion or guns those economic voters favored trump by sixty two thirty two only two per cent of voters say the economy is excellent voters prefer trump over bison on emigration by twelve points on national security by twelve points on his rely palcinian conflict by eleven points by the way that demonstrates once again that bison is saddled with a coalition that is at least in part anti israel trump has no such problems trump is h most proposal present modern times and is eleven points more popular on the issue than bison is vote fifty eight per cent majority support more economic and military eights you crane that did not seem to benefit bison on brighter questions of fitness to handle for an affairs the gender gap o national security is enormous men prefer trump sixty two two thirty three that is a twenty nine per cent positive martian for trump by the way rescue runs the bast if any of these candidates right now a the is generic republican generic republican runs amazing generic republican is is tremendously ahead of of donate a o of hoiden at this point was all people want is just in all alternative now what that means that the math could easily change the pole also shows that if for example tonal trumpet is is to be convicted of a crime during twenty twenty four than those poles change pretty dramatically what it does do however for trump in the primaries is obviously it takes away the largest to argument against him by both nick kalian on to mantis which is his delectability if the argument against trump is that he cannot beat bison or that he is the candid at least likely be bison when their poles the come out showing that trump is up on bison in pretty much all the swing stages obviously that argument gets under cut and this by the way should show trump something which his the more you are out of the headlines the more you are likely to win if tunnel trump hides in the basement from now until the election he will be president again it is pretty much that simple he needs to run the reverse widen strategy now is trump capable of doing that maybe maybe not but he should he should stop posting on truth social he should go in the basement he should let his lawyers do their work at he is various trials and he should be quiet an he should let every one focus on the fact that jobidon is terrible at the presidenthing really really bad especially because there new revelations about jobidon on the corruption front theatre on continue to plague him ani mac earthy has really god piece over at national view he says would the america people have elected jobidon if it would ben widely understood that biding was bought and paid for by the chines comes t regime the question presses because as it turns out the income ant president actually is what the media democrat complex falsely claim the prior president was a clandestine agent of a hostile foreign power scandalous as this story is it is just as in berating jobiden's collusion with china is back in the news because the house overs committed has just released its latest report showing the big guy as e recalled from twenty boblinsky's texts actually did get at least one ten per cent payout from the biding china scheme precisely matching his stake in the venture as was sketched out and in notorious made twenty seventeen hemal this only news because the paper trail is now catching upset the outlines of the story as an my earthy rights thanks to the extensive excavation of bison financial records by enters cruck rashly an on johns followed by dogged reporting of the negro post the allies the story were publicly available before election day twenty twenty but the story is gotten only more damming with additional evidence unearth by the over my committee c f c a shanghai base energy conglomerate with which jobidon and i family join forces was china to described as thinly failed arm of vision pins monstrosor monstrous regime what carat toe camouflage who as run by e on man wit the bisons deemed a protect of g how could be otherwise c f cs position as a privilege private company was established by the regime into thousand six all of this was knowable three years ago prior to the election not only that his pretty obvious that bison was being bought an paid for by c f c if c f c could brandish cordial relations and business partnership with t bison family other targets of china's blandishments would be more willing to transact it was a fact as anime earthy that bison c f c scene was not an abstract can t was the dirty done deal in which the regime backed company lavish the bisons with mountains of money the scandal out wright there to s in october of twenty twenty america did not see it and pelicans in believe it because the biding twenty twenty campaign and congressional democrats and the media tried to portray all of this as russia to s in formation but that was not true turns out the bison's dealings with c fa were already under way in twenty fifteen which is when jobidon was still vice president apparently man hunter bison did not take c so money during the boom years was the of optics would beenterable but they were gift that c is was already using the biding connection to further its objects they believe c fa owed them they expected to be paid and that was already in the works and as it turns out jobidon did get money on may thirteenth twenty seventeen names sillier sent hunter a now famous man that sketched out the structure and splits in the c fa see including ten per cent for the bigger the bidenside believe the deal hebomentum hunter bidet's discussions with ye indicated that at least for starters thereouldbe a quit ten million dollar in fusion of capital interesting then that when jobidon bought his rehoboth beech mansion less than a monthlater he paid two point haven four million dollars in cash rather than taking the mortgage there is a problem thou the c f c fun it did not actually materialize and desperation see in in that is wen hunter reached out two c f c and said ism sitting here with mind in any event hunter admonished the had of c f c m concern that you a vet er changed your minded broken or dead without telling me or that they are unaware of the promises an assurance the had been made he said do not mistake kindness for weakness the following day he was assured that we f we would be willing to cooperate with the family and again the money did in fact change hands and things are going to get worse for jobidon before the election if if donate trump stays out of the headlines and that is always he big question it's always the big butt will donate trump stay out of the headlines right now again the hadlantr are obviously taken up by the war in the madeleast it is quite possible they'll shift back to donate trumps legal issues as the year goes on that's what democrats are betting on if don't here the thing even if those things move ford if donate trump just stays a way from them if he does not say anything he can easily be president again or theoretically republicans could go more toward u nojanaric republican which would be more toward to cantus or nick hailed helping along that effort as i will governor can reads she apparently is going to in dosed to cantus at a rally into join on sundae that is very early right now obviously to cantus in second place the latest pulse show him tide with nick hale at sixteen per cent reynald's backing the mantis in i is going carry an awful lot of wait it is going to sink hale back in the third place you would imagine as have said before the big problem with with hailed is that if to mantis drops out a lot of hi supports can go back to trump a lot of that stuff his knocking over to hale which will basely con firm true sleep if hailed were to drop out presumably a lot of that sport would go to to cantus in any case trump is way ahead at

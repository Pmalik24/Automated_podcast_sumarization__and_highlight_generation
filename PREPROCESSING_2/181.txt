painless peaceful and legal suicide in our sissy r poets bran and i toast each other and we say here is to you a little hesitantly instead of what we usually say canton where we have a hundred years a very italic toast there is no chanting for us we will not make it to our thirteenth wedding and adversary we've insisted that we do not bring proper suitcases because i will not lug home a large suitcase full of clothes he will never wear and medicines he will never take and will not dump his clothes at the swims version of goodwill and leave his mess for the cleaning state basically i just will not deal with it with after after bran has died and i have to leave him my goal is to get myself on a plan with my friend who has offered to a company me home then my daughter saran will meet me at the airport and saran and i will be met by my daughter wetland and the two of them will say good night to me and my fantasy is that i will fall into my bed and not get up for two weeks this is absolutely not what happens march twenty nineteen stony creek connecticut bran's memory loss began in twenty sixteen and it was small and then bigger and then startling names disappearing repetition information turned upside down appointments and medication scrambled suddenly it seemed we argued endlessly about everything a gregarious man he did not want to see friends except to fish he now talked only about the past his childhood and football i could not steer him to any other subjects in the evenings i said because i did not know any better that maybe we could talk about our life now as its going on him and me and his retirement and the kids and the grandchildren and our friends and he said sure but we did not and the evenings were ours of television one spring morning have been weeping because bran seems distant and in that moment weeping the harder because although i could see that he was concerned and truly sorry he had upset me i could also see that he did not really know why i was upset and reminding him of our long pointless fight the day before was not helping we still had the occasional sundae morning conversations that we would always had and cherished somebody hurt somebody is feelings and somebody is old an apology which will be forthcoming sooner from me later from him but delivered by dinner time bran was not i mine to the lure of the i did not say it or if i set it i did not mean it approach but one of the things i loved was his willingness to own up there would be a burst of anger the black cloud would pass and my husband would dig a little deeper and usually come up with a genuine apology my favorite ism sorry i was such a knucklehead the clod did not pass now the apology was thin or weary or cold i could feel him through a glass and i was banging on it screaming at him why is there a glass between us where did it come from take it down and bran looked at me with puzzled irritated concern and said in effect what glass and please please stopped complaining about this thing that is not even there money canary twenty seven twenty twenty rich we lardon rich in the hotels car service takes us to the pretty hotel in the cobbled stoned old town section the city's warmer than we expect and it is drizzling i feel shifty and out of place at the hotels front desk bran wanders around in and out of the lobby and when i see him walk through a pair of swinging doors at the end of the hall while i am searching for our passports my stomach hurts as it does every time he leave s my sight when he comes back a few minutes later i pulled myself together everytown the concierge asked me a question i fumble a suspect why are we here would be a map of all the stores on ban offstruss gnocchi you bleak carrier may they show me the bar in the library i want to say to bran that it reminds me a little of a hotel we loved in amsterdam but i am afraid that he will not remember the trip the hotel i am afraid that he will not but he will pretend that he does and i will not know if he does or does not which is awful or i will know he does not which is also awful and i do not say anything which is usually the choice i make now we are both exhausted by the time we get to our room spring twenty nineteen stony creek our normal life have begun to require a level of effort that i had last had to make when i had had an unhappy marriage a full time job a teen age a toddler and a baby with none of the joy having barely looked at another man or woman for fourteen years i was now imagining myself having drinks on a roof top lounge with pleasant but unlikely even ism promising companions bran and i were always stickily close we liked a grocery shop together now i exhaled when he went for a long walk and ruminated late at night that maybe i could get him a small apartment in new haven with some kind of helper if needed how i could have contemplated helper and managed not to wonder why i was thinking that my sixty five year old husband who read falconer and worked out three times a week would need a helper i could not absolutely could not say i did not tell anyone in the world that i had these thoughts i did tell close friends that he was driving me crazy with his male mid sixty early retirement loose ends and it will pass i said to myself and look he is making staying glass i found the teacher made the appointment for the lesson and located the studio and he is going to his bookclub i scanned the planning meals when he felt overwhelmed and i ran to library for the book and he is pursuing the occasional zoning fights and our little town and studying the towns by laws with great enthusiasm really what is wrong i could not say but i knew that this man was not the man it'd married and the change had happen not over fifty years which would have been very sad but not puzzling but just over the last three years end of life it is amazing to me that people said to me well why go to switzerland i mean why not or agon or colorado or for why your sermon there are right to die laws in those states that some people said this to me right before and right after my husband died was more than amazing the right to die physician assisted dying laws in californium colorado dragon for most montane new mexico district of colombia an new jersey main who why and washington require that you be or become a resident of that state sometimes quick and easy not always in order to pursue your physician assisted suicide and also consistently that you are mentally competent medically assessed as having only six months to live and can express your wish to die usually three times twice oral and once in writing to too local physicians practically speaking you have to be damn close to death's door to get a doctor to swear that you will be dead in six months you have too physician interviews some days apart in which you was set that you are not psychotic or suicidal or depressed and hope the doctors agree with you you have to be able to swallow whatever the doctor for scribes without any assistance choosing to die and being able to act independently while terminally ill is a deliberately narrow opening many people cannot get through it they cannot swallow well enough they cannot talk well enough they cannot hold the glass or mix the drink on their own and helping some one hold the glass is a crime in much of america people who do wish to end their lives an shorten their period of great suffering and loss those people are out of luck in the united states of america septembered two thousand and five dirham connecticut how we met bran and i fell in love the way some middle aged people in unhappy partnerships and in small towns do liberal democrats an a republican town ethnic types in a town full of northern europeans opinion ate loud mouths and people who were willing to man the dirham democrats hot dog stand hot dogs and side every september at the fair i overlooked his bad haircut and aviator glasses ism sure he had to overlook my lack of interest in sports an my impatience bran could talk about a plastic a zebu or additional parking at the library for hours we have been walking together since our partners were not walkers and talking together in public at our local democrats breakfast club and then suddenly talking in private he said i was of three sport captain in high school and i laughed he said it would have been foreparts but you cannot do look cross and baseball is that right i said and he took my hand he said what is your family i said news from new york you he did well were a football family we have three linesman trophies in my family i said what is a kinsman and he kissed me i kissed him back and sensibly we avoided each other for the next year after a year and some arsines and new haven at the end of the day he asked me to take a walk with him he said ism not stupid i know how this will end you will tell me we should not do this to the people we love or all tell you and we will go back to our lives where we should be and i will never get over this or we blow up our lives and be together i just want to say this he sad before we walk back to our cars i know who you could be with some one rich some one fancy some guy your sister finds for you but i know who you should be with you should be with a guy who does not mind that your smarter than he is wo does not mind that most of the time you will be the main event you need to be with a guy who supports how hard you work and whole ring you a cup of coffee late at night do not know if i can be that guy he said tears in his eyes but it'd a shot we married thursday august fifteenth twenty nineteen new having connecticut we have an appointment want the neurologist we get there in plenty of time the secretary reception as nods at us from behind the glass there around six million people with all heifers in the united states and many many more with m c i mild cognitive impairment often one of the first stages of all heifers but not for everybody and although reevaluation every six months is recommended to people with m c no website can tell you why frequent revaluation is recommended as there is no successful treatment for m c i or for slowing the progression of m c i to all timers or really for all timers itself almost two thirds of these six million people are women almost two thirds of the caregivers for those all heifers patients are also women there are lots of theories about why more women than men get to geisha but only theories i do not have the scientific training to assess these theories there are no comparable theories about w y women make up two thirds of the unpaid dementia care givers because no theories are needed who does not know sisters darters wives of course they couldn't take care of some one with dimension thursday jury eighteenth twenty nineteen stony creek em or day the appointment for bran's smart is at eight forty five and it is only fifteenmenutes away we both wake up at six thirty bran lies in bed for a while grumbling at his phone he takes his morning mess and tells me his contemplating a shower i encourage the shower because he has a bad case of stasis on his scalp and the only thing that keeps it from trailing into his eyebrows and erupting around his nose is the medicated sham who he uses every day we have been talking about the siriasis shampoo used daily for about a year and a half looking back it seems a lot of fraught conversation to have about continuing to do something he is done almost every day for the fourteen years we have been together he is a good looking man my has been always smelled great and looked good and was vain about his good looks his wolfish smile and his dark thick hair i did not mind the vanity which was not excess of the mostly shared only with me about once a year he grabbed hi stomach and said if it was free it'd get a temp tuck after he had his cataracts removed he drag me into the bathroom to look with him into the mirror these bags he said you never told me six weeks later he was getting an eyelids when we would go out to dinner and look out on a sea of men his age even if weave been in a furious argument he grinned tap me on the hand and say how my alike me now and it'd always laugh i did not understand why i was now having to say washer hair honey or honey take a shower now i under can and now that i understand i wish that it is middle aged man laziness or retirement blues or a man's response to being told what to do it is not have been wearing and as miles cognitive impairment which as far as i can tell our informative post smart meeting with the neurologist will be next week a wildly euphemistic name for the early stages of dimension the clock drawing test and the many mental states exam in our second appointment the neurologist gets down to it by an probably in a tone that says definitely has a cementing disease it is probably allheimers very very likely i say that on the websites they described the allheimer's trajectory as three to four to twenty years the neurologist disagrees eight to ten to ma b ma be twelve but remember he is had these symptoms for at least two it'd say three years the neurologist makes clear that those eight to ten to twelve years for brine would be the end of life the end of his body's life i have now watched enough allhemer's diary videos who records this grief and posted on you two who does this i think even though i am as grateful as i am horrified that it is very clear that the end of the body will be long after the end of the self by moving to the practical the neurologist signals that we are coming to the end of the appointment she says that bran probably should not be driving even with the g p s not because he will get lost because bran jumps i might be in an accident you might kill some one the neurologist says we are both silent we get home when we cry for an hour in each others arms we agree not to do much talking for twenty for hours our whole week end is crying and talking and binge watching teeny at night i was sure the bran had alltimers before the empire i thought it is not a surprise but it was a surprise the way every bad thing even as you see the flames in the distance even as the terrible thing over upon you breathing in your ear hammering on your narrow bones is still a surprise before we fall asleep bran muses aloud about his wish to control his least and how i will arrange that for him he made up his mind after forty eight hours and never wavered we cried and i agreed and he said to me you go research it you are good at that stuff which meant that while i was looking up exit international in the hemlock society and websites that would sell you both the plastic turkey bag and the helium machine for your own do it yourself suffocation i was also researching how to get dentinal an fend barbital and simian pent barbital on the dark web i research at the public library not on the phone not on my laptop the internet tells me again and again not to search anything for my own computer and that if i need to know something call do not text and do not use my own laptop i was discovering the limits of my friends with medical degrees and the possibilities of carbon monoxide poisoning in your car in your garage but it is become more iffy since nineteen seventy five when the car industry adjusted the coo emissions and then a plied catalytic converters also we do not have a garage bran's dearest oldest friend his fishing buy since nineteen seventy nide as to bran if you think you do not need to go right now and you want a wait awhile i can just shoot you myself in a year or two in a field bran hugs and look up how it feels to drown lots of people have first person accounts about near drowning and they seem divided between peaceful brain fog as the white light shines brighter and clawing one terrified way through terrible suffocation and mention that drowning is away some people and their lives bran looks at me hard do you city me it is cold no and the depth of googol wormholes for end of life for assisted suicide for youth aphasia for terminal illness and for making end of life choices in august i finally find digital a swims organization to which even a foreigner can apply for an accompanied suicide if you meet their criteria be a sound mind have medical records supporting this have ten thousand dollars to commit and be sufficiently mobile to get to the outskirts of uric fall twenty nineteen stony creek applying to digital is pretty much my second job now getting medical records from the distant past and autobiographical essay from bran current dental records his first certificate but every mistake i make and up costing us two weeks and the thing that takes up much tide is a careless note on a form from the neurologist that describes bran is clinically dearest he is not but it is exactly the thing that dignatas will not support i have to find a psychiatrist wo will certify that bra meets all of dignatas is criteria bran is a certain kind of to for this project it does not want a particle ten discussions below his parade he does not want o over here troubling or puzzling discussions e does not want any bad news he does not want any unsolved problems presented and regular progress reports are appreciated no meeting should last more than ten minutes occasionally when we had a speed bump of which he is aware he says this is crazy it is my life i should get to decide how to end it most days he seems to feel that have got the situation well in hand that the end is coming too soon certainly but not right around the corner not before we can do she in a move many more times and that nothing bad will happen in the process which will unfold as we expect this is not true that nothing bad will happen and therefore not comforting to me it leaves me quite alone with reality but the way he feels is exactly what i want for him talking with a friend i rant about the america health care system our refusal to let people die dignified and comfortable less the money made off suffering the doctors unable to face their limits and meet the needs of their patients nobody can talk about it i say nobody seems to know with their doing there is literally no treatment the most advanced all timers research in the world says eat fucking blueberries get enough fucking sleep my friend not and if nonmember twenty nineteen stony creek it is the day before thanksgiving and dignatas tells us we now have the provisional green light this is the call we have been working towards since august by an hugs me hard because we have accomplish the thing we wanted to accomplish and done it together and he loves team work and then the light changes and dims and i am in the world without him in it he sees clearly the world going on without him me alone in the kitchen and him not next to me we cry in each others arms and without speaking we go right up to bed for a nap at eleven a m and only come down when the kids come through the door ready to start thanksgiving prep i start dropping things i dropped the dynamic piwaights on to the kitchen floor i drop an entire open bottle of corn syrup into a bowl of butter and eggs i burn the toast i actually set one pie on fire in the open and quadruple the amount of bourbon in the other that no one who is not a contucky drunk could eat it thanksgiving is done christian is coming and is my mother in law bran and i already knew a lot about all timers from my mother in law's best friend of fifty years join van's best friend was an ant to bran a regular dinner guest formidably well dressed in the nancy pagan would a great golfer a devoted philanthropist to causes i reviled and my mother in law's boon companion for movies dinner and drinks at the club she had descended into all timers these last few years as if on an express first she complained about the cleaning lady then she complained about her occasional guests then she complained about her son then she complain that valuables were being moved to odd places and probably stolen then she could no longer navigate not even on roads she driven for fifty years then she became violent and tearful afraid of the terrible real and imaginary forces beyond her control and then she did not have the capacity to behave well in the communal dining room were dress appropriately for the yoga class or even to keep herself clean and get along with her health care aid then her son moved her into a memory carry unit an she still knew my mother in law and weeping at every visit begged her friend to take her home even shared every detail of her dear friends to climb with bran who took note i love my mother in law bran often quoted a favorite saying of hers we are not here for a long time were here for a good time you can imagine how often he said that i had not said anything to van over the phone now i stand outside her bedroom door on our second floor until i hear bustling sounds i knock and she lets me in she is already nicely put together i sit on the bed beside her and tell her about our plan with digital she pulls away from me and wipes her eyes and i weight with my hands clasped i do not want a scene but if there is one i wanted to happen while bran is still asleep then she says i am relieved i realized that last night i was praying about this and praying all night and or realize that what i prayed for was that he would not have to suffer as join does ism shock that ism relieved but i am we hold hands and cry and she says that i was a gift to her son and i throw myself in her arms as if she is my own mother dismember twenty nineteen stony creek i am practising being

important the bran open the hotel room door showing that he is in charge of the process i tell bran this and he nods but i can tell he is not going to jump up at the first knock bran is not some one who rushes period to host at any gathering we have ever had he loves being the guest and he makes up for it by doing a ton of dishes after i do not know how to make sure he answers the door or even if it is important i just keep saying the doctors gan a knock on our hotel room door am also worried about etiquette will the doctor expect a cup of tea does he look the grim deeper no and no the doctor does knock on the door and i almost scream bran strolls over to the door and is his most amiable and pleasant bran self we us to say the bran could talk to any one he could make small talk with a stump and in the end that stump would be hugging bran good bye thanking him for a great evening and inviting us all to the next stump get together doctor g is a small man with large lovely mournful eyes we all shake hands and bran and doctor g sit across from each other i asked doctor g if i can stay for the conversation and he looks surprise he says gently that of course i should stay as this all concerns me as well i begin crying and both men look at me kindly i pour myself a glass of water doctor g my she says that is my father's name and i feel lightly bless somehow and i know that i have lost my mind asks about our flight he mentions complaining lightly just on passion and what i can only describe is the jewfish fashion of complaining while assuring us at the beg inning an end of each sentence that he has certainly not complaining that he hat to come late at night because he was at a concert in the city and it was most convenient coming after the concert because he lives by the lake and does not come into town every day but since we chose to stay in the old town he had to make a special trip just to see us not that he is complaining i beg him to take a glass of water and he does probably it'll stop crying he opens a folder and says to bran after i read your application i knew i would see you but i did not think it would be this soon bran says it is not a big window i mean no one knows how long they have how much time they have to make this choice doctor g looks he might argue but unsaid he says your absolutely right he says to bran i will ask you several times many times if you are sure that this is what you wish to do and i want you to understand that at any time at any time between now and the final act you are free to change your mind and not do this i hope you will not do this he says softly and bran nods doctor g says are you sure that you wish to end our life on thursday bran says that he is sure i start crying again and thank god both men ignore me again doctor g smiles and nods it seems to me he says pleasantly holding up the folder you do not believe in anything mister lichi bran laughs and says i believe in a lot of things but religion in the after life are not among them well doctor g says chuckling you'll find out before i will let me know bran smiles doctor gas tone changes let me tell you what will happen you will arrive at our apartment building and the suburbs assure in the morning by ten a m do not be late you will be greeted by two people from digital they will invite you in you can take your time he says there will be no rushing there is some paper work there are chocolates they will give you an antithetic he says you will not vomit you have up to an hour after that to make your choice about drinking the drink if you need more time they will administer the anti acetic again and again you will have about an hour after that to drink the drink after you drink it it is a little bitter he says and i wonder how he knows after you drink it you will fall into a light sleep then a deep sleep then it will be over is is emichin you can sit with him for a long time ism glad he calls me missis kimchi i know bran always gets to kick out of that bran nods attentively doctor g says at any time in this process you may change your mind right now or thursday morning no one will be surprised or distress we will all be glad for you i do not know why this would be perhaps i would be glad too but only if it meant the spell was broken and my whole husband was returned to me and to himself and these last years turned out to have been just a terrible test one poisoned apple after another to prove that my darling deserves the life he had before bran shakes his says i know what ism doing he says this is the right thing for me doctor g nods i see that he says but i will keep asking bran and i sit back down after he is gone i say that doctor g seemed nice and bran agrees bran says it is going o k and i agree we sleep side by side finger tips touching thursday canary thirty if twenty twenty uric the night passes and the next morning we have a car take us to falcon where dignatas has its apartment or house i could not really tell it is a residential structure in an industrial park two nice women in nice clothes sweaters and slacks may i feel that an effort was made they did not just throw on their sweats and come over read us they have dressed for the occasion of shepherding us across the river and they take it seriously i have never been treated with such seamless attentive tack they walk us in up a few steps to the door and i see a snow covered garden the kind of gesture board a garden that you would find in an industrial park and into a large odd immaculate room the seating in every corner two small arm chairs a large leather re plainer a leather sofa and a hospital bed as well it dawns on me later that it is important that everything that can be sat on or laid down upon be washable in the center of the room there is a table with several chairs the ladies bring our paper work to the table and point out the many bowls of chocolates they review all of the steps which bran and i cannot both relight they look at him closely and say at any time in this process including after you drink the antithetic you can choose not to do this we will be very supportive of you changing your mind rest assured we are assured the only sine of reluctance on bran's part is what he warned me about his making conversation before taking the sodium pentobarbital he said to me that he thought he might be inclined to just bush it around for a while when the time came to take it i know i have to go he said i know ism going ism ready ism just not in a hurry he does not hurry he drinks the antithetic and gets comfortable on the couch i sit next to him holding his hand but i have to let at go because he is gesturing while story telling the stories are all about football at male and his coach care cost and i could tell them with him bran and a friend winding up and male because of a young don fight in front of the anchor bar and care cost stern and forgiving bailing them out bran talking about quitting football because he did not get to play enough his first season and care telling him that he e care would let bran play when bran was good enough and not before and bran resolving to be good enough bran's father and care cost playing hardball together one time his two fathers i cannot manage to look interested in these stories because ism not bran says nothing about his life about our life about our love about the children and grandchildren nothing about the beautiful public housing he designed and cared about deeply were the work he did for conservation and open spaces were even and i must be reaching here about fishing but i do tried not to look ism an agony which i am the ladies weight in the back room a kitchen i think and after about forty five minutes they come out again they tell us that the antithetic has now worn off and if bran wishes to continue i do he says he will have to take it again they say you can take your time and i roll my eyes because of corse ye will he always does i think as if we are in some other room on some other occasion and then i remember where i am and i am ashamed of myself bran smile slightly but times your plain he says and i have never felt bad about being me and my entire life he takes the antithetic again and the ladies put an airplane pillow around his neck bran fall silent and now i long for the football stories i take both of his hand s and he lets me i love you i love you i love you i say i love you much i love you too he says and he drinks the sodium pendobarbatol i kiss him all over his handsome weary face and he lets me it is impossible to think about the next twenty minutes i keep my eyes and hands on him as if it'll forget what is to breathe next to him or feel his presents i do not not for a minute i hear his breathing when i go to sleep and i feel his body heat when i wake up he falls asleep holding my hand and his head falls back a little on the neck pillow whose purpose i now understand is breathing changes and it is the last time i will hear him sleeping breathing deeply and steadily the way he has done lying beside me for almost fifteen years i hold his hand i can still feel its weight and warmth his skin colure changes from ruddy to parlor pink i sit there and sit there as if some other thing will now happen he is quite pale and i see that he is gone from this world i sit holding his hand for a long time i get up and wrap my arms around him and kiss his forehead as if he is my baby at last gone to sleep as if he is my brave boy going on a long journey miles and miles of naught there is not much else to do the ladies would me to go before the swims police come it is simpler they say i does not feel that we have done something illegal but i can tell that it would be better perhaps better for me for digital for me to not be around while a swims policeman identifies bran's body that is what his passport and gentle records are for as i understand it i call an user and hugged the ladies i hid to the airport in the uric airport i sit in the fancy lounge and i look around for faces people watching since the moment of bran's death i find most people especially men disgusting not just unappealing but disgusting like yesterday's oatmeal liked eels in a bowl i find hetero sexual couples dismaying in the lounge i feel an alien examining pairs of earthlings what is the meaning of that how could a creature that be the choice this other creature makes how can one recognized choice in these random movements september fifteenth two thousand and seven dirham

tie to was the rooms in your city the most famous headline o still and o what makes her act unusual is that it is happily and was italy from her point of view is an immigrant my born in india here she is telling a audience peskily she truly did not know about college in america till soya got to staffer i am union the of biggest tat did you li non tan in the san sin the banns don get in ti si when

it stamford seats e a as do i a as do oases t after ta ciao mys aaaaai say in main i as men is entire act is this tricky thing of embracing every stereotype of the emigrant india mam while also can winking at the audience i know this is over the top i know how funny this sis she does is bit about telling soya not to become friends with kids an stamford who might for down the on path you n wanna an the wound tins major i you i o too damn re who a ais do i n have to say agama this is not the joke and it really happen at came one day she told soya the kinds of majors that she might look for hen she makes friends at school do sh i thought she was joke a an y when she first said i rat up i was among you r hilariasn't music why are you laughing her mam is joking on stage and it is real to get where her mam sing is coming from in all this of some background can't the pivotal moment in cares life was when she as fourteen back an india her mom died and this completely crushed her dad wanna was the youngest of four kids i needed not one to keep razing one last child he went get her married off soon as possible and i did not want gat might i was that kid who was curious and loved education and wanted to read about the wood and and also i was heavily influence by america botcugion i read ache is comics i watched trees company that the best of course i was said no ones married there an just living i ever red seems fin she said known a marriage her dag kicked her out she had to make her own way in the world she remember standing out in the ran front i the quass embassy the would not accept her paper work to come here spindly made it here got a old agree placed an ad to find exactly the kind of husband she wanted which is a wholother story and since then she has devoted herself completely to or three kids get them to a life that is safe and secure and very unlike her intern aged life soya is the oldest of the pilot project i eversoya this went just years of mathcamps and tutoring every summer and voluntary jobs at her mamaranged and after schoolectivities all to get a good college and ultimately a safe comfortable job in neck or engineering or may be medicine e ten grit wen soy was at home and high school but now it is stamford threats to this plan or just everywhere one the biggest threats this america idea that a college kit should explore take the classes they enjoy find what makes them happy as a merit n the happiness of my child is a last thing on my line again she lovers it punch in it is totally over the top but also she is not getting it is the last thing it now if becoming eating gain makes a git happy but ti do not giver to them do you think she is being tricked and to thinking happiness is important by by people in america yow ye absolutely hundred percent hundred present something son says to a bunch of my questions does she know what is best for her family yes hundred per can does she thing her children would thank her one day foreseeing the hard decisions for their life that they might not just now a hundred per cent with this i mind wanna is still trying to control soya's life from the other side of the country to a remarkable stem i princence she acts the are and soya storm ocheckonsoya's room to make sure she s working she has veriest people that she knows or just meats call soya to given encouraging symptoms about how great a life in computers her medicine is going to be she consults i soy and pretty much every aspect of her life this up impulse for control her daughter is instinctive and thorough that after i interviewed wanna wanna called soya who i had not interviewed just yet with instructions on what to say to make well she just said on she just said when they ask you do you control me you should say now wait but is not telling you to tell us that she has not controlling rather controlling i think that that is the thing about my mob is she does not think she is of a critical because it all comes from a place of just pure love and and she give me i little lines of explanations of what i should say and wife ism worries i should tall and i was just kind of yod those are good ideas and she was like ever to learn is i know i might em promise and music no improvisation we new to play i grab somebody is not s ticking with a plan but since she arrived at stamford boy has been pushing back on her mom more than she ever has and the biggest thing they disagree e about the most serious bottle front in this war over how much control wanna gets of rezoya's life is what classes it should take when a said was your man's voice in your head when you er picking your classes her answer showed just how much her man's voice is in her head a hundred permit if i last year when soy was a freshman her mind did think very unusual for a standard parent she sat in when i is fume meetings with her academic advise her mostly lurking off camera and making her wishes known tozoya but sometimes speaking up he remembers one call for insane with an viewer i think the most embarrassing part of the call was my mam saying to i is only supposed to take computer sets but she should only take cam peer's eyes and then i think what was embarrass sing was she had said that right after i had gone on this whole standard about how i loved learning about ladder and ancient cultures and then she was but to i needs to take come peter since almost as if she had not heard what i had said and the i cadomace adviser was her face just dropped it was just embarrassing i think she is thinking all tibia an ma grant ma once to control india daughter to do stop which i just a hat bet cause were not even a stereo typically cultural family and just was the worst feeling i did not want to be seen as we that i did not want seen be seen as id worked hard to create this i daily that was not just india girl does stop that important to me i want to be complex and interesting and seen as more than that and i feel ism cot in this miss match of cultures and miss match of understanding of what education looks and to be crew she does not think her ma is entirely whoa when mama says ism paying for this why shouldn't i cost to pick your courses part of sorry thinks the a why should she be spending her mama's money to take an english case her mama does not is not that selfish of her but she just how messy and complicated all this is between them i need to tell you this next story soya now her mam well and is such a forceful forward looking kid the soya is the reason that her mama sauna became a stand u comedian at all four years ago when she was sixteen i saw how unhappy her mama was she train to be a lawyer but did not it an stop when she hat her kids she enol raising the kids for years here mana i was dying but i wouldn't for get out what her do i could not for get to what i should do and she said to me mam on my friends love hanging out with you because they think your funny why do not you no comedy and i was not what she talking about who scum mi come and watch what i have to sand what am i n on her say i do not know what comedy people do and she is no ma i really think you

you all my friends would wont to come to my house cause she was just funny and lively she just had such a get a her all always her answer was oh it'll just be a secretary somewhere or i got a law degree i could to go exercise my lotic e could go practice livest come you hated practicing laic you love telling story it took her all this months to convince her mama that she should do what she loved and now it is not lost on zoa that this is exactly what she is asking her mama to let her you at college i keep telling her that where ism mam the reason you have your careers as i said do it you love and she was a yow but you shouldn't do it your life that is too starry and look i when i ask her mom about this she says it it is different for her the viola when she started is comedian the fame was financially secure they were fine soya does not have that her mamey she needs to invent a life for herself this she supporting herself and some she manage to gree a job is a writer a job in the arts i mean it it is a very unshaven unknown bat you do not know what next is is hard for her to put that feeling side given her past can i say for my experience with my parents who grow up without money and fought the way to professional jobs in the middle class ism really not sure there is anything that soya can say to warn orzarnan disown to convince each other is almost the parents did too good a job creating a safe wife for soya and now she is not scared the way they are about how badly thinks e of we live in fear at least my husband and i she does not and to at am grateful she

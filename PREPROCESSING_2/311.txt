welcome to the hubermannatponcas a science science back to for i may druhubermen and on a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine my guest to day is doctor k ti doctor k ti is a professor of hero science at the sulk institute for biological studies she did her training t mi t and at stamford and is currently in investigator with the toward he's medical institute which is a highly curated group of individuals where incentivize to do high risk high reward work and pioneer new areas of biological study throughout her career doctor kit has made fundamental break through into our understanding of the brain including demonstrating that a brain area called the amygdala which most people associate with fear and threat detection is actually involved in reinforcement of behaviors and experiences that are positive and involve reward her current work focuses on various aspects of social interaction including what happens when we feel lonely or isolated indeed to day k ti will tell us about her discovery of called loneliness neurons neurons that give us that sense that we are not being fulfilled from our social interactions she also describes a phenomenon she discovered called social homeostasis which is our sense that we are experiencing enough not enough or just enough social interaction irrespective of whether or not we are in introvert or in extravert we also talk about social her keys and social rank how people and animals tear out into called alphas and bad's subordinates and dominant et camera in all sorts of social interactions i think even will find at discussion especially interesting end we talk about the roll of social media and online interactions and why despite extensive interaction with many many individuals those social media and line interactions can often leave us feeling deprived in specific ways we talk about the negro chemical the neural circuit and some of the hormonal aspects of social interactions it is a discussion that by the end will have you thinking far more deeply about what is a social interaction and why certain social interactions leave us feeling good others feeling sort of men and why other social interactions or lack of social interactions can often leave us feeling quite depended even dearest it is a conversation central to mental illness and the understanding of things depression and anxiety p t it and isolation end it is a conversation mental to mental health and in order to build healthy social interactions before we begin i to emphasize to this podcast is separator my teaching an resocirolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zerocostic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress cop ears with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity have spoken many times before on this another podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now one of the key aspects to getting a great night sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that is because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees eight sleep makes it extremely easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment at the beginning middle and throughout the night and when you wake up in the morning have been sleeping on an et sleep matters cover for nearly three years now and it has dramatically improved my sleep if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dot come slash supermen to save a hundred an fifty dollars off their pod three cover eight sleep currently ships to the u s a canada u k select countries in the u and australia again that is eight sleep dot come slash supermen to day's episode is also brought to us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and differ an activities and your sleep patterns impact your health by giving you real time feed back on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor now blood glucose sometimes refer to as blood sugar has an immediate and long term impact on your energy levels and your overall health one of the best ways to maintain focus and energy throughout your day as well as to keep your called metabolic health in best order is to make sure that your blood glucose never spikes too much nor does it get too low with levels you can monitor how different foods an food comminations impact your blood locos levels on a moment to moment basis have been using levels for some time now and it is really help me understand which foods and food comminations exercise schedules and sleep schedules are optimal for my blood locos levels and how that translates to energy levels and other metrics of health if you are interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor you can go to levels dot link slash supermen levels has just launched a new medium censor that is smaller and has even better tracking than before right now there also offering two free months of membership again that is levels dot link ally n k slash supermen to try the new censer and to free months of membership to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means zero sugar and the appropriate rations of the electrolyte sodium magnesium and patagium and that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve cells your neurons relies on electrolytes in order to function properly when your well hydrated and your hydration also includes the appropriate ratios of electrolytes your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved i drink one packet of element dissolved in about sixteen to thirty two ounces of water when i wake up in the morning as well as while i exercise and if have sweat a louring that exercise i often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about thirty two ounces of water after i exercise element c mes in a variety of different flavors personally i all the fruit flavors raspberry and watermelon or my favorite i also the citrous flavored one frankly i cannot really pick just one of the fruit flavors i them all much and it also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint flavors which i find are best in the winter months because of course you do not just need hydration on hot days and in the summer and spring months but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry if you to try element you can go to drink elements spelled element he doctor slash supermen to try a free sample pack again that is drink element doc come slash supermen and now for my conversation with doctor k tie doctor k ti welcome and hover even let its free folks are into here you call me and and wonder if my name is and i always know who ism speaking t according to whether not they call me drew saris my family and people that i know after certain period o my life drew which are people that know me through my very brief and anon illustrious career in boxing and and which are people that tat me as i was coming up through science i let just put this way there was another drew we did a coinflip and i lost and is fine address find whatever makes you comfortable what is important to day is not how any one refers to me but rather the discussion about your work which is spectacular have known you a long time and give been falling your career and is shippen amazing and wonderful to see the contributions you have made to science and also to the culture of science o or can talk about both of those things to kick things off let us talk about a brain structure that most people i think of heard of but that is badly misunderstood and that is the amygdala most people here a ligula and they think o fear that is what the emigdalais all about but and i hoping you educate us on the fact that that the amygdalas is actually far more complex than that and far more interesting than that when you hear the word of misdeal where does your mind go i agree that a lot of the the band with on the amigdalizement occupied by fire studies but we have known actually for really long time that the amygdalas important for all sorts of emotional processing since clover by performed lesions on on monkeys and found that monkeys would then have flat affective responses to all sorts of different stimuli to food an at an object whatever it was just not nothing no emotion know emotional response no motivational significance however you want a frame it to things that usually would make you either disgusted or excited or neutral and i think that that knowledge about the eidola was there from the beginning it is not something i came up with i but then it is interesting it is almost a it's a media statement or media observation about how scientific research progresses sometimes you make a lot of progress in one particular vain because it is easy to press forward there but it is important to also think about all the other parts in filling in the space in between to make surveyor have not missed anything the narrative bout the imply became about fear and i think also just when we think about survival when you are an animal in the natural world especially if you are a prey animal which is the majority that is a lot of animals i then you need to prioritize escaping a predator it is immediate throgouton your survival verses rewards set making drinking water getting food these things can be done later escaping this predator is paramount and there should be some natural a symmetry in how we process a motion at baseline and that is something that we have looked into a lot as well but i i think the the big picture discovery that mim my team has contributed to our understanding of the mandala is that it represents a fork in the road a for processing emotional vigilance and thinking about all these old psychological theories about how do you emotionally evaluate the world around you what is what is the what is the chain of events is there a chain of events what is happening in a certain order i verses what is happening in parallel for example one model is if there is all this information that comes in and then we have to filter out what is important i what is going to be something that need to pay attention to versus what do need to ignore if ism driving and to pay tent to the road this this light this pedestrian just start walking versus what it feels for my stock to be touching my foot not superrelevant right hour the my but against the seat not nothing i need to pay attention to ane to focus on the dynamic information then you have to select the second step would be selecting whether it is good or bad and what you want to do with it and that process i think the selection of whether you are i a signing it a positive for negative valance happens in the imagdula gat you brought up this word vigilance something is a word that some scientist but most of the general public orpine not familiar with splits am talk about vigilance i and then i want to go back to the macula and i of explore some of its diversity of function i will be more when i hear the word vigilance i think goodness verse is badness ye of something is that physically they simply it is been used in a lot of different fields i think of that negative and positive numbers or or i but it is an analogy that we take to just media pot potent positive net net negative and it is it is a ts intentional departure from the word value om value becomes very scale or everything on it can be in the same direction with different magnitudes is often how we think about value it it could be representing both silence as but often a small reward in the big reward or small punishment at be punishment is how experimentally we parse u value and vigilance is just asking about how your brain response to things that are cut are bad wat a neurons that might respond similarly to things that are good and bad those might be important means rather than i positvernegtive vigilance neurons ya i i think it is a it is just a term that that signifies that next step when we walk in to say a novel environment do you think that our a amygdalas a active and really trying to figure out whether not an environment a set of people or a person is safe and really just check that box first in order to be able to do other things as youknow it is this business of determining vigilance and the roll of the midland that and of the first gait that we have to walk through any time wherein a new environment princes you showed up here today an mention i think i locked my car and am i said you will be finding this neighborhood either way an then you walked in and presume ley were taking in the new environment meeting some new people we had a lite discussion about can a well discussion bout you call and presumably because you and i know one another you felt safe i would hope but presumably the amygdala is always performing this role even if we have some prior knowledge about something just figuring out am i safe here where a e the exits where the entrances a who is here what is their story do you think all of that is is operating and you think it is always conscious where is it largely unconscious to us oh gat there is a few different questions there am first i want a address the the question about novelty and then i want to come back to the the other issue of conscious but the way the amygdala works is it is jobs is to a sign meaning to anything that could have motivational significance and if it is a brand new thing where paying attention where seeing if if i if it mattered did it matter and i think anything that is novel even if we do not know what it means a low sound you have never heard before u even if it signifies nothing of motivational significance the first few times that you are presented with it you will get a inimical response you see this in a lad play the town for the first time and then there is a response that rapidly decays when the town does not end of predicting anything with t the animal can can detect wore human is as self pattern that this sun humans if you're the give a person that puts your for on do not disturb first as has it on vibrate and sometimes it is always vibrating and it is just it vibrate all the time where is i put my thought on do not to ben some wen someone ease's on rings it is very startling to me but there they do not even notice because that there from that is just the sound of comics that makes it all the time i think it has to do with how many times are presented with it and it is the startle response the first few times that you are presented with a stimulus a the amygdala well respond and than it too case very quickly and then only if that stimulus predict something important a something rewarding or or punishing then ah what will it begin to respond again it is it is your giving everything novel a chance to to tell you in one trial in single trial learning if something is on to happen and i think a fire farmers a great example firearms goes off your your instantly now you are looking round is there anything happening even even just people rushing out you nowhere is there is the salient thing that your in a respond to and if you have a lot of fire drills than you might respond differently after a while i think that is the habituation component you mention that the ligula will respond to a novel stimulus and if it predicts something interesting then other things happen with all about this if not the galas stops responding and you lissomely really important which is that the amygdala will respond to something that is predicting reward were punishment i think most people do not realize that torch nothing a lot of early career her biologist do not realize that that the amygdala is not just involved in fear an punishment we we talk wit you migduala presently were time with you miggala complex a bunch of other things is it true that there fronds in the impala complex that predict reward and others that predict fear and punishment ya i as the graduate student i worked on a part of the amygdala called the basalateral o misdeal i still a complex within the broader a misdeal this brain region is cortical in that it is mostly gludomatrgic naans with some gab urge naans next but without the same structure that the quartan has and i studied the c that signal an the contact of reward i found essentially that when you induce plasticity you get an a synaptic strengthening when you a when animals learned things amigdelanarons fire and response to use at predict rewards and this was you coming into the content of a field that had shown that this happens with fear and this became i i remember may the very first time i gave a a sit a presentation as at a scientific conference i was a junior graduate student i was given a ten minute talk at the a doggerel a signal according research conference many famous professors were speaking and there were two talks about the amygdala and reward and i was one of them and the response to the talk was just how its is possible how can how can the imigdula how can how can you get the same read out for reward an fear and really it came to be there is to to possibilities an me there is more puzzle but the main two possible is an are one that the emigdula was not specific for fear at all it just response to anything important if it is important it responds period the other possibility is that the imigdula is sending has different neurons that respond to positive and negative predicting stimuli and sends us information to different downstream targets to respond differently obviously i respond differently to a reward i walk towards it i i consume it a punishment ism avoiding it and clearly the behaviors are diametrically opposed and to me it seems very possible at least that that there was a dimerous point and maybe this could be it and we just did some very simple experiment when i first started my lab to trace the projection targets of a migdelanerans and record and everything's all mixed up together it is not obvious that they would that that that this would be if of a fork in the road but when you look at them you do see that there are projections that come from the imigdula that are predominantly incoming either reward or fear and there is many different projections and i this is just the beginning but this was a time when it was a novel concept to even think that turns from one region could have completely different functions going different downs from targets which now seems totally obvious and it at there is hundreds and hundreds of paper showing it now but at the time it was difficult to get this work publish because that is just not how people fought about information moving through the brain i guess i think it first of all such important work and wonderful to be a early in the the a face of recasting how the brainwork such is what you did am i think most people in the general public still think a ligula fear and a clearly it is able to signal reward and punishment as you discovered in i now pointing out a abuse toes the emigdula have a direct line to some of the organs of the body that can change our bodily activation state party breathing in muscletention because i think most of us experience fear and reward as both in our head in a brains but also of the body great question great question it'll tell you the clues that lead me to my current working model which may it is not necessarily the final word but i would say that i think the a ligula complies as were discussing it these thirteen subnuclyi that reside in the temporal lobe they are important for a signing importance but there not important for producing the actual autonomic arousal that we associate with panic or fear the reason i say this is there is a famous case study patient as am who have has bilateral damage to her imicdily and no response to emotional faces no responses to fearful stimuli but if you if capable of having the panic response due to low to e suffocation associated with t with suffocation and there is still the ability to produce that panic an arousal response it is just not the cognitive evaluation of it i think that is what we think the imigdola is doing is assigning that it it does receive information from the rest of the body there are for example gremlin receptors in the eidola things that can sends hunger and we have done some some work looking at this kind of inspired by an ism not sure for this for your familiar with this study it is a controversial study dansicgare twenty eleven but where these supreme court judges the they look at supreme court judge rulings on unpearal decisions a cross the day relative to meal breaks and you can see right after strike breakfast ninety per cent emery's getting fry emery's getting out yean then i drop steer cent then there is lunch they were back to eighty per cent in the it of precipitously drops to single that just again the judges are changing we permeance of the rulings depending on how well fed the there there are counter arguments to this but that is strongly what the data suggest it is not a controlled study is just a striking correlation but its their is it is not completely novel concept the angry phenomenon ism sure i do not not everybody's different i certainly experience it but we we think that when you are getting strong signals from the body for example i think i think the emigdose can able detect a lot of different home yo septic an puts even that we have not we and have evidence for that yet but for specifically energy balance when you are hungry you are a migdocan detected perhaps through ireland receptors or other other mechanisms and then you what we see is that in that food dear after one day of food depdeprovation formic you can see this shift in the balance between the posits valence incoming projection neurons and the negative failings and coming projectionaris in unit baseline fear trumps all the negative projection irons can silence the reward projection one which make sense if i need a run away from the editor i cannot i cannot worry about eating this food right now but if ism in a near starvation state which for mice or they admit very him tapis these one day without food is a really ideal the only last a few days at this point they are kicking in to survival mode where actually getting food becomes the the greater need and you will see animals hunting in ways they normally would not haunt when when there really desperate and this mode of of for deprivation shifts things that the reward pathway actually the has stronger power to the influence and silence the a fear pathway than before while trained smart it really is it can take what we normally think of as a priority list fear and thing safe is more important than food reward and then if food an acquiring food is critical to survival it can invert a that is what you are saying exact names at t happens in a day it seems reversible that something that we are looking at right now and thinking about how specific is this this to food is the true for lots of different things what about exercise other other treasures that are the potentially more positive the emigdula is able to detect a lot of different signals from the environment and we are not sure how all that gets in there i think one of the the detection of the environment has been really well worked out in terms of our basic sensory modalities but think about the things that really a fact your emotions take a day at least for me as a human an this society the things that affect my emotions most to to day are almost entirely social interactions very subtle ones ones that do not seem to threaten my life or safety very small subtle social interactions are are what how the greatest bearing i think on u my emotional valuation and my emotional band with and what is that how do we detect that how do we assemble this information appliance the new ants put on the onion layers of social programming to come out with whatever i interpret this gesture to mean it is it is pretty incredible an that kind of were a my research program has has been sliding so interesting area let us drill into it a bit and put in contact may be in tack amok social media m sorn social media whether not integral or acts dos d seem to be the two major platforms am non tic took people saystuff sometimes they say positive things sometimes they see saying negative things sometimes they say things are neutral it seems to me that nowadays if one is on these social media platforms that we are e sort of crowd sours this phenomenon of social interaction in a way that we had not before because i i grab prior to the advent of social media and i could bring my physical body into certain environments and not others youthen at high school i could hang out we had an area call the back cave where scape orders in some other at that time is fits hung you with the quad where the cool kids hung now et camera you could you could pick your niche i social media s not that you can pick followers they can pick you et camera but i think since most people have social media nowadays seems ere on there in some ways that were placed ourselves in the center of an arena which we have a ton of in coming in put we all most of us have a amygdalas two of em amygdalas he pointed out one on each side the brain and presume we were on these platforms to receive positive he back and avoid negative fee back however there does seem to be a cohort of people who seem to the friction of come combat or kind of litters call at high friction interactions or moderate friction interactions they to argue they to parse ideas it is not all bad necessarily have you ever looked at social media in you are in your own mind looked at social media through the lends of of a amygdala filtering or through the lends of a nor circuit filtering and i wondered what is going on there that some one with without you are in kept knowledge of these sprain circuitry's would not think to a look at that landscape whom or may we cut just do that now as ya w that ism i lot of people ask me about social media from the contact of is this of as this social contact meaning fall as this positive does this count does this help you not feel lonely i and of course i do notknow the answer we have not done that particular study yet and i do not know i do not know of that specific study having been performed but my prediction is that it is now can o do much because i i believe that a key component of what i would consider social contact heavily depends on having some interbank sincrany some interaction an in that is sincrannes and i think with social media sometimes there can be engaging dialogue that plays out in near real time but generally speaking it is a sit grandness you are looking at things that are happened that you are not a part of you are excluded from all these things they haven an australia yes yesterday and ism on their saying cool of it ye and then the persons already asleep yes exact tat s we in by a incline are not a fingerless that who are not experiencing things at the same time it is not a shared experience that in terms of that having that bond necessarily and have never actually been asked about how the amygdala process social media a ism i guess i think what happens is the in eidola is just responding to stimuli hat sending a bottom up signals as a caricature of of bottom up and top down processing let us give an example that ism ism walking on the street and all the sudden i here the really ferocious dog barking at for of ongoing cream and then i get superscared and then i realize oil peter's offense that a eidola detect heard the dog barking then dog barking in yen ism ism freeman you then my prefrontal comic realizes there the first an it looks very sturdy this fence looks stable and then ism relaxing and ism resuming my walking normally i think that sort of the dance that our brain is doing when we have top down an bottom up i information that were my ti staffocust for me i think when ism unsocial media there is many stimuli that that are evoking responses and ism to be completely transparent and i know this is not something that everybody else dos or cannot doer is necessarily what is best for that but i work very hard to control in put from the top down ism in terms of i really really limit the amount i abaxial leek do not check meal or go on social media i would say ism on social editor hemal less than one hour per week tester week per week i have to say to is a congraduallations it must such o media again a second but as fellow presser you not once a week have heard of people scheduling their times for meal responses but once a week that is blossom i had a wonder yer o prat people who help me get through it and then red and o throughout what is important but other is i just when over i do my own meal i say yes to all the things then i make all these plans and then i and then i have too many trips and ism responding front fragmented fragmented and it is just overcommitting and i think i i know my limits sometimes it is difficult for me to be in my a amygdala mode responding to stimuli and yet letting my prefontalcorticts to its things have set some very heavy prefrontal vortically selected limits of the input i put in that my brain can function and be clear i cannot be creative i cannot have a pifphanese if there is all this clatter of writing this firsthand back and loadable la three three it is just ill lasso while squeeze squeeze the brain now that we can actually grow something beautiful in now well and i want to re emphasize what i said in my introduction which is at you are oh productive and when i say productive i do not just mean productive plugged shut you you the work you have done is incredibly creative you transformed our understanding of what this famous structure the emigdula actually does an you have made many important discoveries as a consequence of presently other things but including wiping away all this in coming in clutter as you said controlling the top down in puts i have to ask just from a practical standpoint during that one hour a week are you reading every male that came in a you just been very selective about which impels i are not opening most even no i do not open mussy male now i just i search for the ones that might assistant i identifies as the one i need to open there is a list of things that have b interested in and then we will go through the lis and then sometimes it requires me to go and find the demon respond to myself because that is n the i would do that for you know to ten ten minutes a day or something do you recommend them tot of there as son as i cannot now it am do you pass on this advice to the people tat you train i think it depends on what resources and what is you what is the whit is your job right now right i think i as a training i definitely to mas i ti professor idea my e most but a certain point i i was just never getting to the bottom and then t would just tress me out make me feel overwhelmed and what is my job my job is to number one be a stable for of a sustainable research program and i that just requires me having a lot of mental health an well being and i and and clear mindedness and i need to be able to come up with creative ideas i mean to be able to sprint when there is a dead line and i i just cannot exhaust my system with unnecessary i would call them quadrant for in the time management quarrel if your familiar with a we have what is and t a important urgent yes its there hang the urge and i or in somethings and that things i neither important nor then that is most meals a are in like if you retire management literature and you have the luxury to have some one else help you or something that is well train to be really got to cat capturing thingsthat are portend and sometimes i miss males but meals are not the way my trainings would reach me that would reach me in a different way i and then emails for everyone else that i did not give my number two i feel honor to have we your contact i to take a brief moment and think one of our sponsors and that is a one a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that also contains adaptations i started taking a one away back in two thousand and twelve the reason i started taking it in the reason i still take it every day is that it insures that i meet all my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it insures that i get enough periotic and robotic to support got health now god health is something that over the last ten years we realize is not just important for the health of our god but also for our man system and for the production of gaur transmitters and demodulators things opening in cere atonement in other words god health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course i strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are number f things in a one including specific mice mutants that are hard to get from whole foods or at least in sufficient quantities g one allows me to get the fitments and minerals that i need probiatics prelatic the adaptions and critical my cronutrients any time somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement what that supplement should be i tell them a one because a one support many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try a one go to drink g one dokcalm slash supermen and you will get a year supply of vitamin d three k to and five free travel packs of a one again that is drink a one doccalm slash supermen i think this is wonderful advice for people to hear we have a future guest on this podcast in call report he wrote the book deep work and he as another book call the world without email he is a computer since professor gorge sownwery he talks extensively about the tremendous career but also relation ship and life value of doing essential what you are describing lathe i do think k that you represent have the extreme of what have become aware of a terms of people that can limit the amount of time in a social mania platforms animal anyway i just want it say congratulations i just on t say that and i think it even if people do not reduce to one hour per week i think that making some effort toward reducing the amount of incoming as you said controlling the top down in puts to the mig demo bit also to the rest of the brain involved in creative processing et camera is we an we actually do have agency it just is it is it is tough sometimes to build up that discipline a you are doing a tremendous service by sharing that somebody as successful as you does this presumably is successful in part because you do this could we by extension say that many people since billions of people are on social media are likely triggering the activation of their a milk deal clouding out other more potentially productive activation of their curl circuit is by re just making themselves freely available to the to the a thoughts and words and impulses of others some in to me it seems the answer would yes but it'd to know a youth i mean i think and there something to be said there stiffly been moments where have have gone a deep into my and spent more time in a certain bursts right that is isolated i think that there is a lot to be learned from sociomedia to actually to bring i back to one phone you mention earlier on mat as a men people protect just one escalades and sometimes there is a lot of of fraction one of the reasons i stay on media even though ism making this big fort a sort of deep clutter my consciousness is because of that feet back especially when for some one you i imagine is go to be supersuri and even for me a certain point of mi career it just felt people to want to tell me mad news to my face as much any more after be positive all the time and what they what a rial my thinking and dial media allows you the protection of an enmity to say what you really think without consequence essentially and on the one hand the consequence free nature of being able to just say things can be very dangerous but at the same time for me i really valor just being able to receive it i ism of a big girl i can felterout what i want when i get the all the in wit's but if i do not receive the inputs sometimes it is hard to learn from the feel back ism not getting even sometimes fee lack given in a not very nice way i can still create a model for someone else that has this perspective that i can take with me and that can the another perspective i can honor easily in the future because i have the theory of mine for some one some book some one would get up set about that that is something that could be harmful to people who are think have the theory of my i think it is supervaluable from that perspective and that is why i continue to use it great ye i i really applaud that as well i i always read my teaching else because they are anonymous and yes i do wonder what grad the different a people who gave different evade know got i do not know that information i sometimes wonder do they attend the class ore they just angry they did do well on the exam but that really represents the small fraction of feed back that ism that i wonder about most of it that is valuable to me is the hey the course but these parts really socked water he remain or this part was completely unclear or completely hated the way you blank blank and blank because that fee back is something i can really work with to improve i think course e vows a are similar to what you are describing i think there is value there if i were to just look at the the positive feed back and then ignore the get if fee back can not write those people off then i do not think i can improve as a teacher actually i always encourage comments and feed back and suggestions in the tub comments for this podcast for that reason and i do read the comment i go through and i read and am few of em sting i but the posit fee back is great to sometimes it is more of this please or less of that yes i think there there is information in that yum i think it sounds you have been doing all of these things naturally i actually i then a since have had my research drop milk my lab we do an anonymous lab survey every it is supposed to be about every eighteen months and then it is a whole long process of going throughitan it is just avoid ai think the fourth or fifth time we have done it and it is now i think it is seventy questions because e it have you you should we shut trim it down but it it ends at being hundreds of pages of of text short answer lot sometimes long answer feed back from anonymously from people my live my leave is pretty big outs it is am ism not even train really guess who is saying it it is just fee back and it takes me months to go through with at and and get all the fee back and it is useful i mean in a class the the the a mount of contact that you have is it is it is restricted to this very specific time and space whereas when you are entering someone over the cross course of years there is a lot of different there is a lot of different points of of content and interaction and you are in the lab all forty hours a weaker whatever and going trips h meeting here there is just a lot of different different ways to improve and ways tat we have never have not had any training in how to be a really great mentor and ism getting that training now ism making my own course and my menses are my teachers and i really ungrateful for the the todilege that they provide for free in the s anatomy must lab survey sometimes it makes me cry but sometimes it makes me feebly get about something that ism doing that is working and in any case it makes me feel that i have ground truth i guess i still do not know but when people say things that staying i it makes me feeling better saying what they really thank and they are not holding back it does not and i that news feels reality and that is very something about that is rewarding ism just to feel i have reality rather than ism getting something else that the model does not quite fits very um satisfying with model s an quite fit sound i of the word ground truth there is something beautiful to that and i i resinate with them what you are saying it is go back to social interaction something that your lab is doing lots of work on nowadays and maybe we could shift to the sort of social interaction that must of just are familiar with the mum sitting across the table have a coffee with somebody the taking a walk with somebody maybe upon call that maybe a tough conversation maybe a playful unscripted conversation u maybe a meal at a holiday dinner there is a huge range there what what do we know about the value of social interaction at the level of si for biological needs i get the level of neural circuits and maybeven hormones in must peel pert of ox toasts and this think the love hormone but it is there is much more there for people to understand and know about you how important is this thing that we call social interaction and how bad do things get when we are not getting the right kinds of social interaction you know i think this is is is a great question and ism glad that it is become something that has been recognized at a more global and national scale just the importance of of having social support in our lives for help for our well being but social isolation or even just perceived loneliness has immense heart consequences for all social species shorten life span increased mod disorders increased actually morbidity and mortality for diseases cancer or hard disease that a might not be what we would normally think and i think understanding how each of those processes is happening those mechanisms are far from being worked out but the the correlational evidences undeniable were now taking this into the liberally for the first time and something simple a social isolation how can we do not know way more about it and ism some one who stumbled into the field of social isolation by accident prior to the pandemic and all just say the whole story on why there is such a gaping whole in our knowledge as the nearesince community about social isolation really comes from harry harlot's work this original work of maternal separation that was undeniably cruel if it caused irreparable damage to these baby monkeys and they never recovered and about interns police as a describing to not interrupt in my life but i but the level are on word could you just briefly describe the harlot experiments yes their very famous experiments where they separated a baby monkeys from their moms and then had either a wire sort of thing holding a bottle look at what i what do you miss most about the mom is it the war is it the food or the the the comfort and then they had that they had a wire thing with with the milk bottle verses blankets and cup cutty soft things and and the the baby monkeys would go to the cuddly soft thing but a blanket is not a replacement for a mother nobody's saying that it is not and through these experiments there is extended maternal separation and it is it is it was cruel there was permanent irreparable damage when you when you rehouse these monkeys they never socialized normally they had lots of different mental and physical health problems and i think in humans we know that sought solitary confinement is considered torture social isolation a difficult thing to study in in a lot of conditions and we stumbled on to it by complete accident through working with a stock a former nostoc an milabgilian matters who was a graduate student doing an experiment on on it was just try to figure out if these dope neurons what also respond to cocaine the way of vitiate these sori the ventral the mental area doping's were now respond to cocaine want to see these other doping's respond to cocaine sort of a incremental study when you do this cocaine studies you you inject to the animal with cocaine or sailing when they leave the nave animal in the cage and then you take brain slices record from the means and look at the synaptic strength and the expected outcome sort of was that these dopeingans with would be similar to other opens that showed in seen a long lasting potentiation after a signal does with cocaine but what happened instead was that yes there was potentiation of the colonials there is also potentiation in the sailing animals relative to the naive group and this was a huge puzzle what was this and turned out through many many different experiment that it is actually because when you inject animals with cocaine you are separating them froth exactly anti a that crazy d this is what the way people of the experiment inject them a smiling you separate them the naive animals to stay there with their other wittier other litter ma i show show the control group the say m control group is actually a social inhalation condition by accident this control group that did not make sense was how we stumbled on to then we tried as novel cage it is not the novel cage it is the it is the social isolation and that is how we became a lad that studied social isolation as complete accident we were not sure what what we were looking at and then we mini we found these means and we manipulate these means and they produced something very different than other doeinerans which normally if you stimulate opeminerans these eventual big mental area mid random minions like nine see per son o the time when pep u here well talk about dpingans they mean these ones and there the ones where you press the lever stimulate the earth will press the labor thousands of times and my love to be sum in yes and if if you are a human and you do cocaine topmost people love cocaine they they want their very procsiocial when thereon cocaine and that is what dopemingerns were thought to be doing but these other dopeinerons in the dorsal safe that i will also says in the brainsten near to an aqueduct where you could detect signals from the body but these other dopeinans in the safe they when you stimulate them animals do not it they will not work for reward they actually will move away from a space that's were they are being stimulated condition place and real time place aversion i do not the feeling of these sirens being active please stop it and yet they would be prosodical and for a long time wit this was superconfusn we could not understand it and then just because at the same time we had a am a hunger study going on the lad we thought about it i can eat found because it silicious and i i want a eat the semen treat or i could eat because ism superlunary i feel shaky ones to eat this nasty i reward about a back backs om was brit and i need and by by bludsugger is dangerously love and so the is two reasons that you can eat and one of them is uncomfortable hunger is not comfortable you do not is not a good feeling to be hungry and so we thought about this and that kind of how we circularly came around to thinking i think we have discovered the lonely the lartnerans a sensually and what is loneliness and loneliness is this unpleasant reinstate of wanting sisal contact that would have this prososoul e fact as well and u that basically the very serindipitis luptyliv way that i came to be a studying how loneliness is represented in the brain amazing before we talk a bit more about these loneliness anurans and some of their in puts an out puts in the brain how has the discovery of these anurans u perhaps changed the way that you organize your day and week in life right if at all for instance are you more aware of how much time you spend alone verses with others are you more careful or discerning about who you spend your time with you i i ask this because u there is many examples for me in the nursing's literature where you i learned something new about how the brain works and i think oh yes makes a lot of sense why my sleep is in great i turns out that light exposure to the eyes at particular times of day really sets the whole body in brain and to particular rhythms that you will explain why i was little depressed when i was in graduate school staying up all my doing experiments and it'd sleep much of the day and feel home getting eight nine hours i do not get eat to nine hours now but him when i wake up early for me personally there is a bit of an anti depression to fact and as long's i slept the night before sis o disorders my a right you now i think as new information comes on line at least for me it is it is changed the way that i organize my life to to but in subtle or or in not subtleways the idea that there are anurans in the brain that in cod loneliness the absence of social contact does that have you thinking after a feu days of managing the lab ah with which is you point out you are very large lab lot of social interaction but it is work contact social interaction does that has that led you to think hay we should go out to dinner as a lab or i should spend time with somebody who is not in science er i should spend time by myself because have had too much social interaction ism not asking for strict erotically here ism just wondering if you are willing to get playing the sand boys of this with me a bum how this information perhaps has shaped some of your choices you personally and yet you very clear o not asking you to dice u know worse om has a changed your social wife it is really interesting that you ask this question and now that you not that you are asking this way i i i mean of course when i learn new things i i take them and implement them into my life but to be honest in in the cycle of of learning and studying an being curious and i actually think where i reside more is when something is going on with me my research programmed you no researches i me search it becomes what the it dictates wat the research programmed evolves into and for ex for example sis just end started studying loneliness ism a few years before the pandemic hit and then the pandemic hit and it was just a tap function change i went from ism never alone unless you call being in user alone r being on a plan and nags constantly people in my office even when ism going to bath o somas waiting for me out like ism not s am hurrying in the bathroom and never alone there is four people in my bed kicking me in the face ism just there is s much socialconic and then boom there would be a day i would not see another bat just the a not zero but just extremely sudden drop of social contact when there is no more work and was just at that period of time and it was it was very depressing it was just this huge i felt i was in freewill and it made me at first it was really deserruptive and i was worry about myself and then at some point i adjusted to it and the i go used to work i going a sort of a garden i gout of if i got just started a different life pattern that involved a lot of alone time and something in a long time personal life group where there was not any space for anything to grow before and then i became comfortable with it and then i start thinking out tat that is really wear the idea of socialhomia stacks was born this idea that oke why is it with acute social isolation humans monkeys mice you acutely isolated the individual from the social group you reintroduced them to the social group rebound of pro social fraction oh happy to see you there is all these affiliative interactions a cute burst of a affiliative interactions whereas with chronic social isolation in humans monkeys mice even flies you reintroduced in the social group and you get territorial behavior a egression avoidance antisocial behavior ism or just sort of a very different negative valance response to the exposure to the group and this maybe people brushed it off for a long time as just it is confusing this literature and consistent or maybe there is one model that makes it all make sense that is so ill homely homie stasis where you are used to getting this at a certain point and my effector system gets activated y i detect that ism alone it is i want more the deffer sits detected than my effector systems gets activated this another i start spinning all the systems that try to get me back into contact ism calling my friends ism testing my for ism ism if ism a mouse ism making ultrasonic vocalizations ism exploring outside of the borough and then if my friends do not call me back thaylike sorry we do not want to see any one till and of covet by in whatever it is it is it is not working my correction efforts are failing or maybe a certain about of time we do not know then i give up i stop i popcorn i stop going ow i just make a different life you the the the the do not you do not leave the borough whatever it is and there is in in animals and humans at least behaviourly there is a near step function drop off of attempts to you count see sort of date o then they just give up a dating after this one whatever happens there is some some straw that bricks the camel's back and the this person does want date any more or does not want to go out any more whatever and and what is that that adaptation then you are at a new base line you are you are expecting now you are neural ism ism expecting to have a gardening day at home alone not see any one and then and then much we will come over if feels i a surplus my previous optimum reintroduction to the social group is now feeling a surplus and overload over stimulated and that is i thing something that a lot of people experience this whip lash of going into the pen demit an coming out of it different people to different levels it depends on how much you isolated while you were in the pandemic but i think thinking about i you are social set point as being flexible an dynamic was a new concept to me and then in my mind the question is what is the part of this process that is causing all these harmful health consequences short in lifespan moon disorders et camera is it the initial detection that ism missing something and effector sister activation because if that was the case maybe i wan a banded that you know maybe i want if to get to get a pet get a get get a embody i do not know what you know you would have different prescriptions and at advice to give people if that wore the case verses you would give almost opposite advice if the thing that is causing it is the the set point at station and you want youwant to stave it off verses if you wanted to accelerate getting into the sat point which is better is it the adaptation or kind of tried of fix it and in one case you would want a es off the the having the set point happen the sebsipoint transition happen and the other ass rip it off a bandit could turkey just adjust and thenyou'l be fine then you will not worry about it then you will not be lonely any more cause you will just be comfortable being alone people talk about cognac of flexibility an and i think it is it is sort of that but it is social flexibility i want to be able to be alone i also want to be able to be in a large group and be comfortable and i think what have done if anything to change my life my all to accommodate these new insides have had is is to consciously create dynamic social experiences loss of social experiences yes but also protecting alone time which i never did before i just is t ti to give in away and i realize that having that just made my social homeostatic system feel more elastic and flexible and resilient and less crisis if something a very comfortable being alone supercomfortable began now and it requires investing in that relationship i how you framed a earlier i think we were not not recording it but the relationship with yourself as being a very important relationship and when i think about brain states we do not know that yet but my working model would be that different individuals we had represent their identities and whenever there present it creates a unique on sombre of that combination of people being present and being alone is also a unique state that cannot be achieved i have the brain state of being alone i cannot achieve it if anyone else is around and that is just what that is kind of the working model i have i think what your saying is ai sensual for people to hear because it make sense that loneliness would hurt it make sense that some people are more extroverted which i think is defined is a getting energy from social interactions and resetting energy through social interactions as suppose to introverted which by the way folks introverts myself do enjoy social interaction is just that we reset through more low or one on one time than we do in larger groups that is my understanding of the introversion extroversion literature we can revisit that but this notion of social homy stasis is i think key ah important enough that i think we probably one o we define it as many times or restate it rather as many times as is necessary cause if believe what your describing as a something that one would experience with food if we eat a lot were consuming three five hundred calories a day and then suddenly we only have access to eighteen hundred calories a day there is it feels a deafens it because indeed it is whereas after some period of time at eighteen hundred colors a day twenty two hundred calories a day feels relative abundance relative abundance when the pandamicet i certainly was unhappy about the state of affairs in the world of course but i recall feeling i oh can us i finally do not have to commute ninety minutes in each direction to standard because i lived in the east bay at that time u i fell i had time to do things i had not done in a long time and i thanks to some i was able to get certain things done not others then after about sixth months when i realize that this is on to carry on for while i remember feeling quite lonely and making some efforts to repair that i think social media not to harpoon social media could do either one of two things and i do not know which in the context of a socialhomia stasis either going on in stergrahm and seeing a lot of familiar faces and comments and accounts could make me feel am getting some social interaction such that than when i close that a and move to my work at my desk for something on which these days is mostly done slow that i would feel i had social interaction or perhaps it is the equivalent of u calories that then makes me feel more isolated when i am not in the a perhaps i find it to be distinctly different then the experience at last night of going to dinner with someone i know quite well sitting down and having a open ended conversation and deciding to close out the night only when we realize and we gat to get up to morrow for work when our separate ways there is something that felt very sating about it i wonder in this contact of sociahomiastasis wither not the analogy of social interaction to a colonic intake we could is there another dimension to it where it is not just the total number of calories of the total amount of social interaction but the quality of social interaction the type of social interaction that actually feels nourishment as opposed to just calories i love were your going with us and and when we wrote this review the first time were we nowhere ts conseptlling this idea of of how your social appoint can change they stop if if you are acutely isolated or a conically isolated and the access is the quality last quantity of detected social contact which is fuzzy and you now there is it is it is again one of the most challenging frontiers of this feel because how even if we imagined every single component that the brain can detect of the social the social conduct much of it is about expectation if i think i got a gesture if if i get a nod from the president only only no to the president is not at me o citing first as if i get a not from my partner m only got are they not at me with going on why why did i just get a not it i totally matters the gesture you need the identity there is many different credit if this does that me to all plug in to this weal to make it spend i think that ah that is one of the the i i think that is on keep us busy for a while but in terms of your question about social media and when you switch from you don't getting social metro feed back and then doing work ism i think i think it really depends i mean social media is such a large category you can have many different types of responses generally i think the bound what you when you say social met verses o real life interaction where you are with some one maybe you are touching ma we're not touching but even if yours having conversation ism you have interbank in crazy you are ism having a lot of it to ring s you are in the same place if but you can have interring sire even on the phone it just a voice call is actually a lot more interbrincincrany than then messages i think i think tax messages can bring a lot of anxiety and there is been a lot of commentary about that i and same thing with with with social me i think the the thing about social media that is perhaps ism the most harmful or net negative i think in terms of i when ism think about social nourishment i yours for making the term up on the fly here but i it is it is almost a withdrawal when social media is posted it is not to you its to everyone and you can be one of the people that receives this message but it is not even to on that not even talking you and ism doing something that is without you otherwise you be en this picture and not reading on social media listening to whatever it is a vote almost exclusively you are you are posting about activities that you are being excluded from and some as not even really talking you unless i be not direct message in you ut then a call i find of concern that different category if it is a one to one communication social met to me it is is a blast i it is not it is just catching up with some one in social media i i do not really see the merit of it because it'll just catch up with them when i catch up with them and there kensilcials we way older but i do not know i actually really catch up with the that jo see pictures of i dine i feel mixed about it because it is not a real connection and it does not for me sate my social appetite to catch up with to to look at someone ease's profile on on social media ism that does not actually do anything for the the connection i i do not know but i seriously doubt tons of oxytocin this released when i follow some one's feed about their indication i dunno i would i think that it definitely matters the quality and social media is is different then real life interactions for many reasons i to think it quick break and think ouresponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalize nutrition platform that analyzes does from your blood indaba to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health cols have long been a believer in getting regular bloodworm done for the simple reason that many of the fact or in fact your immediate long turn health c and only be analyzed from a quality blood last i major problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and forth but you do not knowhow to do with that information with inside tractor they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things metabolic factors lipids hormones et camera but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition behavioral modification supplements et camera that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you would to try inside tractor you can go to inside tracker dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside tractors plans again that is inside tracker dot calm slash hubormen really appreciate your willingness to a explorer in this a in this contact i think you are mention of the fact that am real life interaction involves interbrain synchrony could be by text scaling up from that by phone a face time or something akin to that video vidiochat am on social media there is comment space and force a although that is time consuming in its difficult because there is unanimity people r in different places times owns if you do not know some one its different contacts am ism really thanks to what your describing ism really starting to think about social media as different than in person social interactions were by phone or vidiochat social interactions and how those would differentially impact social homeostasis and it is leading me at least to conclude that at least for me that most social media interactions would create more hunger as opposed to a am sating of of the need for social interaction it is am i to be careful t the analogies here be act i can do this i as almost can to make analogy between a for pornography ha in person sexual intimacy i suppose there is something in between where people could talk by phone but we do notion explore this and anconctious we and then am sexual intimacy with with a with emotion with positive emotion those that there is a scaling factor and ism not ism not putting a judgment or valance ism ism certainly not that is not my place as a good friend of mine says ism not a cop ism not telling too what to do they cannot do but it is interesting to think about these a these circuits within us that create these what you and i in our field call appetitive the desire for or aversive the desire to move away from type responses and how much of our life side from you because you're regulating your social media and your a and your you mail and take but much of life now is offering us the opportunity to am tickle these circuits or even hit them hard with a sledge hammer but we are not thinking about these homeostatic mechanism of whether r not their creating more hunger form or more satisfaction from know and i i i cannot emphasize enough how critical this is and i think that is because ism somebody who does spend a fair amount of time on social media la i my work exists on social media you to but camera and i would hope that the work that were putting into the world with this podcast is creating as satiation of the desire for information rather than a hunger for more i do hope that but i recognize that educational material on social media represents it the e tiny tiny fraction of what is there social homiastacis i think is a term that if people have not already stamped into their mind they should be stamping into their mind and and doctor chi deserves credit for that i do not i will say that you do not have to have heard you say before you wrote in a review something akin to social contact is either positive or negative when it is deficient or in excess which is i think what your describing is is sociahomiastacis is that right when we talks about the quality and quantity there is just in terms of contact just amount of contact there is such a thing as just the right amount there something a thing it is too little dos such a thing is too much there is overcrowding right it does not matter who it it can be your family it just sometimes a lot an your family evenamtat the famous amdasco now think you are enlightened go spend a welkin with your parents no no disrespect moment but i think with quality it matters much like have a sort of same before the same gesture from the president or my partner it is going to feel very different to me whether that was a slight or a it is just it is relative to what is appropriate for our rank for our prior history of relationships for teethe environment of conducts and i think with social media in general and agree social media's grateful a lot of things i mean and i i think that having a podcast this that is accessible to the public makes research more sustainable i have a lot of things to say about silence communication that ism very grateful for but in terms of social media think about the mutual investment when you are interacting with of one on subsocial media what are they investing in this connection if i put out a post about my vacation that is public ism investing point zererzee we we serer her one presented i ban with to make con tart with you in anything and it is it its scales up from them if if you are making a voice call of some one you are giving them at least most of your attention for the time that you are on the call that is a lot right where is just thinking about the investment is another common there is the real time component and then there is the the investment upon it who is it coming from at matters if you are anonymous have really i cannot tell what this means a compliment from and or or a hate hatchment or a love comment from anonymous person i do not do this you i just literally do not know how to you know it does not really desirably do anything from because i do not he interpret it it is almost uninterpretable without this other to mention that my brain is has evolved to look for i think that is speculation but i think social media is is operating in a way that that it is not the logical and not designed to make us feel better it is just design to make us want to use it and i think have a lot of this comes down to things it a relative there is the famous there is the famous observations if of a moment monkey sees another monkey get a cucumber it is happy with the cucumber but if a monkey sees the other monkey get grape monkey wants grape you want you ant to keep up with the loses you want what if you see some one else having something yousuddenly it feels a loss that you do not have it that you don't even think of this thing the you need it right and i think social medias exposing you to a lot of things that you do not that it is it is this this premonish face you did not have there is all these things you did not know you ere missing that you did not need to miss out on and we have this whole project now if two projects one that is looking at social isolation and following what happens with social isolation across the time course to try to understand is it the amount of time or is it the amount of effort that you put into correcting that deficit u that that makes you leads you to the giving up kind of state change and another project that is about the quality of social contact specifically social exclusion a different kind of defies it you are with your other animals but there is is this you you know it is four animals have e our cage means and three animals are one side able to drink a chocolate milkshake and the other animals excluded and this one excluded animal well go up against the the divider and in look look frantic and you exhibit lots of behaviors that we would associate in humans with fear of missing out trying to reunite with the group try to get the attention of the group trying to get over there a lot of attending looks frantic and studying what we think is actually going on and i think that i think coming up with paradises to try to pro social isolation and we do not even know what behaviors animals exhibit when the lonely this is is is a challenging feel because there is now number of lover press that there is now there is no scrip to follow and there is no trial structure and for narrow scientist bursitis were trained to be rigorous about our statistics because of the sarcastic nature of enrol enrol activity n and how do we prophet things without a trial structure how do we bestitistically cigarettes when the animal is just free floating deciding whatever it wants to do and that is kind of the crusade that my lad is is working through a now t establish pipe lines and techniques and ways to quantify social behavior is and peel off all the cars i love where your lave is headed which just means were can t have to have you back on here again at some point in the future to get the answers to those questions that you are now addressing have long thought that we really know how we feel about somebody when something good happens to them are for them and i never quite understood this at the level of mechanisms how could i it's not o my lab of studies but you know think that there is a natural sort of empathy if one is a healthy a empathic person to seem a member of our own species and hopefully also to observing the members of other species experiencing some discomfort we do not that nor should we another human is in emotional pain right the wail or the cry of loss is one that just i think for any person who empathically tune is just or an animal you hear an animal in pain goodness i mean ism not here to dig no sociopathy but if if that does in evoke a at least some sort of response of hash what i would not do to remove that pain that their pain is your pain empathy a that seems a very reflective spirit rat least i would hope but when somebody experience is something positive i think it is normal and healthy to have a am grated set of responses if it somebody that we really love we may not even know them we think yet your you just a reflectively happy for them somebody that we dislike i think there is a more natural tendency belike a right that as as supposed if that person were in pain i would to think that even if you one did not them that you think that is ops ism really sorry to hear that u i feel there is some a symmetry in these empathic interactions there both empathy one has a negative silence pain the other one has plosive silence another member of our species or other species receiving reward and we can delight in that i mean i ism almost embarrassed to admit how many ferret and otter and racoon accounts i follow because i love seeing them eat i love seeing the little hands of the racon to some great rayon accounts by the way and i delight in it i like delight in it i want to see the racoons whin i do not know why i just i love animals and i suppose that is why do you think that there that we are a symmetrically wired for this you panic attunement can we observe that in other animals i realize this might not be squarely in the we house of what your lavish focussing on but i think it you relates enough to the topic sh recovering to day that you don't you to speculate om on what might be going on ye i i can deafinonly speculate something that we think about a lot but again i there's some there is some level of this which is semantics i i think of empathy is being defined as being able to understand another animals emotion and also taking it on i think something that is ultima different tan emotional contagion right i see a panic ism in a get it in it is not the same thing as a as as empathy an but the is often used in in sort of certain contacts feeling sorry for some one and it is may be different if for feeling happy for some one and this is something i was just talking about with one of my graduate students the other day why is there it is there an a symmetry in in empathy for positive negative or is it just what we have studied it is easier to study this there is a umber we do not know the answer but i guess another conceptual framer to put out there and not saying it is correct its i think just a a good tool for debate but it is not much that there good people and mad people and that good people are empathic and bad people are not a oms i quite simple i i guess the way i thing about it is whether you view this other social agent as having a lined goals are agendas as you or are they adversarial if there if there in an in your alliance whatever that means broadly to find verses adversarial you would have a different feeling and it is it is fusee this i guess i was just i e watching this i this is just sort of overhearing but this is a podcast not of primary research mourn also i can just say things ray i i watch some trash tidies sometimes and these reality competition shows words like then you vote the two best friends into elimination an they have they have eliminate each other o always to is but then the best friends and they look lately they and then it is basically mutually exclusive either you can care about your friend and feel bat not wanting to send them home or you you kick you just you it is game time and you u u compete and you can see different individuals wrestling with these two brain states and and how to we what to do but they're essentially mi mi mi speculation is that viouving one as a competitor and there an adversary they are standing the way of me getting what i want you empathy goes down it is a universally correlated to empathy if you are viewed as a competitor things that would contribute to you creating a model where an in a social agent it is in adversary as opposed to an a potential ally is really what it is going to come down to to the the degree that you feel empathy you the second some one you realized some one's out to get you no empathy now and no more i path for this person who i just realized is out to get me or something that or thin the case of being isolated for a long period of time you have learn to exist on your own now maybe every one sir competitor adversary i none of you as really helping me do my day my in only and you ice for anything i mean this food what i that teas just becomes different when your part of an ego system and you realize that there is consequences and there is there is of every action that you take every act of asterism will be recognized an there h another there is there is a there is some score being coped in your when your part of a society and and then when you are when you are not there is no there is there is none of that and i think the degree to which you are integrated in society it is almost the extra secular matrix this is villi this is at out there an enology tit when you think about snaps is being made connections between people there is also all the support material that facilitates certain patterns and certain connections for happening are not happening and and i think that is it is it is stuff that we have not quantified yet but it doesn't i think those things should be studied years ago i worked with arris kids and and a fair number of them had just arrived fry a region of the world that had undergone dramatic seel political evolution and change and it was remarkable because we would put out a tray of food to eat and then that the foreman was everyone would serve themselves and then you could ah got get more food if if you if everyone finished and a couple these kids that d come from these very deprived environments would just take more than there their share it was clear that by taking that other kids work an again any and and i remember telling them listen we all have to eat more o less equal parts and than we can there is more we can get more and it'll never forget the skids response he just turned me he said you cannot hit us and i said that is true i cannot get you nice and he said sir ism just going to take as much as i want and this took several weeks actually to work out i have gum yes of course i would never hit em and abut every one's is adversaries everyone is is adversary and it was remarkable to see the evolution of these kid's across that it was about three and half weeks at which point they actually became incredibly u good at sharing but it took a lot of work it was almost as if even though they knew more trays of food could arrive r ye ism not limitless but there was there was an abundance of food yin the moment they there were solving for that short hurt is in moment ye and and here were to him at human beings capable of speech and expression of emotion et camera and he understood the fundamental rule which was i could not hit him therefore he could basically do what he wanted without that consequence and the main consequence he thing right exactly and and i remember it was it was striking it'll never forget that and the evolution to a different more a altruistic state was wonderful especially cause of what i think what it did for him but but it'll never forget thinking this is a human being who essentially functioning an animal an animal night able dog mastiff and he was kind o other dogs but if there were unattended to toys at the dog park he was on a pickamot and he put him right in front of himself and is this was down sanyego needs sit with them rain front of him and on lie tortilla you are not in a play with all those toys another dog came and to any one we just sit in front of them but another dog would come and try and take one of those toys and he would hear these giant gets and you would om stamp down and drag it back and it seems that there are these very primitive circuits about a resource location and protection of resources that in the absence of understanding that there is a much bigger landscape costello century figured out tugs o fun game although most dogs could play tog with him there are few that could is a ninety bound bulldog hit is a back the but to see this in a human being was just striking i just at as your describing thus its this adversary verses a neutral verses a friend it is just striking in its god a be that that the brain as complex as it is have often wondered and our collogue maracas master once said that circuits in the brain a can broadly be divided into these sorts of circuits into yum ya and m a which is not far too simplistic right but whom it argue with the great carcass monster am and ism not going to but it is sort of interesting we sort of been our responses into yes toque let let us to operate or yes let us idea om er i think naan ye or or no way no chance mine ye verses m m and am as complex as it'd to think the brain is and we are and he maybe when it comes down to behaviors and how we interpret in put and a decision making am maybe it is really all about feelings of safety and feelings of am relatedness ye i think it is all about the epic experiential statistics that you have been exposed to this this boy who says you cam take a the because you cannot et i mean we do not know but that the picture that grows out of my imagination is this boys had a lot of expanses of people hiding them a lot of expel fences of not enough food and not a lot of experiences of strangers being nice to them not a lot of people that you can trust that is the that is experiential statistics that would fit this model some one you who common and big oh no there is more for ism to i you gates more fruit for fruit you now am to give you even more foot for it it the experiential statistics are you have come from a world of abundance with people are genera generosity being you have learned being generous can make you have a life long friend and all these amazing opportunities that make your quality that food is you never him up food again it is about the relationships because that is your experiential statistics and i think this is such a profound concept about about your science in the brain about our social structures and how they form what makes a structure a egalitarian or despotic were right how how can we as individuals take a structure that is is one format let says despotic hierarchy and evolve t into something that is more a egalitarian and i water whatever the the the levers and what breathe parameter spaces that we can pull on and i think these are questions that i mean it is hard to think of what could be more important i but that prospective of thinking about from experiential statistics i think really supports the need of of of diversity have not bringing in people to academe whole had very different experiences experiential statistics different bialies of what the can think is interesting to work on on study and obviously and every everysector of our society i think i how can we get more diverse sets of experiences represented at each decision making body that really matters i am in to that and also to be able to understand that differences in background experience u require that we we the early youmention theory of mind this ability to get into the mind set of others and inner of assume or presumes certain montes in order to hopefully he create ore benevolent environment for everybody i it requires you know realizing that some peoples social interactions or you now have been terrible or dramatic or it requires at a departure fromself essentially requires it hat this empathy or something empathy i in all directions right i mean in all directions requires that every one at least makes some effort to try and understand that i do wonder and maybe som what put on the comments on you you maybe it maybe you are aware say of whether not kids are being trained in that beautiful peri of time of life where negro plasticity is robust a although does continue to not the rise life seen it is especially robust early in life to to be in a healthy way impafically attend to be able to have theory of mind more robust theory of mind yes i think it is it is really forbidding it ism som ism apparent have to kids that are in public school and think their public schools rated it is fine i we won say everything with ai an i but but at the school they definitely do you get education about i more holistic health and a emotional regulation i think and in considering others i that is been that is at the big focus of the school and i think that is actually really important i mean again ism ism superb from for my upbringing but mi in re t to learn math whenever it is time to learn the mat to learn it whenever they need it whenever they needed t learn it an couple an o for weeks and figure out do the thing am most of the things of the learn the in to forget them and then have to relearn them i what are the things that you are going a really need to know no matter what you choose to do and i think regulating you are your own emotions in and in engaging other individuals in a healthy sustainable way that and i means to sustainable one terms of the longevity of the relationships and i think those are the things that and really mattering say i think i also this question about exposure to abundance and scarcity a is really interesting to i mean i now enough that the direction we want to go in to a please i think you know this sol you not street sound for a new age you when i say abundthe abundance mind set right i am you see this in people who are i recently divorce ore nearly single for whatever reason it is is the world of place where finding a partnership is is relatively straightforward with som work involved a where is it there is only one person on the planet for you hand they might be dead all ready y like is the plenty if some one else business takes off may be some one you when to college your high school with where the lab is doing really well you are seen them tremendously successful but maybe they meed a hundred million dollars in it in a new in a company acquisition do you immediately feel oh those are resources that i do not have i even tough ism not in that business i were do you see it as will that there must be a lot of money out there that i that people could earn in and potentially make i really prescribe and believe in this abundance for scarcity minds sat framework m i think there is absolutes the example we to talk about this the vivid that there is just not for there is scarcity of food fact of course there are individuals the experience scarcity of various s different needs but many of us we reach ha threshold of abundance and then it becomes relative we have everything we absolutely physiologically need if we are not comparing ourselves to anyone else but then once we were enter the social arena comparison is essential why do we compare ourselves to others it is it is in grain because social status to something that we need to attend to a large part of our or our brain is devoted to representing our relative social rank what is our place with sol son that what is the dynamic how do we fit in to the social landscape and comparison i think is just a way to do that that is that is been evolutionarily conserved perhaps for less of a good purpose at this point because many of our basic survival needs are met for the large majority of of humans on the planet to day not for everybody of course but yet what is the percentage of humans who feel they have everything that they desire how many people feel they do not want for anything and it is interesting because having things does not make you have an abundance minds that having abundance does not is not sufficient to give you the mind sent of abundance that is such an important statement i mean just it i do not think they could be restated enough you have studied social rank people here social rank and hierkee and i have to guess that let some means in their emigdela another airs of the brain get buzzing because as soon as people here social rank they i think naturally hurting will where mind the social rank and how do i feel about how that rank is established and and all sorts of interesting in important questions some people get very angry that there are billionaires on this planet the specially given that in most major cities you do notate to go very far to see people who have very limited a resources social rank is something that i think exists in every the mice you might work be even in the family their social rank i have a sibling i remember who got more of a of a piece of cake even slight difference in that way with something that my older sibling would point out am cause she was more effective tat getting in the slightly larger piece of cake alias until i was being enough to fend for myself and my friends with larger sibling pools in their family it was a specially compete on if you have ever gone to a meal with somebody who had a lot of siblings they fast they they dive resource allocation methods then if they were an only child guesses a one sibling the there's variation here ism generalizing but u but yet let us talk about social rank what we know about how social rank is organized in the brain how we perceive our own social rank cannon i we woulds chute which the modern sin son the snow i find it fashionitin i not were of any topic most any magic and i think this is one that effects so yah i mean it'll first say that social rank is something very specific to a certain type of hierarchy that assumes a linear hitch which sometimes forms but oftentimes there is different hopes of hierarchies that are flatter or more a morris it is not really clear who is who is the all on the playground an on others this click here the if you be done in right right t that i name it is not always organize the such but if you get animals into a sort of small space you will see in many species especially with in the male forming a linear hierarchy and we wanted to explore this and i think one of the biggest challenges wit studying social rank and this is something we struggled with as well is how do you control for the individual identity firs is the a the actual rank what i mean by this is let us say there is ha study that says that means in certain rain region fire to animals of different ranks according to the rank fire most of the ala less less less less down to he rank dos that is that tell us of this bring region in cot social rank maybe in a loose sense and ism sure that when rank issues come up a lot of the rain lights up for different comdifferent reasons but for example let us say the immigdala would respond more to the ala may be because it cop in cut social rank but may be also because what whoever is the dominant is the one who is most likely to have consequences and all of my interactions with the ala are relatively high consequence and ism sort of stressed out whenever ism time the ala attention and you remember all the in sections you have with your boss more than some one else there is an intention hierarchy subordinates attend more to dominance and there is it is almost hard to make this comparison because it is not all flat the the clean experiment which we are still trying to do its it is difficult to do the perfect experiment would be if you take an individual unchanged the rank for example i to use this example with brace mama such as indulging i know that this is from a while ago but once upon a time i met brace mama for a very brief moment when he was president and and may be there is somenerans that light up oh wow there is the broccobamaflash president arras but if they are identity means once he was no longer president if i was to be presented with brace mama then they would still fire if they were rank means then may be after he was no longer president it just these earns fire to whoever is president now and i think that experiment is very difficult to do and has not been done but we are working on at right now in a a another expel raiment where we take animals and there living in groups and we rank them all and then we re house them t everybody has a rank that they start with then we put all the alive together put all the basis together et camera that everybody forms a new rank then you have animals that went up rank when down a rank or stay the same for every group and that is something that were looking at right now initially you take a pool of animals and then let us you get you number one to three for just mistake omsomlessy mut si take the number four lowest in that itchy but now i make them the top of a new heart you it that is right got it and it is really preliminary and we will see what happens but where investigating it seems that when you take alias intermediates or subordinates and put them together to new pieces it takes them different amounts of time and the non it dynamics revery different informing the new hierarchy and in any con unpredictable way they your willing to share as to er i think it is too early but it'll just say i guess it seems the the intermediates might be taking the longest amount of time to form the hierarchy they do not know where they sit in tear they are for they were flexible or something where is the dominants there do it out and then work an a work at about there will be defeat it is quick the fight does not last at long subordinates we have to still observe this all still being we will see if everything replicates but certainly the dynamics are different what the exact redoubts wet you were working on what the features are what key features to to see but it is kind of uncanny because these are genetically in brad animals that are all house and these should be all everyone should be the same the critically but this makes me think that during certain developmental periods rank is shaping your long lasting development i think it is sigil similar phenomenon perhaps to the older child younger child phenomenon where if you are the oldest you go into the world t an you have lots of different roles you might be the bottom youegot to plan sport steams and been differ class than alias but the the the leadership desire slash potential skill seems to be correlated in a very non scientific all in the o the the number of presidents that is often old oldest or only children the type of things ut it is the loose correlation and there lot of other reasons why might not be behavioral but there is sort of fluffy fluffy correlations about that i think there something to it though when elasticities happening your this this becomes your most familiar state of assuming a certain role and that attractor state deepens with more time spent there n that is e fascinating have also observed and i think have seem a few papers to i do not know how rigorism these papers or that youngest let say not oldest siblings here were setting aside single the children that do not have any siblings but that youngest siblings a do tend to wouldn't c break the would more in terms of a associoin cultural norms of the family they they venture further in terms of experiences and valiant systems there often seen as um having had fewer constraints than the older sibling which may may not be true but that the youngest a siblings often will u take on risk that older siblings will not ye yeyetnd that certainly been my ow or not in forestry i mean am a young younger brother of a older sister u but and but then there was times in our childhood where she was out of the false end i was at home just some one am that tore change is things but and is very dynamic i realize a and her in an convoy lose space but i ah but i find social rank stuff to be superinteresting i grow up in a big pack of mostly boys the just count a how worked out on my neighborhood at the time and it was very interesting because it was very clear was a dynamic hierarchy where if we were skateboarding certain kids were ala if we were playing soccer other this we were doing anything artistic if it was i gan a geeky knowledge and and nutty snuff you know then might have been somebody else a ma the knowledge u and have the information that people wanted i think dynamic hierarchies are really interesting i think get us out of that sort of more standard ala on a chess beating tell on what to do dictatorial model i mean and this is now fully out of any since land and into speculation opinion land but i think that type of structure structure where when you are doing different tasks different individuals become the altar the leader because it is base on competent is very healthy i think structures where you have locked down this is that this is the hierarchy wear some ones the boss of you because of this one skill but there is all these other skills that they are not as they they are not superior the dishes don't not no outrank you at and and how do you work all that out and i think white's also something about keeping squalid what is what is the rank right and we did this experiment when we design a task animals are trained that a cue predicts reward delivery only one animal can get i a time its just a very narrow place if one animals getting you cannot get it then u we would have ant four animals that our cage mates for my sister cage mates and we would have two of them do get out at each point that we know the ranks the ranks are stable they have a rank twenty three four in the cage and everybody does a round robin ones first us those one for us trees to they flight yet that what they they do round robin in this reward competition task their food deprived and we we present rewards what is the what happens and subordinates to win some the times even their dominance when more all the they they consistently wen more and we found that three frontal cortical neurons you could represent very stably and decode which animal was dominant flat a regardless of the trial and then when you looked at whether we could decode competitive success meeting who is gong to win that next trial there is any trial every thirty or forty seconds and but thirty seconds before which is as far as we and measure as then were you loo cut up into the previous trial as soon as the last trial and even before the next triplane you can predict above chance says significantly which animals count win the next trial just based on the filtering patter in a prefrontal quarter that is right you can predict winners and losers you can predict and understand where they are in the dirty as well based on the act accusation of grants prior to the battle that is a recording from the a bynolegiis recording from the prefrontal cortexive to wat a business competitors more a marshal arch competitor n and you can predict who in wind based on the patter in a filtering in the brains prior to the competition that is right and that suggest all sorts of things number one it does not mean these competitions not independent there is something about the state of the animal and when we looked at is it just whoever won the previous trial that did not account for this and i thought this was really interesting but when you look at the emoting accuracy for a dominance first i subordinates about ah who will win the next trial for dominates it is stays pretty flat it just has to do with i think this is my speculation of our data that they they either are engage or the not engaged the subordinates the decoding accuracy is s love is above chance but then it shoots up somewhere around closer to the cue presentation and my speculation about that is that e subordinates are looking at the dominance the look at domino does not look that it does not all tat they can go for it there that looks her turning my omit homo it is it is not the both going outfit every time it is it is a calculation which trials o he is popping intention it is when you're driving and traffic an your try to find the the moment a cot over and you are waiting for the persons tat testing and there just there is a big face and that everybody just getting in you now you can just see you look looking for clues about the state of love of competition and then and then the dominance they are not looking at the subordinate they're just doing whatever they feel doing it is i get there a i think there's that one seen in madmen were something happened in the work environment and due and it was clear some one's account in sell or something in work out for one person person the other and i think one of the character says to a don draper who clearly one of the alias in that work environment by virtue of yet rolling and position says youkow i some times think about the way that you blank blank plan an black and he goes on this brief tirade about how used he was an and draper says i do not think about you at all and then the elevator i believe closes and it really cemented his status in the office as somebody who is really not paying much attention to what other people are doing his just making decisions according to what is going to be best for the fireman in some cases for himself and in some cases both so thing that is essentially what you are talking about yah i think it is it is kind of the nature of the structure that is what makes you the alpha is you are you you have you have other things that are occupying your attention and you are your visionary status hopefully if you are a productive successful of and first sustainable group and then everyone else is they do not we that soft need hap the bi picture they do not they do not it becomes the reinforcement scettulls different ism just looking for validation and i mi in my playing my roll o we it is e very different minds that i think as a scientist when you are train sometimes you are a supporting member on a team where you are getting instruction om would telling y what to do viruses the moment when you get your own project and maybe your borg mas el me e there is no one to command but no one's telling you what to do that is to me one of the biggest the rushholds to step over when you are becoming a scientist or an investigator is the first time where you just you something and try and experiment no one told you to do and it feels superhero o feels you are sneaking a round or something and and then i think i think in to days mentorship cain sometimes that that happens too at i think if we could have that experience happen earlier i think that would only be good for for the future of research i agree i was very fortunate that my graduate adviser ism told me look at in help you but ism going too have two kids while you are in the lab and ism not in be round a lots o you enough to figure out do not burn the lab down do not kill yourself with any of the poisons in the lab and the my stock adviser the late and great benbarris largely treated the post ones as junior professors from an early stage and i remember thinking he cannot control the experiments ism going to do this is up to me any an and a great number of us who were training with him at that time when on to have her own laugh i think ah there is really something important to that model and of course were discussing the research field but this could be exported to any number of different fields cause he what those mentors were essentially training us to you was to to assume the role that we would eventually have i suppose to be subordinates do you watch him empire actually just this week yet yesterday and the day be r before the a an suppose like interview who work at the tempts once vampire visited and interviewed to in my lad and type bits passel i have not seen him by my rede o the very top of my model god that on to spend the next twenty men talking about it but you see all sorts of interesting behavior vote very relit than to human behavior pierces yes but also altruistic behavior allopathic grooming i kiang in chip culture as have learned from the show assuming its accurate that who grooms who is very important and there is all sorts of interesting a maneuvers that subordinates make and there is all sorts of interesting displays of vigor that the alpha makes to remind people that they are the alpha and then as they age ore make mistakes of judgement the subordinates also will fain deference tibia oh yet you are the alpha you are really tough and secretly their plotting to replace the alpha wheaten i were joining out seen for mad man or big mut him empire which going to research laboratories or or any other landscape kindergarten i think these circuits are active in all of us and the sooner that we i acknowledge those and thine fined ones that generalized to the the goodness of as many a members as possible we are not down our task but clearly you are doing the task soda social rank o something that a we need to acknowledge no doubt which actually leads me to what might seem a desperate topic but one that i know we are both very interested in and that your focussing on now which is psychedelics because one of the interesting things about psychedelics is their capacity to increase norplasticity but also some of the psychedelics and i realize m drama is not a classic psychedelic but they are classified as impatience they increase empathy for self and others u what are you looking into with psychedelics which psychedelics and yet what brought you to the study of psychedelics and by the way have done participated in clinical because people wonder i have participated in clinical trials for a suicide an and m i am i do not recommend people do psychedelics re rationally i do think they hold great promise for the treatment of depression and drama but people need to be careful their certain people who could not and should not take psychedelics because it would be genuinely unsafe for them psychologically specially young people there is my disclaimer and but they are fascinating compounds tho i guys have always been interested in psychedelic i think i wrote my undergraduate thesis about it is just about hallucinations pretty spypsychodelic psychotic breaks and asleep and gets ta find a just comparing what is the common thread when our brain creates a reality that is not a actively there and psychedelics of course is away that we can experience that and remember and recall it a we that is very difficult with men sleep and and sometimes the psychotic breaks obviously gets i frenzy as not something that you can transiently give yourself and have that experience i think having the ability to move into other brain states is what makes it attractive i think the other component is the the hostility you can you can have an experience and perhaps the first hand experience is you haven't epiphany that you take with you it is life changing and your life habits are completely different for long lasting way after the singular experience is is kind of one of the things that makes it different from all of the other therapeutic treatments that we have got a most of the other ones it'd say and for me right now there is a lot of work going on the exploring psychodelixis a therapy for various different conditions disease states a i think that is great i think it is really important work ism glad a lot is being done on that i think my focus is is to turnover some rocks that might not have been turned over yet and just to get really down at e quantitative rigorous mathematical level of what is a hallucination for example when i ask this question what is a hallucination ism interested in the actual secular mechanisms are we just we think about heron's having signal to noise and your modulation as changing that are we just changing the signal to noise ratio and then pattern completing all the noise and that is what a hallucination is we just take that is where is reinterpreting noise and putting sort of existing maps everything's fitting to existing boulder map that we have already got that then appears as some hallucination u or is you know maybe just hae to be hallucination this also obviously some serious different thresholds of the psychedelic experience but all these clinical statements this human self reported qualitative descriptions of the psychedelic experience things be having just more positive outlook being o uniting one in self and other a sort of clarity of the world more labile in thoughts more flexible thoughts ah we are trying to just create actual ways to last them for example this idea about what is what is going on in your mind when you when your having a psychedelic experience all of these different states might feel more labile u it may be the transition probabilities between different brain states of a happy sad this is out maybe s just all looser and you can access everything because the transition probabilities are just high another possibility is that an mere it is dost dependent at a certain dose you go in to another brain state and previously we have son this in the same project that was just telling about rank on rerecording for presto cortical neurons and looking not all the behaviors and the behaviors for representing social rank we do not know what they are we used computer vision to extract a bunch of behaveoromotifes and than tried to understand what is the best model that would predict what the animals gan ado next not just wins and losses but all the subtle gestures are we going to fight are we going to give it up are we going to back off and predict the behaviors from pretend of cortical activity and the best model that we have found was something called hand in marcovian model which essentially just means that there are hidden states you might think of them as moods om you might give them some other name but all all all use moods loosely it is not perfect but om that is kind of one way that helps me think about hidden states where you have certain statistics of behaviors the you would produce if ism sad there is certain things imine to do it is a different statistics than o when ism happy different probability of going surfing if ism sad or happier thin for that we basically found that there re a certain umber of hidden states and if you are on psychedelics with that change the number of states or just transitions between them we also found in are presto cortical representation that there is of certain distance of the representation of self and other in this dimensionality reduced activity space for combo john to that just means there is a representation of self and other there is some quantifiable distance in in abstract terms in the brain and we can qualify if those representations get closer together and urge fuss of self firsts other that is something that we would want we would be looking for if you are putting psychodelgs on these are that these are questions ism interested in that under construction right now we are recording from om animals while we are giving them sells ban a using narrow piles recording recornaccording from thousands of barons om in prefer to credits and other parts of quarter was the the shank goes pilose places and looking at how om animals respond in a conflict tasks there is there is trials were there is a cue the predicts reward ace the pricks shock then there is some trials were both cases are presented and both outcomes are presented and the reason for this conflict trial is that actually if you give moderate to low doses of sells band or most drugs only animals can do this even on lots of different drugs most people can still eat food and avoid getting hit by this truck i mean their exceptions of course but generally speaking there is a lot of different reinstates where you can still do the these essential functions pretty robustly but it is about what happens in the more ambiguous sound what happens when there is a conflicts an and what do you do how do you when there when it is a little gray i think that is when you can see a shift in valence smart o that is something that we have been looking for an and trying to see if in clinical studies there exploring set and setting as maybe the factors that have in the past historically given very unpredictable outcomes for psychodelictherapies it is possible that it is sat in sitting it is also possible that there is individual variability it is possible that there are big markers that can predict which individuals would be well suited for the hypnotherapy and those are all things that were interested and i find the fascinating and i i just won a applaud you again for taking on these hard questions these are fairly high level questions m certainly there is a lot of a clinical trials exploring psychodelicsolic sell prison in their rule and treating mental health and there is at the same time a real dirty of studies exploring mechanistically how these compounds are working i mean i do wont to tit my hats all the folks that have explored then druidic changes and clear changes in a level of neurons and and on and on but in terms of these higher level states of self wrthversis other recognition in psychedelics you the those are tough questions that need to be addressed mechanistically and it is clear your doing that i i think this this notion that your testing of whether not psychedelics reveal more accessibility or lability as you described it of between different states oh wow i cannot shall move from sad to happy there is there is a rout for that manna experience that isn't moss being told that my when your feeling sad feel your the feel of psychology especially pop psychology is in a real crisis right now in my opinion because were told tot feel our feelings but then we are also told do not react our feelings which sounds great but if those feelings get intense enough that is very hard for most people to do it is feel your feelings but do not stay within wat that there is the cathartic model feel your feelings and and get them out screaming and et camera and then there is the the now the more you engage mineral pathway the stronger that neral pathway gets and therefore you are piston a feel more anger there is a lot of conflict right now in terms of the popular psychology version of this you whereas the the clinical feels i think have it at an understanding that has not been translated i think one other thing about psychedelics that is interesting is that the transitions inter states is also more labile i give you start feeling a little sad there is the potential to feel very very sad and to going to a state of sadness of an intensity eve never experience before which by the way could be there vertically beneficial am i think there is some evidence for that provided their adequate support before during an after those sessions but i think most people feel when the not on psychedelics will feel emotions that are in comfortable and will do all sorts of things to try and avoid those emotions i ism not speaking as a inclination here but i just again i think what the the a the range in specificity of questions hat you are asking about psychedelics i find exciting another a a reason it'll say that you we went to have you back to to discuss those findings when when they come out let us talk a little bit about you look ummi've known you for a while but to be of i think is the longest conversation we have ever had which is one of the reasons i love doing as podcast to get the sit down with colleagues and have intellectual slash other conversations of of substantial depth that i would not have the opportunity to have elsewhere i know enough about you however to know that you have been involved in various things new us a puerperal the science but you have other interested well i as i recall you have been a you will instructor r where you have been involved in the i con o wellness fitness a community index stay tell us about that and then i molt o curious about u how you structure your day your routines given that you are apparent of to young children you run a very large laboratory operating at the very highest level and of course you value important things relationships and relationship to self and health and all these sorts of things i not to make it too open ended but and tell us of tell us of your interest and and of your relationship to wellness and fitness and well be y i guess i think i everybody comes to there their calling in in some what feels a path you could nave verdict but wenyou look at outside i guess both myparends are professor for does not look supersurprising that ism a professor but that no how it felt to me when i was in high school i was a total revel i just treaties and my house we hands were there everybody listening it is not i do not recommend that but i just cared about i just cared for having fun and sports and i think school was not may be challenging enough for me at that time i did not necessary recognize that that was what it was but have always enjoyed being really active and that is what makes me feel good it is i i i definitely agree with stuff you have set on your podcast about having exercise routines in the morning that billy influence the rest of your day i i did not always exercise the mong at different phases but y after i was an undergrad i took some time to travel around australia back back round australia live in some very remote places spend some time living in intent then i was a yoginstructor then i i went to grad school on the barrio i had a very active a hobby of i was the seamy professional break dancers very into breakdown red rerealaria yes we did half time shows or i guess tactically third quarter time out shows at trial stadium for the golden state warriors i was the one girl who could do wind tell they would use me the in mills som yo to goes yet yet there is some very mediocre forage of me break dancing and i was just really into it but i think that is where my work life balance passion comes from i talk about it a lot i think about it a lot and people say me all the time well you is is really true why why you preach all this work life balance stuff hand you must have been a work had atsoppoint your life and i think when i was younger i definitely did not the idea the you had to only be one thing i wanted to be many things i could not decide it was if you shapes can be a writer i was going to be a yo instructor was going tit be i never really thought is can be professional dancer i just was not good enough and there is not careers to be made from dancing really it is very difficult but how a lot of other interests and i wanted to prove i do not know who i wanted to prove it to i think myself at first and then eventually it made me may be feel like i should may be prove t to everyone that you can have a very whole life and not sacrifice everything you soft have to choose between family and career or personal life you can half them all you just have to decide that it is a priority and own that and make those choices on and a daily basis and come down to time management and it is been a very even though it looks oocagieouslys to have fun and how el this other hoboes it it is it is important because i think that we need more role models in especially in academic science where people bring their wholesales to their job and even tough your do is a very specific thing um because you have a roles a mentor and i suppose the went or apprenticeship relationship as evolves then there is have you a lots of comes abut that to in academia i still think ultimately when when i was working in someone ease's lab and i definitely looked up to them they were the roll model obviously ism looking at yes their science bum looking at how they make this old work how you how were you doing this how how do they live their lives and how do they approach balancing it all and i does i just wanted to put some more dato points on the on the scoreboard wore people a having lots of hobbies in other non work activities while still making meaning for contributions and it does not make you less of a he less of a scientist or less of a person because you are a whole human if anything perhaps you make people better shines ya during exploration of you go and er breakdancing inform anything about your your result up was it really bout resetting a your mind an body and healthy ways that you could return to the lad feeling excited about returning to the will i think have always been of the mind set were sometimes things do not go well an a certain arena and it is it does not feel good to have all your eggs in that basket stuff goes wrong sometimes experiment doesn't work sometimes you find something out you lose he whole days that it is bad news happens in the cabin m i think just wanted to versify your portfolio that your happiness portfolios not entirely based on your accomplishments at work i think we just want to have more elements and the same thing goes for at one point when i was really into dancing i got a very serious injury and it took this huge part of my life away from me ism glad had work thank god i have work you i have something i can do else in i just think having a lot of different parts of your life make you more flexible more creative more awake more engaged and when i do not i defile have been a work frolic when i was appose i can a sister professor period definitely t did not make enough time for myself to have of a richer a rich personal life at certain point and very quickly i just wither away into what shell of a human a shell empty shell of the person i used to be and it is noticeable everybody can feel it you cannot present every one that works with you feels it eventually and i think that is a big thing and as have taken feed back from my anonymous lab surveys and other other forms of feed back and just reflecting it is clear i taking your life style in to and having agency over designing your life style to be i deal for you is superimportance a typical day for me a might look ink at the last fork day its and say i soft actually i is early high tides i got a wake up in the dark pack of my bags goes surfing and then get home before serf see my friends in the water and i think surfing is a lot of things it is exercise it is a cold plunge it is to toms some of your favorite things may be a little but meditative may some social community than and i go every time at the same day there is the same cup of people then i go home make the kids er snacks breakfast drop him off at school then i go o lab and then run lad meeting and have meetings most of my day when ism at work is spent meeting with people drawing on a whiteboard mostly meeting with my trainees is what i to spend most of my time on of course there is herself that gets in the mimic administrative whatever and than come home at a pretty early hour pick up my kids mic dinner and then go to sleep con early conaboring these days that ismetiple day sounds exciting to me sounds exciting to me i think a if one were to stay up la than one feel sleep deprived if they wake up early if you wake up late your missing out on the early morning sunrise the serve all that have never served ashy once i paddled out once when i was in college an a there was no serf paddle back in but keep hearing about this surfing thing and people seem to love it that is one of my concerns is that if you fall in love withthat you can spend the lot of time out in the ocean what clearly it is all serving you well and a i must be wonderful to be a child in your home i can imagine how much fun it is and how interesting it is you mention several times mentorship and trained and it is clear that u reshaping the landscape of science for the next generation coming up is something that's of real passion to you i take great a pleasure in asking this because you know it was not long ago that you and i were graduate soon and postocksin more or less the same ventage right and as is the case people retired people die this is the reality of life and people move up up the ranks as you have what are some of the things that your most passion about in terms of shaping the future of science in particular research science but may be more broadly and what a you doing about it i think that she the academic culture has evolved and and i guess i should start lies just saying first i as i was driving over here as is beautiful drive and ism just thinking it is cool that we get to do this for a living is not it amazing that studying whatever i find interesting to me is something that i can have a secure drop for and then just thinking about cool ideas and directions and talking about it self that i would do for free is is really my job and i i just seem grateful to have that and i think there are lot of beautiful sides of academia that sometimes do not get the air time that they deserve and of course is a lot of human gloom there always has been when i was gratututing there is lots of demand gloom in the ether there is plenty now i think perhaps it is become a little bit more dire the plight of academia write now ah there is been a nation wide drop of stocks in general there is a just a mass access away from academy to industry and i think that reflects the changing environment and i guess when i was a graduate student i have this book in my death more called advice for you investigator written my demonic hall which is a great book it is then it is a quick read it is got some whims whimsical annicdoubts an some some some important insides i think i also a lot of masageny very much glamorizing for workaholic tendencies and there as definitely a picture of a scientist this was the way to succeed other options not really offered and and i really struggled with that i had a lot of imposters in drove coming up through i mean i some one asked me whole when did when's stop having impostor centrum think maybe twenty twenty one very recently i think i spend twenty years of my career having imposters from wondering if i was good enough if can make it i gan to a have what it takes an constantly doubting and questioning it and i think that it would have been nice to to not feel alone at that period of of my career i think some of the things that were described in this original book we are really important for academic research to be born as a thing how do we make this be a thing that you can get paid for how o we make this be a job that people get to have and then at this point i think most people would agree we need science science is important we want a we want a we benefit from science and i think at this point it is not clear that we need a need as as much as we did before it is not we are we are looking at a crumbling academic culture where where we are struggling to retain people and that is it is not it is not a great sustainable dynamic i think trainings are not getting compensated well enough or treated treated well enough that it is an attractive choice and i think we need sort of make a change and nothing wrong necessarily about about the intentions that were sat hundreds of years ago but things change and we are we are we are now and thinks our taking very quickly am i i guess i get to make one of my childhood dreams which is to write a book come true in a i get in in one of the benefits of social media i did have a treat and of just sort of spontaneously ranting abound about how this book is problematic ins very is agonistic and maybe we need another book for other types of people and that makes people feel more included um and and and this treat when around and it is i did not expect an i did not expect anything to come this ism just living my daily life and then my deemsudly had literary agents and a bookdeal and the gay ism now in waiting this book and ism not me about half way through but i think the the goal of the book i do not really have time for this project to be hon just but it is such an important project to me i think that i i want a see academia be a one of the healthiest places why is it second only to the military in the pervasiveness of sexual mist conduct and the to ye ye did that actually in o factoid is academia is the military is worse in terms of sexualmest conduct retaliation issues that occur but academia second and i an t makes you wonder what are the parameters that make this type of abuse rampant i think one of the obvious ones is the clear ranks how stable the ranks are how the power structure of academia and the military very fix not superdimitable not difficult to move these the ranks are there there and the power structure is very screwed and those are the ingredients that facilitate abuse and i think in the military i could see a very good argument for why that hierarch that strict rigid hierarchical structure is necessary there is not time for making mistakes get it but with academia there is there is time there is were what we were not it is not a war were we are just studying self that we think is cool why is a such a rigid hierarchy with such devastating consequences necessary i would argue maybe it is not and i think have been spending a lot of time thinking about this for myself have been have have found this professional leadership coach i i love and just thinking about sustain ability how do we make in a sustainable ecosystem and it is not something you find in a lot of leadership management a literature that i that have been exposed to do it'll take it'll take a note from from the the ponces and say if any one knows of literature that talks about developing sustainable ego systems within leadership of management have loved to here about that in the comments but i think that is a big hole people think about making thing stable the power structure hold be stable but actually being flexible in dynamic is what give systems resilient and inflexibility u to to survive and write now ours all the cracks in in the towers of academia are showing and it is time to to see if this is are we get adapt and survive or are we can crumble the lot pay there item grateful that your drilling install that with ism sure the same rigor and em attention to asking the really critical questions are you have in your lab certainly i observe the landscape changing very rapidly i think there is also a lot to be learned and to explore that exploits to other professions i certainly believe that the more first time opportunities to experience the beauty of doing research and biology in particular to that is what in familiar with ism the more likely that we are as a field of research an science to make more fundamental discoveries in other words the more people that get the experience of trying science doing exploratory research science the more likely we are to pull from that pool and in that pool there will be people of competence a talent and also gifted which is at for increase the the size of the net them and the net of course is netting something very specific which is a you and i both know that wall training certainly matters knowledge is important that ultimately love of craft and passion and just being tickled by that research bug once that neon that gets tickled that lets us see something for the first time or know something u down the microscope were in a in a date a plod or something there is there really no going back i i i want to be very clear that i loudly applaud your efforts to extend the experience of research to people in earlier you are telling me that you are doing this that many of the people in your lab our first time researchers they dine come through the pedigree of research ya know do a lot of outraged about twenty five per cent of my lad the summer was the first time metric experiences and we have been really privilege to have the band with to support that am i will say though i mean on the same tip i think what you have done with this podcast is incredible you have made millions of people who did not have assess to science or nears is be fascinated with arsines and now imagine what if every person that lesson as podcast and thought this is is a great podcast i was to get to some nearest idea could do it with some potful time what if they could contribute in any just whatever level that they wanted you that much more contribution that were currently messing out on because there is many barriers to be able to contribute to science that i think u removing the ones that are really there as fellas the one that are just perceived to be there is powerful but i mean the podcast is proof the prof is in the pudding the proof is in this podcast how many people could fall love with sins if they were given a chance to w thank you for that it is indeed a labor of love for me and and there are opportunities me will provide only to a couple of them where a certain projects in the science a crowd sourcing data and apsis is really quite f n there is the atone project were you trace morons is she very very pleasing can do awolistening to podgasera book kids can do it your your tracing these neurons busy filling in lives a gathering book you are contributing to the cancellation of understanding the structure of of the brain n cleanse human brain and without that crowd sourcing it is just nocking a happen main their efforts to make machine learning do it and to do it through a eye but that there is a lot to be gained from having actual humans do this that those tecnowledges do not quite yet approximate well provide a link to to some of those projects but this in k doctor ti of course i want to thank you much first of all for coming here to day and sharing much knowledge and also being willing to going to some places that were by virtue of my questions always the speculative and and and really think about those and and and address those through the lends of of deep mechanistic understanding of how these circuits work and to make it clear to people your enthusiasm for science is infectious in the most positive sense of the word and i know that many people i are going to benefit from from your knowledge and also from the work that you've been doing in your laboratory and i have seen your star rise and it is a still going going going and it is just remarkable and extraordinary but i must say not at all surprising that and your advocacy work and for all you do and that you are doing i just behalf of myself and everyone listening i just one extend a genuine and really heart felt thanks thank you thank you men ins then such an honor a the o ma you man podcast it is legend a thank you much

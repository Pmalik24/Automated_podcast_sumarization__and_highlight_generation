hitheverybody e you was sing et our podcast the internet there are words in this episode that we have beeped if you prefer a beep diversion of the show you could find that out a depside this america life at work hitheverybody i glass here it is smart life am to be easy chico just here for a minute to say we have a special show for you to day one of our producers on a offer wall as been reporting a lot on education at schools and three years ago she did this stop this about a part of education everybody knows about but i think we do not talk about much at all not away the feels anything and this one of my favoratures we have ever done and full of surprise turns to twists on i do not one waste any more time here setting this open just on a hand over the chotojona we can get to it here she is less and angel are both teachers both in the branch and new you city both relentlessly energetic women who make generous use of their arms while talking they met years ago they liked each other in two thousand five list and angel were part of a programmed that brought their two schools together sort of a class room exchange kid's from lists school would see angel school and vice visa they thugs their students would get a lot out of meeting each other and learning about one another schools the cause their students spend their school days in two very different places these a green bound school university heights high school is a public school it is ninety seven per cent black in his tannic it is located in the poorest congressional district in the country the south branch angel vassal a school fieldstone is also in the brand but it is one of new york cities in we private schools it is seventy per cent white it is known as a progressive school one in five kids gets financhlad which is helpful because last year tuition was forty three thousand dollars these two schools worth three miles from each other ut the students basically needed a foreign exchange program to meet each other the tucker started by having their students right letters to each other they were pen pause for a while which was going well and then la and angel plan a time to get them together list the public school teacher says the moment her kids got off the bust fieldstone the private school they had a dramatic reaction to what theysaw they couldn't leave the campus they felt everyone was looking at them and one of the students start screaming crying this is on fair a this miss i do not want to be here ism leave i leading right now an going home we are melody it is o ka you should stay with the group let us talk i know some contacts university heights the public school these kids were coming from it is small and friendly they are no meal detectors but it is a public school in a poor neighborhood the kids share of building and a him with another school the private school fieldstone has an eighteen acre pampas on a hill stone buildings are connected by landscaped paths every few windows is the size of a garage door there is a dance studio in art gallery a pool on that first day the public school kids almost all of them porter kin and demanding kids from the south branch walk on to the campus look around at the quad the trees see the schools mission etched into the stone arches angel the private school teacher from fieldstone came to greet them and immediately noticed that one of the girls seemed upset and i went over to talker as idling and that she jumped up and she said we've got a get to here we get to get at here w get o get at here and i thought it was a choke at the beginning i did not realized and it really was i mean she went white completely white you'll bloody from her face and her friend was holding ears e colonel smiling called ellmility it was just unlawful situation none of us hand had anticipated such a wrong reaction r there are hundreds of programs right now that are trying to do some version of this exchange program the help people connect across a growing divide for a lot of students america public schools are more segregated than they were a generation ago not less the gap between rich and poor is wider than is ben since the great depressions physically whatever gap you hereabout income gap achievement gap we shall divide these two groups of kids from university lights and fieldstone exist on opposite sees and just seeing across that divide something many of us never do can be incredibly powerful in this case from the very first few minutes it was definitely dramatic this incident when the kids visited fieldstone happened ten years ago and i heard this story from many different people the teachers kid's from both schools malison poland was a junior at the private school fieldstone at the time she remembers the girl who freaked out peoplewere what happen that was weird but nobody really it was very behind the scenes even more she remembers the feeling she had seeing the girl free out feeling helpless it is uncomfortable you cannot help so one not be uncomfortable ah you no one wants to we thou on the hill school on the top of the hill on the pop it is uncomfortable but at the same time i told that er she where she was coming from terms of it is must out it is crazy our educations have been drastically defend and that is completely on far but what you do in the moment when your soon high school student an you do not have the power it'll have a i could not be call apoliticstion in that moment and change i do not octal making change to take a long time a lot of keelson wants do go on to my politicians an run well didn't in the nor times and host evening news programs and design major america cities in part of the point of programs these that try a bridge the divide is seeing as the private school kids will likely go on to be important influential people may be it education police for finance new businesses it is good for them to know not everybody's life looks theirs but of course then there is the question what i the public school kids get out of it wait now there is a popular idea an education it pops up all over the place about exposure that exposure is part surely important for poor kids not just important that it can change destinies you take a group of kids to tor a college campus they will be more likely to go to college or if you just know some one who went to college that will help the idea is if you want a kid to move from one social class to another that kid has to see what it looks over there on the other side exposure is a tool for social change and economic mobility or it just sucks you see how much you did not get an its shocking or painful and you free to that one girl meany the people who run programs these hope that even if it is up setting in the moment ultimately this kind of experience helps more than it hurts but nobody really knows because this is the kind of thing that plays out over time it occurred to me that the group of kids who were part of that first year exchange between fieldstone and university heights could answer this question does it hurt or help the public school kids it is been ten years they are in their mid twenties now they have gone to college got an apartments and jabs in it turns out this one experience really has shaped some of the publicscol kiss in profound ways was i did not we coming to days show what happens when you see the other side and at life a lot better what's begin with melody the girl who freed a i wondered about melange because she had such a strong immediate reaction that everyone remembered but also because listened to what happened after that apparently meany start a crying the moment she got to fieldstone wanted to leave but the teachers managed to calm her down and for while it seemed the moment had passed and they were fine the partnered all the students up the university heights kids could go with the fieldsman kids to some other classes arena etlesteane a fieldstone to told me the girl who shadowed her she does not remember her name but other people told me it was melody marleena has never forgotten her i remember we were studying an lit the enlistment ah i w were ti were looking at it through paintings and i remember her making connections between the painting and enlighten fire philosopher is and closing con lock and just schooling all of us you do not making connections i would have been completely in capable has taking and is clear the smartest person the room then after waling everyone in this class with her intellect melody left ran away she found the experience of being at fieldstone upsetting she ultimately could not stand to be there and lest green barn her teacher told me meany did not just run away from fieldstone that day she also seemed to run away from high school she does not remember seeing her much after that i would love to know i would love to know how she feels about who she is and if that moment in her life in any way shape the way she thinks to day less told me she had no idea were melody was but she said you known you should call ashes palace the was money's best friend she will know what happened oh me a any

know but rashly says she musthave how else do someone disappear that unless they make it out of the bronc and never looked back there is a new york city number listed under meany's name but of course at ha at a time where i any inconvenient o make had there is a woman with the same name who manages a real estate firm an corpus christy there is a gentle lab technician in harrisburg an executive office professional and loss vagus a woman on twitter who i think lives in mexico and has devoted her account to retreating just in beers twit her account they all seemed to be about the rate age all not her a background check on meany's name was a current and former address i went to the current one she does motive there sent letters to boat no on rashly her friend from high school gave me a couple names of people she thought might have kept up with meany and top of the list was able burial their high school history teacher he is porter began meany from the neighborhood ashes says we all loved able but especially meany e o i it is gonna jofywal the reporter all tat her how are you ye cole the pop cabo people cold to me to about in got how re you able said meany is one of those kids you remember because she was very very very smart three series and full of potential she stood out to him for other reasons too she is a bet at ye i e pesto o o however a i at she hat w a peeseaat i she in not i think she she hat pat a scoop it we e for yusuga a om a let to a bat en i alone and old not a enure in tat e at a i i i we sat she we was skin that of the whole o poking o in i think she cut u hat e personal i she cut it ha stop tat in a slogan you were just busy in happy to see you just hang on a second she had you beck she coming t in cat ha probably alley to hold a poke f i an she i we what waves she a and a never so i began contacting former classmates and i became sort of upsets because it was weird how invisible she was every one else was superheavy to find these far twenty five heralds and we have the inner net and the classmates memories of meany were all similarly mythic she spoke her mind she was brilliant she was fierce she was going to make it and no one had heard from her weirdly the one person i contacted who had a real idea of what happy in a many was the teacher from fieldstone the private school angel visas some one told me angel had taken a special interest in meany after she got upset at fieldstone and a deck leader when i met angel and first asked about meany she started crying no angle got a box of tissues then sat down i had a real s spot i still hat a us tot so that kit she was smart yuan really smart i do not know she realized she knew she was powerful but i know she knew she was smart after that first encounter a fieldstone angel tried hard to gain melody's rest i think she felt partly responsible and she really e wanted to help meany even though she was not meany's teacher the program kept going throughout the year angel would bring her private school students over to the public school and sometimes she would visit on her own and every time she would make a special point to check in on meany the last time angel ever saw meany was in the public school angel was over there visiting and lilies the college adviser comes in she walked in and meany was really on a tear about ta white bitch is and they do not know anything about the world an lilies walks in and e she waves a piece paper and she says meany come here meany goes up they fifty people the room she says a middlebury accepted you'll scholarship and meany's started crying i strike hi you added we was excited you known lilies she said we made it we made it we made it you to incredible news and middlebury we are talking about a serious serious school school scholarship and meany buried her face seen lily's shoulder her and they hugged for such a long time that you do not wan these hugs it must have been a two minute hug and cilia was swain her round and meany had hearts round her and i thought that is great and you knew at that moment it was moving because you knew at that moment meany felt safe and that is when meany to spear because she did not finish the less month of the year she disappear to this say that do not know where she is ah she probably just got scared ye she got into middlebury but she did not go she did not finish the less the month of school either she left you literally disappeared no one could find her i called middlebury to see if maybe meany did attend they said no did she get in they said we have no record showing that she received an offer of admission i did not know if that meant she was not admitted where they just had no record either way but that is all they would sect and this was strange because angel had such a vivid memory if meany getting in and angle herself went to mddlebury she probably did not mix up the name of the college bless the college adviser at meany's school seemed to remember it at this point i went back to meany's high school friend rashly and just asked if it sounded many to sike herself out that and she said no way i only made it to my g d but meany was singularly focus on college she would cursed me out when i cut class when it came to dow from me her i you now what hare not i a boy meany was not going to fail at high school she would go to college with no babies and live far far from new york city period you can scything when it my refilling picked up or we port a pointy neighbor go ahead death record all right i can help you learn how to request o participate for i gat reported i i did not think meany was dead but a friend asked and once that lived was planted i could not get the idea out of my head the same day i went in person to the city's office for vital reforge i also went to an old address lesson on a background check one it'd sent letters to she was here the buzzer did not have meany's name on it and i press it anyway no answer stood by the door to the going y seven meany ta his girl friend she is at work rescore shend she did it me me she told me she call when she got of work she did not want to tell me anything more but he did tell me malady worked at a super market on six avenue it happens to be around the corner from my office it took three days for meany to call me and when she did she carefully said have given this a lot of thought and ism ready to talk i cannot for weave you here i en believe ism here ye a i ere ell i mean i i looked on the inside a means you do not probably something that people organic here people are on to listen too if they could see we they know i difference ism differ sitting here with a blue green here she is us a wearing pink set pants and a body her hair is actually under a hat all i can see our some green banks picking out the they she is talking about that is you listening right now any has considered you a lot who you are how you will hear her i asked melody about the visit to fields tan pretty early on in our conversation but her answer began with her first day of high school she says she was just one of those kids who always loved school she got good grades and she would been anticipating high school years before she got there she had a clear image in her mind of how exciting it would be she would become a better river read read and read and go to games maybe join the dance team and er first day a freshman yer well i remember going in and i was just what is this alike this is got to be a joke wait the school felt a job ye completely i was sitting in the class from with seniors when i was a freshman they did not even have a man be course with maybe and em it the second level to muff a u i would say drive till i taking told an imagery your even sis sis six o something that they do not offer any i p classes another thing that was really tormenting to me was that we did not have library and i love books this is was we have really in a poor part of the broncs were we are not been considered then in tenth greed nowlanye'se english teacher said they were going to start a pen pow program with a school called fieldstone noway was open to it she wrote a sincere letter describing herself and her dreams and climbed on to the bust with the rest of her classmates to go to fieldstone what happened when you went there we when we went there we would look a bunch of hooligans i was they wed looked the goodies walking in you do not washy building i felt you knew we were from the law who are these settle kids working an you know just we knew we didn'fidend we did not look the dresses student it was a very organ i school wait what is you look what you me me you well when i went there i had bright red hair cherry read tardy boy tumor which was a female rather at the time i had my nails supenoke it her really colifool when colors on them all of us for orders everybody thou old orders is the big shame you could tell that you knew off the back these suns are not from the school what is you feel that day i fell a watched as girl from the hod they hall i do not belong the just full i have no business in this building dam bemamodem they would just a see of white blond blue green eyes i couldn't possibly bring myself it my body to actually engage with these is i did not one engage with them for many university heights kids i talk to seeing fieldstone was shocking because of the stark difference it was a surprise they could not have imagined a place fieldstone for malady it was not that malady had imagined it this was what i invasion as high school what these kids are experience this is what i wanted to see myself going to as high school experience ell that is what you expected a yet to be definitely you did not what felt surprising to you just this is the first time that ism seeing the thing tin real life that i thought was what was on a walk into inthcade yep an alibis cote this private this is everything kind of is a fucking lie that you see your whole life growing up on teeny shows or movie is locate this is not free this is not available for kids of color this is something that only privilege or the ale a have i know i looked at it and i said while i know that were only being told to flip burg's and burning or macdonals or to who doors for coolness them that will probably live in those buildings on malison avenue and will be wearing the uniform servicing people you thought that when you were at fields definitely well that is why ell is when the shit hits the van you imagined your ye yet seeing what we would all be as a felt that what she found upsetting it seemed that the people around her must believe that this was the natural order of things malady knew there was no nine difference between her an a kid born in to well she could see that this division were all inborn too was not a reflection of her in fear worth or ability she just id know what to do with the idea that she might be alone in seen at o er seseeseseese ererseresersresesees we es erases eyes sreserssese but malady had her own plans after field stench as soon as she could get out of high school and her plan did not involved hoping doors she had enough credits to graduate high school early as a junior i just when i heavy up and get my high school woman to say here ism educated i got it an when i get in school for year school i already sold myself would messes agree which means sixteen to twenty for eight years yep check meany's vision was clear and the results around her could see it too dobla murder the teacher and all the teachers at her school knew the job was to fill in the gaps make up for the fact that malady did not get to be a fieldstone kid and get her to college any ray a few months before graduation the high school guidance counsellor hominy did alary for something called a pussy scholarship the pussy foundation sens kids from entities to private a we colleges full scholarship schools cornel dark met and middlebury malady had her eye sat on middlebury just angelavassos remembered and the thing that could get her there was the pass scholarship it is really competitive this a hundreds of kids all over new york city an this one floor of building that you go to you remember what you were i thing the first day i wore high heels an a skin maybe i wo tie whup is whiter adressipshur all ways went very professional when i went there what is considered unfit o to posse send groups of kids to college together a pussy and their trying to choose kids who would otherwise be missed because their tussores are not great or because they go to bad schools after the first round half the students get called back the next round half the remaining students than that group gets cut again trying o figure out how to get into college distressful for every one that for most people it does not look reality the vie i kept getting you do not put to the next stage and each time you go back they just send you a letter in the mail letting l say you made it through the net down we expect you here at this this day this time the final time is when you meet the college middlebury you remember what they asked you in the interview no i do not we nervous ah i was nervous very nervine this yer i sat in on the pussy finalist interviews and i can tell you that by this point in the process the only kids left in the room could do your jab with a week of training we ere sitting in this room with twenty five amazing kids fifteen of them were about to get voted off the island they get a letter many did saying now potman get pig i believe i still have that tetter hiding somewhere meany did not get in she made it to the very last round but in the end she did not get it i do not know why ante amass remembers meany getting into middlebury except that what she and the school college counter must be remembering is the moment meany was selected as a finalist cause that would have been an exciting moment and it would make sense that they did not know the very last deep that in the end meany did not make it because they never saw her again they could not have known seeing fields ton was not what made meany one to run away it was this you gold o something sun is get turn down is a waste to sike would you have been better of not going to this experience is that a you feel i mean maybe i would have been better off not going to the experience once that happen i is voted off at o my life because it is to painful thin was is just a moment of disappointment ye my cons this sike a really beautiful thing if you do get it i least was the way looked but what you put tod to true they get there is hard to then be turned out it say why did not i get it was what was roll would meet meany could see in a week college was a long shot especially for a kid from a poor public school but she was going to make it because she was exceptional her teacher saw it she knew it that was the ground she stood on until this moment maybe you were just somebody exceptional be close of the environment you were it not necessarily be close you are exception doubly to yo smog you know going to be is e gin to be tody like going to be somebody going t change a world even a and is say be vitalistic probably wanted me to apply for hazard always law be fucking realistic ism never going to get accepted to hazard this is a school did dos and even half looking us sisters olid the i i pe classes or you knowverses a kid this feelstin you work out an for was you are prepared to go to school a this is not happening for me i do not think anything is going to changed at after that i ruffly new that i wanted to run at a high school as fast as possible i that graduating springs to us of that year i was gone sol really gone we have really got gone off the map on ye o is ha wether i i a i i was walking with malady one day recent when when she played a voice man for me she got from let a green down her old high school touch er i hadn't given less meany's number had not even told her yet about being touch it turned out just a few days before meany had called the front desk of the high school to get a copy of her depot and people from the school started getting back in touch i er a her a meany is shaking her head listening a r er a are you going to call a bat a ably than be we stint no poblycal it's one o gab to business to what i got o the to myself another words yet absolutely not meany never called police surprise that in observe bat pass i only he just calling because i happened to call the school is not anybodybody belching out to me this of course makes no sense somebody calling your mobile device and saying i would love to hear whats going on with you that is the definition of some one reaching out but this is where meany is right now for the last e get of her life she is been working at the supermarket taking local college courses part time stopping every few masters when she needs money or sleep and thinking about where she went wrong she did not apply to any other private colleges after middlebury turned her down she did not reach out to lees or polo or ashes or angel she graduated early and checked out of high school and she is furious at herself for doing that i accepted it easily and i guess i just grew very angry with myself on making that trace e same while getticceptis instead of fighting a guest i or maybe bringing change into that situation but i did it i accepted it i thus always in the back of my head i know i i know i folk that out because i could have obey got in something out of that extra you of school what would you have gone i do not know what is woald if i would have reached out what if what if they would have set me to cunt for free cottage noises the could have been another opportunity i just did i got frustrated to ha point that i did not want to look for that which amenity was to scan want to shit random with cause i feel it was not going to change now a high school teacher who remembers many as having much promise it is calling and wanting to catch up of course meany does not want a return that call for you to have people tell you your exceptional or for me to say people remember you as being very smart as just sort of it is suit on a wound or something it just i i i do not ya how how how do i measure that intelligence is very hard to do with had you gone to middlebury do you think you would believe that you ere mar come you when just she felt when she visited fields in that first time many consent a better alter at reality sitting right there next to her to day an alternate reality where she went to college and her life is totally different o on a of one coming out we meet that alternate reality meany she went to college that is in a minute from cicada bubligradeal when a program continues to make life from or glass to days program three miles honajoffy wads looking at a group of students who shared one small experience the students from a public school in the bronc who took field trips three miles up the road to visit one of new work's fanciest private schools in the first half of her program we heard from meany he thinks that if she had gone to college it would a made all the difference in her life in this half of the shell who can one weather r not that is true a lot a kith from her public high school university lights high school leave the life that she did not they did go to college two third to the last year again her conagoffey wall have been talking to lots of university hates graduate and have haw this experience a coupletimes were i feel ism speaking to means alternate reality the year after meany graduated a handsome young black university high senior named jonathan gas ollas one the pussy scholarship this is a kid who grew up in malady's neighborhood wen to her school was one of only a dozen or kids picked to be part of the programmed with field stay and he one the pussy scholarship meany desperately wanted if any one is alternate reality meany it is jonathan but this is not a roll jonathan conveniently lotion to i did not really for myself i angreally see college from myself i saw just not being a home i this say at fifteen years old malady could see a future with college and graduate school not only that every one around her could see it to this is not what people saw for jonathan this is not what jonathan saw for jonathan i thou i did not have a drive to go to college why not it was never what i thought of myself in a future was being a genitor as always waking up sturdy mornings mop in the house cleaning killing and i sweeping the floor wasn't this is what would have that was what i was experienced in college i knowhati would do this and i had blessing to have a good friend that was into the books macaw hardy i wish you could see jonathan's face when he talks about real i know that is the cornything to say i promise if you could see it you would forget to be cool jonathan says he is left my cow basically as long as he can remember pretty long time have known as since i was twelve my junta high school teach her actually said that we would be married i guess she saw it from the way we looked that hear other i spend time with each other in the classroom and we always plated down like no o but that summer it before high school a collar jonathan got together and it stopped feeling a joke that they might just stay together jonathan and mac cowboy found being at home stressful jonathan was given up to foster care as a baby his foster mom adopted him he says she left him but she could be very cruel i was very i held a lot of things in and the way i got them out was by sometimes punching a wall or punching other people again into fights acting out in the classroom if for racket she was into school her i think her outlet was doing work being in the books she did not have to think about it and my outlet ways thinking about it being sad about it and not speaking anybodience is being quiet called having no you and i haven't know out out yes that was i o coping mechanism were best friends and i now great this of course is reckon rather is beautiful driven and just quick she is the friend you want sitting show on when your last driving race jonathan were both selected for the field in programmed and for rather seeing field son was a revelation she remember specific details be trees in the quad that the library was a free standing building she remembers walking up to it and a we get in and the were kids hang el on the floor and with their book back ta kids living their book bags and attended and this is ut heard of i be ami in the block you do not leave your book bag on the floor and walk away you now to me with a a mack laptop inside you knew i mean that is does not happen and you do not get to sit on the floor at the school and a laid back kind of relax way cell says she had the following thoughts all within the first few minutes these kids are free this is what freedom looks we must not deserve to be free and finally i am really lucky to be seen this i mean it is one thing hearing it from able but id's another thing seeing those things you do not know how little you have because you do not have anything to compare it to i think it motivate to for me that is what the connection with the fields in school did for me it motivated me as for me i din a to i awash anyway and o wo never beside just whet this is whet the rich people a tracheal says every one fell bad seeing field ton but jonathan more because he would been taught to feel that way at home we had a lot arguments about his mam but he knows now he saw himself through her eyes in a lot of ways she made him feel very low at times i tried to loved him and show him the support she says she just told him over and over how special he was you have because he was you know he was and he is he is remarkable man and he he is very tolled he deserved what this world had off for him you known he had to take it that was how jonathan went from imagining himself as a janitor to applying for college not because he saw fields ten because a claw fields ton rather wanted to go to a college where she could sit on the rug and debate with friends lap top on the floor by her knee senior year they were both nominated for a passing scholarship hell did not make it ass the first round but she went on to apply ta lots of their schools and got into barred college with the scholarship and jonathan got passing he got in to wheaten college and massachusetts i think it was a fridge i think it was a fried y to say the gave be that had the letter the mail from wen to may thing was who mi to be accepted into a college you knowing that was your first thought ye did you have any moment of this is great i got into college no was you skipped it past excitement nit was no realexciment i a just all right now what did something changed since from nonmember to whenever you arrived at college way stare to field coquet ism a person who goes to college i i manfully see yes you know was up at the port a sonar feel i was with and when i got to call is should jonathan's first day at wheaten he looked up his course silly an n panic he could not afford the bus he also did not tell any one he could not afford the books he just never got them i did not do the home ism going now into class were one it is a different an admit now ism in keelson was twelve kids to a teacher and ism the only black ki he does somebody is classes i only only kid in somebody is class is now ism embarrass to be the only black gid that does not do work an fulfill that the real type ism not going class it is the castaway to was now ism still the blanket now that dis says to come to class and does not do the look o tout wit at but for me was i mean i what when among in a a to to seethes in the beginning i struggle to i my first year i got see plusses and be menaces it was deversating to me because i was and pass student in high school and we both were this is alive this is crazy i was not expecting this and when you get a talk about that ye we to o but a bat item it was mice to have somebody to talk about it with betas my parents hadn't gone to college nobody could really help us we just sort of needed to figurate out together we kind of troubles suited some problem i the book situation were you that one i told him that he should go the library me to that is what i was doing it had not occur to either of them that the beautiful free standing bray on campus was there to serve them and not a lot of the books they needed for free but when my calpanact she went to the student summer and learned about the library and the inter library lone system she told jonathan two hundred miles away who still had not asked a soul and jonathan was the one who was in posse posse's scholars have ninety per cent college graduation made the program is full of supports for kids just him he had months of training from posse before he even went to college he had a special campus mentor posse was calling him and sending him letters he was ignoring at all a few months into his first o master jonathan was barely getting outside of his room or his head i mean to go to less i

venerable with was bucking and sometimes i a us lie he had the home of to day er yet we data long to her because it was to mush pressor but and don't don't it is do not one helpful i because i was not in close proximity to him and i could not help an i could not save him and i was not trying to save him but it was you know i tried everything to sort of keep him afloat even though i was barely was my head above the water ism as well but we were floating and together but he seemed at times he were he would drown and i was trying to help him but i got to be it was not enough after si note time he

friends were failing at college one by one jonathan was not the anomaly she was by the time she graduated cell was the only person she knew us me it all is now more than twice as likely as jonathan to make it into the meddle class statistically more likely to be employed to be healthy to enjoy her daily work to have a happy marriage but most poor kids who make it to college do not make it to graduation in fact the number is shockingly loll less than one fifth finish in six years there are swarms of researchers trying to figure out what to do about this right now education is the best way to cross class barriers and in many cases education seems to be the barrier able murder the high school teacher who all these kids remember and loved he knows this very well just listened to what happened when i asked able if he remembered racial head bat o it e her she went to aboard a college she as she did this days er now she shes grade she graduated in this teaching oh if a i a after or a i get to for of o a feu o fat at a to blow is porterikan he grew up in the box in the projects when he told kids they could make it to college it was credible because he did it he graduated college he went to graduate school travelled the world able says it is important for kids to see some one them succeed but he also feels deeply ambivalent about playing this roll he still tells kids to go to college because what else is he supposed to do an no a for something of each for o i he to o we is i it and is no way out ta fortune yon probably render wit a we i a gray at get e catch wit many of em

what happen the lots of his former students is probably the same thing that happen to them at fieldstone there are dropped into a foreign land and ask to mentally imagine themselves as belonging that is hard to do in fact the entire project of cell's life has been trying to convince herself she does belong in this regard she is a mental gladiator because this project did not end when she got into the prestigious college it did not end when she graduated from that college or when after college she landed an excellent job interview at a affirm to be a paralegal even though i got my foot in the door by having a good vest make and maybe giving a good to and to you when i get in there ism this i do not deserve this this not the pay salary was above what i deserved in this is more money than either of my parents have ever made probably and those things good through my mind when ism walking into a place a place that am trying to apply for work an and and how could you come somebody that you deserve it when you do not even believe it yourself ins is it is a reoccurring thee in my life i have to tell myself that i deserve this cause i i worked really hard for it she has to ignore the fancy library that she did not get to enjoy in high school the bad greed sure to in college the fact that she cannot afford books the fact that she is the only black kitten class the fact that her peers and college already knew how to use a seminal an correctly the face book stream of high school friends dropping out of college one at a time and the boy friend who deeply more deeply than her believes the message confirmed a gain and again by all these things that he is unworthy recall has did not look at the mountain of evidence that what she is working toward will not be possible and instead hows to repeat to herself you do deserve this you deserve this you do deserve this and that is what i did while is it fields did and that is what i did when i was at bard an that is what i do my job into views now that is what i do at work racial keeps waiting for the sense of entitlement to satin the bravado she sees in her peers from barge she can fake it but she has not got into the point where she truly feels it i mention this to polo an a probably do you i don you or work o om i or of ppicicution or o a we be icicutioner a do roof you e do ably this scrub of kids got their first peek over the fence a detain go now and malady ta girl who found it upsetting as a fifteen early that she ran away she is twenty five now she is this same person she was at fifteen but there are no longer people around to all her you are exceptional your going to make something of yourself but there is are customers and an upscale supermarket it with red banners out front announcing luxury apartments upstairs when you described being at fields ton and seeing these cads are going to be doctors and lawyers and wore gin to be the people opening doors for them in serving them do you feel that you now absolutely oogipis that is why am a sol ashamed of legal but rely told people what i donate i felt we we there to service people that and that is what i service i service people that defile express the the but o the luck that your not on the level give tell long people a work cause i ha is it is a sole market e thus i really want to shake that for my thus ben most li yeas of my life an just after malar i i just really while there is this one thing i keep replaying in my head after talking all these people it is this story angel visas told me about meany getting into middlebury you remember that the teacher from fields sin the private school remember how vivid angel's memory was and she says meany come here meany goes of they fifty people in the room she says a middlebury accepted you fill scholarship meany did not get into middlebury she does not remember this moment at all but angel does clearly even to day she acknowledges it must not have been what really happen but she remembers it if a theory about this i think angel has this memory of meany making it triumphantly making it because it is really hard to believe that meany would not make it and i can completely understand that i met meany in nonmember and i still call her most weeks just to say what happen with your dentist with your grads with that meeting with your professor i keep expecting there to be news she is about to get her big breaker something and things will happened for her i feels suspenseful but nothing has happened for her for ten years i think its some special brand of america pathological optimism that many of us believe the story of meany has to turn out to be happy and get if it does not something unusual has happened and not just this is what happens all the time that the super market might be full of meanies monachufy wall is one oftheproducens of our program s not been three years since we first broadcast this story or call jonathan an meany all

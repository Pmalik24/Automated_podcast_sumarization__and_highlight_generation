welcome to the superman tapioca science science pay to ran man drew supermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools along those lines id to think the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an el in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on treason i still take athletigrens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they will gie you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in viteemen d three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stockroom slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar one talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparation of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they're all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element doc come lash huberment this month we are talking all about the narrow science of emotions and to day we are going to talk about in extremely important topic that central to our daily life and that is motivation we are going to talk about pleasure and reward what underlies our sense of pleasure or reward we are going to talk about addictions you cannot have a discussion about pleasure and reward without having a discussion about addictions and the addictive properties of certain substances as well as haw to break free of addiction as well we are going to talk about the negro chemistry of drive and mind set all these themes are woven together in the contact of emotions each one of them of course could also be its own entire month of the podcast and in fact we are going to have an entire month devoted to addiction and i have a very special guess that is going to be joining us to talk about the science and clinical practices that we know ore important for understanding and treating addiction but for now let us just talk about the narrow science of motivation and reward of pleasure and pain because those are central to what we think of it as e motions whether not we feel good whether not we feel we are on track in life whether not we feel we are falling behind motivation is fundamental to our daily life it what allows us to get out of bed in the morning it is what allows us to pursue long term goals or short term goals motivation and the chemistry of motivation is tightly wound in with the negro chemistry of movement in fact the same single molecule dopamine is responsible for our sense of motivation and for movement even though nerves controlling muscles again these are nerves in the spinal quarter brain that move our limbs the effector chemical there the one that actually causes the muscles to twitch to contract is a seetacolling in the brain set callings responsible for focus however whether or not we move whether not we want to move whether or not we have the desire to overcome barriers of they could be social barriers or financial barriers or time constraints that depends on this molecule we call dopamine it is a fascinating molecule and it lies at the center of many great things in life and it lies at the center of many terrible aspects of life namely addiction and certain forms of mental disease if ever there was a double eager blade in the world of narrow science its dopamine let us talk about what dopamine is and as always we are going to talk about actionable tools to day were defining in a talk about some things relate to supplementation although you might be surprised to learn that it is not all just about increasing dopominencs in particular in some cases that is the wrong thing to do sometimes it is appropriate sometimes it is not more we are going to talk about tools relate to what is called dopamine scheduling how the way that you are leading your life in the way that your conceptualizing your goals can actually predict whether r not you are going to continue to pursue those goals and therefore whether not you will succeed in achieving those goals as well as whether not you will quit there is a fundamental relationship between dopamine released in your brain and your desire to exert effort and you can actually control the schedule of dopamine release but it requires the appropriate knowledge this is one of those cases where understanding the way the dopamine system works will allow you to leverage it to your benefit and if you do not understand the way the dopamine works there is a good chance that it is going to pull you out into the current of life meaning the rest of the world is going to control your dopamine schedule some excited to tell you about to day's information you can a learns some basic since you can learn a lot of tools and these tools i believe are applicable whether or not your five years old eight years old eighty years old or anything in between let us talk about dopamine let us get a few basic facts on the table dopamine was discovered in the late nineteen fifties and it was discovered as the precursor meaning the thing from which epinefron or adrenalin is made now that is fundamentally important because this molecule we call dopamine nowadays we think of as the molecular reward and pleasure but actually it is the substrate from which a adrenaline is made and in the brain it is the subtract from which epinefran is made epinephrin is the same thing as a adrenalin except in the brain we call epineferan epinefran is you may recall from previous podcast or if you have not no problem epinefran allows us to get into action it stimulates changes in the blood vessels in the heart in the organs and tissues of the body that bias us for movement and if you would to learn more about epinefron you can check out our episode on mastering stress o talk a lot about it there dopamine was initially thought to be just the building block for epinefron and it is indeed the chemical building block from which epinefran is made however dopamine does a lot of things on its own it is not always converted to epineferan dopamine is released from several sites in the brain and body but perhaps the most important one for to day's discussion about motivation and reward is something that sometimes just call the reward pathway for the if senator that sometimes call the mess limbic reward pathway but it is fundamentally important to your desire to engage in action and it is fundamentally important for people getting addicted to substances or behaviors how does this work well you have got a structure in the deep part of your brain called the v t a it stands for ventral segmental area as always you do not have to remember these names but if you want to i offer them to you for to further guggling research reading et camera the v t er ventral segmental area contains in irons that send what we call frontal wires that spit out dopamine at a different structure call the nucleus accumbent and those two structures vita and nucleus he comments form really the core machinery of the reward pathway in the pathway that controls your motivation for anything you can think of them an accelerator they brace you for action however within the reward pathway there is also a break the break or restriction on that dopamine which controls when it is released and how much its released is the prefrontal quarter the prefrontal quarter is the curl real estate right behind your forehead it is discussed for many aspects of narrow sines you hereabout it for decision making executive function for planning et camera and indeed its responsible for a lot of those it is this really unique real estate that we were all endowed with as humans other animals do not have much of it we have a lot of it and that prefrontal quarter acts as a break on the dopamine system without that break you would be purely a pleasure seeking animal you would be purely pleasure seeking you would have no basis for regulating your behavior in terms of trying to get things that make you feel good and that brings us to the important feature of motivation which is that motivation is a two part process which is about balancing pleasure and pain most people thing about motivation and reward an dopamine is just trying to achieve pleasure and indeed dopamine is released in the brain from the vitae at the nucleus accumbent when we experience things that we here is the way to conceptualize this and if you can internalize this in your mind it will really help you as you move through your a try to understand why you might be motivated or not motivated for certain things when you are just sitting around not doing much i anything may you wake up in bed in the morning you re thing about get n we get n up or not this reward pathway is releasing dopamine at a rate of about three or four times per second it is con a firing in a low level when i say firing mean electrical activity in the neurons when you are just around you feel oka not depress not highly motive ate not excited may be three or four times a second if suddenly you get excited about something you anticipate something not receive an award but you get excited in an anticipatory way then the rate of firing the rate of activity in this reward pathway suddenly increases to thirty or forty times and it has the effect of creating a sense of action or desire to move in the direction of the thing that your craving it fact it is fair to say that dopamine is responsible for wanting and for craving and that is distinctly different from the way that you hear it talked about normally which is at its involved in pleasure yes dopamine is released in response to secs its released in response to food it is released in response to a lot of things but it is mostly released in anticipation and craving for a particular thing it has the effect of narrowing our focus for the thing that we crave and that thing could be as simple as a cup of coffee it could be as on important as a big board meeting that could be a big final exact could be of the person that were excited to meat or see dopamine does not care about what your craving it just releases at a particular rate in fact if we just take a step back and we look at the scientific data on how much the dopamine firing increases in response to different things you get a pretty interesting window into how your brain works and why you might be motivated or not motivated let us say your hungry or you are looking for i to a cup of coffee or you are going to see your partner well your dopamine neurons are firing at a low rate until you start finking about the thing that you want or the thing that you are looking forward to let say your craving chocolate or a good meal stake if you stake or a nice play post if you post when you eat that food the amount of dopamine that is released in this reward pathway goes up about fifty per cent above baseline the neurons there go from firing yo three or four times per second to six or ten times per second it really depends and these aren't exact numbers but if we were to measure the amount of dopamine that is released it goes up about fifty per cent sects which is fundamental to our species continuation and reproduction although it does not have to be for for conceiving children sects does release dopamine and it increases dopamine levels about a hundred per cent basically doubles them nicotine of the sort that is and cigarettes or some people are taking nicotine in supplemental form increases the amount of dopamine about a hundred and fifty per cent above base line it also does some other things that were going a talk about but nicotine does that and it is kind of interesting that nicotine would increase the amount of dopamine in your brain very quickly within seconds that is a hundred and fifty times over baseline as opposed to secs which is a hundred per cent above or food which is fifty per cent cocaine and amphetamine increase the amount of dopamine that is released a thousandfold within about ten seconds of consuming the drug however just thinking about food about secs about nicotine if you nicotine or locator inpedemin can increase the amount of dopamine that is released to the same degree as actually consuming the drug now it depends in some cases for instance the cocaine use or the attic that wants cocaine cannot just think about cocaine and increase the amount of that is released about a thousandfold is hash much lower but it is just enough to put them on the motivation track for to crave that particular thing now there reasons why you would have brain circuitry this i me brain circuitry this did not evolve to get you addicted brain circuitry this involved in order to motivate behaviors toward particular goals water when you are thirsty secs in order to reproduce and we begin to talk abut the relationship between estrogen and estostro in the dopamine system because those hormones actually bias dopamine to be released these things and these ordinary is iron's word part of the evolutionary history that led to the continuation of our species things coca an amphetamine are disastrous for most people because they release much dopamine and they create these closed loops where people than only crave the particular thing can amphetamine that leads to those massive amounts of dopamine release most things do not release that that level of dopamine and nowadays there's a ton of interest in social media and invidious games and it there have been some measurements of the amount of dopamine released video games especially video games that have a very high update speed where there is novel territory all the time not novelty is a big stimulus of dopamine those can release dopamine somewhere between nicotine and cocaine very high levels of dopamine release sociomedias an interesting one because the amount of dooming that is released in response to logging on to socialmedia initially could be quite high but it seems likely that there is a taper in the amount of dopamine but and yet people still get addicted why why is it that we can get addicted to things that fail to get to elicit the same massive amount of pleasure that they initially did being addicted to something is not just about the fact that it feel good that you want to do it over and over again and that is because of this pleasure pain balance that underlies motivation let us look alibi closer at the pleasure pain balance because therein lies the tools for you to be able to control motivation toward healthy things and avoid motivated behaviors towards things that are destructive for you there are lot of reasons why people try novel behaviors whether not those or drugs or whether not those are adventure thrill seeking things where they seek out new partners or they take a new class as you will notice ism not placing any judgment or value on these different behaviors although i thing it is fair to point out that for most people addictive drugs coca an amphetamine are very destructive actually we know that about fifteen to twenty per cent one people have a genetic bias towards addiction that you sometimes here that the first time that you use a drug you can become addicted to it that is actually not been shown to be true for most things in most people but for some people that actually is true and we will talk alibi later about why certain people are heavily bias toward becoming attics on the first use of a particular drug itsucually very interesting t has everything to do with whether not they were formally addicted to something else but in any case the way the addiction works and the way that motivation works generally in the non addictive setting is that when you anticipate something elope of dopamine is released and then when you reach that thing your engage in that thing the amount of dooming goes up even further but as you repeatedly pursue a behavior and you repeatedly engage with a particular thing let say you love running or you love chocolate as you eat a piece of chocolate believe it or not it tastes good and then there is a shift a way from activation of dopamine and there are other chemicals that are released that trigger a low level sense of pain now you might not feel as physical pain but the craving that you feel is both one part dopamine and one part the mirror image of dopamine which is the pain or the craving for yet another piece of chocolateand this is a very important and subtle feature of the dopamine system that is not often discussed people alwiyside about just as pleasure you love sochamedia it gives youdopamenance you engage in that you chocolate it releases diamines you do that but for every bit of dopamine that is released there is another circuit in the brain that creates you can think of it as kind of a downward deflection in pleasure you engage in something you really want and there is an increase in pleasure and then there is a without you doing anything there is a mirror image of that which is a downward deflection in pleasure which recalling pain for every bit of pleasure there is a mirror image experience of pain and they overlap in time very closely it sometimes hard to sense this but try it the next time you eat something really delicious you will take a byte it tastes delicious and part of the experience is to want more of that thing this is true for any pleasureful experience now the diabolical part about dopamine is that because it dint evolve in order to get you to indulge in more and more and more of some thing what happens is that initially you experience an inn increase in pleasure and you also experience this increase in pain shortly after or woven in with the pleasure that makes you want more of that thing but with each subsequent time that you encounter that thing that you pursue the chocolate that you a you pursue the lover each time the experience of dopamine release and pleasure is diminished a little bit and the diabolical thing is that the pain response is increased a little bit and this is best observed in the contacts of drug seeking behavior the first time some one decides to take cocaine or imphedomine they may do it to abordum they may do it out of pure pressure they may do it to relieve some internal sense may be there border there just excited may be there high and novel novelty seeking their lot of reasons why people might try a drug far too many for us to to get into or parse here may be they only want to do it but so one encourages them they will experience a huge dopamine release and they will feel likely very good however the next time they take it it will not feel quite as good and it will not feel even as good the third time or the next time but the amount of pain the amount of craving that they experience for the drug will increase over time much of our pursuit of pleasure is simply to reduce the pain of craving the next time you experience something you really i do not want to take you out of that experience but it is really important that you notice this that if there is something you really enjoy part of that enjoyment is about the anticipation and wanting of more of that thing and that is the pain system in action and we can distinguish between dopamine which is really about pleasure and dopamine which is really about motivation to pursue more in order to relief or exclude future pain let me repeat that dopamine is not as much about pleasure as much as it is about motivation and desire to pursue more in order to reduce the amount of pain and we are now talking about pain as a psychological pain and a craving although people that miss a lover very badly or that really crave of food very badly or that are addicted to a drug cannot act as it will experience that as a physical craving animental craving the body and brain are linked in this way it is t almost they will describe it as painful they yearn for it and i think the word yearning is one that is very valuable this context because yearning seems to include a whole body experience more than just wanting which could just be up in the mind your desire for something its proportional to how pleasureful it is to indulge in that thing but also how much pain you experience when you do not have it and you can now start to let your mind wandering to all sorts of examples of editions or things that you happen to i it'll use wo the example that i sometimes use on here which in my love of cressance a though several of you pointed out these are called caisson but then it sounds mom trying to speak french and i always tried to do that when i was a kid and i went to a bilingual school in it fail then ans can a fail now s in call them cressante a they're delicious i love them a really good one makes me wane to eat six it is true i have pretty good impulse control i think but it makes me wane to eat six i taste it and taste delicious and unless i really force myself to experience the taste of it in my mouth and how flaky ism getting hungry for rid now and delicious the crescent is mostly the taste of that crescent makes me want to eat more crescent now eventually blood sugar goes up society is reached at camera what happens then what is satisfaction an society about will that is a separate neuromodulator that is about the neuromodulator serotonin it is about ox token it is about a hormone system that invallsome thy call prolactin or gan to talk about all all of those in the book the molecule of more wonderful book a those were described as the here and now molecules the ones that allow you to experience your sensations and pleasure in the present and for which the brain stops projecting into the future now let us talk about craving and and these called here and now molecules and how those engage in a kind of pushpin balance that willallow you to notions feel more motivated but also to enjoy the things in life that you are pursue in to much greater degree we have neurons in tan area of our brain called the rape are a p h e the rape releases craton at different places in the brain serotonin is the molecule of bliss and contentment for what you already have have talked before about exteroceptor exteroceptor is a focus on the outside world everything beyond the confines of your skin also talked about interception a focus on things that are happening internally within the confines of your skin dopamine and ceratonan can be thought of as related to exteroceptor dopamine makes us focused on things outside us that are beyond what we call our personal space where we actually have to move and take action in order to achieve things and ceratonan in general has to do with the things that are in our immediate here and now hence the description of the as the here an now molecules it is interesting to point out that the body and the brain can at do direct its attention towards things outside us or inside us or split our attention between those talked about this in a previous pots but if you did not see it no problem just understand that dopamine braces us toward thinking about what we do not have whereas ceratonan and some of the related molecules the end o canabinoids if you picked up on the word canabinoid yes it is cannabis because cannabis apaches to end canabinoid receptors and the endicanabinoids a receptors and chemicals that the canabinoids that you naturally make that are involved in things forgetting it is not a coincidence that nonsmokers do not have the most terrific memory you may know a few that have great memories but chances are they would have even better memories if a they were not pot smokers but you make these molecules that bind these receptors that make you feel kind of blessed out and content in the present those are receptors that exist in us not for sake of consuming t c or marijuana but forsake of binding of our natural in dozens canabinoids you got these two systems that come a pushball and if you were to say do the anoint the book of wherever you go there you are john coats talks about this a meditation practise that different than most meditation practices where you eat one main and you focus all of your attention on the main the taste of the omen the texture of the main that is really a mindfulness practise that gear towards trying to take a behavior which is normally about pursuit normally feeding is were going engage in feeding because of dopamine we pursue more of a food because of that pleasure pain relationship i talked about before the focus on the one among where the or becoming very present in any behavior that normally would be a kind of exteroceptive pursuit behavior and bring it into the here and now that is a mental trick or a mental task that the mindfulness community has really embraced in order to trying create increased pleasure for what you already have it is really trying to accomplish a shift from dopamine being released to serotonin and the conabonoid system being involved in that behavior if you are interested in mindfulness which is some they have talked about before in this podcast and i a s have made om off the cuff jokes about the opposite of mindfulness being mindlessness mindfulness is a vast space that is of mindful practise that a lot of people of engaged in and indeed it can give you deeper appreciation for things that you already have dopamine has the quality of making people kind of rapidly in pursuit of things look at people who are high on cocaneor enpedeming and they are almost entirely extroceptive drugs merauana the opioid anything that a really hits the serotonin system hard tend to make people rather lethargic and content to stay exactly where they are they do not want a purse much at all a occasionally when people it the smoke mariner consumetiage see their appetite goes way up and they really want to consume food that is because of its effects on insolent and its effects on blood sugar which is a slightly separate matter but since some of you o probably your minds might have gone at to those either experiences or reports of what pot does o that is why it does that you have got these molecules dopamine that make you focused on the things you want an the things you crave and then you have got the molecules that make you content with what you have the most important thing perhaps in creating a healthy emotional landscape is to have a balance between these two demodulator systems people that are always in anticipation and desire an seeking that is wonderful for pursuing goals however it is terrible for enjoying life and actually those people are actually quite difficult to be around there is a certain almost sociopathic element to people who are what they call hyperbola mantric people who are always on the dopa mantric scale to the point where they are always pursuing goals in fact those people are known to be a at least in the psychological spectrum they can be very manipulative dopamine and the pursuit of something does not necessarily have to be high energy and intense from the outside when you observe it from the outside in fact a their people who will manipulate in order to get what they want this has been shown who have high levels of dopamine release in their brain but they have learned that a kind of passive manipulation is the best way to maneuver through a particular environment i soft want to focus too much on a sociopathy because those are kind of extreme examples but it just goes to show that people who identify a goal and realize the series of steps that they need to take in order to achieve that goal can neither do it through ethical means or nonethical means they can do it through active pursuit being the kind of type person that is always declaring their goals and going after it posting it on instrgam telling everybody about it trying o recruit others there is that tintype there is that kind of signature of dopamine and then there are the people that want to get what they want in their doing it by always serving other people by always taking care of everybody ease's needs by always to and to accomplish their goals but through a mode that at least from the outside seems more passive or more about supporting others neither of these are good or bad and that is because dopamine is a molecule it does not care how you reach your goals it only cares that you reach your goals because the seethe internal sensation is one again of mild pleasure a little bit of pain although more pain over time if you are not reaching those goals and it takes you away from the here and now at about this point in the podcast ism guessing that some of you are thinking o get great i want more dopamine i want to be more motivated i do not want to procrastinate as much and i want to be able to experience life i want these here and now molecules to be released as well well there is a way to do that but you have to understand the source of procrastination is not one thing they are busily two kinds of procrastinators or says the research the first kind are people that actually really enjoy they stress of the impending deadline it is the only way they can get into action these are people that really the feeling of something being do in an hour and how activated and sharp an focus that makes them feel those people are people that are tapping into the epanefferent system the stress system and for which the stress really tightens their ability to see it creates that rostra view of the world it creates an action element in the body that makes them feel they want o move it really eliminates all the distract e distractions for them they are actually leveraging stress internal stress in order to achieve a state that they cannot seem to otherwise achieve i will not tell you what to do in order to overcome all kinds of procrastination but from a logical perspective it make sense therefore for those kinds of people to think about other ways that they can get their system into activation have talked about this and previous podcast but a couple those tools might be the what we have called superoxygenation breathing which i admit is not always superoxygenating this would be a if you want did not want to to consume anything this can be twenty five or thirty cycles of indeed inhale an exams it is likely to create some anxiety and a low level stress if you're some one whose prone to panic attacks i would not recommend this but it is pretty straightforward it will deploy a adrenaline into your system and you will find that your visual feel is focus and you will be able to work and focus better than if you just kind a weighted around for some wave of motivation to to wash over you normally you are was ting for that deadline to come into sight and then that is what the stimulus is but you can self direct o adrenaline release without ingesting anything you can also invest coffee caffeine or you mate or something that which is what i a prefer very often to coffee which has affine caffeine does release dopamine at low levels how much it releases dopamine is not clear it seems to increase firing in these neurons in the nucleus accommens by about thirty per cent which is a pretty low la bel but it concrete agitation for canine sensitive people that could be a problem have talked before about things eltyracine the precursor o dopamine or macunapurines i talk about then the last episode but if you did not see that just to remind you eltyracine as present in red meats its in certain nuts and eltyracine is the precursor to dopamine you can supplements altyracine if you you will get a big inflection and dopamine but there is a crash associated with it however it will increase motivation in the short term not suggesting any one do this i want to be very clear say what i always say am not a doctor i do not proscribe anything of a professor a profess things you have to know whether not these things or appropriate for your mental physical health or not you need to consult the doctor for instance people who suffer from skitzatyple or skitzophraniarmania should probably not be taking supplements that increase the dopamine levels now if you cannot increase your level of focus and your level of alertness and your level of motivation using breathing well then there might be something else at play there are other procrastinators for which they simply are not releasing enough dopamine they are not making enough dopamine and for those people there are a variety of things that can increase dopamine i do suggest you talk to psychiatric or doctor have talked about macunapurines which is ninety nine point nine per cent el dopa the recurs or to dopamine there are people that do much better when they take things that increase their dopamine levels there are and to deprescence we button proud prison which increase is the other name for which increase dopamine and epineferon it can increase risk of epileptic attacks if your epileptic ganef to talked your doctor but they will increase dopamine and motivation and hocus however if you think back t are earlier discussion about dopamine dopamine if it is very high creates a sense of pleasure an the designer for more you can also become a person for which enough is never enough the only thing that dopamine really wants is more of the thing that releases dopamine and big in flections in dopamine whether not they come from cocaine or whether or not they come from a supplementation caplin exercise study regime will just make you want more of something and we have all heard before of protamine set this incredible discovery of my cold coral due or some of these positive mine sets that the psychology community has put forth as really good for pursuit of goals and pursuit of a things that require long bouts of effort well it is wonderful if you can learn to attach dopamine to that process psychologically but if you are starting to augment the amount of dopamine increase the amount of dopamine through things supplementation and proscription drugs what is going to happen is your not only can need to pursue more and more of the sorts of things that are that are associate with the dopamine more doing more studying more sport more pursuit higher mountains more money more whatever but we know that over time the mirror image of that the pain of lack of accomplishment will also increase this is the pleasure pain relationship that we talked about earlier in a few moments i in a talk about how to think about healthy dopamine schedules but i just want to take a setback for second and talk a little bit about the the lipide of doping what happens after the called dopamine crash what mechanisms are installed in us because believe re not there are mechanisms that are installed in all of us that really put the complete and total break on dopamine wither there and what they do because you have experience these before and their actually ways that you can navigate them these dopamine crashes or these intentional dopamine suppression mechanisms in order to leverage healthier dopamine schedules and to feel more motivated perhaps one of the most fundamental mechanisms in all humans is the nor circuitry design for seeking out mates and for reproduction and that is because the continuation of any one species is the primary driver for any species that is just the reality now am removing all context here whatever i say of course sits in the in the youknowonabackdrop of consensual age appropriate a species appropriate a context appropriate all of that this is not about the sociology of reproduction in sexes about the biology the biology of sex in males and females does matter offs exec chromosome es why chromosome exec why exuiwie does not matter the reality is that dopamine is released on anticipation and consummation of sex and reproduction and after orgasm regardless of chromosome background there is a dramatic decrease in dopamine and in increase in a hormone called prolactin now prolactin is associated with milk let down in lactating mothers its also present in males and in general prolactin creates a sense of lethargy of stillness and lack of desire to move and lack of desire to pursue more of whatever released the dopamine prolactin in fact sets the refractory period on a males ability to mate again now this is going to very tremendously from individual to individual it also can of there are data showing that it can very tremendously from mate paring to mate paring the number one thing that releases dopamine is novelty and it is true that the refractory period is shorten by the introduction of novel mates this was first shown in a coneclassic experiment in a of all things in chickens this is called the collage effect and the story is the story goes and i believe its the true story its actually in all the the noranichronology text books i believe it is true is that president clean coolie was visiting a chicken farm they were is been taken around and the person who is hosting the visit showed them a rooster that was college and his wife were on the visit and said this rooster copulates thousands of times per day and is is college apparently an a elbowed present colegenceat a you hear that candy pointing out the the prowess of this muster and college said yet but lame ask a question same hen or different hands and turns out to is different hens and the reason is the introduction of a novel mate increases dopamine levels and what is interesting about this is that after copulation prolactin goes through the roof and prevents further copulation dopamine crashes but the introduction of some sort of novelty shortens this now this is not a apply for a people to change mates often what this is is a story about the dopamine and prolactin system that also exists in humans now there are actually o things that people in a certain communities take in order to bypass these refractory pearls is actually it drugs that increase dopamine suppress prolactin and vice of era is sushi another way to suppress prolactin vitamin be six is a fairly potent prolactin inhibiter as is zinc and if you look out there in the literature and for those either in the wellness and consorts performance community a lot of the called quoting quotestosterone boosters are actually comminations of sidemen be six and zinc which inhibit prolactin and by way of inhibiting prolactin increase dopamine they do have some some you functional effecting that regard there not really increasing testosterone directly their suppressing prolactin levels and there are clinical conditions hyperoprolactanemia which leads to massive decreases in libido et camera and there are a prescription drugs to treat hop a hyperoprolactin anemia which of corse should you should always talk to enter chronologists about those sorts of prescription drugs it is interesting that this very basic mechanism of dopamine and prolactin this sort of motivation no no more motivation is a system that evolved for reproduction first but that actually takes place and you can see in thelsewherein in the world for instance skitsophrenia a disease that has many different types and facts but skitsophrenia is a case of an a often of hyperactivation of the dopamine system much that it can make people feel can high they hallucinate i meaner to of very very high or a a deregulated a dominoes as sorts in the brain one of the treatments for gets aphelia are drugs that block dopamine receptors and o if you have the unfortunate the many people there out on the street these days who haves gets phrenic some of whom are taking their me some of whom are not if you ever see somebody on the street that is doing what its a lip smacking and writhing its actually called arrive discinesia this is a movement dish disorder that is created by taking these antidopaman uric drugs s you can imagine these antidopaminurgic drugs while being very effective and suppressing hallucinations they create these movement problems because of dopamine importance for the movement circuitry called perametal circuitry for the ofphysionatos in addition you sometimes see in males that take these drugs jocks hi haliperadol in the a and the other dopamine blockers that they actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia the development of a male breast tissue is because of the elevated levels of prolactin because there suppressing their dopamine much now that is of really extreme case but a maybe perhaps if you a if you see somebody engaging these very strange kind of face surwrithing in body writhing behaviors that is actually not a consequence of their mental illness that is a consequence most often of the drugs that they are taking to treat the mental illness those are side effects of those drugs now prolactin is increased any time we have some really heightened intense experience is not just released after sedan reproduction prolactin is released after some major event is actually responsible its a thought for some of a postpartum depression for different types of kind of the the let down the low i can distinctly remember that after finals a or after publishing a big paper i would be very very happy but then it'd find that o what next or things might seem a litigate dimmed or dulled out for the next day or or the following week the time scales on these are going to very because some people release a lot of dopamine for a very long time in response to something great and other people have a quick inflection of dopamine and then their back to feeling not great it really varies from person of person in fact long ago i stelas i learned about dopamine rewards circuitry in the relationship you be between dopamine and prolactin i start to leverage this believe or not after some major event i would take a couple hundred milligrams of a vitamin be six i think for people have diabetic neuropathy you need to be careful with vitamin be six a check with your doctor i was told although i have not found the literature on this that i can in some cases a exacerbate puerperal neuropathy but for most people a it is thought to be reasonably safe a but again always check a with your physician but i would take some b six a kind of offset some of that low and actually i do not know if it was subjective or not but it seem to have a somewhat of a of a plosive effect i also started just internalizing the fact that dopamine is subjective there are objective aspects to dopamine and how much is released but there is also some subjective effects to dopamine and one of the things that you can do in order to generally just be a happier person especially if you're person in pursuit of long term goals of any kind is the longer that you can extend that positive phase of the dopamine release and the more that you can blunt the pain response to that the better and you cannot shall do this cognitively i used to joke with my lab that when we would publish a paper i get really excited but i would not allow myself to get too excited what i wanted to do instead and what have still try to do as trying extend the arc of that positive experience as long as i possibly can simply by thinking back o that was really cool i really enjoy doing that work i really enjoyed the discovery i really enjoyed doing that with the people that i was working with at the time what a pleasure that was i can get this very easily from pictures of people and things costello that i really enjoy trips that have taken you can extend pleasure without having to engage in the behavior over and over that is extending the arc of that dopamine release as well it offset some of the pain of not having that experience occur over and over and over again now for the high performers out there your probably familiar with this many people who have a big achievement their first thoughts are will now what what am i going to do next how mi ever going o exceed that and indeed many people who are very high on this kind of dopamine sensation and novelty seeking scale are prone addiction there prone to the rabid pursuit of external goals of exterroception to the neglect of these internal mechanisms that allow them to feel calm and happy for people that are very driven very motivated adopting a practice of being able to engage in the here and now the sort of omen tip practices we talked about earlier o of learning how to achieve a really good nights sleep on a regular basis through tools an mechanisms i talked about in previous podcast gives a sort of balance to the pleasure seeking and offsetting of pain and the pleasure in the here and now pleasure is really two things it is a joy in pursuit but it is also the joy in what you have and there is a beautiful model of emotional development that was developed by allay shore professor at you seal and psychiatric the talks about some of the basics of good infant parent attachment where good parenting that leads to healthy adult relationships and emotion regulation tends to include both sides of this dopamine serotonin spectrum you talk about the relationship between child and apparent typically was the mother but also father where you can get the child really excited by kind of squealing and camping them up a talking about something or ice scream or play and the kid gets very excited that's the doorman uric system the anticipation of something that is coming but as well engaging with children in a way that is really about everything that you have right in the here and now the reading of the book the kids always seem to ask one more time one more they seem to want more of the things that they enjoy but really engaging with them in a way that increases their sense of pleasure for what is right there as well as giving them a lot of things to be excited about and positive anticipation now having work years ago with a arris kids and also with young kids a summer camps and things that one of the things that you learn is you never say maybe to a kid about a reward if you say we might have ice cream later you are essentially saying we are having ice cream they do not hear the maybe part and it turns out adults do not either it is really interesting there something called reward prediction error i talked about this before but i have not really talked about it deeply in the contacts of the dopamine system dopamine as have said is involved an anticipation of wanting not of having it is involved in motivation toward the thing that you want and it bis us us towards action reward prediction error equals the actual amount of dopamine that is released in response to something verses minus the amount that is expect it oke if you tell a kid we might have ice cream that here we are going to have ice cream and say expect it and if you later say well we are nock can have ice cream and i said maybe that is ashcan a lead to a much bigger crash in dopamine it is going to lead to a negative signal a punishment signal it is literally going to feel pain kids you can leverage this if your parents say maybe there effectually telling your dopamine system absolutely now adults are this too if we think something might happen and it does not happen there is a big crash in our in our affect in our emotionality and that is because that dopamine system goes from firing about three to four times per second to about ten or fifteen times per second in the possibility that something might happen possibility is deeply woven inpour biology of the dopamine and motivation system as a way for us presumably an ancient times to explore novel territories and get a sense that maybe there is water there maybe there r mates there maybe there is better food there maybe there is resources there the maybe is important thing that in language terms maybe means maybe but in nurobiological terms maybe means perhaps there is going to be the surprise of an even bigger dopamine reward and the one thing dopamine loves more than anything else is surprise when we get something pause we go to the man box or expecting see bills and you open it up and you get a letter from somebody you have not thought about in a long time and you adore that person that is a huge dopamine release it actually trigger's normal plastic you probably never forget that because the way that dopamine gates plasticity when we get a a surprise of something that we did not want also it creates plasticity the surprise novelty motivation and reward there all woven in to this package that we call dopamine and the cool thing is you can actually regulate this whole system in a way that will steer you or lean you towards more positive anticipation of things in life and lestisappointment it is simply matter of a busting what we call the dopamine schedule couple things before we continue we are going to talk about attention deficit in a few minutes but before that i want to talk about something that i mention no before in previous podcast but that you may not be aware of and if you are aware of you may still be doing which is severely injuring your ability to release dopamine it is creating a sense of disappointment in ways that are most likely hurting you mentally and physically and that the blunting of dopamine by viewing light in the middle of the night i realize this is not discussion about sleep in creating rhythms but the data now are strong showing that viewing bright light from about ten him to fore am too often trigger's activation of the circuit called the habenula this is i to goes from arena to structure call the habenula h b e and u ale then from the habenula to some of this reward circuitry and it suppresses the activation of the reward circuitry not just in that moment but to things that you normally positively anticipate and pursue and the remembering this up now as cause i have not really gone into depth on the dopamine system before now you understand have this very precious reward system that is kind of a double ledge bored it needs to be taken care of and treated well you want to use it but not over use it et camera but getting bright light exposure in the middle of the night is reducing your capacity to release dopamine is not just about the sleep that you are not getting in that time it is also that you are not a getting the dopamine that is of that would otherwise be available to you we yore actually taking think of light in the middle o the night as at kind of antagonists this kind of a blocker of dopamine maybe that it'll help you if you are somebody who has to work in the middle of the night and you want a by pass this dopamine suppression please the episode about jetlag and shift work because their lot o tips there that will low you to do that in order to understand how to control the dopamine system had a leverage it for a better life you need not understand the results of a very important experiment this experiment was able to separate pleasure from motivation it is a very simple but many simple experiments of very elegant experiment what they did and this has not been done in animals and inhuman they offered rats food it was a food that they particularly light and the animals would lever press for a pellet of food con a classic experiment it eat the food and they presumably the food because they were motive depress the lever and eat it great they took other rats they eliminated the dopamine neurons you can do this by injection of a neurotoxin that destroys these neurons thy actually had no dopamine in their brain they have no ability to release dopamine and they gave them a lever that rats would sit there and they hit the lever and they eat the food they are still enjoyed the food s you say well o case he dopamine is not involved in motivation and is involved in pleasure no it absolutely is they could still enjoy the food but if they moved the rat literally one body length away from the lever what they found was the animals that had dopamine would move over to lever press it and eat and the ones the rats that did not have dopamine available to them would not even move one bodylength one rat length to the lever in order to press it and get the food dopamine therefore is not about the ability to experience pleasure it is about motivation for pleasure this has been repeated in humans in a variety of different cynareos you cannot really do the lever press thing quite as easily but we know that people have low levels of dopamine are simply less motivated even though they can achieve pleasure and this has serious ramifications for the fact that now quote duo pleasure or ways to induce things that we believe give us pleasure a everywhere and there within reach we do not have to forage for our food there is lot of of highly process high sugar high fat foods there is also foods their healthy that tastes good but there and hopefully their pretty easy to get or that different people have different access to things of course but dopamine is not about the ability to experience pleasure it is about how motivated you are to reach those pleasures and many of your polythinking will ism not a very motivated person you talk about the one kind of procrastination early er what about when i just feel cinomec about life now for some of you there may be a real clinical depression and you should talk to a professional there are very good prescription drugs that can really help people there is also great non drug treatments of a psychotherapy and other treatments that are being developed in addition a psychotherapy in the various kinds of psychoanalysis et camera that one can use i think the data really point to the fact that a commination of pharmacology and talk therapies are generally best and there are a huge range of these things i know many of you are in these professions were not can talk about that right now there's a compound that is kind of interesting in the supplement space that is not a macunipurians ell dopa it is not eltyracine that is not promoting massive releases of dopamine or even dopamine alone but a commination of dopamine and ceratonan and it is an intriguing molecule it is a sold over the counter banyan the check with your health care a a provider before you would take anything or remove anything that is very important which it but it is a final ethene final ether main or p e a p a or data final ether among releases dopamine at low levels but also seratoninant low levels it is kind of a cocktail of the motivation molecules as well as the quote an quote here and now molecules and peoples response this varies widely but many people report feeling heighten sense of mental acuity well being et camera it is a bit of a stimulant anything that trigger's activation the dopamine and nor an efferent pathway but is an interesting supplement i actually have not tried it before am i cannot report on my own experiences i will point you however to examine do am it would not be a superman ladpodcast episode if i did not point you to examined to coming incredible free resource where you can put in any supplement and it will tell you that quote unquote human affect matrices that will pointy to the various studies we always provide a link to this in the caption its an amazing resource you can go there to explore more but i have not talk about a bat a final l ether an before in previous podcast and i wanted to add it to the am list of things that tap in to the dopamine system that are a in this i guess we call it down the supplementation space i personally fascinated by these supplements and the things that exist out there that are nonprescription that seem to at least once some people have positive effects a for instance last episode we talked about a seal a carnations which a there several papers that report anti depression effects as well as passive effects on other things a sperm health ovarian health et camera i learn from a colleague that a seal el carnations in rope is is prescription drug an the u s its sold over the counter i guess depending on where you are listening to this the availability might very and as always i put the caviar you have to check with your health care provider if its right for you but ism fascinated by the fact that these things exist and that they lie somewhere between prescription drugs and doing nothing and that makes them p a interesting compounds and i think that p a a bataphenal ethelamin is a yet another one of of such compounds i going to talk a lot about attention deficit and attention defies at hyperactivity disorder in a future episode but i do want o mention it to day in the contacts of dopamine and impulsivity eight t or d d attention defies it hyperactivity disorder d d are clinical diagnoses i think a lot of people nowadays walk round and say i a a d d or you have d d am and indeed one can create a sort of d d by attention switching all the time a ism a big fan of calnewport he wrote the book deep work he a i believe he was the one who said contact switching is is terrible for the brain its the worst thing for the brain because then the brain learns to contacts which and real deep work productivity learning of all kinds good relationships of all kinds really come from depth of experience not from a breadth of experience within the moment and i think it is important to know that there is clinical he t and d d and then there is the kind that people are kind of inducing a and through distraction and social media and phones et camera and those can sometimes lead to clinical eight high c an eight d but i want to talk about had h d and d d in kids just briefly the drugs that are normally given to treat those conditions it d and d d are things overall things that have very emphedemine qualities and structures and you might ask why would they do that will turns out that in kids these activate that four brain circuitry the break that exists on the deeper a mesolymbics circuitry as recall theirs the vita and nuclysecombens dos the kind of accelerators on dopamine and then there is the forefront of quartets which acts as a break and can limit impulsivity and those drugs tend to increase the activity of neurons in that pathway the prefrontal quarter and it reduces impulsivity in fact there's ay experiment described in the book the molecule of more which is really interesting where they looked at impulsivity in obis children and it turns out on they do this experiment in a safety that they looked at kids on both jobs kids and nonobest kids and their willingness to cross a very busy highway and it turns out that the ones kids got hit by cars more often than a non jobs a children and turns out this was the virtual reality experiment that had nothing do with the fact that they were ones or or limitations on movement or speed of movement it was that the jobs children were more impulsive in a variety of contacts noxious in this virtual crossing the street thing and it turns out a the data point to the fact that impulsivity at age ten is actually predictive of overeating disorders at a later stage in life some of these drugs that are designed to create heightened activity in the breaking system the decelerator of the reward pathway are designed to reduce impulsivity because they suppress the release of dopamine and they allow hopefully they allow children and and when they become adults to better control the schedule of dopamine release now lats talk about what is a dopamine schedule and how you can leverage this in order to have heighten levels of motivation but not get much dopamine that your experience a crash afterwards and also that you can experience heighten pleasure from the various pursuits that you are engaged in in life i know many of you are interested in tools that will allow you to be more motivated to focus longer sleep better that is really what the superman lab podcast is all about but always framed in the contacts of nurobiological principles and objective mechanisms there are some tools that we can apply to the dopamine system and motivation that can really improve our ability to stay in pursuit of things as well as enjoy things after were achieved our goals or even in star goals and here is the key principle dopamine is very subjective meaning you can either allow yourself to experience the pleasure of reaching a milestone of achieving or some craving or not now that will not work in the extreme cases of drugs cocaine and emphatic mind but it is actually pretty powerful what one can do with the subjective system fact granite describe you an experiment that highlights just how powerful the subjective read out or the subjective interpretation of a given experience really can be even at the level of farmocollegy i love examples of subjective effects over things that would otherwise seem hard wired because they really illustrate the interplay between are cognition are belief system and what would otherwise be these just plugin chug kind of mechanisms of you eat ex amount of chocolate or you drink ex amount of water after being water deprived for a certain amount of time hen you get ex amount of dopamine here is the experiment they experiment was just published on march eighteen twenty twenty one very recently and the title of the experiment is expectation for stimulant type modifies caffeine's effects on mood and cognition this was done in college students it is a fascinating study what they did is they gave college students either placebo essentially nothing or two hundred milligrams of affine two under milligrams a affine is about what is in a well a a typical coffee a medium coffee that you a drip coffee or a the coffee that you would make at home it is a fair amount of affine if you were to take in pill form it would defy make you feel more alert unless you were one of those on mutants literally mutants that o is insensitive to affine in those mutants are pretty rare they took sixty five undergraduate students in college they randomize them to either placebo or affine and they told them that they were either getting affine or natural now lateral cognitively carries a very different of expectation college students know overall to be a much stronger stimulant than affine they know it to create a sort of high this is the way the students described it and they thought that it would increase their level of focus and their ability to perform work was really interesting is the was deli an effect of placebo her says coffin that is not surprising however right in take a placebo you maybe may not feel more alert a but you take two under milligrams a fine very likely go a feel very let but there was also an effect of weather not the students thought they were getting affine or natural the subjects receiving affine reported feeling more stimulated anxious and motivated than the subjects that receive the placebo oke but the ones that expected start reported stronger and becoming effects they felt much more high they performed better on a working memory test and in general they had all the increased cognitive effects that they would have been seen with natural but they were only in jesting waffle and this shows an interaction between the drop affine and the expectation that it was natural it led to heighten performers simply because the students thought they we getting natural i do not know whether r not they a told them at the end that it was not at all i doubt that they did this if you want to look it up a the study was a publish in the a the journal of experimental clinical of psychopharmacology on the paper is lube at all l o of we at all and again it was just published of march eighteenth twenty twenty one speaks to the fact that yes there are called placebo effects but this is different than placebo this is a belief effect about what the specific reactions to a given stimulant ought to be and i think this is very important because i think that it points to the fact that the the the top down the kind of higher level connive processes are impacting even the most basic fundamental aspects of the say dopamine rules serrate amount a a adrenalin release are upanefhran release in ways that can positively impact performance in this case it was a positive improvement in working memory and focus as long as were talking about affine it'd to point out a study that really interesting this was publishing journal of enrol science which is the society for hero sciences can flagship journal is their journal oisgood journal and what they showed was that affine can increase dopamine release in the brain by about thirty percent that was it surprising i even said that earlier but what they also showed is that it has a protective of fact on dopamine neurons affine in some cases may not just increased dopamine release but it might actually have a protective effect on dopamine neurons now that is distinctly different from some claims that drugs m drama ecstasy have been its been argued can are nurotoxic for things dopamine and serotonin neurons the study that was published about that in the journal science which is an extremely prestigious excellent journal later it was shown that it was an m i am ecstasy that was given on in that case it was actually amphetamine which is known to destroy dopamanurgic and seretonurgec neurons what does this mean this means that low levels of affine may at least in a few studies be protective for dopamine neurons over time that m i ma ecstasy something that clinical trials right now for the treatment of aroma pities of various kinds and depression but still illegal at this point in time a may although it does not appear yet from any published studies destroy dopamanurgic neurons perhaps rghanurgec neurons at there is a real astrict in a question mark there but amphetamine an in particular methemphed examine is very destructive for dopamanurgenct neurons i do not think any of us needed any additional reasons to avoid methamphetamine a this drug that creates huge increases in dopamine and then huge crashes from that dopamine very destructive drug but in addition to that seems to destroy dopa an urgent neurons from time to time have talked about nicotine on here not smoking because obviously smoking is bad lung cancers bad a for health at camera on but nicotine its in supplemental form have mention that a very famous nor a scientists no about prize winning scientists a choose a lot an carat i know other people o chunicarete om they believe in its narrow protective effects for parkinsons and chimers and indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release we talked about that earlier whether not has a protective effect is not clear the protective effects might be through the noradronergic and a seat of cosine systems those findings are still unclear but it is interesting to note that nicotine can increase prolactin somewhat there are couple studies i be happy to link to them in the caption that shows that nicotine taken too much over too long periods of time can also increase prolactin which again is the opposite side of dopamine to day we have talked a lot about the dopamine system and and those kinds of schedule that will low craving or a diction but what is the schedule of dopamine that is going to low you to maximize on your pursuit of pleasure and your elimination of pain and we get the answer to that from our good friend gambling the reason gambling works the reason why people will throw their lives away the reason why people go back again and again and again to places loss vagus in aplanatic city is because of the hope and anticipation it is as those are cities and places built on dopamine i do not they are leveraging your dopamine system and i realize that there are experienced gamblers their people that enjoy gambling allactually just say in i sitting at the roulette table i was take a designate amount of money it is not much i enjoy playing a lo bit of roulette i certainly enjoy when i win i certainly do not it when i lose but i do it seemly for the pleasure of playing and i do it very seldom i do not have a gambling problem and if i did i probably tell you but i do not have a gambling problem yet people throw away the entire lives on gambling and as a friend of mine whose a certified addiction treatment specialists tells me that you a gambling addiction is a particularly sinister because the next time really could be the thing that changes everything unlike other addictions the next time really could change everything and that is imbedded in the mind of the gambling attic and rarely does it work out a in favor of the well being of the gambling attic and their gambling however the intermittent reinforcement schedule was discovered long ago by scientific researchers this is the slot machine that every once in a while gives you a win to keep you playing this is the the probability of winning on the craps table or the roulette table or at blackjack just often enough the you are willing to by tickets head out there play again go downstairs again from your room even though you were you were done for the night intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful form of dopamine reward schedule to keep you doing something we can export that we can use it for good if there is something that your pursuing in life whether not it is an academic goal or financial goal or relationship goal one of the things that you can do to insure that you will remain on the path to that goal for a very long time and that you will continue to exceed your previous performance as well as continue to enjoy the dopamine release that occurs when you hit the milestones that you want to achieve is to occasionally remove reward subjectively let say you set out a goal of making om o make this quantitative with respect to finances ages as easy description but this could also be in sport this could be in school this could be in music could be in anything creative endeavors but let say you set out a certain financial goal or let say you want to get cart number of followers on whatever social mediate platform as you reach each one of those goals you should know now that the amount of dopamine is not going to peak its ashulgan to diminish and make you create more the key to avoiding that crash but to still keep it in healthy levels that will allow you to continue your pursuit is as you are staircase in toward your goal maybe that is dollars maybe that is followers maybe that is grades maybe that some other metric it is metals or trophies you actually want to blunt the reward response for come of those intermediate goals now's not telling you should celebrate your winds but ism telling you not to celebrate all of them or as a good friend of mine who a recently a fortunately for him a had a great financial success he asked me and somebody else a good friendomine whose very tuned in to dopamine reward schedules understands how they work at a really deep level and he said i do not know what to do next and we said oh that is simple you should just give most of it away and this was not applied to receive any the money ourselves this was really about reducing the impact of that reward now hopefully giving a money away if you already have enough of it would be something that was rewarding in an of itself but if you are a student whose pursuing goals in university or you are an athlete whose pursuing goals it actually make sense from a rational perspective once you understand these mechanisms to hit a new high point of performance or to get that a pair for you if it is an amines et camera and to tell yourself of that was good but to actually actively blunt the reward to not goal and celebrate too intensely because in doing that you keep your dopamine system in check and you insure that you are going to stay on the path of continued pursuit not just for that thing but for all things big increases in dopamine lead to big crashes in dopamine and big increases in dopamine up the anti they increase the extent to which you are willing to invest time and energy in order to achieve goals and rewards that may be out of your reach you never really know if you are going to succeed to make this crystal clear celebrate your winds but do not celebrate every wind that is one way that you can insure that you are going to continue down the path of progress and i think most of the learning tools that are in schools are about reward hopefully for for genuine performance they are about encouraging us we do have to believe that we can perform well one of the hallmarks of growth mindset is the internalization that we are not getting it right yet the word yet is very important and also the else that we reward our good our good behavior are our good performance but not every time one way to do this is to actually take the reward and reinforcement out of your own hands in your own mind and you tell somebody that they are in control of whether or not you are allowed to feel good about your winds now this is i realize is very unnatural for most people but if you are somebody who simply going to be in pursuit and you're going to really register your winds and you think that thatscon actually make you a better performer it will in the short term but not in the long term you can lift the a what loss pages and aplanatic city and other gamboling a mechanisms and places have known for a long time they lifted it from the scientists you can now take it back and you can start to leverage that and you just make it intermittent you reward yourself not on a predictable schedule not every other time or every third time or every tenth time but sometimes it is three in a row than not at all for ten days reward is important self reward is critically important but make sure that you are not doing it on such a predictable schedule that you burn out these stipple in circuits or that you undercut your own ability to strive and achieve i shall have a story from graduate school which i was forced into an intermit ant reinforcement schedule that and do believe is served me very well in my scientific career another aspects of life my graduate adviser was an amazing scientists in fortune she passed away but the making scientists and amazing human being with a very dry and am somewhat cruel sense of humor and her name was barber chapman and we published a paper in the journal science and a science nature and sell are considered the big three the most competitive journals to published i had a first author paper in science it was am really exciting to me was a graduates to i is very excited about the discovery i was excited that it was in science i was just in a thrilled and i remember when the paper finally got accepted because it involved a ton of revisions and a lot of very hard work and she came in and she said paper got excepted i was superexcited and she just cone a sat there and nodded and i said i regain a celebrate i remain i have a party i it what are we going to do and it'll never forget her answer she said we should skip this one and i thought she was joking and i said what you means skip this one were in no publish the paper you recompose the paper but she said maybe when you get for more maybe three maybe too and i thought she was messing with me and she was a messing with me and she was right we never had a party we never had a celebration for that paper i think she was really thing to n still two ideas in me one is that the work itself was what was supposed to be most rewarding the practice of experimentation a writing the paper the experience of achieving something tho worked very hard at and that did indeed feel amazing action can still feel it my body now the excitements o the was still a dopamine a release or that arches is going very long this would be a almost twenty years ago now that this happened that is remarkable the other one is that she is right we never went out and celebrated and we did celebrate other winds other papers in the future in things that sort but she was i other consciously or or subconsciously putting me on an intermittent reward schedule and to this day when something really good happens i actually hesitate as to whether not i want internalize that and celebrate whether i want a tell anybody which is its own form of celebration cause then you are getting positive feet back and i am very cautious with how i deploy dopamine release in response to winds it is certainly not the only way that have navigated my career a their number of other principles i incorporate but intermittent reward for winds for achievements is a very powerful way to insure that you will stay on the path of pursuit at this point in the podcast it'd to take a moment to address some corrections i made some errors in previous episodes they were not major errors but a couple of you pointed them out and it is important to me that we strive for accuracy the first one was i talked in a previous episode about the potential benefits for some people not all of ashuaganda and its roll in blunting cortesall an a way of offsetting medium term and some long term stress it is as a supplement that have benefited from it works through the gala system and some other systems some one pointed out a study that admittedly was done in rats i point i was focusing mainly on studies in humans during the episode but they point out a a study that was done in rats that showed that long term administration of of oschuaganda could actually create some negative effects a mainly on the fibroid and a perhaps even the martial system maybe the melatonin system i just one acknowledge that study a it'll reference it in the caption a again that was a rat study i was focused on human studies please go to examined out calm putting oshuagande will tell you the serious effects on different aspects of brain embody it also linked to the submit articles that are relevant there it is called the human effect metrics cause that is only focused on humans that is one the reads i examined to calm as its focused on human studies get a wonderful free resource but i do appreciate that you pointed out that study because i do want people beware of the the range of affects that these a various compounds can have as well a couple times in previous episodes i said five h t p and not five h t five h t is serotonin five eh t p is a procured in a serotonin i was talking about supplements and compounds that can stimulate the release of serotonin a in the previous episode i was actually referring to it in he contact for which i do not personally to take five h t p that is just my own bias am for reasons i described in that episode but a if you heard me see five h t p when i meant to take five h t n apologize and then last i just want to point out again something t i mention the beginning which is that the human labpodcastis now subtitled in punish episodes one an two as well as our welcome radio are in punish the other ones will be subtitled soon you can expect that within the next couple weeks if punish speaking a people who prefer to digest the information in punish or that you am you can look forward to the

then teach it it is usually not watch one do one teach one its usually watch one do twenty teach as many people as you a possibly want ism not looking for attribution these are tools that are grounded

welcome to the hubermanacontance of science science ace to for i mender supermen and on up professor of neurobiology and entomology at stamford school of venison my guys to day is doctor and professor makes bonito doctor makes bonito is a neurologist and a professor of negro science and psychology at the university one californium barely he is a world expert in the brain mechanisms controlling executive function and memory executive function is the way in which we are able to designate and carry out specific cognitive strategies and it is fundamental to every aspect of our daily lives and because much of being effective in daily life involves using specific context relevant batches of information in order to understand what to do and when and what not to do and when and to come up with strategies that are very adaptive for us to move forward in the context of relationships work school and athletics and on and on there is really no separation between executive function and memory and to day doctor desbozito explains the neral circuits controlling executive function and memory how they interact the key role of dopamine in executive function and something called working memory and teaches us ways to optimize executive function and memory that is how to optimize cognitive function in addition to discussing how to optimize connive function in the healthy brain today's discussion also centers around how to restore connive function in disease or injury conditions that deplete executive function and memory such as thematic brain injury concussion alsheimers parkinsons and attention definite disorders doctor despozito shares with us research findings both about behavioral informicologic strategies to enhance executive function and memory by the end of to day's discussion you will have learned from doctor does bonito a tremendous amount about the modern understanding of cognition that is thinking and memory and the carrying out of specific connive strategies you will also learn a tremendous amount about how to optimize brain function and brain health before we begin id to emphasize at this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to think the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is make new venison now we knew venison is the most neutrino dense and delicious red meat available have spoken before on this podcast and there is general consensus that most people should strive to consume approximately one gram of proline expound of bodyweight now when one strives to do that it is important to maximize the quality of that proving an take to the carry ratio because you do not want to consume an excess of calories when trying to get that one gram of proline expound of bodyweight now we knew venison has an extremely high quality proving to carry ratio it makes getting that one gram of p routine propound a bodyweight extremely easy it is also delicious personally i the ground venire and lie the venison stakes and then for convenience when am on the road i the jersey the jersey is a very high proline to carry ratio it has as much as ten grams of proline purr jerky stick and has something only fifty five calories again making a very easy to get enough proline without consuming excess calories if you would to try mawenewe venison can go to make new venison dock calm slash superman to get twenty per cent off your first order again that is mawenee venison doc calm slash superman to get twenty per cent off to day's episode is also brought to us by u jive makes medical grade red light therapy devices now there is one thing have consistently emphasize on this podcast is the incredible roll that light can have on our biology of course ism always telling people that they should get sunlight in their eyes as soon as possible after waking on as many days of their life as possible for sake of setting certain rhythm daytime moodfokus an alertness and improve sleep now in addition to sunlight red light and serin free light has been shown to have passive effects on improving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health including faster muscle recovery improved skin health and wound healing even improvements in acne or that is removal of acne reducing pain and inflammation improving my a conjugal function and even improving vision itself what sets jive apart and why it is my preferred red light therapy device is that it has clinically proving ravelings meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light and her i red light combination that trigger the optimal cellar adaptations personally i use the hand held jive every day the hence jug is about the size of a thick piece of toast and i also own a jive panel that allows for full body exposure and i use that one approximately five times per weep for about ten to fifteen minutes procession if you would to try jive you can go to jive doc all slash superman to receive fifty dollars off your first purchase again that is jive spell we oh o v doc calm slash superman to get fifty dollars off your first purchase to day's episode is also brought to us by eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity of spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now a key component of getting a great night sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees one of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes accuse at the appropriate times at the beginning and throughout and at the end of your night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that is what eight sleep allows you to do it allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energies have been sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover for a out three years now and it has dramatically improve the quality of my sleep if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep do calm slash supermen to get a hundred fifty dollars off their pod three mattress cover eight sleep currently ships and the you less a candida you k select countries in the u and australia again that is eight sleep do calm slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor marked deposit doctor deposit welcome i pandour thank you much providing me really look can forward our conversation you may not remember me but i remember you when i was a first year graduates to and a you showed up it berley one of the first people to really bring functional imaging of the human brain to berley bring a neurology and a clinical emphasis to the nursing studies there in its really just a blossomed and it is been a real thrill for me to see all the magnificent work out of your laboratory over the years and i know you also still see patient the topics that are of interest to you i know of great interest to our audience you wo just start off with a few of the basics and i do little functional near anatomy lesson for folks not to scare any one do not worry this will be accessible t everyone and just talk about the front loaves and forefront of quartan and a a bit of what those structures do because many times on this pod vassals at oke the neural real estate right behind your forehead is involved in contacts and planning at camera but you are the real expert here am how should we think about what the front o loaves do and and their versus rolls in health and disease yes there for loaves this affrontoloaves pride a tonal except a and the frontaoloaves pry take up more do take up more territory than a to pry about a third of of the quarter and within the front to loaves i do not ism get to use sir front loaves fry in our conpresentiona lap what i really mean as the forefront of quarter within the front loaves there is also mot areas at point for motor function as well a but more talk about the frontolove the took about its you known barman higher level talking a bill is really talk about the prefrontal tartar and this is what is considered sir the highest level of quarter in the brain ye when you think it when you think about to people a sign it all sorts of functions almost every function think of people for put into the front lives but i think what we have all conconnic a move towards us this idea of executive function this atilt this ability to to plan to organize a to really trance for our thoughts into an action and really to be guided by goals and and intentions and not be kind of take in a kind of ruled by sort of just automatic behaviors d a word we use in corner sciences call cognac control to control executive functions what we attribute to the front tole and you can think of it as the seat el of the brain or the i ignore the conductor of the archaist are really the part of the brain that is that is really controlling the the the rest of the brain yet you have to choose which part you wanted not leave home that is your front is your frontalopes speaking of which a what a some of the a symptoms of mild front lobe damage an severe front o lobe damage a damage brought about either through a nerve gene of disease or physical injury i in organ to talk a bit about both to day or a lot about both but how would lack of executive function a show up maybe on inking of a subtle level ye i mean at first i would say that it shows up all the time because when when and in front a low behaviors probably much more prevalent than than we realize certainly we think about it when you have a brain injury to the frontolovs and there is lots of neurological disorders stroke can termacbrane my nowcimersthes that can affect in frontolope and there is a number of fend psychiatric disorders obsessive compulsive disorder and gets of frenzy and depression that a thought to be frontolope is function but when your sleep deprived and when your stress and just normal aging the frontaloves seems to be the first system that is affected because it really is involve in the highest level when we are having a bad day when we are having difficult the sort of setting priorities om we're having difficulties achieving the goal that we have set out when we get distract when we get distracted u when we are not able to serve a daft and flexible these are all the type of things tat a reflect that our frontoloves are not functioning ultimately approximately what age does the front lobe circuitry a come on line to speak mean when i see a baby a babies can orient their eyes towards things but they are rather reflective in in where they will place their eyes but by time kids or three or four they con certainly play with blocks or interacted with other children or their parents but it seems that ben full functionality the frontaloves is is really gradual at least that is my non clinically train to sentiment ye i mean that is a really tough question to know when they are fully developed because these studies haven done when emir i was introduce somewhere able to for image the brain in a nonavase of way a than studies its tart to come out trying to remap out at what age does your frontoloves fully develop and it seem it was early into your your twenties you know always say that it is not surprising that you cannot rent to car an to your twenty five at the insurance companies knew before your scientist it is to when your frontoloves have when your decision making skills at their highest and that is probably bout right and to your twenties is brolly before your front loves of fully developed and it is really interesting question is what why does it takes long it is the area of the brain that takes the longest to develop and why is that and i think there is a reason i think hat t this sort of slow developed of frontaloves allows us to to explorer allows us to think a to novel ways of solving problems allows us to take in the world if they were shut off earlier ah it would would lead to ma be much more sort of rigid kind of less flexible kind of a behavior thatthat would seem think i i think that that it helps to be i take a long time to develop but also it obviously leads to some problems sometimes adolescences s as we see sometimes can one see a lack of front o low maturity in just the sheer number of physical movements that a child makes am for instance in a class room of i that say fourth graters often times they will be a range of u apparent of ability of kids to sit still or to listen do we think that the kid that is having a hard time focussing and listening to instructions or steadying their body when they are told to sit still i now if they still tell consist said i hell but the would tell me a sit still i i was a kid am is that am somehow reflective of a slightly lagging front of frontoloe function and maturity whereas that that the kids the consist still in stop con focus does that mean that they are low bit more accelerated along that trajectory let's hard to say i mean the frontelobe is big as a big territory and we can get into it but there is the front lo probably has twenty five difference sob regions within it and and grossly we think about the frontelobes as the fatal portion of the front lobes of which is involved in these executive function probably supports these exercise functabilities but then we have got another part the front loves called the normal frontal cortex was brolly value more in social and emotional behavior when we think again when we think about front all behaviors a they cant you have to break there is many different type affront a behavior that time behavior which may be loved since or being able to inhibit your motor movements or maybe not being distracted may reflect that that system is a little bit delayed but it could be that another system the one that is involved in planning and organizes you knows more developed than i i i do think they they develop at different trajectories with the front loaves essentially am serving an executive or see o tight function got directed behavior intentions cognitive control on these are the terms you used u where are the rules what do the rules look and i think about brain function or have spent one my life thinking about think about chemical an electrical signalling between means different irons communicating more or less at a given moment reflecting some sort of circuit as we call it and then some behavior or some decision comes out and if i for instance u i to get my driver's licence renewed since if i go to the department of motor vehicles what a lovely experience that is a the moment i get there tat i for lock him to a certain rule set when ism home ism in a different rule set when ism in my friends verses when i with my parents a different rule sets and seems at the front o lo is really good it drawing on context base on knowledge of where one is and then coming up with concave algorithms that are appropriate or inappropriate to run in that context but what is the nature of these algorithms are they of the o say shut down all cursing in this environment o get your freedom just quoting be you i mean when e really comes down to it has some interesting philosophical aspects too because i just be yourself be then try be vulnerable you'll these things i make sense but of course one needs to be appropriate with the context o this work what what is the what are the algorithms how how's his work i because because that is a pretty common example of our patience that they they do not follow the rules m they they if you are sitting in a some one ought the doctor's office and the phoned rings not to pick up his phone but the patients do not and that they may pick up the phone there there is a door loment who is a a noroligis from france publish these beautiful papers in the cities of all these things that patience did that just that broke the rules and and stand bring just kind of pull to the their environment without having any contexts to it if he put a pair of glasses on the table and did not ask him to put hem n they would put hem on even if they had a pair glasses on a ready or he took em to their apartment than they saw the bed and they jump into h bed and go on to the covers i he saw he had a nurse and she he put a blood pressure coff there and she picked up the blood pressure coffin just start taking his blood pressure and not asking em to do any these things and they they they just do not follow sort of the social rules but they are there they they have not lost rules if you ask these patience was that the appropriate thing to do they will say no no they know it they not they know its appropriate yet they shay know ism not supposed to answer your phone but o o they know better but they cannot control the inexactly sons it is it is yo is not a break down at the rules disappear is that they cannot apply the rule that they cannot apply the rules brought properly and and that is true for a lot of patience even with kids you tell them i do not have anything to eat before dinner because for having dinner and then they sitting there having a always and you say what it i just tell you you said shall do not eat but i ism hungry right a sir another for examples or the frontloves not completely cant of developed when i think about rules i i think about the brain the brain processes information obviously but it also store s information the most important thing it does his store all sorts of information all over the brain and i think what the front a loves do as they store rules and what is interesting about the way it stores rules they seem to store the rules in a hierarchical fa arson and what i mean by that is that there is different levels to rules i i to give the example of a playing golf i tell story a lot about my good friend bob night when hits a ball into the you know off into the woods and he has to try and hit the ball out of the woods he is holding on to all different levels of rules on how a successfully get his ball back towards the green the chemist simplest one is just where in a where is the flat have got o maintained a a orientation to get to the flack hes holding that he also hat a higher level rules he knows that if he kicks the ball it is a penalty he is not an a do that righting then an another higher level rule might be if i just keep doing this that this is can be healthy for me hes storing all this information at sort of a different lives of hire and he supplanted r applying it to ultimately achieve this very simple act of not simple act of of in the offal yes i just i think about for the front a sort dick is able to call upon the rule in the appropriate contacts and if you do not have your front to loves it it it does not get pulled up properly and those rules must be learned right that it there is no way i can imagine that one can be born into the world with these rules sets an i think abut the the two marshal experiment that is or famous now were kids are offered to eat a one marshamaua right away or differ and get two marshamaloshes a adorable video fly reistragedies they use turning away and poking the marshmallow and there is a some debate on going as to whether not a success we lack of success in differing to the two marshamaul reward is am predictive of of other things in life but leaving that aside u ami correct in assuming that that task is a frontal lob task the kids are given a novel rule you nave one marshal a now or wait patiently and then a with and overcome the craving for that one marshal an then you will get too presumably that that experiment is engaging the frontal loaves and wee can only speculate but some kids are able to defer some or not and i can imagine that at that age there is a lot of neuroplasticity am strengthening and weakening of connections is in the brain on in an experienced dependent way does that mean that children and perhaps adults as well can train up there prefrontal sort cortical abilities to strategies and defer in a way that is adaptive absolutely i mean definitely you can learn target's to not only sort of learn rules but but how to apply goals ben when you start to think about that task and particular some of it has to do what sort of maintaining a goal and and maintaining a goal at different time scales right and children tend to e sort of act on goals that are much more short on a shorter time call an ism gan have the alone right now because ism hungry i suppose to wait i till dinner which is a longer longer term goal and ye have this default a sort of the short you can you can learn that maintaining a longer type goal i it can be much more beneficial i then then the short term gull even though it does not seem obvious and we all learn that right was we it as we get longer of us we keep or i on the ball or for long term goals and that is very predictive of you successful we can we can be the farther out we can maintain at gallon that is what the that is what the forefront of cortex does it maintains goals and than applies those goals and if you do not apply i then you love then then all of this executive function breaks down do you think that these algorithms and rules that the prefrontal quartic circuitry can learn and indeed does learn can generalize for instance when i my first year of college was the disaster a for reasons that aren't interesting right now but then when i came back mysoffmore year really spring of my freshmen years okay its on it was had the rescue myself and one of thingsthey as to do as i would study and i would set a timer i refuse to get up even if i a use the the rest r in her very very badly i would ism set up all sorts of behavioral constraints and i to think that i was building up my prefrontal ability refocus on the material and fortunately for me there were no smart ones i then much easier i internet now we had get of but no no all internet browsing to to speak of and i to think that the i sometimes call it a and this is terrible am to call this because it is not a nearly exhaustive of the underling function by call sort limbic friction it is there's this friction that one feels mentally you want it get up you when has the rest me hen eats something hone o call a friend but you stay focus on the task in hand do you think that that business of coming stain focus on the task at hand can generalize because of the sensations it generates in the body and then you owe that that is is familiar this is just studying but in a different context ye one is one says focus wore do you think that the prefrontal quarters it is context specific that it needs to learn a rule the rules for every individual situation and than this has all sorts of implications for behavior restrained and focus and attention defies it a if you could just speculate am a that known yet when list id in how they can be more focus and people often defeat you what supplement what drug octet that those are interesting conversations but i think ultimately were talking about neral circuitry yet i mean it absolutely can generalize tit that is been a trusting thing and de trying to develop what we call cogniterapy where we we teach we try and prove some one's memorability we try and prove son's executive functionality that the disappointing early results was always that ye they get very good at the task that you train them at but it does not seem to vernalize that anything use if you teach hem a a task they can do amazing things match o finger to colors or shape and put together all sorts of rules and then and there really good at that taste very quickly and then nothings really changed in the real life but but i think we have learned in how a sort of and how to trying make it a translate to real life and and for example there is there is a there called got man had been training which is developed a by brain evening college at the roman researchers to tyrant where they have been very successful in teaching a patience i do not prove your executive function and how to make that translate into real world but it is it is very hard work its it is very therapist driven it it requires i it requires a series of o trainings for example people learn a they develop individual projects planning a meal or planning a family vacation planning up hod gasman than they work through what is involved in that for o very specific project how you how you stay focus how you do not just get distracted how you you keep your my in the ball how you break it down to seagulls how you i you mot to what you are doing how you do not let anxieties porascination gan all but it is a it is a very act of for process but when you add all that to it and a very discipline way over the course of many hours many weeks it does translate patience and individuals to say ye ism just better doing things i mean the whole gulls to do things tried and and ism just better at it i do not know what it is but ism ism not just better at what you taught ma am just reiterate at other things i do have a lot of hope that these kind of therapece bill generalize to the rent to people's real life i throughout the term limbic friction again not a technical or clinical or official term in anyway but just a way to and a captured some of the interactions of the front of quarter with other circuitry cumin the far for involved in agitation and challenges focussing than the limbic system but its it certainly is involved when thinking about the frontal quarter i often think about it is connections with other areas of the brains wo may be we could talk a little bit about those connections and and in particular the connections from the front a quarter to what is call it am circuitry that controls reflective behaviors what are what is the nature of that circuitry and can we make any general statements does the frontal quarter really serve to provided quieting suppressive function on reflects or is it more of an orcustor a conductor where it saying look little bit of that woman o that and then what is what comes out in behavior or speech is something that looks very organized but it is actually the the the reflection of the lot of selective filtering yes i mean the prefenal quarter what fastening about is that it i would say it connects that every part of the brain a tartar and the sub quartan and almost every part of the brain connects to it o that i mean that right there tells you it is a pretty importance very and id it has to if it is going to be in this o conductor ti experience a roll and it is in this privileged position just anatomically that that was as great inside to how important it is and it is connecting and then of course we could talk about it how it is connected to the body as well how i control is hartragt and respiration as well s notches this the brains a but it is really interesting you said is is it really just sort of maintaining telling you what is relevant and what is not relevant or an allowing you to switch i think it does all those things it definably what we call sense these top down signals it is sending signals to the brain about what you should be pain attention to an what you should not be a play an attention to for example if you we have done studies with functional imaging where we have them look at pictures of faces and scenes and that lights up the back of your brain your visual quarter as areas at er can process faces and process scenes and om but sometimes we have you just one pay attention to the faces and not the scenes and other times we want you to pay attention the scenes and not the faces well you do not even though it is getting the same bottom up visual in put the prefrontal quarter will show greater activity to the relevant information it it will it will for it is sending a signal say pay attention the faces it ignore the scenes and a or vice averse it is it is directing all of this information tat wanted with to what is what is relevant but at the same time it is also a allowing us to switch if if that we now have to go switch to another task its was of a this as not in portent now ore gang to move over to this this other other task there is many different components of how i can how i can kind of control behavior but it does all of these things in this incredible way that we tied don't completely understand what we know that is the source of of all f this control is coming from the preform the quarter it'd to take a brief moment and think one of our sponsors and that is a one a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that also contains adoptions i start taking a one away back in two thousand and twelve the reason i start taking it n the reason i still take it every day is that it insures that i been all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it insures that i get enough robotic and robotic to support got health now god health is something that over the last ten years we realized is not just important for the health of our got but also for our mine system and for the production of narrow transmitters and auromodulators things dopamine in her atone in other words god health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course i strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of nutritional intake every single day but there are number of things in a one including specific micro veterans that are hard to get from whole foods ore at least in sufficient quantities a one allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that i need robotic preboatics the adaptions and critical micrornutriencs any time somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement what that supplement should be i tell them a one because a one support many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try a one go to drink g one dotcam slash superman and you will get a your supply a vitamin d three k two and five free travel packs of a one again that is a drink a one calm slash huberment you mention connections between the prefrontal quarter in the body u that is the first have heard of that and ism not challenging that to the contrary ism just intrigued by it m ism aware that the hi pofalmess and some these deeper brain structures associated with more what is call the primitive drives temperature regulation a hunger et camera connect to the body but a what what is the nature of some of the connections with the fault to the o was just or talking terms of of our knowledge of how young changing i i wanted your pates to talk about ti as to the prefrontal quarters and slow heartwrights i meant in that in that runway got it at that that yet bi bi the by influence and a cortical function will obviously we can influence a a organs the got it through some intermediate stations yes ye i me it is not to not to be hyperbolic but seems the prefrontal quarter what here ere referring to as the front loaves are essentially the seat of what makes us human and what makes us functional or dysfunctional in a given context it i m ah i recall there is a centrum cloveerbucy centrum which has some vague a similarities to how you describe frontal cart damage but there i as i re call humans or animals with that centrum will act in a way that is not appropriate to context but more inappropriate tell they will try and eat a a sumac cop or draw with a piece of paper which obviously will not work it seems with the frontal quarter it knows that a pen is for writing it just the person might say i know not speck write this but ism just in or write with it but i when o take your pen and write something inappropriate with it but it is not that the the people forget that there is that it is a pen it seems it is drawing on rule sets but that somethings intact it is that it is not clover buy syndrome were animal some people can trying a mate with inanamit are objet u which is one of the more alien sometimes it'll never forget that serum from my con nurse fence course which yo y the way to throw that in there ye si how shall we thing about this and heremchin an get at a kind of a broader understanding a brain function and context specific behavior it front quarter is supersipistic ate but it does not have all the information seems some one without a front or quartets probably knows that you write with a pen you do not write with a piece of paper ye i i think it is we think about it as it is the frontocort as allows us to take thought and move it towards action and there is this disconnect between the the knowledge and an action and this separation of action from knowledge and i guess i can reflect on my patience when i have seen a lot of patience with damage all over the brain and all the families of patience who have front of injury always say the same thing the they are just no longer that person they are no longer my pause are no longer my best friend and no longer my father to something they cannot put it into words but they are not them any more there is something has changed whereas if you talked of patient with broke of aphasia whose has this inability to speak they cannot get any words out now this is a devastating problem there still the same person they they they their personality hasn't change they they feel the same person they just cannot speak the way they get around in the world is different or if you take a patient with prosaic knows it which is a this inability to recognize faces of course the way they navigate around the world is is is difficult and it is not the same but there is still the same person there is something really special about the frontal cart that allows us to be as you said sir of who we are and that is the difficult part how does the frontelopes allow us or take a take who we are translate that into noted we are not i guess another worse saying it just just having knowledge is in what makes us who we are right at this to be able to take that knowledge and and and presented in a way that allows us to live life bases on our intentions and our goals and our desires much of things stoic philosophy and and even lying well miss culture are bout having routines you o overcoming reflects by just having recipes scrips to follow each day i certainly try to have my mourning be as what i call liner as possible and i find it is much easier in the earlier part of the day to just decide hears what i to do wrist out o lis do things in a certain sequence if i do not do that i go non linger as i refer to it well get distracted and things that sort but earlier you mention sleep deprivation can impair front a low function it does seem that as the day progresses and certainly in the middle the night it just becomes much harder to control are are thinking maybe even our behavior but and certainly our emotions is there a front old a regulation of emotional states as well i know you have some recent work on this loved ye i mean as i was saying earlier the frontaloves as a big place and and half of it is invoked an these high level executive functions but the other half of it is in is a part up the lyric system or that we call the parelemic issei that is involved an social and emotional behavior and a there is this intimate back and forth between these two areas of the quarters if you have just damage to these frontal to these areas that are condo in the front lobe you will have many different in parents that are we would call sir social or emotional apparent and their executive function will be quite normal and then you will have the the opposite where patients with the late damage have executive functions but they seem emotionally intact but but you do not in journal life when we have both these intact their their communicating with each other right emotion in contacts and is going influence are executive function we make bad decisions in stressful situations are situations were not comfortable with its it is where we might make a better decision if it is a quiet yow kind o come quiet place u but it is something that we can i think your right you can you can sort of get into routine and learn how to do things if you have very much plan tow but whats unique about us you we can be flexible on a datable right when when something novel comes over there is something i something unexpected comes up we can adapt to it and that is really what the front of cortex is really importanimpor i not just sort of making these plans routines and sending all the rules with being abs when things do not go right ha ta how to write the ship right i will never ask you to demonize technology i certainly use a a smartphone from waking till sleep generally not in the middle the night if i can avoid it a and i generally avoid it but am trying to take what we've discussed this far and superimpose the the notion of smart phones and ask what are the rules what are the algorithms that were learning when we use these devices and ism not calling them adapt give wore maledict if there clearly here to stay they have assisted in medicine ism sure it makes it easier for doctors to communicate on the on the ward an and for clinic and a it but useful it but contained in the small device there are things u for instance text messaging where unlike twenty years ago we can have four or five different conversations very quickly while boarding a flight there is a tasks whishing element that was just not present in a life prior to that social medium particular this notion of being able to scroll move if we really step back from this move one's thumb an access hundreds if not thousands of video content from distich each of which has a distinct context and have to imagine that kids indadults have frontal courtesies that a learning these rules and the rule is move your thumbs stay engaged emotions either positive silence emotions or negative emotions and me it is it is a fairly limited landscape there when you really think about it but but the algorithm that is learned is to me does not seem exploitable it does not help me prepare for a podcast at all i know that for short does not help me go for a run does not help me listen with more focused attention to a family member were a friend or significant other it may make me more empathic or more angry i we can we can speculate but again with no with no intention of demonizing social media it does it seem that that the algorithms that are being run in our brain men are they neutral re they positive are they negative shall we be worried it does not seem lake they translate to much else they who cannot see a way in which they help us be better people in other domains where as reading a book line by line and then going back o i did not even remember anything from that page going back line by line cling i game a squash or somethinglike that there i can see the real value of the rule sets that generalize ye i and i can just historically i corrupt in world when there was no earphones as a resident and and one of the most difficult things i do in practices have to take care patience in emergency room and there is a real emergency one's having cold control sensors or there having a stroke and doing this back in the aides or nineties and early two thousand when you went down there and you did not have any smart phone you you could only rely on what is what is in your head and i could say now having the smart phone it has not it does not help me at all i i never u know does not help me at all in making the kind of decisions that i have to make in emergence ism ism trying to side what what what is the problem here what is the differential diagnosis what how should i treated ism just trying to make very going through an grown you said in a common sense wand there is nothing on my phone that i can turn to to help me do that it has helped with giving me knowledge back in the day i to remember what the i land an dose was and have that in my head or go look for the piece of paper my pocket and i can quickly pull up you kiwi if ism a little bit there is information that i can access i do not have to worry about keeping every single dose in my head or keeping everything my head just facts in my head but outside of that there is nothing i can turn to that it is it is making me better making me make better decisions s i i do not even need myself phone i do not go searching u for myself pone if ism going to go to merit o remorigan to take a take a phone i do not see how it is helping for make your front the look it cannot be your front to loves i mean this another way of saying it but but ion the lipide can it help you optimize front to love function technologies certainly it can we can maybe talk about later there are discertainly that that is one way to get learned strategists through a through a device that that is easily accessible and you know to you as suppose book or or i in a therapist the in your house i suppose i worry that am too much of my time and other people's time and especially young people's time is am engaging in a algorithm that does not generalize for adaptive behavior elsewhere and and by comparison youknow a the game o stalker with friends or something i it is social social media social am it is physical social medals not physical but will will rule that that portion out but there is a rule set here's gold directed behavior am presumably some of the things that happen in a game a stalker with friends translate to some other domain of life am because it is a single context game of stalker wheres the social media i do not know anybody that goes and looks at one account and that is it and absorbs the information may be comments has an interaction and goes it is it is hundreds or thousands of context is there any risk or perhaps benefit to being able to am get this very a detailed portal into many contexts reunite time and that the forgings never had done that in the course of human history as far as i know ye i may i think there is a risk but wat pops to mine n your having kids is is watching them navigate in their cars to place is totally dependent on angora maps and i the you are pry old enough to remember real maps that were you does asoaelemaps i were you had to really figure hat you you had to go to a certain place and you had thither look at the map or or or as spit assays on at of the this these skills were something that you learned and you developed and it was problem solving and and a and that is all gone now i mean that it is it is i i wonder even if sometimes if if a people even know the direction there going whether it is was norther what set down the end because there just following the direction i we will see i i just cannot imagine that that learned skill as nock and o be detrimental to us at it is some point in generalized the reverse generalize an a bad way right and as as supposed to a good way am i do not ya it does it does deptfually worry me but you said there is nothing on the phone that helps you plan a pot last something that helps me in the emerged from nothing else a professor hen he is giving a lecture i agree with you that the sort of having your head buried in in a sulphone ism not yet it is i do not see tho being healthy for your front loves let us talk about working memory am so years back but still now you use working memory tasks in experiments in your laboratory few would am be kind as to explain what working memory is and then i love to talk about some of the work you have done exploring the rule of dope of men in working memory am because this is critical to every day life and i know dopemeins to bit of a buzz word these days but ism the listeners to this podcast anyway or a pretty sophisticated in terms of knowing that dopamine is not just about reward it is about motivation and gold directed behavior and i think dopamine intrigues for a good reason that it does govern a lot of our quality of life to i what is working memory yet i mean working memory it snorting a start studying it about thirty years ago and i do not think i realize how important it was when i started but what we mean by working memories is ability to hold information in mind i when it is no longer accessible to us if you tell me you are telephone number and ism after put it into my phone you know it is no longer there you just told me but it'll hold it in in working memory until i can punch it into my my phone it does not have to be something that comes from the outside world i could hold up a you know i can pull up my own if ism filling out o form and i want to pull up my self security number i can hold that in mind to until i put it down ism when you think about it it it is a very important us ability that we have that we do very callously and what have learn more about working memory is is the working part of it t it is not just as passive holding information of mine what it is being able to do things with the information it is being able to i it when we when we do a bath problem which we do not do that much now that we have calculated if you do that in you are head you are able to for manipulate the information an and do the different parts of the problem or even if you are you are trying to find someone in a crowd and you are holding on to some face you are able to hold that face in mind and cross check it and search and and there is there is operations to working memory is not just you knows not just this passive maintenance when we start to think about working memory in that way we start to realize how important is for it is you not think fit as the foundation for for cognition it just think about reading comprehension you cannot understand this conversation if you cannot hold in mind what is going on earlier in in the conversation or when your reading a book you rememorying the sentence i before it it it just predicts all these abilities that that allows us to to read to to a plan to organize in all the sort of executive functions that were we are doing right we have to hold in mine rules we have to hold in mine goals we have to hold in mind all of these things in order to carry out behavior i us is it is it is really come a long way and and terms about people are thinking about it i i know that a to walker said that you now sleep is our superpower but i guess one way to for of use his term while we are awake working memory is is really our superpower we i it allows us to to translate as we said sir of our knowledge into action by holding this information a and mind as were thinking about what we want to do if we are going to think about dopamine in the contacts of working memory is dopamine an accelerator on working memory is it a facilitator what is dopamine doing for w working memory and may we count talk a obit about the circuitry a have talked about open men before on this podcast but there is a good chance that some the people listening to this haven't heard those episodes may we could just quickly review the three majors circuits for opening in the one that is relevant for working memory ye bet let me star wit the working memory the circuitry for working memory because shan't wont of it important things about working memory is the other type of memory is as long tor memories is you you can working memory short lived it is only as long as you are able to rehearse it and then it disappears where's what we call lung tor memory if i it you remembering what you had for breakfast or your vacation this is information that is ts consolidated and and gets put into a a more durable form that we call long to memory and the interesting thing about memory is that these are separate systems everything from working memory just as in pass into long to memory there there to completely different systems and and too completely different parts of the brain that seem to control it a working memory a the front of cortex seems to be very important for working memory when when we are holding information and line the neurons the brain sells in the frontoloves ore active and they stay kind of active as long as we are holding on that information and they are more active when the information is relevant a and if we a we we get distracted we'll get less active kind of the front lops on attract your a you contract the memory that you are holding in mind another important thing about the circuitry is that i if wore holding in mine say digits tense the phone number well that information in your back of the brain and the the front does is for keeping information in the back of the brain active because it is connected to the visual areas it is it is able to our keep that information active and what we have learned is that there is not these buffers in the brain whereof know if your holding verbal information its in this little buffering if your holding visual information in another buffer the whole brain acts as a buffer and and the front love can call up any part of the brain and and keep that part of the brain active as it is as it is you know as it is trying to hold this information in line the mechanism for working memories just this persistent neral activity within the front loves and then the questions what is do not mean do well do not mean is one of the normodulators that are made in the brainstorm and it projects up the different parts of the brain there is a system that goes up into the into the what we call the basil gangly which is born for motor function and white's another open resistant that goes up to the frontoloves and what was discovered was that if you deplete do not mean a working memory drops you get of significant impairment working memory if if you droplet do not mean and if you replace it ah than your working memory will be improved and do not means seems to be a modulator to help this persistent activity state persistent a during the time that you need to we this information in mind in my reaching too far to drawn analogy between dope means roll in working memory that is to keep information on line and the other established roll of dopamine which is for movement for the generation of smooth movement i as evidence by conditions parkinsons where people lackdopamanurgin her on or have damage o soft benmenurging neurons and have i challenges in generating smooth movement what ism essentially asking is can we think of dopamine as facilitating physical movement through one circuit but also and of mental movement thought movement and a i think o for those i just listening in and not watching i can rubbing my index in mintage finger against my thumb a just keeping something on line i it sort of movement of thought or information and then you can chuck it away and bring i out the next information is that is that i think is ha good way of thinking about and one my wonder lot will how can do not mean be important for memory but also be important for movement and its really simple as just that its acting at different circuits the the the anurans that go to the motor areas that carry do not mean will will when do not mean is express there than and boosted there then still be involved in movement and lack of do not mean the base ganging lea to her log oral sorters parkansiisease that has severe movement a difficulty but when it is acting in the frontal cortex ah and express the frontal cortex than it is an in prove working memory so is just the the nature of where the circuits are where the do not mean is that is that is allowing it to have different kinds of actions and that is ought for all transmitters a the reason why docile coming seems to be more important for longer memories because it it is projecting to the hipicapus which was he knows another are that is in formed for memory and and that is why all coming does not boost working memory but do not mean does an viciversa i to take a quick brake to acknowledge our sponsor element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolyte sodium magnesium and potassium and that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve cells your neurons relies on electrolytes in order o function properly when your well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes in your system your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved i drink one packet of element dissolved in about sixteen to thirty two ounces of water when i wake up in the morning as well as while i exercise and if have sweat lecturing that exercise i often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about thirty two ounces of water after i exercise element comes in a variety of different flavors all of which i find really tasty the centrists i the water telling the raspberry frankly i can't pick just one it also comes in chocolate and chocolate went which i find taste best if they are put into water dissolved and then heeded up i tend to do that in the winter months because of course you do not just need hydration on hot days and in the summer in spring months but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry if you to try element you can go to drink elements spelled elements doom slash supermen to try a free sample back again that is drink element doom slash supermen drilling a little bit more deeply in to the roll of dopamine and working memory you did some really lovely experiments a showing that if am people who have low levels of damn a increase their dopamine a phormochologically i think the drug that was use was bromocriptine a that working memory improves conversely if one to pleas dopamine pharmocologically do working memory gets worse am but as i recall there was an important base line that is important because it really mattered in terms the altcomeaning if somebody already had relatively high levels of dopamine in the circuit increasing dopamine further with bromocriptine did not i impart a benefit and might have even made their working memory worse there is a kind of inverted youshape function to the a how does one know whether not the base line dopamine is low medium or high urge how do they know whet or not that they would a one to explore going about increasing dopamine through any number of different approaches right for most people probably have off a do not mean but there is a significant percentage that probably have too little or may be too much and it is unfortunately we cannot measure in the blood an there is not a blood tests than i am aware of that can can measure a do not mean because it is stuck in a sucking the brain am prefer dopamine in the blood does not is not a good read out is not a good read out ye and and especially when your talking about do not mean and in arias prefrontal cartel and a we do not have a good read out there there is there is in vase of procedures posotronomissian tomography where we can inject a radio is to a and the tags dope mean and then we can measure how much we can to a scan that actually show us us how much dope mean this scan was originally developed to show parkinseces that that you can kimonos parking disease by showing that there is there is less dope mean and impatience paresis by looking at this the scan am obviously it is in vast your injecting a is stope is expensive and on something we could all do but we had use s to show that it correlates very strongly with your working memory capacities o how much information you can hold on line if you can hold four or five or six letters when i do a a span task am correlated with how much dope men we can see n the pecan that that would be a away that we could do it a if you were to read out a string of a few numbers or letters am and i can remember all of those a few moments later a perhaps perhaps might baseline done mean levels or a moderate in the in the normal range whereas if i could not keep that on line that might be might be reflective of lower baseline opening levels is thateright yes it is a very strong proxy for do not mean if your your working our capacity is seven letters when or numbers when i say for or three seven one five zero six if you get wees a rat pretty quickly you probably have more dot baseline soft mean than than some one who has five er is it is it is a proxy for measuring on one that that is one way of do it and that is actually how we did in our original studies we we actually a group individuals base on whether their capacity base on this behavioral measure was high or low and you said those who work that can only hold five or six letters if we gave em bromal pristine which was the dopenergegagonists we improve their working memory ah we got them into servanoten level but but those who re already pie we actually made them we work we got them worse and the moral that story was that more is just not better were trying to get people optimal and the real question is is enough we want to get people oatmeal you were inferring it you have to know what their do not bean is where where are you on this inverted you curve another way of doing it i is through am a genet oogenetic study we have do not mean and her transmitters have to be broken down and retake into the into the brainsell in order to be used again and is different ways of doing it in some sells a it gets transported back into the brain sell an other other places there is an ensile that that breaks it down while there is an enzyme called comet ah that is breaks down don't mean in the forefront of quarter specifically in a large percentage individuals that ensile is either overactive or underactive probably about twenty five per cent of individuals it is overactive in another twenty five per cent it is underactive probably half the population now this is gin a very depend on other where you live in where you come form in things but it but but maybe half the population either has an underactive denim or overactive ens on if you have an underactive denim an actually more do not mean sits around and you actually have more dope mean than others and if you have an overactive ens in it is the opposite we have actually shown that if you now going genitive people with a simple saliva test and figure out do they have this genetic what we call jolly amorphism where just one to mean assist gets changed and the ensign becomes either active or underactive we can we can do the same thing as is scraping them by their capacity those that have the low dope mean will make them et better and those who have sere basely i do not mean will will make them worse superinteresting the we could talk about aroma scripting little bit and ism not encouraging people to run out and take aroma pristine romacripting as you mention is a dopamine agonist relatively short acting yet in for five hours six hours kikes in about it ninety minutes after right as i recall you said i have never taken at mum how do people feel when there on coma scripting i mean when i hear a dopamine agonists hamming their lot of elicit drugs cocaine it methamphetamine that a increase dopamine but then again chocolate the salon food increased dope me but the fanatics the time course and the levels are are different for each o rise things ism opening of course being a currency of motivation and reward not not directly relate any one compound but m i would think that based on the data you just described that and given the fact that there are number of people out there with challenges in working memory attention taskwiching et camera tit there would be a strong interest on the part of the farmer critical companies at least and certainly the general public in things promacripting to increase dopemeang to increase working memory given it is our superpower ye i mean one of the most disappointing things to me in my career has been that farmer some companies have not picked up on this idea that we could improve cognition very specifically improve kind of process with very specific narrow modulators the the discovery that the poleceon of dot mean and not other transmitters in pairs work in memory was made in nineteen seventy nine when i heard a pat comics talk about this as the resident i was just the maze that there could be a single transmitter can change a single behavior i was sing very complicated behavioral mephitis has just seemed impossible to me that there could be such a tightly between us single a single demodulator in single conga process and just open the door for me that this really could be a credibly beneficial there for for any any one with executive function of from ta of function but unfortunately there is never been a farm stockmen that tried to develop a drug for improving cognition to this that is a goodlasiay and they i mean its crazy for several reasons one is that the date are clearly there a too these drugs are already established us not they have to go through safety trials again that that is already be done but mostly because regardless of whether one is a fan of the farmer critical industry or hates it the farmer sun industry and principal can make a tonomoney doing that i would think that they be heavily and sentience to do it i have they am turned a blind eye on this i am not sure i mean when i realize that that i could tastes struts in in healthy individuals that that they were if i gave him and low enough doses they were safe and and i had much experience of m in patience that i felt comfortable doing it i then i start asking farm accompanies o o do on again involved here were can we this should be done i cannot do this by myself we need to have real trials and real studies of how this will help and just was another eyes would always cross and never never got any any for attraction in always went back is sort of disease wat what disease are you am curing what what is the market for it is a aparkinss these things an claimers is these thing an this has been a general problem with neurology it is very disease centric it is always sort of foot and it is always focus on how can we develpatreton for hosiers or tarmac rangryor stroke i suppose to homecoming develop a treatment for working memory is function which is the problem of cross diseases the answer to your earlier questions these drugs are very safe they we give i in such low doses to help the individuals they do not even know they cannot even tell the difference between the place bell and the drug really they do not even know which one there on they are not buzzing thinking no this feels go have join my working memories better they have know did there's even know their working memories better s always we show i that their working memory is betters of it ye r there truly mind to what is going on aroma pristine is but one of the opening agonists can think of a few other keep violin other things that do any of these opening agonists a exert this a impact on working memory or is it those a very by drug because different a downing agonists a to hit different receptor pathways and things that ye know it is not specific the drug i mean that the reason for born pristine is that it is the oldest in this one i was most comfortable with i had to be comfortable with that clinically before it'd give it undergraduates that at ten or girlies there is nothing special but other agonists work similarly there is a there is a drug that is develpapartis which is a company bitter which actually inhibit is this this ends lime that were talking about an that that also willing prove a we will have the same at a function there is been some future a work that nor up an veteran also seems to be helpful with working memory a it is not as a may be not is potent as as the open uric and that that is e point to one to make another another disappointingthing about this whole field with the farm apology of cognition m you my i wrote a paper as a residence just sometimes your tending say can you write this refer paper for us and and i wrote one as a resident o call the farm apology cognition where is looked at all the animal wertureon you do not a giving a demodulators so coming born a do not mean orpedeveran and there where's a lot of at there's a lot of animal letterer for supporting that this would work in omens but was more striking to me was that it was not always just a single a her transmitter there were studies where you would give do not mean and it would not do anything give assoil coming it would not do anything but if he gave a loose of both it would it would be really effactif these these nurses systemstone act an isolation we needs also study sort of how the combinations work and that is where another where the farm swiconays have the inform structure to do these kind of says is very hard to do in a single lav to to do multiple drugs at at at one time you no and then trying look at trying to termite all the different in directions ay be we could talk about a couple of other drugs that are legal or of and have fly approval are known to be safe in the right context that am it seems would fit the bill here a for improving working memory one is well neutron brute pruproprun ruprupae i can ever pronounce that as far as i know it is a a a panefferin our noria an for an agonist you just mention that increasing up and offer may have t a pause impacting working memory and to some extended domain agonist is there any evidence that well neutron can improve working memory yean anything that em loose nor p an afrit can do it the one that we have use a that is most use is gun famine which is actually a blood pressure medications that starting to gain some traction in fact i think there was a study with cop with brain fog for comas showing that improve a symptoms wit that there is actually some trials now that our looking at on famine and i would say anything that booth's nor up an afraid would be would be helpful but then again i do not won tom want to leave out the other transmitters kisser siratone and your increasing are tone and increases o calling goose's other cognac processes and then in a way they can help working memory were we talk about working memory being being this foundation while if if you give vassal coming and find of loose memory while the can indirectly help your exact conjunction a f you give a a drug that improves your focus the tack and indirectly help you no working memory when i am really pushing force is not just single you not can be one draw you no one drug it is gain to be a cocktail and we have the not only figure out what the cocktail is but also figure out who were given it to what is tot link et to the persons own make up of their own your chemistry when we get to a point where we will know we can math outs or everyone do not mean nor up reference are ton levels o then will make real progress and and helping them because right now i sort say with my students what we are doing is to o just cutting open the cull into sort pouring in on to the brain not my but actually doing if but it seems that way we n the precision is not there yet will you it is great that you developed this am cone of task that can be a proxy for dopamine levels the connive task again being how many number letter string somebody can remember basely working memory performance there are a lot of tests out there that claim u they can assess dopamine and serene in a set of calling levels from a blood draw um afraid of the dutch test have never r takin it but a few for minutes ago you said that really leone needs to do positronomission tomography imagine which is fairly labor intensive most people do not of access to one of those it's a clinical tool am there behavior a proxies there is narrow imaging but also to my knowledge i i do not know that there is any blood draw that will say hey you are ceretonean levels or lower your dopenma levels or are moderate yours a t et camera there are lot of companies that market these but are you aware of any clinical or other tools for getting an accurate read of her transmit levels in in a person's brain aside from narrow imaging no and an it is it is even more complicated than t seems because the soberer system is complicated because it is not only just the are from the quarter as we talked about us also the ball ganglia and a not only do we have to measure do not mean just generally levels we have to measure the balance of the do not mean in theory it and the and the preform quarter there is there is a model of do not mean am function and it is relation next it executive function hit has to do with sort of the balance between these two systems that do not mean in the forefront of quarter is promoting portability it is it is keeping information and mind keeping these representations stable where is the do not mean in the ball angle what it is doing is is allowing you to update and refresh the information that your that you are holding in mind this for stability fortis flexibility if you have too much robin from the quarter i candy to a very rigid state where you you do not let anything in and and if you have too much do not mean the stratum and get too flexible than toucan get very intractable there is a sort of balance of do not means it is not just how much do not mean you have in your brain it is it is how much what is the balance of the don't means i do not see a blood less as ever giving us that information but i do see the being a a brain test that that can that can give us this kind of of information of the to or least a proxy for it what i was thinking about when you are talking about asking this question you knot for example if you measure pupillary pupil dilation that is a pretty good proxy for nor for t e noragenertic system it at to given a people wonder what am how to do it where join a am go into too much detail here but at a given brightness in the room what we call luminance a the pupil tends to be smaller when it is bright and larger when it is a you are in a dim room that sort of obvious m but at a given luminance the more alert aroused somebody is am arousal is a general term here am not not talking about a particular kind of arousal than the pupiltens to be more dilated it gets bigger the more a normal front is not is ruin the system if somebody is pupils are really big in bright light a persons got a lot of a pan efferent a adrenalin i in their system are you use this clinically a a when some one comes in an they the big all yet yet ploy in you a there probably on a stimulant yes i mean a lot of aerology does is is try to look for these windows into the brain and i think there are number of windows into the brain that we area to be able to develop that and reflect these nermaitory system that is why have been interested and developing bile markers because really what a narrow bile marker is is is trying to a developed something you can measure easily and simply and cheaply with but gives you information about how the brain is working and that is a bi you now that is a our up an enough from by a marker workman margin capacities at do not mean by a marker and and we are getting better at that but a gan we are not putting enough emphasis on it in my opinion to really sort of help improve brain health have you ever tried bromacriptine very early on but it is it is such a low do that at the dose that the my subjects were getting by i said it does not it is low you do not fell inching and i should say with even with patience am that take it they they rarely get in side a facts sometimes a with these trugs because tears peril do not mean they can get a on nausea going but it is extremely well tolerate you do not get any any anything feeling from it does it change reaction time it does and that is always the question of of how much of is is that which just for speeding up richest or making them faster but for all the work we have done it is it is pretty convincing that it is it is not just how fast you doing it you are doing it better a you might find this entertaining some years ago a i learned that athletes a we are taking aroma pristine a preolympics and in the olympics i think it is a band substance now and the treats that we are taking it do not ask me how i know this but i could tell you off line u and ism not one of these athletes nor was i supplying the bromcriptine we are using it because a that they were sprinters and it turns out the lot of the sprint races are one a by being first out the blocks there are other factors as well but that reaction time hundreds of mill a seconds are the difference between podium in nepotism and aroma pristine was one of the drugs the used it was not on the band substance list i just a remind her that every lyrics you see there are lots of things being use that are not on the band substance less and ism not trying to be disparaging i think there is just a lot of interesting augmenting er modulation for nervous system function bromacriptine was capitalist at that time i think it is on the band list now u there is a lot of a use of farm college now on college campuses and in high school and even in elementary schools and sometimes by parents for their kids to trying improve cone of function most typically the use of overall viveants riddle in and other stimulants which are noratridergicdopemen uric agonies obese with the a disclaimer coat what ever you one to call it that those decisions should always be made with i a trained psychiatrist monitoring things what are your thoughts about form a college for enhancing cogneif function given that the landscape of society is challenging and people want to perform hell they need to be able to focus we got smart phones distracting us and to some extend one could say all it is cheating to use form a college but a cup of coffee is a bit of a norageran magic agonist and due certainly can purse my focus in alias do not during too much of it i yet whole your thoughts a just ye i think it a kind of gets back to we talked about there being an time steal level of of dot mean in your brain i i think if you think about it as just more and more and more is better and that more is better than there is really know and i certainly know the had how much you should be taking this her a is women was running my ladies all the coin and a culture of of wall street in the eighties that we father movies about it and it does not lead to good places right right ism all for optimizing function a beg want oftemise brain health an if you have an under act of ensign that is not that that makes your do not mean levels than ism all for trying to of demise that along with everything else we need optimize in the brain if we could figure out who i yet who is sort of on the lower and an boost them up ism all for that the promise we do not know they are on the high end and some of the battles were actually making themselves worse we know for sore ism these are healthy ten and barely undergraduras that we made them worse on working merry test i i increase my increasing the dot man a just a little amount just tip them over just a little little amount and a and you don't without the knowing than it just it seems it is not well informed your an to be taking the other thing is i i i if we are going to do this we should do it right i think drugs at a all in riddle and they were developed because they helped patience but they wasn't festally developed with knowing how exactly they work an that is how the farm single company work tat as arise to ye i man t to it work that ton ism all for that as a physician but if i had my choice a drugs that boost up multiple sis all the catacomb means the once that push dope me pan opera and normal after an i i would steer away from those because you have no control over how your modulating the system again have sort of talking about a cocktail its it may be a little bit o dope men in a little more more in efferent but if you give take them riddle our all you just gin the same amount is it is kind of if i was to start ta sort of experiment a than i it'd except born i would not use tat a all a riddle as that as the drug that i think wit healthful even though there clinically her of you sol i use things frown pristine quonpacine were they conmodulate a very specific drug and then and then you than the goal is to to demise and and that is what we are trying to do with cognac the the there and everything sleeping better and better interest all these are aiming to itemize not reach some super you man potential right just bring out the best in in people's abilities am and ism ism glad you mention sleep i was say you a sleep is the the better back its the foundation of mental health physical health and performance mean without that farm apology might bring you for an afternoon but you can to pay the piper somehow our friend collie jaywalker obviously is a in beating that drum a while what about drugs modapanil which our thought to be true cognize enhancers as opposed to drugs that just cold of r design to ramp up levels of alertness i many the drugs were discussing do let's hard to know i may i think certain drugs just improve general abilities either they bee how fast you can crocus et or how efficient you camprocus or or narrow the focus of your mention and that just helps all abilities it is it is hard to say i think is his has to be more work in really understanding what specifically ah you not these drugs are doing that is quite iron scripting the the dobenark stories been inturesand because is a very specific a fact or the very specific mechanism i to see that be done with with other her modulators may we could talk a bit about some of the disease conditions that you treat and the roll of working memory in opening in those conditions as well as other transmitter systems you know one subject that we have not talked about on this pard cast a previously but is of tremendous interest to people is dramatic brain injury er concussion even mild concussion and before we were recording day we are time out football but sone to remind people that football is just one instance of an opportunity to get a concussion or dramatic brain entry most dramatic brain injury cushion is not do to football it just gets a lot of the attention but you have got bi seal accidents car accidents playground accidents a maybe could list of a few more but how common is by i in concussion and and maybe could just perhaps i list out some of the other situations where you see a lot of this u that it is a bit more critic that people would not scarily think that shorter that that population gets tube what they do ye i think concussion i is much more prevalent than we we realize and and the numbers have gone up and up not because it is becoming more commodious is becoming more recognize and i think i we we under estimated and trivialize or what a concussion is as is that is just the you as something that is am thou not just you are going to recover from it i mean still the old school thinking by a a lot of all just is that every one gets better within a copleamons just just weighted out and you will get better that is just of the normal time course of concussion but as we have studied it more i we realize that there is a quite a large percentgeof people who a year out there is still suffering problems they still feel they are not mentally clear and they still are sensitive to light and they still feel a little dizzy and n just the symptemyuknos a host of symptoms that just one year later after a concussion where they did not even lose consciousness that something that they may not have even talk to their doctor about is is is is lingering and it is a real this we call us persistent post concussions in german that is the most worrisome to me because it is true that most concussions will recover lucky the brain is incredibly resilient incredibly plastic and it it will heel itself but they are a lot of patients where just it just persists in those of the most worrisome to me because we do not have very good interventions to try and help that and do not think we take these patients very seriously when they are complaining of something that seems very vague and not very specific to most of doctors what do you tell a patient who comes in and it is clearly how to concussion my old for severe concussion you maybe car accident maybe sports injury maybe they were knocked out cold maybe not but there having some headaches an photo be a your sensitive lives feeling not right i have had it a couple these unfortunately and you just feel off you on feel quite right and some of that manifests focus issues this was some years ago i to thin i through it have had scans and i good think think in miss but what do you tell them besides do not get another one ye will first of all i i explain what a concussion is when have found neurology lot of what patience one to know is just that just one understand their problem that walking in expecting a cure it just just a understanding what it is having some one understand what what happened to them is is very helpful and comforting what we mean by concussion and we in the clinical world will use moltramatic branjury eonian honestly with concussion a it it is it baseless is a tearing of axons it is the brain the brain sells have these long fires that communicate with each other and there called axons and when the brain violently move forward and backwards if you are in a car accidents and eve you see belt on and you suddenly hit you go from fifty to zero your head violently goes forward and viably goes backwards and that angular force actually tears and stretches axons in the brains if you had a concussion you have torn some axons an luckily we have billions hug and if you tear a couple o thousand you you will recut you'll recover but you you have torn as on this a real nor logic it is a real r ain injury even if if even if you have an lost ta consciousness and you have only as symptoms for a couple of days but there an is a correlation the longer you have lost consciousness and the long your symptoms last an war axons you you have torn this kind of a direct relationship between the two the the mechanism is is these tornacsen now of nurse of do not communicate with each other and that the the brain different brain readers are not communicating with each other ism and it turns out the most common place for acts on meters and in the front o lops and now we talked about all these things at the front he lies due to workingstraight the rest of the brain while it does not it has some injured pathways and that is why a lot of the symptoms that patients have are these kind of miles executive symptoms this this mental fitness that there describing is this ability just this inability to to to get things get things done they do not lose knowledge of who they they do not for get their name or you do not forget where they live or lose memories from the past or anything that but they just they do not officially get things done as well as they use to and only takes a little bit of a drop right you people think you have to have a big a drop in performance to have i have a real life in pact just one per cent drop and your you having a hard time doing your castor e teaching a lecturer or whatever you might do be one per cent drop sounds a a frighteningly small change have required to to negatively impact life but a poor nights sleep me what kind of drop in prefrunt a cortical function are we looking at om from let us ay i'dnormally get seven or eight hours or sixty eight hours and i openly only get three or four are we talking a significant detriment i i do think i i do think that yet that that that the it is significant this i poor night's sleep and and and we all now we all notice that i mean it is very it is very obvious i mean and you and and it is hard to for of quantify i ism a baseball fan i can quantify it it if you think about it in a picture and how fast they throw a small drop for them f some one is throwing a hundred miles an hour just a small drop turns then you now from really a lee to some one mediocre maybe it is more of at ten per cent dropout but it is still relatively small drop can have a use in fact i think people think that just because your little bit off that is not and that is not a big deal you can you cent of work through it and that is what most talkers a just just just plough through it just just work your way through with you are going to get better and i suppose to saying ye you really have a orangery this is what happened we need to rehabilitate you just we would do if you tor your antercrucialigamen i do not know why tearing your curia light in or your billy's tenant gets more interest then then tearing axons in in your brain it is it is amazing to me that that there is more emphasis on northpetic injuries than than brain injuries ye i do not know why that is either i think the brain is mysterious enough that most people an and many clinicians us count to back away with hands raised but if you are in the feel of neurology our such to asps it than one has officially signed on to trying resolving matters i i for somebody that am has a dramatic brain injury or or low level count concussion excuse me i would part of the a primary advice been to trying get one's sleep as as good as possible be given that sleep reprobation can compound ism dramatic bring injury a induce deficit an working memory and who knows maybe a good portion of the defisisten working memory due to dramatic brain injuring concussion is because of the sleep reprobation that it can call ut it gets it can get circular not only that but one of the most common symptoms that patience my patient with cushion have is is the sleep is interruptive that they the and that is true in parolee it is fascinating almost every neurological disorder my patient complain their sleep and and i start o asking you know not a lot an real to was you how your sleep but i really reeve back from my reds one of the first things my attending would do when we got to the warders that a you sleep last night and t just a cross the bard patience or not fall asleep but they are not stay in asleep and is it is a we still understand why just brain injury does that some almost every concossient patience says ism not sleeping well which then compounds compounds the problem optimize i sleep obviously optimize and nutrition i there is a a question about activity it used to be that i used to recommend hat a concussion you should you should the do not go to work you knots sleep jut just take it easy for while do not exercise keep the blot we blind after on now it sit is it is the idea that you should really get up and moving as best you got you got a do what you can tolerate you do not want to give yourself at you off you don want to give yourself more of a headache a more like sensitivity but as much as you can tolerate is is the the thought these days about sort of promoting recovery and then really getting your brain back working i think lot of my patience they are off from work for a couple weeks and they feel fine and they they think the pretty much normal than the first day o work as a complete disaster bogus until you actually test it in real life you do not know how what kind of trouble is you have i do not recommend going back full seem but i do recommend going back trying to build up these the stills skills again and then i think we i think we need to develop therapies that people will will use things gold madmen training which involves a therapies can pealthinsurance does not pay for this ninety nine per cent of my patience do not get any help by any kind of intervention a unfortunately but now we talk about t acnolegy things am brain cut about brain backs o mike moronic a which i know you've talked about with that he developed a a a a a company call posit science for were developed these brain training games that that can help and prove specific count of functions and they are very easy to do because they are on line and they you not their her science behind them and and you can you can do i that in that way you do not have a therapists in your room but you can on line sort of do these sort of things that are gardening specific me mechanisms tor trying to improve the kind of things that we think are impaired by concussion and i to see more patience gets started on some of those things orderly if you go on the was and just o do brain training you will be overwhelmed with things and you do not know what works one what does not work e i i think the work that moronic and colleagues have done and will provide a long to that i do not have any financial stake in his in his work or products trainings that is but i will say i think mike's work has been a tremendous om and ye is far ahead of the curve twenty years ago everyone is tikeabout narrow plasticity in critical periods they give a no about prize to it to my scientific great grandparents avid hubon't torrensome weasel and they deserve that noble prize but there was a and of a central tenant of narrow science at that time was that critical curio plasticity ends around adolescence or one's early twenties and that is simply not true in moronic really i think one of the people who deserves credit for making it clear that plasticity is on going i takes some focus in and a work to access it in adulthood but that we can all access nor plasticity but it it takes it is there o on they should give merman i an know bell too but that you not not on the committee just lie editorial there the description of specific corny of trainings that can improve working memory in people that have had dramatic bring interior concussion as well as our earlier discussion about the development of front old function and plates a front ta low function makes me wonder is the working memory circuitry and front low function a sit or lose it kind of circuit meaning if somebody you do not got t a high school graduates high school and then gets into a a life style or college in the garters college as well and then gets into a life style where they are not reading very many books there dealing scrolling social media there carrying out their daily tasks with you know apparently a high degree of functionality but they're not really pushing these forebrain circuits do we imagine that some of those forebrain circuits regress a use it or lose it seems to me that a few years back may be ten fifteen years back that was a lot of interest in how to maintain cognac function in fact won he most common questions i would get even as a neuroscientist primarily folks on the visual and not atomic porous system was how do i keep my memory as i age it seems to me that training it up and then continuing to use those circuits as it would be a really good way reading books without forcing oneself to finish the chapter even though distractions jump into ones said things that a for me it is when i go tho him i trying not to bring my phone and if i do all this into one album of music but i will not allow myself to playing my phone i try i mean not interrupting a conversation wit text messaging i mean baby that the landscape ism trying to a draw here is seems the world is designed to to disrupt that the modern world is desire to disrupt working memory in cognition of the front along and we need to do some real training just muscles and atrophy and cardiacpitness atrophies if we are not doing ready a you o resistance in party of vascular training s that is a yet i think that is fair i think of all the systems i that decline with aging not every brain system declines but certainly the frontal executive since some talking about as one that takes more of a decline than others that just how it is with with healthy aging i not surprising it is it is the most complicated system and it is privy the most biologically costly and the more complicated system is in a a take more of a hit that than other systems and certainly i i do not know about regressing but certainly we are not or we may be accelerating this this this a decline that we know exists and but a way i would think about it though is is that not just am trying to prevent the decline but what we talked about before it is no reason not to optimize i no if if everything is couched and i do not want to get to mention do not want to et claimer disease and i do not want to get this in that i think that is not the way we should be looking about we want to look about optimizing health and and brain health and and and getting up to our optimal levels a because otherwise but always playing defense instead of playing playing offense and that is really hard for neurologist we we have a hard time thinking about brained health even though we are the brain specialists we think about brain disease and we are just now as i feels are thinking about prevent get on neurology which s in in thinking about it not just stopping dulcimer disease but a promoting healthy health in a healthy brain radius nrodison talk to patience about or healthy patience about being healthier i love how landed you are about the medical felt and how and i to thing to changing i know something happened in the in the twenty twenty twenty twenty one a ere i that i feel is just my my bias but i feel that the general public star to becoming more aware of the things they might do to support their mental and physical health may be they had more time on their hands but think there is just more forging for information am i love the idea that through simple practises forcing oneself to read a book chapter start to finish without looking at one's phone even if it takes twice as long as one would u redirecting one's focus when focus moves away is way of keeping working memory in cognate function on line may be even strengthening it as you said optimizing it am i think that they are much emphasis now on physical health which i think is great see thanks to mat walker if you really you do not brought that tort in on sleep and now others myself for i really you don't try to amplify the message of the critical rule of sleep but also must people realize they should not me at least walk as you the ten thousand steps thing is not a bad idea getting some part raise up a few times a week or more may be doing some resistance training a few times or week or more and then and not just for athletes but for elderly folks men and women i feel we need the same for cognition torment for a brain function and here just in o structure to that no one can say right now you need to do a three chapters of reading fiction per week or a you get a ready you d learn a few new vocabulary words and the write sentences with them that they do in school but then were just set into the general population and right and must be blew think regress right ye i may i i think the big problem a with brain health is is trying to have a measure of what brain health is and it is entering to me again as a physician thinking about it from an all to standpoint a when you go to your family doctor your priming care physician every year from your yearly physical a they examine every organ in your body except your brain your lungs your hearts your skulls a me skin but what what do they do for you know outside of having a conversation with you and no cone there is not non working memory they don't measure you your brain at all and and it is not their fault the we haven't provide the field as not provided them with a test of of a brain health right and part of the promise we do not have a measurement the brain health i ism involved and it is something all the brain health project which is at route callous which is their goal is a study a control a hundred thousand people in a and they have been developing a brain health insects and a that is a complicated thing to do but i i really believe their aunt to son to because it is not just collision its cognition it is its social it is it is life style likes sleep an and it is it is a well being youth brain a brain health indexes can o cover all of these aspects of they have developed quite a interesting a important index which which can which just try to capture all aspects of brain health and then can be used to track a re you contract your brain health over time with interventions that they they develop we we need something we need the first once we develop a brain health in debts that that then then we have something to to follow and to and to be able to measure if if if we are optimizing your brain a otherwise how do if your you're optimizing your your brain health you out your doctor's not on you you do not know ism all these games you get on in the web do not really tell you ism will not we developed that ah then all of the things that can promote rain health will be measurable and i think it will take off the way physical fitness that perhaps you get enough of it from your work but given what about brain health and approaches to brain health what are some of the things that you do besides sleep exercise nutrition am in terms of am trying to optimize brain function ism indoor make it appoint to read fiction you make it appoint to learn new new skills instrument ins things that again may be your profession in your and your personal life keeps you busy enough that yo do not have to do those things i man for me have a gathering organizing an disseminating the information for the podcast feels that that that the heavy lifting mental work for me but but ism keenly aware of but the fact that were i to read more fiction or ism learn instrument i mean everyone else around me would suffer if i learn an instrument but ism that it will probably benefit me in some real way at what of the things that you do ore and that you ism you think our kind of access points that hopefully people also enjoy ye know i i agree that i i think when you have a i busy careering your doing many different things teaching and research and seeing patients have always felt that i ism maxing out in idol and ism full my executive functions being tested to limit but be can askiyou a professional fathead of the mind ye in a way but then then you realize there that that is that is not you know that is not everything there there is many other aspects a everything emanates from the brain yo start to think about what should i be doing in my my life is is a father and i husband what what what should i be doing yon terms of promoting social interactions with friends and and dow what should i be doing for sleep and health that a sleep and nutrition ism as fin you bring up books i i think you not went proxy twenty years ere i never read any not you many fictional book and said this this cannot be good for my brain and then just consciously started reading i reading am books and reading his an more non fiction books and just listening to books or reading reading a yes the to red e grievers ye while unfortunately when i was undergraduates you of with premed that do not let to take any courses that are interesting i never learned any history or or you k all the books that i never read i start reading my kids english use your books that i never out a chance to intern reading history and ye always felt just like g just increasing not you just knowledge was was not i say r range of stores in formation that is one of it is this cob that that is to to be useful but but again i all of these things that i do believe help brain health we need we need some way to remeasure it i think ism certainly if you feel healthy that's an important thing f you feel your healthy physically are mentally that is that is good that is a good start but if we actually had a way the for of track at the way we can track heart disease and long disease and skin and things that i think that would really post everyone is confidence that this is really making a making a difference on the basis of to day's conversation i am going to read some fiction a i read a lot of non fiction u and i enjoyed i listen to some audio books but i i just it is crazy to me because ism a borrow scientists by training and i understand near plasticity and i do know a bit about fitness and the key roll of remaining active con sister lose it and maybe improve it right kind of that was not intended to rime folks on a behaviors but clearly based on everything you have told us that if we do not exercise these working memory another cat circuits for cognition why should they stick around inland ism beginning a think that social media is entertaining as it is and i learn there and i teach there but that it is not a cohesive plot rights those baby alters that really cool looking dog that i love to own ism think ai can another dog this interesting conference that it is it is random judo random tailor to me of course as that is what their algorithms do but but that is not following a plot character development antagonists protagonists i any of thethelike things that provide connive richness is cone of obvious as i as i ay this but a i feel we are divorced from these things that really help involve culture and involved individuals and and it takes some discipline but of run ore going to the gem you do a few times for shorter amount time with lesson tenses e pretty soon our up to speed and there is another threshold let yo an n be a pro year not got em certainly i can be ananatalate professor i do not think i obviously boosting exact fictions credibly important but i do not think its can happen just what acknowledge i think it is kin and he it needs you an interaction i mean i i believe expect concern should be taught in school as one of the court as as a course all this school magimenthory that talk about could be taught in school wit is what you do with your students for example when you have a graduate students i and they have to learn how to read the literature and design an experiment and carry out the experiment i there is no technology that is gin i just be able to teach him out to do that you have got it intervene sometimes and they stop reading all those papers are an not relevant o k or your your you pilot it this enough get going it is it is that kind of wisdom that that that you get when you get older that that that that allows that has to be i has to be on top of the the the technology that is why i think i we also need needs to be directed whether it is in school or whether it is in a patient i think there still needs to be on coaching us i know that is why life coaches have have been sometpeople really benefited from lifecoaches because so one just it sounds obvious when you tell your kids just right you now just just do it this way break it of into little pieces it seems obvious but to them it is not always obvious and they just need to be told something simple for it to make a pig difference and in school we were we are brought along step by step and though is contact white would not it be the same an adulthood m ism realizing a sprite learn how to play chess seems a good game it chest chest yet any any one ans working memory y got to keepinformation on line her there is a bunch else there i think a but as a tool to improve cognition i was clothing though some people or yet more towards the arts my sister is really great about if she is a therapist an it in sirmisiscobut also i takes theater classes and she said you known improvise i forces you to keep on your toes keep the contact there you are up on your feet it android was not a theater kid i did the crew i did the pulling the curtains and stuff to i when did other things but but but that whole bis is about being you n a learning the novel rule set in the moment improve by definition absolutely i mean anything that requires you to have that where there is a goal and you have got a break it down it a subtotals and you have got o do it simultaneously you got o filthrorgh out distractions and you now for example my my kids got me one of these pies of an for for i christian and outthink it is easy to her makes some meets and throat in the oven and done it is r i o my third time and it still not even round i canoi'll a it one's good an yet you are in a sin wit great for as of the standard is really high attempted to make a reference to the cheese word meets o but i wan to keep the lines a short as possible cause they are already too long may you we could talk a little bit about some other unfortunately common disease states parkinsons and al'shimers let us start with alshimers i think few few things i scare people more than the idea of getting alshimers especially if they have al'shimers in their family first of all what is the lunatic link with al'shimers if one has a parent or grand parent that got allshimers is there unknown increase in in their one's risk for getting lashers it is not that straightforward its other diseases there disease hunting's where it is a very strong long that if you have a apparent you have a very high chance of getting it but there is many factors that ta it is not necessarily case that your your increase series of of getting it there are families where there is something special about the family where just runs in families but a i try a to a not scare my pa patient children into worrying that that there not surely going to get claimers because it is not that straight forward as i understand alsehimers is it the nerves gender of disorder a impact the hippocampus among other structures there is been some debate in recent years as to whether not the whole amyloid hypothesis is real or not there is a push unfortunately false data accusations and that whole thing but my understanding is that if you look at a slice o human brain from an all a patient that died with alshimers i maybe even from alshimesmers that you see places and tangles you see these am subseller structures and build up and that our basic understanding of alshimers that in the taxbookn that most people have heard of a is still correct right yes oke because they think o a couple years ago it was an unfortunately the way social media sometimes can work is that the idea was that it was all wrong r i know all wrong and indeed somebody somebody fudge data they made up demand than that is terrible am but alsheimers is in e nerve gene of disorder includes the hippocampus places and tangles or present in the neurons those are not good for neurons as i understand what is the controversy and and why do not we have a treatment for alsehimers yet i feel almost every other psychiatric disease including parking and there there certain things you can do to at least push the system in the right way whys alseheimers an other dimension tricky ye i man is very frustrating because o the her de generators is it is a many factors that are probing voted in the pathpathology that there is not once i o one single a transmitter then parking disease at a decrease do mean and one transmitter can make a very bi difference am early on an alsehimers that was discovered that there was low assail coming an in the brains and if only approve a treatment for claimer diseases e drug that boos assail coming that is the drulyre is called the napasil there is a few of em there anticolinestris and hitters that boos asilcoling they have been around for twenty years or more and the reality is when you give it to your patience they do not see much of of a difference because it is it is not the primary deposits of the real problem has been trying to find out what is the primary mechanism that is leading to this tithe wide range of cognac behavioral issues and and and there does not seem to be at least one nor transmitter that can make the difference and now the push has been is the one is there something else that we can do can we can we block amyloid we blocks something in the pathology and again it just has not been i successful it it is very freshly because i think it was over price thirty five years ago i saw my first assayers patience and i do not believe i say that much different them now except that we have a lot more things we can do just on the social side of things but unforcenatly for drugs we do not have anything that is been really transform enough u but again that that is i i think part of a in being in ragas it sounds very depressing but i think part of the family what the family is not always looking for cure of course that is they would to have a cure but i think them understanding what is going on what to expect had to handle the behaviors is what they really after at least until we find a cure parkinsons you mentioned is a deficit in dopa energid function do largely to u degeneration of dopa an urgent earns there there is some some effective treatments right el dopa did the this over the counter the stuff that sold that a lot of people take who do not have parkinson ism not suggesting they take it called lacuna purines it is the velvety been ye we heard of it is nine or nine present elder however yet it is in present and some energy drinks and supplements and people go by it ism not suggesting they do that i should tried it boy feel being really dopamine doubt does not to me does not feel that good you have fell con agitated my vision go twinkle it did not feel a high of any kind and then i felt lousy for copleowers after it were off ye i do not think you can really get in enough fedora to get enough into your brain that that happened early apology when it was discovered we could not give our patience enough fell dopa without them feeling bad because it is all i metabolize in the periphery and was not till we got synimet came along which is has i debocxiis the carbolic invert at block sort of the the the break down of doing that we were able to sort to get enough do not mean into the brains ism not sure yet that that is why i think i it is not gan a prey get the level supply enough in in the brain parkinson's patients are given a dopa or aroma pristine or drones that going back to allshimers for a moment i mean what you tell it somebody we has early stage allative as you just say listen trying get good see try and keep people around you stake cognizable engaged try and keep those circuits going through behavioral inducing aroplastisity but werscan a watch the the the steepness of the decline is that red really all we have got the all we have got at much ye is to help them up with everything that comes up on a day to day basis allot the problems the memory problems tend to be something that ta families can help compensate for but it but you do get to a point where you cannot be with someone for twenty four seven it said the real burn out for for caregivers the lot of the behaviors that come up a patients get kind of delusions and agitated and and some of the ah medications that we use for other conditions a our helpful for for treating that but it it is really just a purely symptomatic there and the more socialization that patients get the ten they tend to do better there was a study back at manual back that if he showed patience am family movie or family bums it was a real k i was better than any drug you could give them to for help their behavior there is still those memories or in there and they were making sometime of contact that was was helping them emotionally that you could not turn off with with ta drugs i think the more we do things that the the more will be helpful for them please in it a symptomatically how have seen a number of videos and on social media people with alseimers who a listen to a piece of music or people with parkinsons that here a piece of music and that seems to a resurrect some at least emotion contact appropriate emotional state what he come brings the person to the to the surface again ye agave tragic situation for alsheimers right now it seems if ever there was a call to arms for the neurology community and am baobab and behavior all tax we be for to for for alsheimers for the treatment olshimers absolutely i will never ask a guest to comment on the the the good are bad behaviors of other people except my own but o there is in no bell prize winning negro scientist and i visited him he is it a biggeyscost school a back in two thousand ten and doing the course of our one hour meeting he consume no fewer than four pieces of minaret gum and i said got ask what is this about by the way he is extremely sharp still and he said oh ye ye i used to be a smoker but smoking really bad for because you can get long cans dipping bad for you could you get mouth cancer but nicotine these are his words by the way it is protective against parkinsons and alsheimers and it keeps in my brain sharp you nickered all day long and i thought oke well he is not he is an empty actually and i thought that is interesting and i did not an episode this podcast on nicotine it by the way can raise blood pressure it is certainly smoking baking dipping our sniffing not good bad do not do it but there is some interest in the use of nicotine as a connive and hanger it'd love to know your thoughts on that and it'd love to know your thoughts on his statement about nicotine being a a potential way to stave off parkinsons and alsheimers with the cavyacht that he just cone it through that out there in the says a sort of known for just kind of throwing stuff out there everynassan while i have a feeling who this person men but in any wen what gives yet were i do not know anything about nicotine saving off any nerve of disorder but nicotine was use a and it was used in a number of early claimers studies just because of its effect on cult the colinergi a systems there is some truth to that a the coiners system is is a pimping o dysfunctional an alsimerieasant in booking the colonergic system probably is beneficial i mean patience that would give the aticolonessers in hitters there are some families that say yet he just see sees remembering more and just doing better there there have seen positive things to it a it does not really slow the course of the disease that is the profits the just carries to even the worse symptomatically improving the symptoms it again i think it is going to take both asilcoing and something else i think we do not know should we give dot mean with the with the nicotine or the asecoling sure we nope open i think it is going to be a cocktail which which again farmesuk a companies have not tried a cocktail of narmodulators falsies they have just tried house coming sells a you should be running tie no disrespect to the current people in charge by the way but maybe sham am big believer that there should not be individuals in charge of large organizations there should be panels entered much talk about diversity but they appoint individuals he cannot get it right any time there is when there is only one person by definition sori committee committees anyway another editorial are there any sex differences man female differences in sort of u these dopamine levels working memory injuries concussion things that would direct people toward different routs of treatment given that maybe there is more susceptibility in one case maybe less susceptibility maybe certain or transmitters are more effective in improving symptoms an in men her so women do you see that in the clinic ye that is a great question there was a family job suits of professor at you see sand barber now in the psychology apartment a when she was a raisin my lab study the role of essergan on working memory and dobenergic function an which he brought to my attention at the time and was embarrassing that i did not know was that there is the fronteloves are full of escergand receptors is folly more stay receptors in the fundelovs than any other part of the brain in men and women enteron bosses dome you a higher estergan levels correlates with with increase a do not me a levels and and there was some anecdote evidence that in postmen pail women women who were put on escergan that the working memory improved and there was a a kind of evolving link between estrogen in front the low function and she does is amazing study where she studied healthy a barely undergraduates at two points and time during the mental cycle when estrin was that is lowest and what was highest and she also am senate them for the centime they were talking about the know if they were sort of lower or higher on the dome level and then put them in the scanner measured frontal of function and and showed that there was a clear the frontal of function was modulated by where they were in their estray psyche when they were low estrogen they were low doping and if they were lowest and and low doping to start they were really had decreased frontal function and decrease working memory ability it i fluctuated a based on this interaction between exciton and do not mean suggesting that you are not on don't meaning important but hormone sir clearly important that and they they work a since since energetically you was for developing this this total am we certainly have to bring hormones into the a suasion and learn more about it there just little information about am hormones and cognition yet one of the themes that come out of some the episodes we have done with eddies who specialize in endicren health is that for both men and for women am optimizing estrogen levels is really imported for cognition and vascular function i think people mistakenly here oka testosterone men estrogen women obviously both hormones are present in men and women in fact i think u i know that testosterone levels and women are actually higher than their estrogen levels when you look that when you love am a use the same units of measure it just happens that they still have lower testosterone on average than the typical mail but that men who estrogen levels are too low suffer connive defects an vascular defects of this idea that more testosterone lower estrogen n in men as is the is the ideal right and a it just does not hold right does not hold them and unless you want to be bomb and have a hard attack the just just at just does not hold very interesting do we know estrogens doing there is it its its specifically raising dopamine ah might we soft have to gat to the en attic biology yes sexual interesting as yesactually boosting adopt mean activity it is making more dopamean available ye ye a it is it is really a amazing and and am and to think about it sort of fluctuating am certainly during the mental cycle we can think about how much of fluctuates an in igualwmen over three days but than you can think a cross individuals you can think about how how much it can account for individual difference is not only for knowing your dot men level but i knowing sir restrain an a hsertainlans really an to be important interesting is there any evidence that physical exercise can improve working memory in cognition separate from the known improvements in party of vascular function and blood flow to the brain that occur with exercise as there anything about going for if forty five minute bow of exercise an pic your favoredeexercise and then doing connive work immediately afterward when presumably the capitol means opening a up an veteran an ever an meaner in be circulating at let in the blood at higher levels is a is or as that stuff ever been explore in all the groups around the country that are trying to develop conker therapies they they often use erotic exercise as as as another type of therapy and and that for example the group at universe illinois campaign our craters group as yuan aerobic exercise quite a bit and they can find at just as effect of as cognac therapy proving executive function just straight up now erotic exercise well and do and the hard part in the real world is is had you get you know a seven or eight year old do the kind of a robin said but but now it the know recommend bicycles and now there has been studies with seven year old with just putting him in mostly with overcome bicycles as for f designing we have to think about ways the design exercise that can get aerobics up but it is it is a and noraljust or start i think my feel the starring to realize that there is there is we got a tackle this at all all every way we can and now of hearing you hear more noroltus talk about thirty years ago know know nroliger say you gat exercise more or just now it is er talking about exercise an nutrition and sleep and and you it is all becoming sort of part of our package give organ help our patience but the aropicacises as suit superinteresting and and i think it is going to be you know that that kind of made me think that am what we did not talk about was mindfulness and when we at lot of these studies also if they had mindfulness training to the chard cork go manage been training it is it is better than than just the the executive training alone just learning skills to stop relax refocus kind of gives the sort of boost o to executive function as well i think of mindfulness t sort of ut there is no such thing as traditional meditation i have to be careful here but but they the sort of stereotypical meditation of closing one eyes closing one's eyes excuse me sitting down lying down and and just focussing on one's breath and then redirecting one's focus to may be third e enter the o area between the forehead just redirecting focus redirect i think of meditation of that sort as a focus exercise right it is it is not much a perceptional exercise because thoughts are kind of you do not do in what they are doing om focus exercise and that is half of the problem with not achieving our goals right as we we lose our focus and building into sort of strategies to to main focus a you now to stop and lacks an refocus as is an important strategy an for boosting executive function and that and it does not seem to matter what i know that is alter from flavors of mindfulness a we just happened to use on when we were studying it it does not yet i do not think we know enough about how we should tell er the mindfulness but most forms of awfulness will work of of the type your talking about that's similar what i describe to sambar to what yes next exactly ye it is amazing to me twenty years ago if somebody one to talk about neurosis in mindfulness on a major universe campus let us say stamford or a burglar is poblybl bit callers ideas at that time just given the ye the kind of culture a they would have been laughed out of the room but but there was a lot of skepticism and i feel now mindfulness meditation breath work the idea that ye my goodness breathing can impact your emotional state ye i mean that shouldhave been obvious and now that people are on board that and now of course threes a lot of interests in psychedelics is kind of a new emerging therapy carrying more risk potential risk but it looks its very likely to some of those ware going to make it through the the f t fill there is at some point but the conversation were having now y nor all yes o nor by all just talking about mindfulness nutrition were talking freely about nicotine were not suggesting people do that rumor pristine as i to optimized cognac function of me this conversation would have never happened am seven years ago no it just the field has changed yet nor i here her alas talk about it all the times miso do try mindfulness and if you do does it make your d you feel you perform better that a things for asking no forms of yes the short answer is yes am i there is as a very specific practice that have use since twenty seventeen that is really benefit in me much which is an what i call it non sleep deep least but it is based on a practice called the yoga metro where you just lie down and it is a these are free audio scripts on line we can killings to these and you go through body scan and you do some long avail breathing which emphasizes the part sympathetic c relaxing aspect of the autonomic nervous system i know that om saying for the audience a and it does involve some intentions an things that but it can also just be a self directed relaxation and i emerge from that with much more mental and physical vigor than i did prior and this only takes may be ten minutes there is also a thirty minute scripts i do those and then i do a mindfulness meditation the thing about mindfulness meditation that the biggest impact for me has been the problems of my life a get re a i get a different perspective i start thinking about things in different domains of time this thing that is a problem that have been dealing with for instance i mi starts think in in the course of my lifetime this is you know relatively small not small thing but in relatively small time been and i sort of think about you best course of action given it is real role in my life and what i want et camera i feel its w of orients met in time u that is been a major effect for focus the best tool i knows to you put the phone in another room m not cone of i do not and i know our friend ad change her surgeon chair of nurse or gat you see us a he is big on mindfulness meditation you dit do you meditate now i think that is one other things forever talking about what should we do besides reading fiction i think that that should be on my list lecithin is is as i yet now i gas is just amazing that i that h the patients tell me about it and what we have seen from or our studies a lot of this a again i was saying before is if wee had some measure of a brain help that we could see the impact of it what sort of push us towards our sing proxy doing it more i think another thing that we would in sort of talking about we talk a little about what do not mean as are there other kind of brain states that sort of a predict how you are going to respond to these therapies and and ow if if you are going o benefit from em and and a we have we have done a lot of work what sort of measuring sort of the large scale organization f the brain and bring net works and that sort of very popular i dean in our science to days moving away from for what is this we have taught to lot but what the front to loves do but the front loves are part of these networks in the brain and and a really sort of your the state of your networks is really important factor is well in addition to sort of your your doting your sort of neurmoduyi sort o nor chemical profile yet tell me more about this i mean you actually a prep ted my next question which as can be and it is is my favorite question asked called de us or off taught me to asked this way back when like what you most excited about now was i know the work you have published and and we've and you have done a magnificent job of sharing the details of that and and work of others in a really informative and in some cases actionable way but what what dare you hat you really excited about if if a there we are no financial barriers to your grants at camera you had a thousand people working what what what is the what is the thing that is hitting year opening circuits these day well in the grand scale ism excited that things that we have learned of the last thirty years not just in my later your later any one's lave is actually now being translated actually helping people i mean when people asked me what i do i samineurologists because that is at my for what i feel i am and i feel i got into this business to to the help people an it is it is when you when you work for years and years and years and in a dozen translated it it is can be frustrating but but now ism excited that i it seems that the things we have learned that leas have learned and her science o starrington now translate into some not to something and in nurse science what sort of what is happen last ten years we have thinking of the brain and in a kind of grandeur scale his sort of it is over all organization not focus on just this career that aria ism one it when i talk about the front to loves is being the most important part the the in the a conductor yes i i i am talking about one brain region but it it is a brain region i said that is connected to everywhere and it is because it is connected to everywhere is what is really a the essence of waits it is important a some of the refers on excited most about a sort taking away the names of areas and just thinking about the brain as a as a a big network at alike an airline network or or electrical network and how how different areas communicate with each other and when you think of it that way for example in airline network a you have got all these hubs all over the world all over the country in the united states for example you have got chico is is is a hub and em and there is other hub ma walk or since a natty but they have very different functions in the network as a whole right if if you are trying to get from a new york to san francisco which happened to be many times even though you are not going through chico if chicanes shut down your protean get delayed because so a as is huge impact on the whole system and if m way goes down you down even know it yuliriht over's sorry if anyone's listening for they ell u you are going to go through but but thinking about the brain the brain is the same way the brain has these hubs as well and and you now the forefront a quarters is is a hub chico it is just an important hub that keeps the whole system a ouyougoing and that is why it has much more of an impact when you when you you when you damage or you stressed as suppose to an some other part of the brain and what is exciting in me is not only that make us thinking about disease differently because now or start to think about how is diseases effecting these hubs that the pathology seems to be a and when you look at claimer's disease you look its gets a frenzy and you look t a lot of diseases it is not just that is some microscopic change in some neuron it seems to be effecting hubs in the brain that are affecting the whole network and we have a different target to go after for treatments it what can we do to sort of boost a hub that is been damaged i suppose to thinking about in a in a less specific way and then also as were as we have really start to learn about how the brain as organizing these networks were vouge to learn that measuring a your network structure is very predictive of of of your well being and how you respond to interventions there is a metric called my hilarity which measures a how organize your brain networks are and the brain is made up of different models a different networks and these net works can either be very communicating with each other are not communicating with each other and and the more segregated they are we call that more motility the kind of separate entities their the modular and it turns out we can measure that with that from i we can put so one in o scanner we can do this resting a a from i scanning and then we can measure how modular your brain as rs as my brain and all of us are very different levels of modularity is it more advantageous to have more modularity is supposed to less yet turns out that it seems to be more aviation have more we can prepare separateness of brain ye unction between heirs yet that the networks are sort of more independent that does not mean they do not talk to each other but at at at for base line their more interesting state conic yet if the more their more independent as supposed to a less independent with each other not unlike a her muscular junctions gan development are what we call jolly enervated that is why babies can move their limbs but not with a lot of coordination look at a one your old turn eats pretty for instance hilarious i look at that same kid seven months later there is lot more precision o movement largely due to removal more modularity of conconnections right right interest we we did a study where we took twelve dramatic orangery patience and measure the modularity you get a number you are just get a modular index for each of the twelfths people and then they underwent this gomagemen training and we are able to predict who was can improve on the training that those who had more m started off more modular benefited more from the training and it is turn out that this has been a very bus finding across studies now across different training a different young old patient populations it is also predicted things a whether is some one in a comas more likely to do well or someone whose orders can to have a certain mount of cognac to cline or some ones we respond to bear therapy if their obsessive compulsive of there is something about this brain state that not only can measure but actually is giving us inside in to the interventions that we are doing which again is going to be much more helpful and determining what helps and what does not help if we know awe now i what the state is before we start the intervention interesting and a makes me thinkmany things but to just focus on two of them one is i love this idea that you and others restarting to look at bring network activity as supposed to over emphasizing the roll of say prefrontal quartics or hippocampus understanding more that those are hubs in a larger theme of am of activation because you no fight one wish for science communication its that people would yes learn some terms dooming in front to loaves it is important to now the woman cloture but is understand that if you really want to be able to work with the information in a way that is beneficial you need to thing about verbs not owns right it is about the action sates of these eras and those action states are always a involving multiplarias yet just you cannot to about running as just quadruped in hamstring flection and ex tension and you known contraction is is as a you can you can break it down that way and then's useful to know that but ultimately you are talking about gait and stride and things that that have a real verb action to the and we have not had much of that for the nervous system i at it at a circuit level we ben able to do that for individual none that is the first piece and then am the second piece is that it occurs to me that there is much rich understanding of the different states of sleep you mat walker is just here recording the series on sleep that will release slater this year and mistakes one two three four deep sleep slow wave sleep rap and i movement sleep but we do not even really have a naming am system for waking states we say focus we say tasks switching but those are am just names we made up a just as stage one two three and red sleeper names that we made up but there seems to be a a much richer understanding what rapid eyed movement sleep is good for and what defines in raping movement sleep lead to then there is for instance how a given our network j omen to make this up calling us certain network activation state state a what we we that if you sorry sciences task in a feel of n since now as tasks with with giving us a understanding of the verb states and what these waking states of mind are very mysterious an and for the general public this is important because people wonder is my focus poor or is it is a good is my tasks wishing ability good and we only tend to look at it are they functional enough to do their job and manage their family manage their lives we do not really have metrics but for sleep we have metrics and commercial products can measure that you'll sleep tractor rings wristbands mattress covers that me the sort of thing well yet i think modularity can actually be that metric some metric of of your large scale organization of your of your bring can be that metric we wee there is a number of laughs that have done this of have measured regularity and real time what i was stalking about which just getting a snaps out of this is what your baseline mygilarity is but we can also look at mall i have changes on a second ta second the minute the minute basis and a one of my formeposac eat tat a sotagan she just at a very simple experiment where they were noises there were sounds and the the functional myscanis very loud you you cannot hear very well but every once a while there be sound was just above the the the level of the noise of the the scanner and all you had to do a sort of a you don't press i bone if you hard that sound and you did not pick it up all the time you maybe airy resend he time you heard and sometimes twenty person times you did not hear it well she measured their modularity at a moment ta moment basis and she could predict if they were going to get that if they were into be correct or not in reck and and break the sound before they they got the sound if they were highly modular whom they they they got it if they're brain had got into this kind of you don't diffuse less me state the they missed it and i could definitely see as your talking about wherein we can develop a modularity matrix in real time on a device a this would be game changer and an that sort of what ism meou know what give been interested in do what is excites me is that were not gong to do with a scant obviously you cannot walk around wit a scanner in your head right and and even i do not think you even do with the g i think can we develop a proxy for modularity with some more simple way of doing it can we extract this may be at of heart rate variability or for oxygen a have been have been working a wit a some colleagues the o former student a brain miller and a a nostoc of madam galaxies a west clap who have a company call nor scouting were they are able to a they have were been for doing scanning and also electing physiological data to retry and determine if there is some pot we can measure the modulate in scanner but can we pick that up in the in the physiology did i because they can collect oxygen and heart read variability and an other metrics that bay be kind of a read out of that and then the we would have a brain state which is what you are looking in as you are looking for some reinstate but it is not i think people are thinking were getting we need a helmet or something that we need just something simple right that reads out brainstey just the way we read out other physiological a information from our r watch or or something that will the sleep trackers of various kinds have certainly been able to pull out information about rayon i movement and other stages of sleep in in keen mavericks not every metric not what you would get with person wearing it e g a probe or something a you a set of probes but certainly information that can be used a one thing that has me a little bit perplexed a and a ism almost reluctant to bring it up en omen to do it a is that i did a couple episodes about sylicibon and the use of am scion for the a treatment of depression this is robing carder arris from you see us a and i also just solo episode emphasizing a courses is in recreational use for talking about ring mut for treatment of depression but there is there's a lot of her imaging about am a patience before and after a macerodo suicide in this is not mycrodosing and one of the major take always is a increased resting state inactivity which by virtue of what you just describe might not be ideal for coolant function might be good for a social emotional function and ism certainly do not want to disparage the beautiful work that is being done there but you said that increased modularity predicted improved function especially with connive interventions a scion seems to a induce fairly significant in increases in crossed of talk be in brainpowers yogin other words less modularity u shall we be concerned o it is just it has to do with how we a make these measurements and and connectivity doesn't mean the same you are the different types of connectivity and i to when i think about connectivity we talk about this connected it is of of brain state and verses a brain traits when we are talking about you being highly modular as a trait ah that is very different than what your modularity is indifferent states it it actually turns out you do when you do these highly executive demanding tass you get less mot you gets less molar because you have your networks are communicating is with each other it is important to be o for net works to get less modular when it is a more demanding task but that is very different then then whether what is your what is your base line modularity because it is you got to get from your your where your baseline is to this other state and a lot of it has to do us going from one state to another not not much sore the absolute sort of different says that is was seething i did not know about those results buts interesting that a that it does a fact sir connectivity in that way i think the drugs out a going to be helpful a gan a organ a promote sort of tat works talking to each other as oppose o networks not communicating with each other in your clinic do you ever combine drug therabese cone of training and things transcranial magnetic stimulation do you use simulators yes i think i have a lot of patience that have referred for a for it is approved use which is depressions ism very excited about sort of the the work that is being done with it as a as a for depression but we have not really had any improve o anything that is been for you do not for cognition the her bunch of studies and do small studies where you can give transgraing man convention t frontal quartixon working memory improve but they really have been done in ways item we do not know if it generalizes if it is if it is going to be how the way it is been done in depression in a way that can really be but i but again it is just a matter of doing it i think it will be part of the things we do drugs to yet as and all the other things we have talk about is not just going to be one one thing any any gets back to networks right what this is doing is really changing how now the h interaction a regions is not about for of just increasing o decreasing activity in som mysterious part of the brain is this for restoring the balance of a of of a network we mark i really wont to thank you you you can given us an amazing tour of a freshly five feel idea lot have you as a neurologist but the way ism i slightly reluctant do this but am amanatill you joke tat was told to me a that there these people stranded on an island an due there they are really stock and there running out a resources and due by the ay this joke was told to me by a physician and all a sudden this hot air balloon and comes over and the only going say they tart they write help in the sand and they and due hot air balloon directly over them cam descends almost almost to them and due and then some one in the hot air balloon says ism doing the measurement and it is exactly seventy six feet down to those people and then the hot air balloon takes off and goes away and the people on the beach one of who's o physician in es those were neurologist i tell that j because that was the old school view of neurology that am neurologist were great t describing things talking about the terrible conditions they could observe in great detail but that they a did not do anything about it you on the other hand and ism guessing others in the field but certainly you have proven to day that ye that joke needs to be revise whereby there's one at least one naurologos who castle lying down and and shimmer down and assist them and an pulls a those a stranded a people on on the island up to the a the balloon because a to day you have described the the underlying nature of some of these things working memory deficits trout a brain entry concussion alters parkinsincs again i threw a lot at you and you you responded it would in en throw clear detail but also a number of things that that clearly can assist in these in these in these situations such as from pristine mindfulness exercise and and really as it as an exploration of of what can be done interventions and am for all those reasons and for tolerating this tearing a joke that i just told am i want to say thank you because am have learned to ton and i know the audience has learned to ton and much of what we have learned has us am looking in the directions of a possibility to to alleviate these situations and and as you point out for the already healthy even to optimized brain function and health for all of that thanks for a sliding down the rope to the to the island i say on be half of all the napalms in the for it'll thank you repricing out what we do it is just it is just important to try and get this message a part i i said with patients we just try to have them understand what what it is that they are going through and i think to day patients after really be advocates for themselves and i think the more they learn about all of these possibilities the more they can go back to their their doctors or whoever trying and ask for what about this what about that is you think this would help me because we have to be advocates for or he then and the only my organ i do that is ma people understand what it is the possibilities are thank you is lot lot of fun great ti mental that an now would have you back again thank much i thank you

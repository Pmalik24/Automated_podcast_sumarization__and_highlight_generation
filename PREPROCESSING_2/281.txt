acre it is crazy to be told you cannot do anything about this is coming and when it happens everything will be different how many things in our lives are that what a can or we have stories that people dealing with the inevitable trying to do the best trying to stay themselves through these things that can be confusing and potentially crushing and we are not o me surround to thy with little inevitable things in life with you no traffic and relative you don't an what happens if you never brush your teeth not out we argon to go with a big can go with two inescapable things that are absolutely certain act whatever show is that death a to is bat taxes ten it do things that are unavoidabithacty i think most of us do not know that much about and to day we turn to people who know more than us prepared to be surprised it what they say from be easy chico is this america life om our a glass s they wen a a eat gone death we can only guess it what happens to us after we die but we do not have to guess it what happens react before though most of us remain ignorant until we arrive at that moment ourselves nanny up did found a spot win you could understand all the better here is nest before i tell you where i went let me tell you why i wanted to go four years ago my mother's husband a was dying she was taking care of m it home with help from a hopes and i went to be with her and him for the last ten days of his life he was this tall very funny man with beautiful manners who adored my mother i felt clumsy and helpless all the time in those last days with as with my mam i did notknow what to say to some one who is dying i did not know how to be ism sure that is true for lots of people i remember checking in on as one afternoon and asking him if he needed any thing he looked at me and said i need everything we both laughed that was the closest i ever got to talking with him about what was happening there were people around who did know what to do though the nurses i watched them from my stupor of awkwardness they never brought any false cheer into the room with as which is hard not to do with the dying person they were direct when jack the week and day nurse left the sundae before as died she said to him is it o pay if i kiss your hand and then she said god willing it'll see you next week the nurses knew how to deal with us the rest of the family too one of the nurses jenny got me cleaning out the fridge one morning we did it together for an hour and a half just talking passing the time it was not until later that i realized oh she did that for me to give me something to do it was a strange feeling to know i was that transparent to her for the last hour of ass's life the people in the room were my mother one of ass's sons jenny and me we held ass's hands jenny was standing and she sometimes touched ass's head gently she told him it is all right it is o ka your family is o say every one is all right ass's eyes were open they would been that way all day he was staring up and to the right over our heads he did not see us he moaned every once in a while and we spoke to him when he moaned the four of us watched his breathing slow down and get shallower until he was taking just sips of air when he was very close to the end jenny brought over a glass of water and a little dropper that we would been using to moisten ass's mow and she told us each to take the dropper and give him some water and say our names close to his year the he would know who was giving him each bit of water as a ritual it felt comforting and sad and vaguely religious and ass's son and i were both crying i had know idea how badly we would needed a ritual at that moment until jenny gave us one i had never seen the kind of expert tastes nurses had they knew death they seem to understand it where is i even though i had just to watch some one fade away and die great in front of me all i could think was what just happened but i did not realize how much behold all of this had on me still until i heard a stranger talking a few months ago about how his mother is a nurse who works in a hospice facility seeing people die almost every day and then he went on to say that after his mother had worked there for a few months she forgot the president's name and when she mentioned that to her boss her boss said ye that happens that is normal here your brain is blocking out a lot of what you are seems and some other step is getting block too my first thought was my god of course their experts not robots my second thought was i need to go to this place and talons people this i want to passover pastis man on my best behavior this is patty burghal she is the one who forgot the president's name that was five years ago though she is on top of it now it is brock mama by the way patty's a registered nurse and the place she works is an impatient hospice about thirty minutes north of boson called the caplin family hospice house we are driving there now patty's got a double shift to day i told her my whole back story she knows what am here patty's five eight blond full of energy even thought six say m shes lived in this part of massachusetts her whole life worked at a hospital that is a nurse at her kids school and then when they graduated she was looking for another job and she went to the caplin house i pulled into the parking lot that lot this place is beautiful and then i noticed off to the last there's a sort of he back entrance a garage entrance and there were two general ham cars pulled up they are waiting and ow i just sat the parking lats for to staring at the house and staring at the cars and wondering what could possibly be going out in that build posit can mean a building caplin or home care as had they both mean the same thing the patient is not looking to be cured it is pallia give care for people at the end of their life he caplin house actually is beautiful all the rooms have big windows the lobby and man colminaria have vaulted dealings an skylights nothing is covered in plastic i overheard one family member of a patient say the thing i about this place is there is not a fond plant in here all the flowers a real there is a big kitchen for any patients who can still et patty's speed walks by i need a forgot for room for play for bank this is not just a place for rich people with private insurance lots of patients are on medicare or medicate caplin house is run by a non profit called care dimentionce and the bulk of what they do is home care caplin house has rooms for just twenty patients and is not full to day but patty's busy she rushes between rooms and then slows down as soon as she steps inside one does she look comfortabletia we patty's talking to crystal the daughter of a fifty one year old woman named lorry who came to caplin house a few hours ago she has lung concerts metastasize to her brain lorry's delirious making sounds but not speaking much any more her family's been taking care of her at home they tell patty that lorry always to look good she has a perfect red manicure and pedicure you have been taken one new the hole care she lurks me in a if he wan a chat about anything f ye have any questions about the medications her let us gone on ran know we can step outside any and now we might not have any questions now but they might come out a i the questions do come up crystal comes and finds patty and she does something i remember doing cristell starts out asking about one small specific thing to try and get a handle on what is happening she wants to know what is the tore that is on her mother's faces read under her nose she asks quietly it is hard to hear but she says what is the thing on her nose she smells bleach n e ten or not no is wit we to such a that is just took e get ye this question basically what is that thing on my mother's face that is making her look and smell like she is not my mother that is just the first in a giant unsorted pile of questions about what is happening and why and what my s was to be doing and feeling crystal says some of the family and friends in the room have been saying that no one should touch they not to touch her er you can touch her from there she tells patty in one long crying sentence that people in the room have been telling her mother that it is o cay to let go and one of the time some one said it her mother all the sudden said no and what is that means find she is delirious and should i be saying it is cay for her to let go and some ways i is she would let go she would not suffer any more but i feel heard even thinking that and my mind's gotten close to the end this a few times before and that she is come back and maybe that is what is happening and some people in the room are saying yogis are drugging hero that she will die faster and i do not know about any of this i do not know patty listens to the whole thing and then jumping a lot of people crystal ask these questions we are not drugging her to put her to sleep i would not do this job if that was the case your ma ism sorry to saying is dying nor she has started her dying processes is one everything we're being is part of the dying process e i keeps ernursehe is are i she is i is like for him an a and an just nodi what the things i seeing that makes me think that it is this time this is the time is her heart is beating really really fast and just sort of fluttering you cannot feel of good strong pall out here her legs and our hands are cold her feet it is shelling a tell talk sing that we see call mottling where the feet get and the knees get sort of dapple little purplish marks and it just means her body's can serving all her blood to be around here i would bet my nursing license that your mother it is not going to turn around from this but if her body is meant to turn around i not giving her anything that one allowed to turn ert does that make sense tour i remember standing with my mother and when of ass nurses in the kitchen and having this conversation that this is it conversation there is many stages to a long decline dips and resurgences and good days and it is all the same thing it is all dying but there is a huge difference between dying and the very last part of dying wat patty and the other nurses call actively dying at process that can take hours or even days but it is different from what comes before and being familiar with one does not many recognize the other i talk to patty later and i asked her how she knows when some one is actively dying how does she know it well that she would say i but my nursing license that this is what is happening i do not always feel that way yet you ye it is a weird thing because when i came to work at the caplin house you known i was sister nurse worked is a nurse for while i i followed another nurse jeannette ism for a month and i i was flowed by the whole dying process cause it was nothing that i had learned and i said pianette say to a family she woke them up and said he is dying he is dying right now and the man had been there the patient had been there for a week and i i i did not know what was different i i did not know what she saw that was different and when i asked her to explain it to me and to o teach it to me she is said you will now you just need about a month here and you will now i talked to a palliative care doctor who told me that the most important thing she got better at with experience was looking for openings that allow you to be helpful little windows little moments with hospice part of that is trying to help people take in bit by bit the realness of what is happening some dying people no surprise are not at all get with the fact that there dying and they do not often get a chance to just say i saw a home care nurse talking to a man a former math teacher in his sixties she was talking bout auntie to presence asking him whether he was depressed he thought about it and he said well ism not jump out the window depressed more what the fuck happened son was a courtly man i never heard him swear or even speak harshly in my life but i can tell how frustrated he was sometimes by the sheer logistics of being a dying person the imposition of it sometimes just the question do you want this seemed overwhelming dying is a constant series of judgment calls decisions based on options that are very far from what any one would want and one thing the nurses are experienced at is trying to make the best of those narrow options shall i an it is no bather first of all and christian an i reckon i do it to gather i went love to give you a shower before you had home patty's crouching next to a woman named join who is going home later to day she has long cancer and she is been getting hospital care at home but her pain got worse she came to the caplin house for a we days of round the clock supervision while the doctors adjusted her painmentications people sometimes come in and out of caplin house this they are dying but they still have time left in their lives and the staff tries to get their symptoms under control pain or vomiting or whatever it is they can do more with that time than just be sick this room smells bad it is strong joannes has not been able to shower in a little while she said she has a hard time doing it at home she is tiny in the bed barely looking up talking almost inaudibly but her strength of will is intact she knows the ambulance cannot pick her up and take her home until later but she wants to be home now already and anything is not going home is something she does not want to do even though a couple of hours ago she was glad when patty suggested a shower because it is much easier to do here when two people can get on your side of her and steady her i just feel the such a great opportunity cause it is hard to do at home and there is two of us here why cannot i can sell shall you do that regularly at home or is it hard cause you make to people cause you are telling me o do not feel that safe wit the left side yen an i hew a wo to i er the bar all one's on a back ground a and oh oh ye helps wen your paying a put some lotion can we wash bat want i head into the bathroom and you can her to sit on this in the bath room a what is to that maybe you can tell where patty's going with this it'd seen her taken care of join and others all day people clearly in the midst of some of the worst days of their lives to afraid in pain sick of being sick and it takes serious skills to beagle to nudge somebody in that situation toward a thing that they do not think they want but are very glad when they get it in we take your pants downs if you can get your back did all right is that a comfortable position for yo and you do know what getting pretty close to a shower you sure you do not loo at look at how go ahead w w john's husband marry had been sitting quietly in the room this whole time he degrees that a shower was a god idea but he did not want a pushjoan on it and then he seemed happy while she decided to do it s once she was in both he and join relaxed to bit triton joked around with patty in the shower and marry got up to leave and go home to get the house ready for when join got back they have been married twenty seven years did do want to given a groszy less tor anything tie settle honey do less before you get there la e let you bellboy for a it well make sure to get that there is a note on the medicare web sight about hospital saying hospice is not just for cancer i saw people at caplin house with other conditions and stage dementia contest of hart failure but mostly i saw cancer sad answer at the caplin house i realized i had questions about the physical part of what had happened with him i saw other people who had that extreme cancer thinness i learned the medical term acetic it is from green words that mean bad condition in a few rooms i saw the same swabs these little green sponges on the end of a stick that we used to keep ass's mouth clean and moist the swabs stayed with me because i remember being grateful that they gave us away a small way we could care for as even after he would stop being able to tell us what he wanted that was the hardest time for me at least to hear him groaning and not know what to do or not do we grilled the nurses about what they thought was going on and what we should do and at the caplin house i saw that a significant part of the nurse's jobs is trying to figure out what a person might need when they cannot communicate any more are you having pain does that something hurt patty's back in lorry's room crystal's mother it is nighttime were to the double part of patty's double shift and lorry is moving around a lot in the bed it sounds terrible to say but i felt comforted to see it and to see others at caplin house do it too because it'd seen it with mesa apparently it is common toward the end it is called terminal agitation lorry's family has not slept in twenty four hours because lorry was up all night last night delirious moving sometimes trying to get out of bed even though she is too weak to stand and could easily break a bone if she falls it's exhausting to deal with and hard to watch the problem with agitation as a palliate of care doctor told me is that it is not a diagnoseless it is something you see but the person can be doing it for lots of reasons each of which calls for a different approach they could be constipated anxious in pain some combination a dying person is a baby that way except we know even less about a dying person's brain than we do about a babies some of the guesses we make are base on what we know from companions but a dying brain is not a comatose brain it is different and in terms of what a dying person perceives some one whose non responsive the science of it we know almost nothing the nurse is told me they assume that people can cure us right to the end but no one knows for sore lorry's eyes are open but it is that distant stare as had she is not seeing what is in front of her her mouth is open and she is squirming in the bed she was a sign language interpreter and sometimes she seems to be signing but no one in the room knows what she is saying if anything you want to tell us sima pay is right up close talking to lorry watching her gets it is something i saw the nurses do it as too get right up close in talk to him and watch his face it would even after he seem to have stopped responding because sometimes suddenly he would respond especially to direct questions i having pay you in pain lorry gives a small shake of her head an says no oh good oh ism glad to hear that ye do you have to pea i ism thinking of putting a catheter en to help you peinyei the think it is probably bothering she has not peeled en ye ism going to do that o key patty in christian when of the hospital aids put in a catheter and the bag immediately starts filling up lorry relaxes the whole family relaxes lorry at least there able to give in to their exhaustion lorry's girl friend care finds patty in the hall they cannot to doctor said that she right can't as ice may falls asleep and cesleyp that is a can i do to don't wo ere well to yet know we has a toiyoun she is a tapping i think the that is really helping her to settle down ye i think i the goon yap ti show of it relax is but an again in if i see a major change i will call you is i said it sometimes they just sink away a not apprised yet e you know my other yet you feel useless this is the sister of another nation she came straight from work to be with him and has been here day and night for two days have been talking to her lot i know the strain of this waiting where nothing is happening and your brain keeps footing between the giant existential thing that is going on and the tedious nuts and bolts of just getting through every hour o every moment seems full of meaning and yet not meaning full at all it is the real and it is crazy making how are you doing e loan yen's exhausting amuse it is what of my drains won just washin him last night all he doesn't selling what he does he makes a noise a non to i than to do it with him me not as log just i cannot hold just long tea cap going on my this kin's nothing stop to take a breath me o it is exhausting and he can do it almost only then amok there is nothing else to do but i do not know what i want to do a means not liking i know do not be sorry it is o know he don't just sitting care i just sitting i he cannot do anything ism tie to praying to go at milium time bat i told him i stay with hem and i do not want i mean even if he does not know em here and not i know em here i never knew what any one was going to say at the caplin house listening to family members in rooms and in the halls i got the feeling that the brains were full to the brim with what was happening and asking them any question tipped all their thoughts out in a rush some people told me the whole story of their family members diagnosis and treatment up to five minutes ago i heard one of the doctors say to an eighty four you old woman who was sitting with her dying husband him better than we do toes he look comfortable to you the woman responded by telling the entire story of their relationship starting with we met when i was thirteen the staff has a name for that kind of answer it is called life or view they say it happens a lot and i heard life or views that were a lot darker than that one not every death is the end of a well lived life but all the stories seem to be trying to tackle the same huge question how did we get here bree this one thing but watching somebody die it is a whole other thing patty again not everybody can sit beside a dying person and hold their hand and i i i think sometimes it is too much nobody wants their love once to be alone i get that but you could wait here for days and days and wen you go to take that one showers when the person might die and sometimes a in people have talked to say it is common that the person will die allow well wait though it is almost their waiting for everyone to come and go away is that what you fond we see that over and over and over again hen i first are to working there in this is a bit of jumbo jump at it just seemed i come on now ism repeating the same stuff that i heard people say when i first got there cause have seen it you mean that people die when's when either every one leaves the from for their spouse or their child or whoever been there for a long time they die after that person leaves the room or there coma tost and they the loved once keep saying he is waiting for his brother to get here on sturdy they're coming from florid on sturdy and ism inside rolling my eyes thinking it is tuesday he is going to die on wednesday or thursday it is not going to be here on sturdy on for when his brother arises from florid and then the brother arrives at low again shows up at the caplin house that twelve third and the patient dies at one and they say to me i tell you he just needed billy to come from florid and it is what talking to people about whoever they were visiting at the cabin house always brought up other earlier losses always one woman who was sitting with her mother told me about how her husband had died suddenly eight years earlier making her a widow a age fifty one a woman whose younger sister was dying said she lost both parents before aged thirteen a woman visiting her brother told me about how his daughter had died years ago and only two years old the woman said her brother was angry about his daughter's death that he said to her his sister why could not have been one of your effing daughters you have got two it was a map this death related to that death over there link to this living person here hidden geography shaping all of our lives after it'd been at the caplin house for several days i ran into marry the husband of join the woman patty coaxed in to getting a shower before going home marry was sitting alone in the main commonaria i knew it could not be good that you anna was back soon bet door was a none we the l the do as such a lucia go li o we verse a at i finger pins going in a i was of the way of was on terrier when your someone was s to dealing with us for loving telson wit tat tin that is was of it it is a ism sorry better held us all wit that is life was on on what one of the many ways have been a smug idiot in my life was by disparaging the use of euphemisms for death and dying i thought it was weak who would do that by the time mesa was at the end i had barely been able to utter the words death or dying for several months i felt the thing itself was only manageable if i did not invoke it patty told me that one of her strategies for protecting herself at work is never to imagine herself in the place of the dying person or their family members she tries not to picture her husband or her kids i remember trying and failing at that i think pard of my clumsiness around mesa and my mother was my barely suppressed terror at the thought of my own husband dying i pictured myself when my mother's place all the time every morning before going to her apartment i pulled out a piece of paper and had to read the words on it out loud in order to make it out the door your husband is not dying this is not about you your mother needs you go to her apartment now it was my own little serenity prayer god grant me the wisdom to know the difference between my fear and her reality when i heard a woman at the caplin house say to her husband who was dying of colencancer something we had a really good run until the last few months did not we baby i had to turn away to go look at a lamp in the corner but i think death makes car sessions of us all at one point or another even the prose i was walking with a nurse named him she worked o critical care for two less decades before changing over to hospice we had just left one woman's room and were heading down the hall when him said shaking her head if the on o via to him and every one else said these of the cases it can be hardest defend against the ones where you cannot not picture yourself when you look at them she had another just last week and was one woman i had my age and she had two boys that were my age in the sons ages my sons ages in the boys were very attentive they stay with her and just laid beside her and it was just really i me on the way home no thank o my gnosis trip be me it told the same age as me i remember this is quiet one of the lianas certified nursing assistance shes studying to be a nurse and she remember the first time she had a patient her own age that ism id just tone a thirty nine and i mike on my a i would i say to a my god that is my age bagel that is me that is me that is me some times these see patience the children ages this is jack another nurse we had a sing year old boy that was here and my daughter there was nine years old at the time and i remember climbing in our bed when i went home and i just fell asleep in remand she was mad is on my breath on e stealing recovers and she was mad i remember just waking up and thinking that was the funniest thing in the world that she was mad but i needed to do that when i came how that night i needed to know my in year old o a jack also told me while i was fallowing her round throwing out questions last year had my skinny remote had a victolfe o ma on all i could think was et ism an and of at work but yet ow if ism to be anywhere that is where i wanted to be and when one of our docks doctor warren came to see me in the hospital and i thought this is at ism dying the hospital doctors walked in the door and it does happen a nurse named rosemary who is been there for a long time told me about one of the other long time nurses cattlemen went out on medicalliefe to have her banyans fixed and was signs with a vermin canso and just had a very rough go of it nothing worked every treatment she had reactions to and finally it was time for catholic to come to the catholic house and she was determined that she was not going to come in on a stretcher the other patience because she was a nurse she walked down the hall and greeted everybody on her way down but it was really had for us to to take care of one of our own cause i think we think well we hospice nurses we do get sick and the first night she came in and i had her isolation and i came out to my mudcat it was an a note dear rosemary could i please have a telegram of dilated i ate out of taipan i know you going to think i should have two milligrams but i only want one milligram no hurry take care of the patience first and one face goth and one tow when you get a chance and that was just catholeen death and illness who is her and who is not how we live with this hanging over us these are the conversatience it'd been waiting years to have before i left i got to ask patty what it is to talk with her patience directly w i was never able to do wit the a patience all the time ask ask you his this set am i dying and the first thing i usually do as to say well you might know better than me do you think you are dying and usually if it is a dying person they say yes ism and it'll say i are you nervous re you anxious what are you afraid of and i you know they a am afraid ism going to have pain we will just talk about it and say well have got this this and this to give you if you have pain if you feel a little bit of pain i want you to tell me and we will heat off a little problem rather than a big pray and they will swell afraid it'll feel i will not be ill to breathe than we talk about that about e have the medications it'll give them and all they have to do as tell me their short of breath and they get the medicine they are afraid they will be alone and it'll simple let us talk to your family about that it'll be here it'll be checking on you i asked party if anyone at the end of that list says well ism just afraid of dying i fear death she said yes and she listens if they won talk about it offers to bring in the chaplain or the social worker what else is there that might be the biggest thing that she and the other nurses know that we do not they know the limits of what they can do accept tax is when educes of our shell coming out since federal government can no longer count on cartoon characters to bring in our tax dollars as they once did what is left for them answers in a minute from chico to to radio went or program continues to magical life from or a glass e the can a bream of crisrighes a theme to day's program death and taxes stories about the inevitable stories would people who know about these things shore their inside knowledge with us and act one we heard all about death we have now arrived at at two which is about taxes they must of us thing of taxes as inevitable death but in fact will we all die we do not all pay our taxes according to the most recent statistics the is only successfully collects eighty five per cent of the money that all of us all which is a lot of money they miss three hundred eighty five billion dollars out of two point six trillion they should be collecting in when you think about it what is amazing as how many of us actually do pay they are entire countries which seems most people were cheating grease and we can o you here we pay up most of us because a some combination of a we think we none of a choice though if you brotherly into what you were going that the rs does not have the many people checking on us and b we think it is the right thing to do and per avid castebam has the story about how we got here and about one former is

was unclear how wellie was going to work one pole showed that one third to one half of people were not sure what they presupposed to do and the government face this choice they were basically two options the government could playoff say this is the law you have to pay could scare people or it could try to inspire people to pay their taxes we went with inspire we chose a spokes person who could

most ninety per cent of america polls said their taxes refire after the war that plunged to around sixty present these days some of us are convinced of our duty a recent survey buy the is showed something one in ten people felt it was cadet cheat a little here and there or as much as possible on their taxes this is the tapping world that a drunk discovered when he started working for the is an nineteen any want he just graduated from john j college of criminal justice and he was hoping the landed job at the e my or may be the d a chasing drug traffic's but the way things worked is he just took this general aptitude test and waited to see you call and the colly got was from the iris was it my pig choice no if i was in that recruiting form an they were twenty booths and one was d a and one was era i probably go the tires last a did not really even know the i as hired lawn forcemeat but he took the job they trained him to shoot a gun a taught him special driving pursuit skills they gave him an impressive looking badge that said special agent number four one five eight with the seal of the s treasury on it and he got to work one ball's first cases came from a tip it was tip about a guy ran a farmasey in new jerry some one had told the rs hey you should check the guy out am pretty sure he is cheating on his taxes a with a colleague went to the pharmacy in it was an old fashion tight formal a regular prescription bear farm see that would sell newspapers and got an any the a stationary cords in greeting cords and things of this nature even in retirement a still speaks like a cop things of this nature the suspect the informant anyway allay his partner walk into the pharmacy and the farm assists there and they get the strangest reception believe it or not he looked at my a partner in myself and looked an us in he said you got it with the tires are not you as if he was expecting a visit which of course he might have been some one after all had ratted him out that was why i was looking into the sky and it was probably some of the farmer's knew pretty well at may be an employ sometimes an a ploy brag about in a when the fired you do not turning the basin et center et camera the insider tip it was a powerful thing a looked into the farmer's bank records and pretty quickly found something fishy the guy did not seemed to be depositing any cash all the money came from chat an cretic cars and clearly people had been buying gum and newspapers an greeting cards with cash where was all the cash going we were able to establish that it was another secret bank account where the cash with going where was the secret bank account just a different bank that he typically used i was not that it was not o no it was not off sure it was not not it is around the corner it was a neighboring town and it was a different you no banks than he typically would use was it in his real name it was in his room says a making how simple it is they silly his secret bank account was a bank account his name one tow never and when he got eating cash at the farmers he just deposited there and every claret it is no question i think a lot of times it is not really as complex as you mike that a lot of cases are that he says the fraud is right there once you start looking but you need a reason to start looking in this case it was the tip the gave him that reason tip of course is a nice word for it ratting out is another but this notion that good ideas could come from people telling on each other it is stuck with out a couple years ago when he retired from the i s he set up a business built around this idea that people could help the government do its job collecting taxes by volunteering information and here for once he did not give it a cops beak name tax squeal at come it is not subtle he went straight to squeal those of the to words that best condo what a was trying to sight which is taxes and squeal you got of in tax rat and whet we experiment at plenty with the tax rat bit i suppose tax rat you could a had a rat sit ta quill could have a pig i could be ones the name was taken the is does have a way you can rat or squeal another people but all

fordiarian for ma handing her her raki of course there is a form e after printed out fell it out and actually put it in an envelope and mailed to the is in free now tax squeal not come a says removes the hassle and provides an extra layer of unanimity you just go to weight type in some answers basically who you squealing on where does the person live what did they do and that is it a will file the form for you for free a works out of the back of ha store his wife runs in a new jersey strip mall the store is a little pard to describe one side literally one side of it is devoted to sports memorabilia jerseys photos baseball cards the other side is window treatments replied at goes off a find that goes down and struck your blow at that tots making this i think the only store in america where you can buy baseball cards and window shades and squeal on your neighbor works at a desk in back with his old badge now preserved in a loosest block and some squeals he is printed out when enough of them pile up he mails him to the r s a says the i s despite who you might think it is not all powerful when he worked there the i s had only around three thousand field agents doing criminal investigations they are massively out matched the i s faces this fundamental problem how do you find the cheaters all's answer rat him out it may sound in pleasant but it turns out this is one of the oldest tricks we have got during the civil war we had an income tax on the rich for a while and the government made it that you could see exactly how much every one was paying the idea was that neighbors could rat out the guy new door if he lived on a big estate did not seem to be paying much squealing was the original form of tax enforcement the i s to day has a whistle blower program where they reward people for turning in big fish last year the program paid out fifty three million dollars an awards fir smaller squeals you can pronoun that form fill it out mail it in or there is tax squeal not come the sos et see what is come and recently a reads through some of the stuff he is gotten through his weight the some one squealing on highline gamblers in florid as a retired sheriff rating out a hair salon there is one angry one in all caps and a woman saying her ex husband is claiming the kids is dependents when she is supposed to be axially a says there are a lot of exes ax wives ex friends ax imply ease dot there is on had a dental office installed in the form in oho and would pontoon routinely work on wish and men an night patience on the week ends and off days and those patients pay fully in cash he would then not include those transactions is part of the regular business income he would all trade and border for services and not share those with the staff who was paid on commission a does not check the validity of these allegations is not looking to them at all e just prince them out and mails them in but but if you want to pay just two dollars el does offer one extra service for two box owl mail a little postcard to the person you have squeal on postcard's yellow with big black letters that read you have been squealed on exclamation point on the back is a legal disclaimer saying taxqueal is not a government entity and explaining the tax squeal mission he shows one to me and producer honajoffhe wall we have these nifty little postcards that say you have been squealed on and this will get mailed out it is a little extra scarier yes it is but it gives people another opportunity y to get this information forward an that is a way o really scarce i bad is not pan ma taxies if they have not that is exactly right if you have then it is not an issuing i would scare me even if i had pa my taxes maybe you omebyyouothink anybody who get that is fried out bit even if the completely compliment i i guess you would be frightened i guess you would be find i i do not look at t that way but yo the average person would probably be frighten it is what o you think about that i think if you've done what you should do you do not worry about it if you have not will you have the possibility of cleaning up your act before somebody comes knocking on your door o honestly i was conflicted about all this it felt kind of wrong but i cannot say why maybe said if you turn someone in you worry that bad things are going to happen o one time i was in this little corner grocery stor and i saw this woman shop lifting and i went back and forth about whether i should say something in the end i did but my heart was pounding and as i left i heard the store under confronting her and i just fell awful squealing it does not feel something to be proud of an ow even ow he is got complicated feelings about it i had you feel about squealing if you feel strongly enough about a certain situation i think you should report it it is just simple as that my own personal belief would i do it no you would not use your own website i would be ah no i wouldn't do it i just would not do it because i do not think i just would not do it why it just not my nature to do those kind of thing as it feels wrong to you to turn them in no it is just not i would do it is not wrong o right now it is got to be right it is got to be right to turn the men there turn some wrong it just it really it really depends it depends on the situation i would have to be directly effect before i would do something that i would do it it'd soon reproach the person before i do that the anonymous feature makes it very ah suspect you allowing people to do this thing that you yourself would not do ism giving the ability to do itdoesn' mean i i i those to do it right all's taxqueal business is not going as well as he dog the tax a turns he thought would pay to advertise n the website they did not really materialize and that two dollar you have been squealed on postcard service most people do not do it most people at turns out i all they do not want a squeal sure there

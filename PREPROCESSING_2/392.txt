welcome to the hubermanlapodca science sciencepaceto r in ism drew supermen and or professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is jocko willing joke willing is a retired navy seal and author of numerous important books on leadership and team dynamics and the host of the jocko podcast during his twenty year career with the us navy joke served with seal team three as commander of task unit bruiser in rhomadiirac and elsewhere in the middle least as well as deployments in aria and rope after retiring from the navy joke used his experience and knowledge gleaned from his time in the seal teams as a way to develop tools that anybody can use to develop their leadership skills both for leading themselves and for leading others that took the form of several important books the first of which was published in two thousand fifteen and is entitled extreme ownership how u s navy seals lead and win he is also authored several books for kids about leadership personal development and how to navigate various aspects of life have read both extreme ownership and the way of the warrior kid and i found them to be immensely useful in terms of actionable information and understanding of one self and different kinds of relationships both in and out of the workplace typically guess on the human labpodcast are scientists and or clinicians it was some time ago that i was a guest on the jock podcast and during the course of our conversation on his podcast we quickly realize that many of the science space tools that my laboratory has focussed on and that have used over the years and shared on the huberuman lab podcast had direct overlap and parallel with many of the tools that joke and other members of the seal teams had arrived at independently that is without knowledge of the underlying science and in fact he had many more tools that he had incorporated during his years in the seal teams as well as in business leadership in family and elsewhere in life that i quickly realize it would be an enormously valuable conversation to have him on this podcast in order to share those tools with the general public during to day's episode we discussed numerous tools that jock has taught and used over the years in a number of different contacts including tools for generating more physical energy and for generating more focus and cognitive energy and for navigating sticking points that is how to deal with lack of motivation how to deal with difficult relationships in the work place and elsewhere and perhaps most importantly how to think about and navigate the self in fact we spend quite a bit of time talking about this notion of the self and once self identity and how self identity plays into our ability to engage in actions of specific types consistently over time where it can hold us back how to gain better perspective and how to help others gain better perspective that we can work better with them and them with us we also go deep into the likely scientific mechanisms underlying why the tools that jock teaches and uses are effective in fact something that you will immediately notice is that joke was writing things down and i was writing things down throughout the conversation and that just reflects the fact that he is not just an immensely powerful teacher he is also a practitioner and an avid learner he is always seeking knowledge we kick back and forth our ideas about what likely does and does not underlay different tools in techniques focussing of course mostly on what works in the practical sense in the world what i can assure you is that by the end of to day's episode thanks to joyous immense generosity and curiosity you will come away with a large number of tools and much richer understanding of how to navigate and infants mental health physical health and performance in all aspects of life before you begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desired effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science backtolectorolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that is one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doom slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elements doom slash supermen and now for my discussion would jock willing joke willing welcome thankstravemyman ism superexcited and superhappy to have you here i glad to be here i know that you and i did five and a half hours on my podcast schedule is clear let us go let us go and actually and people w see the jock go drinks a this is not some sort of promotional by me but these are that the energy drinks i drinks o this could be i called the bring your own go podcast am it is the energy drink i drink and no ism not told to promote that or paid to promote that just the one that i drink there go i noun intended i was just saying to our producer a moment ago that rarely do i sit down into a p podcast or somebody that skilled in podcasting lek freemen would be the only person that have had on this podcast imblyve who is also of podcast since you are a podcast r many other things i confess on a little but intimidated well it is a weird thing to actually call a skill because it is something that i just kind of start of down it is something that you just kind of start of doing it something that locks just kind of start of doing and i never practised it i did not sit down before my first podcast and think about how i should deliver things i just kind of did it maybe it is us lock more than skill well you and i i should go back further than that conversation that we had on your podcast think it might have been twenty fourteen twenty fifteen and you were on the him arrest podcast and the time i was living with my girl friend jehad moved from sandbag to the area re living this little tiny apartment and a basemen in skin tried to save up by a place but rent of place that was decent to live in and we both knew a lot of team guys she knew more him guys than i did in sanding a dated a few is to be direct ism great woman dos gas were cool to me mostly and i remember when i saw the photo on the top card for times podcast was it was your face i said do this my from mansion she as note but if you had to draw a navy seal that is what you draw i think for a lot of people you embody there notion of a number of different things some of which you talk about but some of which when you open up a bit and really get specific about work in the military and work in daily life and what it is to be you but really what is to be a human being some important contradictions also returned right oversee discipline as a when that people associate with you it in my view and i think in the view of a lot of people you embody discipline to day i deafly want o talk about routines but also mind sets but also things that you do and ways it you approach things that might ism not contradict but not be obvious to people might i be a cubit counter intuitive and in addition to that you have a lot of different aspects your life in edition o running business is your a family man you have children and married a long time and it is you have a lot of knowledge from different domains of life with your permission it'd to dive into all of them over the next twenty six hours let us dive great ism fascinated by this idea of sense of self i feel all of us can look back to a time early in life when we first had some experience i could be i in art class could be fishing could be sport does not really matter ism what the exact experience was but where we first realize that they're really cool things in the world something i turned us on at the level of excitement or maybe scared us or something that do you have any recollection of such an event may be not the first one but you we remember hearing or seeing something as a young kid and maybe could tell us how young and just thinking you're of that please a lot of times when people ask questions along the this line of when was there a moment right when was there a moment that you realized discipline or when was there a moment you realized leadershipper when was there a moment you realized detachment kind of the questioner when when was there a moment you realized for lack of a better way saying it ism a person rite up mama ism a person with my own thoughts and i can make things happen and for me all this answers are usually fairly graduate there is a little thing that indicates you get a clue and then you move a tea bit further down that road than you get another clue and you move a it bit further down that road andyou get another clue a that is what i would say for me life was you when you are when i was a little kid i was kind of slowly discovering that i was a person i was a human i remember u my mom took me shopping i i was probably about ten years old and i needed to get pants for school and my mom took me shopping and when i went to into the store there was a girl that was i not know what there called in a store a real sales girl she is probably about sixteen and i started chatting her up right and and i kind of recognize it a little bit but i sort of did not to and i just was chain of this girl and i was making a laugh i was happen a good time with the whole thing and you t putting on the pants and spinning around and she was laughing and i remember en we left the store with the pants and my mom was sort of talking to me about the fact that what what were you trying to do to that girl is i was thinking myself well i kind of o that girl she was pretty i why that popped into my head but i just rememperthingin my ben there is the whole world out there and i let us go make it happen y it is a great story cause it i think it really speaks a thing that you mention which is that when we first start to realize we have a sense of self it has something to do with causing effect on the world we can have an impact in some way not on things outside of us outside of our home you lately bin reading a lot of psychology and have been listening to some mere content and i i dust ley want to talk you about a study that you covered i relate to these ism it is a brutal experiment with these kids that either had stutter or did not have stutter i want to get into ta obit later but what we do and how we treat people an how a we received fee back and give e back has a big impact but i think some of that happened just in own relationship to things in the world that the old a vulgarian psychologists ism learning have this idea of two kinds of people they legally thought there were two kinds of people there are generators and projectors and generators are people that are just from a very young age they realize they can impact other people positively negatively and they they wont create things in the world they want to generate stuff and i a while i can ache build stuff and break stuff and blow stuff up maybe but also help things and and then they are these projectors that to just kind of reflect on what they see and they made the really important point i think that it is not the generators are good in projectors are bad the world needs both that they really work in a kind of symbiotic way but your story captures the essence of what it is to be a generator which is that by doing certain things you can have an impact and it feeds back to you and it is likely that they receive something from it as well ye and where this all came to fruition as i as i now piece together as your talking through the stuff look when i join the military you join the military and you get a blank slat no one cares where you came from no one cares what you did you were the captain of the football team cap on the socratine down cares don cares what your grades were no one cares what you got on the essay teas or and do not cares about anything you are a blank slate and then with that blank slate it is hey if you do this thing if you perform this task and you perform it well you'll get recognition you ill get you will hopefully get more control over your own destiny which is the ultimate in compensation for for human beings to have more control over your own destiny is the ultimate compensation you do not you and i were talking before it record you can have all the money in the world but if you do not control what you are doing every day or at least you do not control most of what yore doing is than it is not worth it the recent people trying make money they can have more autonomy in their life and in the military it becomes very clear an it became very clear to me very quickly that if i performed well i actually got a lot more freedom with what i did even in boot camp if you pass an inspection in boot camp you do not have to redo you are locker or you do not have to make your bed again because you did it right the first time and you have an extra fifteen minutes and and for me really that is when i started to realize oh what ism doing right now is not got impact not only what is can happened be in the next hour but in the next two years three years five years and i think that is the biggest miss that we have when we are growing up and i know you had your challenges and tribulations as you were growing up because you didn't realize oh what ism doing right now is gan effect where ism gin to be in the future and it did not happen until you were out a high school when you went to run your college and you i wait a second i can actually put my life together in a positive way when you are fourteen you are thinking haywonomen to do tomorrow that is poetically future operations or gotten on tour heads to more ort and is wears where mi can get the cellar be wish curves in mig in ahead scape wording and where we do not play the do games to night or what girls are gents hang out that was kind of the mind sat it for ye and then at some point you you learned and did i oh the way the the the actions that i take now or either gingko positively impact my future f there can negatively and pack my future and the the the more i focussed on doing things hare not positively i pack my future the better my life became i think that is a very huge lesson to learn that i know i did not figure out for quite some time at the idea o investments in withdrawals understanding that early in life interns of health behaviors and intellectual behaviors and and your point about the militaries are really interesting when i never thought about the military that way that there is is blank slate when you get in there a and before we started we are talking a little bit about the kinds of mindsets and people that the military attracts and a life to elaborate on that again you mention on something interesting this s notion of garrison interesting word in its own right am what kind of people do you thing to military attracts and then within the military you start to see some kind of predictable bifurcations where certain people go down one track and other people go down another have a few friends from the seal teams is as we both know and have heard sometimes about the distinction between officers and enlisted guise this kind of thing but maybe this question of asking is were across the board for all of military and for a really for people listening whether not they are interesting military or not for their own for their own life i the there is an interesting less in this idea who is attracted to the militaries it people who want to in still order on themselves or is it people ant an still order on other people we are both mother's there is a a really good book and i did i ain't up doing about four podcast on this book which is called the psychology of military incompetence when i first saw then a manning title i known when i first saw that title i thought to myself all this is some some academic that is going to look at the military an bash it and but i did a little research in it turned out wit the guy that had written the book i cannot think of his name or now you was a guide that had served in worldward to was wounded an mind the guy had this could er a yo ware talking about and it is really an obvious concept not you think about it and his base the basic premises this the military when you look at it from the outside it is this orderly place it is a place where everything has a place it is a a place where if you have a certain rank on your shoulder you will command respect and people have to listen to that is what it looks it is an attractive place for people that have an authority in mind set for people that want o just hat do not do not do not question what ism saying just shut up andowhat i tell you do there people that love that there is people that want to live that you have worked for them have worked for them we have we have experience that those type of people throughout our l ts that authority minds that that just want to bark orders and have people listen to them and when they when those people are fourteen years old or sixteen years old or eighteen years old they look at the military and they see a uniform and they say people saluting and they see orders being carried out and they think that is where i am going to go and i can get the respect ratite to serve and the military certainly attracts people that and those people that have that highly disciplined and orderly mind set can do well inside the military especially in garrison and i had to wee gan we are to about this early of the word garrison i do not think there is a civilian equivalent to this word but it basically means the non combat situation when you are out on the parade field when you are when you are going through schooling where there is no combat involved when you are marching those kind of things we call that garrison it is in the rear it is not in combat and the people with an authority minds that actually do pretty well in garrison situations why because things are orderly and you can predict what is going to happen and you do get a certain issue of gear and that gears going to be delivered on time and you are going to shoot this number of rounds down at the range and everything is going to go according to plan that is what garrison is and those people join the military their attractive that and theyan't up doing well in peace time now unfortunately for them combat is a lot different nothing goes the way it spoke to go the bullets do not get deliver on time the enemy has a vote on the way things are going to unfold and you went up in combat in being very chaotic situations the type of person that thrives in combat has a more open mind has a more flexible mind is paying more attention to the in put that there receiving a suppose the some one of the authority mindsthat they do not listen anybody else they make up their own mind they bark orders with some one that has a more open mind set they are listening they are they are taking in put they are evolving they are plan and those type of people excel in a combat situation now unfortunately hand's a sort of the stereotype too you take that that dog of war and you put him back into a garrison environment he does not do well right he is not showing up on time from the inspection he doesn't have his he does not get get get his hair cut he does not have his weapon clean the way it'xppose to be clean cause he is got his weapon ready for combat not ready for inspection and and you get this there there are the to different types of people and of course with those two different types people to degrees going one direct another but what you hope for is some one that can play the game on the garrison side and yet when it comes time to going combat they can also open their mind be flexible be creative that is what you really want is you want some one that is very good at solving problems and to do that you need to have a creative open mind to figure how weregngto do with something i think that is a stereo type the stereo type is that everyone in the military is sort of robotic and falling into the hierarchy and we bark orders and people fall orders and that is just not true there is an element of truth to it but is not the whole truth and certainly if you look at it history the people that are that excel and combat are the people that may be have a little bit of a rebellious street people that have that that are just more creative and more open minded some of my friends from the seal teams a will sometimes throw out stereotypes about the different divisions in the military is there any truth to this idea that force types are one way and marines are one way and o navy is one way army's a certain way sort of a general contour personally or is that just kind of inside ball joking around it is a little bit both i mean certainly the marine corps is steeped in tradition and you if you if you make a guess at what a marine went wen if you meet or if you had a had to guess what a marines on to be you you proving me pretty close i mean marines have a incredible programmed to in doctrineate there people into the culture of the minor and the minor has not incredibly strong culture o powerful culture i love the rincrive work with the rancor a ton and they are outstanding as a generality certainly you could make those assumptions about the marine's general ta now was ti mean that everymerineisthe same now absorb not something with the army something with the airborne something with the navy you have got these kin of stereo types that exist for reason a you not is interesting to it is one of my friends named ben militant wrote wrote an incredible book called by water beneath the walls which have given him a huge hostile about because its the worst title of all time but it is it is certainly the best book written about the seal teams history and where the seal teams came from and and it is interesting it something that i had heard from a seal officer that had given a speech years ago it is change command what he said was hey listen you was trying to emphasize why the seal teams were good and one of the things he said was in in the army you talking historically who is hay in the army if you start to lose a battle you can just retreat run away in the navy traditionally we are fighting on board a ship and if that ship if we cannot run away we are fighting if we lose we die seals cannot quit this sort of this little over the top expression but when you take that little bit further when you look at the history of the navy if your you if we were in the navy a hundred and fifty years ago you would have to go on deployment you would take your ship and you would sail somewhere and you wouldn't be able to talk to meany mores you would have to understand what it is you ere trying to accomplish and don't you go out there and make it happen that is decentralized command and that is something that exist in the seal teams without question very decentralized command and that is one of the one the absolute strengths of the sal terms is you have got leaders at every level inside the organization that if they do not know exactly but not told what to do there can a go aka i do not have been told with do comic figured out and that is one of the strengths of the see teams we do not we also we have more doctrine now but when i came in the seal times there was no doctrine was all word of out and the army in the rinkquar if you have to conduct an ambush you can pull out o manual and you can look up how to conduct an ambush platoon ambush ow to conduct and it is all written very clear and a great docunessits the few seven tack eight infantry plane in squat i think it is the is the army doctrine sill nerds in your hippocampus firing and yes it is imbedded and there forever and it is a great manual and you can pull that thing out and you have a place to start from in the seal teams we did not have that at all you would hear from your cloture chief this is how you condoctrine i ambush and he had heard it from his fortune chief who heard it from his fortune chief who heard it from his fortune chief and opportune chief was in we about its getting pass down but you can make adjustments to it and you you can you can alter the plan a little bit because hey the terrane is different or hey the the the night vision we now have there is changes that we can make because there is no doctrine not having any doctrine in many ways is a strength also it can be a weakness because if you have got a new platoon commander that is never done a a an ambush before and he has no idea what is doing is plane chief has been out of lute for a long time and he does now what he is doing there is no way there's no reference there is strengths and weakness is just any characteristic right everybody's characteristic you've got strengthen you have got weaknesses and your weaknesses can be strengththan you strength an be weaknesses but to get back to your original question are there stereo types inside of each of the military branches sure but are there outliers in each of the military branches there are absolutely and that is why you cannot judge a book by its cover for people is saying this who are not in the military maybe have some military lineage in their family or not but who want to understand a but better about how structure and lack of structure can boast support being effective in in life in relationships in daily life in fitness in business in school i thing goes of the big domains in creative endeavors thing told be useful for them to understand a little bit about how you in particular balance discipline structure with dare i say lack of discipline structure wool you can actyyu to say the word freedom rightcause that is what it turns one or made even play you know i bring this up in part because have seen some post that you put up of you you will plainly guitar with friends or music one of them was attribute to so one who i either was killed in combated it passed away you these moments of connection between people sometimes a working together but sometimes are in relaxation and play in these kinds of things i think it as a really important post for people to see that while jock willing kicks back with a guitar not thing to take over stages maybe you are maybe of a plan then in can do you pily be the one but what is the balance for you in terms of structure and lack of structure and ism not an ask for your daily routine we know that you get up early you train but i do have some specific questions i think would be helpful in putting some meat on the the kind of a the notions about you and again this is not a picking to your life but more to to grab what it is to pick into your life the a question i asked you in the lobby as it is one that you know having seen your content for a long time and really benefited from it i was curious you get up early at about for thirty train every morning how long do you train for and is there any global structure to that and of course everyone needs different programs but you is it wait training one day cargo training the next day or you combining the as always an hours it always half an hour i think people would benefit from getting a little bit more understanding of what that looks for you with the of yacht that everyone has different needs levels of you background et camera but ism intensely curious about this and i certain ism not the only one you want talk about wait lifting or rock and roll on the guitar i want to talk about em let us your let us talk about the most structured first party your day and thewless i but the least structure party your day a least of the party you can share with the with the world yet i waking up early and ism going to work out and depending on what is going on that day if i have an early flight i might work out for eight minutes right ism might going and do two thousand meters on the roller get get a sweat going hard as i can and then ism done and cause i got t go catch a flight that could be happening maybe ism supposed to go surfing in the morning i wake up the waves are terrible and now have got nothing to do if it'd planned out to be serving for two or three hours and now ism nock to go surfing stop to go ism to go lift than under go playing the him and do a bunch of stuff i us spend two or three hours an her i love doing that the work out could be anywhere between what i to say eight minutes and three hours and it could be anything i between i i fully enjoy the the physical aspect of working out if i have more time to spend in the him it'll spend it i remember my dad saying at one point if i retired i would not know what to do and i i it'll think myself or you serious right now your if i did not have anything to do it'd spend six hours day in the him it seen four hours doing you ditto i could fill my day i could fill every day with just physical activity things that i just doing but that is wake up early get a swat going and do i lift yes do i do cardie yes do i run yes o a sprint yes do i lift heavy weights yes throw i bring cattlebells was i ah i do everything and and anything and i enjoy all of it and ism not really good any of it they are not ism not really good at any one aspect of physical activity i i there is people that are infinitely better me in every aspect of and am mot to talk about thingies a world classlenon and there is a guiding free down the him that code if more than me there is a guy when i was it filthy too the was a guy who is we five seven and he look kind of hobby and he was older than me and he could run faster than me he could bench more then sis er at there it was e bothersome yet there out there they it they got some engine in the related to something a i do think the genetic differences in terms of peoples resilient and work out but even is grip strength is highly highly subject is genetic influence is maximum grip strength but of course there is a huge range in what people can develop but a guarantee your grip strength is is greater than mine um people at me this all the time who would win n arm wrestling between your local my jocko who an intrigues of jocko uninisalon a technique an arm wrestling i have to imagine there putting their body behind the was there is actors the there is legitimate technique in a wrestling there r for me yet yet there is no if we could bring a female arm wrestling here that knows how arm wrestle because ism n a her arm wrestle either and she would be both of us a because there is a lot there is a lot more technique an arm wrestling than then most people recognize there is all these little games that are going on there is all this little arm position that you get just everything else it is tachniueere's a lot of technique an arm wrestling let's good to know i did not know that about arm wrestling i think we all start off with some genetic predispositions both good and bad for different things and then there is as far as we know there is a huge range base through narial plasticity and muscle adaptation at camera in what we can obtain never on genetic predisposition a serve as a barrier no one knows also what the upper limits of any of these things are and some of the best examples we know from sporting certainly from aced amid our people who knew they were at a disadvantage and just work centimes harder than everybody else because they had an ax to grind with their genetic disadvantage which is really cooled at the face of it it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundation on nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve some delighted that there sponsoring the pod cast there is my sorry taking athletic greens and the reason i still take orthotic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me in the probiatics that i need for got health or god is very important at populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those probiatics unathletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition n i let it greens contains a number of adaptions vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundation a nutritional needs are met and it taste right if you to try both let it greens you can go to a let it greenstone calm slash superman and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up out let tit greens while you are on the road and the car on the plan et camera and they'll give you a year supply of item in d three k too again that is a let it greenstone cam slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the your supply of vote him in d three k to you get you get the training and do track your training and in a detailed way a you keep at track o lifts and i si right down what i do and it'll right down i right down what i do everyday and that way i can go back and say what was i down back than cause i might go through some phase where ism trying to do more polyps or ism trying to dead lift more and ism trying or what t whatever the whatever the thing is it'll go back into goth the board of did lifting after while let us face it if you just want to be a good dead lifter you are not going to be that fast right you are you are gingko be slow on long runs you do not want to go too deep into dead lifting andyou'lt also do not want to be good at long runs that you cannot dead lift go a good a to was i got to go through phases not getting some for a while not getting something else i do log down what ism doing i can look back and say oh can i ism ism notteven close to stronger i use to be me to get back to that ism fastening by the concept of energy thinks when the most interesting aspects an all abiologeol o psychology and all of life and what when i say energy i mean i the distinction between being back on your heels flatfooted and forward center of mass and i get the impression and i think everyone gets the impression you are somebody with a lot of energy and i wonder whether or not you wake up with a lot of energy and you feel you have to burn it off with this physical activity and and work and other demands in your life where do you find that you wake up and your energy is kind of neutral and exercise and physical activity gives you energy as i think this is one of the kea things out there i think that acts as a barrier for people doing more with their body because they maybe they don't want tire themselves out or may they do not feel they have enough energy to begin with it is also feeds into this idea that you know somepeople to have a lot of energy they really physical and other people are not on but u say on most days you wake up feeling you want to burn off energy build energy what is exercise mean to you and the may we talk about some of underlying stuff going on thirds i think both my find and interesting i would say it is both right there is noway acosideran say oh ye every day that alarm clock goes off and ism oh ye let us rock and o o certainly that is not the case it is also certainly not the case at every dow we o god not get now i that say most the time there warm crock goes off and i do not think bunch when my lar cock goes off i i don't i i do not think bunch i do not debate with myself not negotiating i i just thing goes off and ism do in what ism worse to do sort of robotic now this this much i cannot say when you go and work out your can feel better you will get energy from working out you that is that is a guaranty if you go work out in feel better if you go break a swagger can feel better you are going to get more energy from it and look you got a go really really horrid to were now you feel more tired when you are done and even that am you con ta go psycho it'll do that occasionally but i do not do that on a daily basis you will at the end of a day if i wake up lift run sir and then i do you get through the afternoon at the end of that day ism tired and i feel tired abut normal day working out just makes you feel better we definite gives you definite gives me energy i should say cause i guess i mot everybody nowt is i think it is a very important point because one of the things that we are learning from circadian biology in a time of day effects and sunlight all that stuff that we tuck by n our podcast that you have done intuitively right this what we have i rest canter's the last time we had a conversation is that many the things that science is telling us to do an that we emphasis on the podcast this podcast you have been doing ore built into military schedules and one of them as this notion of waking up early and getting physical early in the day and i suppose if we were to just throw one blanket rule on the table to encompass the broadest number of themes it is that once every twenty four hours we each and all get a big increase in this release of the one one carts all whicheverone says o carts all it is terrible is can burn you out a dream all burn out all that stuff but it is a non negotiable peak and you want it to arrive early in the day and viewing sunlight physical activity caffeine and in particular intense exercise all amplify that coatis all peak in fact i think it is the numbers ism seeing is just sunlight viewing gives you a fifty per cent increase an that course all exercise on top of that another fifty to seventy five per cent increase is is huge release in this hormone that everyone thinks it is terrible but actually sets as huge wave in motion for the rest of the day which gives you more energy higher levels of immune function more folk et et camera and does indeed as you mention in your example of your daily life sets a time or that about fourteen to sixteen hours later you are sleepy which just what you want fourteen to sixteen hours later unless of course you are running vampireshifts in the militarily moron shift work but most people are not of course i think the idea that movement and exercise gives us energy i think it is an important idea and it is something that i was frankly i was hoping your answer would be that as opposed to that you wake up every day and you just wanted just attack the world bed's you have much energy getting out of bed because frankly i never feel but i always feel better after i train always and of course there are times when i crash in the early afternoon if i train really really hard but usually that is when i i over calf and ait to an outrageous degree and then i do not nourish after were i over nourish this is the other thing that eating the whole rest in digesting the digest word in there is meant to for it isothere for reason which is that when we eat a really big meal we a usual need to slow down i hate to get into daily schedules at the level nit taking an nutrition is about the most controversial topic on the inner next a but d you nourish after you train and if you do do you do it to the point where you cannot look on mostly full or on for you thin it really nourish yourself or you find that eating slows you down i find that eating slows me down and i would say again the it is weird how some of this stuff is the name's i got in the habit of waking up early and working out is cause if you do it before anyone else is awake than the camp bother you wen you can get stuffed on right you go to seal team and you get there before any else is there no one can say hay can you help us with us hay no one sent you any meals you get you get that time you get it done and and an it is yours right i remember when you were on my on cast an i do not wear som glasses when i run in the morning because i sweat and it fills my sun glasses it is not because i want o let the you we light into my eyes that is not chorus all e right not for the quarters all i did not know that it is cool that i know it now but i just did it because i do not li have t sweat in my some glasses cannot see i just run without am put a out on ut as far as eating i soft to do physically act give things with food my stomach that is just the way it is ye me and i do not want it and what really keeps that in line for me is ism doing you you to an afternoon and if ism eating a big lunch by the time the afternoon rolls round ism kind of i got food in my guy and i just do not that feeling no i do not eat a big meal until ism kind of done with the physical stuff for the day which is usually at night six seven o'clock at night which i guess there some bad things about that i eat too ate well the data say if you are yow this gat we can go down about o who this and then someones on to pull up some little clinical study and the another on the counters that and i think the data mentally say that having a regular meal schedule that allows you to sleep well at night whatever that means for you and that allows you to be active in fast when you need to be active in focus that is the ideal shade i when ism working with clients i a the leaders of consult ti company that is don't from when ism going to work with a client ism not eat because because there can be asked me questions were to be diving into what is happening inside their business there is a lot of stuff going on it is a lot of cognitive work ism not eaten for podcast ism not et before a podcast to performer o going ofpoct bottom not eat cause i do not want have a bunch of food o my stomach i want o you don't you get a certain level of mental clarity when you haven't eaten a bunch of food gone out on missions i never would eat before i go o out on a mission i would eat when i come home you get home four o'clock in the morning three o'clock in the morning from doing operation cool that it'll eat cause in a went ism in a do be brief for fifteen minutes clean weapons and then you would a big meal go to sleep cool yet i do not want to have food in my stomach when have got a perform or execute anything again i think that is just kind of a fluke that i ended up living that but that is window i live the fortunate flue for all of us because because much of what you embody and what you do i think centers round this idea of discipline of course but also energy it is it is it is the intuitive sense i get about why people are drawn to your messaging and what you do and how you do it energy we know of course is colonic energy i think that is what most people default to they go that how many calories are energy and how many calories in that you need calories to fuel things but the energy that you are describing i think it is the one that well it really maps to eastern traditions more directly thou benin anything yenanyen i was get that wrong which is the notion of curl energy and there is a particular cluster of chemicals in us as a fancy name call the catacomb means but that is dopamine a penafferon which is a drentlemane and nor up an effort and then you have got courts all and those for hang out together and basically give us enough energy to run our brain and body for fifty days fifty days the i dead the you have to eat before you train sure for some people that might work better than others but i think what people do not realizes that any time wore you taking in colonic energy it takes curl energy in order to digest that and put it into storage and the way you describe your day of yet i also do not eat before i train a hydrate in cafanye i have been drinking these before i train i have to limit myself to tub cork cause otherwise are ligan already quaking a little it am the second one but have a pretty high caff in tolerance i to train fasted also and then i find it gives me energy but then the moment that i eat a meal that is a little too large all the sudden ism ism out of energy and what is the deal this calories or energy reuse us to have energy in order to think and move and i think i think a lot of the world has this backwards and this is not a push for intermittent fasting or any particular style of eating really i do not care of people are carnivorovin does not matter to me whatever works i happen to be an omnivore but i think it once people understand the energy to do things is curl and yet of course it relies on having like again and all the stuff round but curl energy is what is really about then your schedule and the way you function and the way you describe your scald really makes a hun of sense you described getting up and lifting running surfing enjugitu in the same day on a day that you are hydration correct oh yo nitwit is that is vital and i know in the teams in the seal teams there is a lot discussion about hydration as importanteven though you is i knows must be able eat sand and survive on sunlight and dirt and drink your own body it is hydration could take in seriously right y anal different people need different amount of hydration and i unforsunurs long i always need to bring water water in the field which socked was water's heavy and i have friends one of my friends tony be t f tony you go in the field with a can cope and having and coffee in his can d got three start days aserterate desert rat man you you jissurvive and i would always have to b bring its on a water big i sweat a ton when i work out or when ism doing anything that requires physical physical out put ism it a i sweat atone have tor don't drink a lout of water for sure but not evokes the same now ye i think if most people focus more on hydration and movement they would find they have two ism an a venture guess heres is not a scientific study but to to four times more energy than if they focussed on colonic energy in what to eat yet i think the cool thing about this you are using the term energy and what is cool about this is you or i i create energy right i create energy by i said by going to the by going lifting in the morning by going and doing burp you go to berries you go to a hundred herpes you are creating energy you are going to be tired you no be sweating but you just created energy that is stuff is its tolly turn got there is neuron science to back it up i achalything about devoting some of my lap to this one of the best examples another a familiar territory for you is cold water yin nowadays there is a lot about ice was and cold baths and showers and all that and ways likely to say it listen it is all just a reliable source of inducing a adrenaline release and you get out of a cold shower you have more energy and that energy couldn't have been colonic energy it is a adrenaline and i again ism it is fair to say ism obsessed by the ideas of identity which is low bit how we started off and i want to get back to it and energy i feel identity and energy can account for seventy five per cent of what it is to live a good life if you can master those because then it all seems to fall into bins it is of course you need sleep why we will to restore your neural energy right at some point you just fade out of naval energy if you do not sleep sleep then falls into a particular bin with a particular purpose and then exercise becomes not awaits burn energy but as you set to create energy we have share trying understand why this is if you will indulge me for second on some narrow science i we did not talk by this last time we have nail circuits that control deliberate action we have nail circuits that control deliberate actions that we forget that we are doing walking and then we have marry circuits which are called central pattern generators and these are the funeral circuits that love to just work on their own and in the background just can a hum in the background and take care of all the stuff heart beat breathing and movement that is repetitive if you you are just marching and you do not have to a just your cases much or me your hiking even and step in this rock that rock once central pattern generators get going it is very automatic and we know that once central pattern generators get going there is the release of those catacomb means those three or four molecules that then feed all the other natural systems the collnremodulayers for reason cause they set the gain higher send you go out for a run or a jog or a hike or something and where you peddle or you row and then you are whole system is is at a higher a p m when you say create energy your sciences are stringers shim what that is repetitive movement that allows you to forget the motor commands that a required to generate that moment you might think about your road stroke or something that but you can do it without thinking much you come off of that and you now a set at a higher a p m to do more deliberate stuff and none of this again involved eating enough probhydrates are making sure you ha enough ketones ore enough protein like its you got plenty of that stuff provide you nourish at some point every twenty for hours or we want i think we know the obit about the science behind jocko willing schedule now but i will ask this are there certain forms of exercise weight lifting verses cardie that you find give you an especially big boost in what were calling energy an here this could be cognate of energy could be physical in to put a a readiness for the next thing at first i got a back you up on this it of backing up you are you are you are science you haver giver rock march put on a heavy weight and yet off you thereof sorry interrupt yea peterotea got me into this he got into doing a long sundae instead of a long sundae run throwing on a light weight less or a ruck and going off three hours and the first twenty minutes i find always want to go faster and get it over with but then have learned that the real pain in it sets in around an hour and then the beauty sets in around ninety minutes red i could do this all day all night and i never won to stop see that is when you were describing how this chemical these chemicals get released and once you are in that automatic mode cause in the seal teams you are doing maritime operations for a month and you are going to do some it kill house shooting and you are not caring to munch weight and e you go out to the desert and now you are cutin on eighty pounds and you are going on day on you get out they're going eighty pound rock march and the first free and seventeen minutes the first twenty three minutes just suck they just suck and what was beautiful as by the time i was twenty three twenty four years old about a is going o sock for seventeen minutes and minutes or can to be man to be a owe to and it does not matter any one i can just keep going for ever its it's sounds what you are saying is what i experience my basically my whole do not life there is going to be a little braking period mentally where you think of this totally socks and then you just can keep going for a really really long time and it is not that big of a deal to your question of is there any form of exercise that gives me that energybook i i would have to say the the high intensity sort of anna robin blast whether it is on the biker on the row or or your swing to cattle bell hard something that that last ten fifteen minutes that is a really good way to you'd peak my mentality for the day do you do the cold water thing and you discern to lot of in buds amid you you force yourself into cold water living myvei've a cold bath on my house and i get in everyday halloing yo spending in the usually around five minutes five minutes before you train we are after join after the some i have not played with yet and you me ism ism such a i i do not to make a bunch of effort for something for me going downstairs get into ice tub and i guess you only need to do it before you work out y only go minute right do minutes a three job and have been taxing back i forth about this there is a lab at stamford crag seller's lab that works on cold in performance and the athletes that stamford mainly the the cross country team in the football players are doing cold before their training because of the huge increase huge long lasting increase in dopamine and a adrenalin that because by that they are finding it increases performance mainly by waking people up again the to it creates energy is and students you never on things o athletes are all supermotiv ate this is no pick again stamford athletes in particular a lot of athletes are excellent to what they do because they are very lazy when they are not training this is true not all athletes but a lot of athletes a and the really good at resting and recovering they can train more but a lot of athletes have a hard time getting in to into gear to to train every day and the cold is a great stimulus right it is a force it is a foreshow of the espresso constimulus without all the jitters i think maybe going there for a minute would be cool before work out i we will say this i had i had a long work out and it was a sturdy which means on sturdy i do to is through kind of in the morning round ten o'clock and i have a long work out went for a long run it was hot and i just got in the ice bath and a sat there for seven minutes the deep chill i got out then i went right to deduce to my felt awful i felt absolute awful i cold and it to me n extra three rounds to get warmed up again that kindly left a bad taste in my mouth for tree work icing but i wan t try that short of talk in another front of my o no only go a minute before my to of that a to if it is really cold a thirty seconds to a minutes going to get you the this big release in a dental and and and dopamine actually one time i did try to know the yum the the chamber that blast cold iron you the crib the other cry when i did that for for a minute or whenever and that did make me feel three work out pretty good yet i think that the the whole notion of cold for metabolism mean people say well it is not that they give an increasing metabolic as far as ism concerned the main function of the cold for most people is going to be the discipline of doing it the sense of resilience that you can build up over time just being familiar with having in the adrenalin in your system and then the fact that the dreaming increases are huge and long lasting an they two point five as increases at there is a college and at stamford on olempcy runs our dual diagnosis a diction client should a patient getting off coca edition who decide to use cold ice baths as a way to account of assist himself along the way it was not get dopamine from cleaning more you worldwide to get it from the ice bath the difference is is coming as you the sharp e increases and the decreases the drop you way below base line what if people do they go seek more cocaine it is really pernicious that way whereas the ice bath and and cold showers will give this long a casting two to three hours or more and that is really something to treasure the idea the you can easily save on your heating bill give yourself this huge dope mean increase and i think everything points the fact that it is healthy and good but i mean obviously it is working for you to do after your training i think all the the gimerats who want more hypertrophy your trying to get an extrados know eighth of an inch on their tryster whatever they freak out cause they hear that it can inhibit hypertrophy and then for whatever reason there is this at sort i doing it wrong well i mean get clearly your you are doing no you are not i your i do not thing your hypertrophy is suffering i actually am of the mind that if your training really hard sure getting in the cold afterwards might blunt some hypertrophy that is what the data tell us any galloping kind the expert on that literature but frankly i do not know any one that trains really hard with the weights and they gets into the cold that looks their suffering from hypertrophy i know a lot of people however who love to point fingers at and pocket cold exposure this seems to be a big thing on social m e of people do not the cold love to point out the studies showing that the cold screws up everything and most of them look they need a few sets in the him a to me and o feel coma point them cause i feeling all of these are just tools right and i in any case i ism a big fan of deliberate cold exposure mostly for the neural effects again ism obsessing over this concept of energy and it something that i i cannot help but ask is that it is the cognitive side of this in the kind of the the effects of winning and land you obviously have a lot of deployments u and a lot of wins whatever in the contacts that men it kill the target capture the capture the hostage camera and then as is the case with war there been some cases of losses right you have lost people maybe there were targets that were not accomplished right this kind of thing you have posted about these and these are always things that are hard to see but i think it is really important that you post about people that you have lost right because first of all these people serve but second of all that things do not always work out the way that were want end sometimes to really catastrophic consequences there is a theory and biology that when we win we somehow get more energy to win more through the release of no surprise dopamine and some related molecules in in fact testosterone in both men and women is another close cousin of the dopamine system ash released from the same general or the the patterns of release are from the same general areas in the brain believe it are not and body but when we win we feel we can keep going ireyou look at the team that wins in's they will play another game the superable winners are you imagine there jumping up and down and they could prod play another superbly losing we know can sure can drop things testosterone and dopa mean for some period of time but when you were in the teams what was your observation about how winning and losing would impact people in the short and long term in other words would you observe people that had a quick reset button and could you say that was terrible and then transmute i guess ism getting into the at the the eastern language not convert that into energy to go do better the next time rest we also see people military and in the civilian world that a loss in particular severe losses ghastly set them down the path of less energy certainly is in less calories in that most of time is the other way they start consuming more calloriesan that does not get them going again this notion of energy and om asking windsverses losses what did you observe and from the perspective of leadership and may be more importantly from the prospective yourself how do you work with that how do you calibrate winds and losses how do you transmit losses into energy these winds we know convert to energy but losses oftentimes can sap our energy way way down i think to start with i think that the selection process to get into the seal teams is going to weed out a bunch of people that cannot recover very quickly from something bat you probably heard these type of stories before the kid that was the star of the football team the star of the basketball team the captain of this the captain of that he is been winning his whole life he goes to buds and he quits because in buds you are you are you are not going to win you are certainly nokingto win everything they are going to find what you are not good at and they are going to exploit that and you are going to lose this what happens a lot of guys that may lose and it disrupt they are they are mote of action they are probably just going to quit and that is why you get this massive patrician ray with guys that are studs i mean were talking a division one athletes division one attic division one restless division one footballplayers division one runners and swimmers they all come to buds they all quit not all to quit but they are's plenty of examples of the highest level of collegian ah we in sports that translate very well to what you are doing in in basic seal training and they quit and sometimes it is because they do not know how to lose thy do not n how to recover from a loss and they are they are just i think already and once you get to a seal team you have got people that are generally speaking going to be pretty resilient when it comes to dealing with a loss now o that i am use get use you talk about losing people you are friends with this go you meet this guy and seal training hay the guy seems a stud o he just going to quit and and you are gong to lose five six seven people eight people people quit fashion keep track of em years gan a lose yore's going to get used to it there is that now once you are in the teams and what you are talking about us now you start taking much more significant lost i those narration lose of one your friends and there is what from a leadership perspective you have to you have to pay attention to when you are it a leader in any organization you are basically in charge of the mob when it comes to what their moral is they are they are a mob and they feed off each other just a mob writing in the streets can all we can break this whendllis break all the windows and thither move this mob mentality and that happens with moral inside of a team and you as a leader cannot get caught up with the mob you cannot let that happen you have to detach yourself from the mob mentally that you do not get caught up in their emotions and they moral because if you get caught up in their emotions an you g caught up in first their moral you cannot correct it we go out on a mission the mission goes great we get do a gun flight kill a coup of bad gives every one's o say hive fives every one's feeling great you come back to base hey we do not need o see brief that was perfect hey we do not need to meter gear a maintain we can just go to bed what we are also that is when the leader has to say oh we have got the mob and the mob is becoming slightly arrogant hedges we'll quick that was a good of but there some things we could not prove but you got a bring that mob back and bring them back to centering same thing in the other direction you got or n operation it does not go were you got an operation you take casualties now you come back to base you see guys moping around you see that the spirit starting to break and same thing if you if you are part of that mob you will be you will be with them your moral will be breaking your spirit we breaking you ever look n oh i see what is happening hedges listen up that was tough did not go the way we wanted it to go we need to learn some lessons here some things i can do better what can we do better to make sure that that never happens again what can we do to make sure we have the opportune to go out and avenge our brother on the battlefield what can we do to move this thing for it as a leader went comes to winning and losing you are generally going to be the person countering what the mob mentality is cause when the mob starts winning they want to keep winning and they might get arrogant when the mob is losing they might start to lose more because there attitude goes down the drain that is we have to pay attention to from a leadership respective for for me personally i think i know what i did when when i lost guises was focus on are i we need we need to celebrate the life we needn't move the morn pul loss and then we need to go to work we need to get er gear back on wed to lock an honor weapons we need to get back out there i know that that is what we needed do young often the best way to contend with with problems with issues with adversity is action is by taking action the more you sit and the more you wait and the more time you spend with that adversity with the upper hand inside your head the the worse it is going to get for me always taking action making something happen it does not have to be huge it does not have to be some mammoth of triumph that you are going to go and go in pursue but if you say heyliss'n this what happen did not go the way yo wanted it too weren't get er get back on were to go back out we are to were to going to do this other mission and that is that is what i think i think taking action and it is in in your personal life too something does not go the way you wanted it to go you did not get tho job you wanted you it get the higher you n get the promotion you can go home and sit there in and and dwell on it that is not get you in progress or you say of gat what me do quick analysis why did not get that promotion oh it is cause i did not get this qualification or i hadn't jump through this gait look e what do notion let commit let me look in t how to how o i get to jumpthrough that gate next time i will get to promotion outstare taking action action for me is a cure for a lot of proms that we haven life love this because the image that is surmising my mind ism it'll share it with you and tell me where it agrees with in may be violet us what your when you tell me but what i wet's imagining in when your time at leadership in the mob is a bunch of candles but not wax candles these are oil candles you thing about a winds he you i count be an of go out in wen it count be a team it con be an individual taking in examine the get in a play it it does not matter but there the riding hive in those winds we know crank up those catacolamens and it is as if the intensity that flame starts going up as a consequence that is natural but the oil in the candle is continuing to burn down you need to celebrate winds but you are burning that oil and we're really talking about here is how to moderate and then reclaim energy and i was imagine you is the leader who is a cages great but listen you are burning that oil right that oil is what you got you the win let us not just clamp it we can no do if yo if you this bombs may be celebrate in some other ways but then let us great let us take the energy we got and put it to the next thing rather than just go crazy drug's of abuse in particular drugs that tapping the opening system namely cocaine and examine and just cause there is no way to avoid this it we are being true to the biology the the energy the dopamine system was design for foraging for all sorts of things food people that overindulge food or seek out food says people that overindulge in these things they y those things and again this sort leans to eastern philosophy a bit but there is western or science or conscience with you to say to support it you start to deplete these opening systems the base line starts to drop and am imagining that the leader you in this case is saying listen let us ton it down use the energy that we have gained and put it to good use rather than just burn it up an joying it and then of course went after a loss when the is i sort think of the candles going dimmer and the but the oil reserve is still there an i'sak how do you start to tap back into the oil reserve well you have to have shy ramp the candle up again you cannot just sit there waiting for the the a the intensity the flame to come back yours shoes have to do something in order for that to happen maybe this is not the best analogy cause it lack sort of the exactly what is that the person turning the intensity up and down on these candles but that is what comes to mine and in eastern traditions there is this idea a thee of energy energy to fight energy to seek mates energy to seek food energy for sacs energy to for all of it is the same energy and i actually believe that the energy that there referring to are these catacolomens i really do now there are other energy systems too relating to child wearing perabond in ox those and all the kind of fuzzy warm stuff that is superimportant and when we would novelist as a species the way we do if if we did not honor that energy system also and that energy system that we normally think of as love as supposed to forward center of mass energizes with this system nightly when you are r working with in training with and a people that you love this could be your your brothers your systems whatever your family there is i think there is an amplifying effect on this whole thing right if is just for more dopa men just for more money just for more winds just for more trophies it'll never forget this is inside when i was a kid i had this weird experience where tony hawked dad rescued me from a scapeward contest in wind of vista the lives to boys up everyone else left i was left there alone i was fourteen cause my home life to that time et camera and he was where you an o lawman take the bust o canaster i know this guyninas non o you are come into our house erase we took me a pony's house and i went into pony's room that he would grown up in tony lived in fabric at that time and the room was not filled with trophies the room was trophies and i remember just thinking wholly catlike and when i think about that and i think about what a healthy person tony turned out to be to happened the bless to knowing lie bit it is amazing cause a lot of people that had those trophies whatever domain of life they converted all that into was just burn the oil down in their candle he is a guy who is still going in his fifties right admit that is a little side story but i think this notion of energy to me is important because as you said when we move toward action and we complete something the oiling that candle starts to get replenished and the flame burns hotter what you are talking about and ism very interested a this now and i don't now if there is there is already been measured or not but what essential were talking about it is a confidence love right if i go out and win i feel good about and it et let us am dona jugisyturniment and the first match i wat then i submit the guyana thirty's taken down emit him en thirty seconds ism feeling good ism feeling confident right what is that mean my dopamean is up cause i got that victim my tastosteroms up cause i got that victory my confidence is up cause i got that victory same thing other direction if i go out first match and i lose to somebody mi dopamine goes down that chemical thing goes down my confidence goes down and what what i have to do as i have to learn how to maintain a level of confidence because if i get over i win that first match win the second i some one on to kill this new sky and i go out on sloppy and i do not care that is when i get caught if i get told if i lack confidence i go up thin there is nothing we'll do to beat this god is going o be horrible of course ism going to get smashed it is it is a similar thing that were talking hat i just wonder how much if you start measuring cause if they say hay if you win your tastostram goes upright and then if you win more your testaostrom goes up on your dope me goes phi your confidence is going up but you can get to a point where your confidence is too high and now you are getting sloppy and i y do not care and it your you mention cocaine you you see videos of people that are all coked up and t i can just they they they can do everything all pullover confident right they are over they think they can kick your rascal i that that is too much dopa men too much e go too much confidence the other side f the spectrum is some one that is on some kind of downer drug and they do not feel they can do anything they are lethargic their confidence is low and they are just depressed there is an interesting thin between dopa men e go confidence and probably testosterone that you get from winning and from losing and once again as a leader from a leadership perspective you cannot get wrapped up in that you cannot you cannot get wrapped up in that you have to detach from t you have to real to take a step back and then if you are good even as a competitor you will say oh have that last match was easy but i need to prepare for the next match i cannot bring over confidence look i don't want a lack to confidence it is a balance right it is that it is that flame on the oil burning lamp that you are talking about that you want that steady flame you do not want too much going to burn out control you don't want too little the formal go out yet rallier we talked about this notion that the some these older vulgarian psychologists had which the not of generators viruses projectors and their idea as that people divide into these different categories in the world needs both it is not a that one is better than the other but the world absolutely needs both and there is is idea now these on some narrow science and some other psychology that have been lathing in to which is that generators know how to happen to this system and they love this system i think that is your story about being taken a shop for dance than it turns out to be a trip to shop for it a number of different experiences for you right a really telling experience i having it having an action effect on the world and something something back to you that still sits with you inside in fact there is a do not a mean circuit they are still related to this young women or then young woman at that time some people are generators and i think that they are more tune to this dopamean system and as were having this conversation ism guessing that about the estimate is that somewhere between fifty and sixty five per cent of people are going yet i get it more workouts gingko give more energy i need to do more of that i need to when ism back on my heels i need to think about the things i can complete et camera and then the other forty five per cent or thirty five per cent might be saying how really get it now the ideas that the projectors can happen to the same circuits everyone has these catecolamean circuits dopamine et camera but that they tend to be more of observers in the world and they being partnered within symbiotic with these people now this starts to take on kind of stern typical masculine feminine things but this exists on both sides it really does there might be some biases right by biological sects there may not be right we could argue that it is pony an argument he'll get us into more trouble than to answers it does normally matter the point is that some people are perfectly happy to be in the company of people winning because they feel good to see other people winning they to be a support staff that is what makes them feel good other people would rather stick hot forks in their eyes then not be the person engaged in the activity may's not every activity but the activity which time it h generators in the projectors i think that in the context of moderating these systems it is key i mean it is key to have a long arch in a career path military science or otherwise i think it is key an every domain of life and i think for me one thing that have learned both the hardly and have also benefit from the plosive experience of i think in relationships that con be romantic relationships but also friendships and in family there because there are generators and projectors almost always in those kind of symbiotic relation cut a yow romantic couple or a family that some kids are more generator some or more projectors just by by something who knows maybe is hard wired may be not as the leader of your family men ass one of the two leaders but as a leader in your family in i can make any assumptions here as the leader your family and also as a father in particular how do you apply these same sorts of ideas when your kid is gone of down because shard to be of fourteen year old or because it was a bad day or when they are up right i think the upstate are as interesting as the down states yes got the degree got the wind how much do you let them celebrate before you haylisten you just got yourself another couple silly leaders of oil in your candle we can do with that you can burn it ere young a save it for the next things you can climb the staircase well clearly it is a very similar thing to what i just talked about if your kid is doing well and and wins the resting tournament and is i want the resting tournament and what they want to do they want to eat if triple cheese pets henry they were to go crazy and you as a leader and as a and as a parent and as a friend need to say man i mean you did good that was gossip yet a great day but let us short think a little bit about next week to how but we just have a few slices to pets at right as a reward this is this the same in any situation that you could be in interacting with other human beings you want to be the perse in that kind of modulates the the confidence in the ego or the way you put it the dopa mean and and the celebratory activities no matter who you are and and this goes with yourself as well you you do something you have a success and you say a that that that is great a but all glory is fleeting and i need to get back to work and you look and do people go too far without sometimes yes absolutely sometimes people they they do not stop and celebrate it all and those the kind of people i think they get burned out eventually because they never say hey that was blossom we had a big went cool high five they do not even say that i think you do not as a leader as a friend as a parent as a spouse you want to be able to modulate that help modulate that do not shut it down you now your kid walks off the resting mat for a his five and you say you could one by more no ism not talking about that or your kid walks off the mat after losing you say you got when yo deserve now you have got to be the counter the counter weight to the emotions that other people have and and i think that when you are when you are doing a good job as a leaders a friend as a spouse whatever you are doing a good job as a counterweight they that is a good way to look at it you want a you want to provide some balance for people to make sure that they do not get out o control and you you notice when people have a downfall it is normally because they have surrounded themselves with people that there is no count er too there is no counter balance if you were my best friend an i you i went out drinking last night had a great time and partied all night and met a girl an you are ha wallet is do against night eventually where we going to be working o be in the gutter somewhere but if you say hey you that was blossom but don remember we got school on money right ad you kind o pull me back that is we we got a fine balance in life and ourselves and in and we got as much we cannot provide balance for other people because people are emotional and e et caught up in what there doing and you want it you want to keep people balanced think one of the reasons people are really drawn to your message and i put myself in that category and i merry twenty fourteen was a very different picture from me does not really matter what the contour was but was things were were working but they were not working the way i wanted them too and i remember arriving at your content first through the temfarrs podcast then jock but then the a venture the jock willing podcast jo rogue an podcast of a be to one's at police introduce me to you in your content notes really a case of at the time i did not have a lot of friends that we are doing similar things to me or that matched my daily routines in a way that i i could kind o energize with in this way i think one reason why you are helpful to people is that not everybody has these friends som you can have the friend that is let us go out and tie one on again lot people do not even have that friend or they have a friend but they are not really close with that person there some ideas nowadays about eighty present a males do not have a close friend that they cook i do not know i mean ism guessing girls and women feel the same to that t a lotstuff is superficial and there is a lot of communication be not a lot of connection right and i think that you and a few other people in the let us call it social media public face public facing space serve as archetypes of the friend that is going to tell you when you are up great but let us clamp it after a while or that when you are down let us get going and hearts how you get going and i do want a high that because i think it is really important and it is but one reason why people are drawn to your message and the message of some other people who are out their trying to do similar things but you in particular because yes you have this military background very intense military background war time background but also you bring it into the daily routines that certainly applied everybody most everybody can acts us non he did water mi one would hope a there is another dimension to this that i want to just bring up and get your reflections on as it relates to military work school relationship family et camera which is this somewhat counter intuitive idea but them once you hear it it makes perfect sense which is that even though the catacomb means are responsible for drive and that that is what we are really about when we are forward center of mass and we have to control the level the intensity o the candle on the level of the oil and i do not know what those actually map too exactly we could probably figured out an we really pursuit but that is the that the idea here the analogy in a kind of surprising way we know that for sure one way to restore levels of motivation drive enthusiasm and to some degree confidence that things could be different is through deep rest things sleep right when things are really really hard when kids are just the they are falling o part it is you put him to sleep they wake up and they delightful that it rung around the pajamas when there little and a teen age wakes up after a good night sleep they might be a surly but we are back adults are this the world is falling apart go to sleep make up oh i might be able to manage this kind of mind set sleep and then the other one is we know that play the sort of that the kind of physical activity or mental activity where it might be a little come edition but the stakes are low and it is really more about connection with the activity or connection with somebody else we are going to play a game of whatever you know will not play just with lakkaso kick my asked when you did do with ether y you'll beat me up both of you kindly but you will do it but a rear to play a game it is just ugly how we might be loo compete but the stakes are low right we know that play and social connection and sleep are basically the reserve war wit the location that you go to refill the oil in the candle every single time and for you where do those things play into your routine you you mentioning can go horrid all day and then in the evening is it dinner with family typically if you are at home and what is that look i know where con a parsing and i do not want o carve into your you'd your personal life too deeply obviously they are boundaries there but was that look is it everyone at the table phones away and you are talking about the day work it yet sure with us a little bit of what that looks as i think it is not important a contour to what you are about and what we are talking about that most people just do not have a window into yes o first of all in just the refilling the tank with games i mean that is for jugituas i you are going o go and yoke n have social connection with people you are not talk to people that you are going to joke about whatever than you gingko roll you'd have a good time rolling your into get all sweat on you are on to feel good than are going o high five there is huge that that is there and you are brain is kind of off when you are when you are training you get to at a certain level you are you are not can be thinking any more sitting with surfing you go surfing and you you catch a wave em in your you are not thinking about oh i need to put my balance over your now it is happening in you are having good time i would say that restoration for me comes from those two things for sure andthenyouhvming my my wife and my kids when i get home in event my kids are older now and there out of the house except for one a and what when i was in the navy when they were young i went around it all there was not any we would rarely have dinner together cause i was gone coming homely you are working all the time you can never e get all your work done ism training you get to it was we we rarely eat dinner as a family when i was in the in the teams and now when when ism home and we can eat together for sure my my daughter that is still at home she is going we it out there and eat dinner and talk about just normal things that people talk about how to conduct a night amber ashore nonet us talk about nomen normal daily things and and what is going on and you know my daughter that is she is thirteen right now than she she talks me about all konsstov and it is some it's define enjoying that aspect of be n around more then i was when i was in the teams and i just we did not have other we did not happen i would take my kits you gits i tod yoga to classes when i could when i was in the teams a would you work outs with them in the morning if i had time on the week ends for sure stuff that with my kids that is kind of what i did but now ye i we my wife is awesome and she is a great cook now because when we first got married it is questionable i just as harassing her about this the other day it she she got she is an unbelievable cook now and it is some and when we first met to by her own admission she will tell you she was not i we she from inland right and there is not cooking what were and and i hood over there at least when i was grown up in the few times i made over there that the food was pretty dreadful a in that u there were some exceptions to that but and they drank a lot over there you've been to some scientific meetings over there wit they would start with sherry in the afternoon and and beer after work it was outrageous man the amount of caul and take was just absurd ye sorry brits ait is my intent get on chi i did not miso an law lout you were angry that of a sodas baby said once you get past two drinks a week your starting ahead into territory that is an and to pleat your health see got you lot of other things office a they drink a lot ye the brits drink a lot i have spent time over there with my father in law my brother in law and and we definitely drank a lot ism glad i do not live there a d had to drink with do not have to drink with all the time it'd probably be dead you were straight age grown up right ye me wells it when was a kid and then when i join the navy i i started drinking that is part of the culture that i bought into and you do not like wanted to be a good seal and ism looking around at the guises that were con ordered good seals oh were drinking cool we that is what that is a were doing and that is what i did i feel i i think my a mi looking back now i did not really i did not think of it is a big real at the time i was not well first of all even when was grown up and i was did not drink and did not smoke did not do drugs i i was not a guy put an at on my hand although my friends and i we we all did not drink in smokes we deafly look i was listen a miner frat when is a car mails i i get it but i was not a go running around telling every one i was straight had but i was on that path for sure another when i got in the seal teams s i of have this this is a different culture it'll not use to ad i didn't really even and reallyeven understand what drinking was i mean i never i never had been drunk on the hell teams look i will not you of once i turn twenty one li we wit the i these guises were in a have for and i cold of just of cop that is what we are doing a and then i drank a ton walls in see tams and than as i ben i the i retired from the we as and when out we basically want it every bar that we would normally go to you as seals i think we closed out the night at the pack shores no be and when when when home that morning or woke up the next morning work dow and then i just kindest stop drinking because and and now i just deaf i be now i just do not really drink any more oh that is that yet when ti have my lav in sanding for five years at for my lap started i deafly saw o team guys in bars you get we come come in and take over why these were take literal take over you you basely i would not leave cause i would not give them the satisfaction or either the dissatisfaction but it is all frustrating you are in there your haven decent time and then just its enormous packatean gives comes ins or i may be sound close out the night sometimes have friends with enough of em that but yo if you are not really a part of you are not really a part of it i always knew that and understood that one thing that i think really comes through now especially but throughout our discussion and all the things have seen of you and it gets me back to this thing that came up a the beginning it'd really to re turn to is that you seem to have a very strong sense of contact and self i to say it ism not a psychologist em i here to play one but what you just described was that one in one contact t made sense to be straight edge you mention minor thought great band straight edge band but when it came time to you you run around with your friends then and it made sense to be without a'lcall or drugs are anting at that stage and than you get into another contact it is one i can do this i can drink and still perform well and do all things that need to do and the when that close is out imine i when to do something else and some people are that because they are kind of a chameleon right they they are switching themselves depending on the contact than they are kind of getting accents when there in one location or another but that is not you it all i get i can tell with with certainty that is not you ad all that there seems to be a very strong sense of self that when we have a sense of self that is firm we can go into different contact we can even change our behavior but we do not lose who we are which means we can always re turn to that the image of my mine is i have done an elubitous cupidiving not a lot but they are during some of the more advance training for onside this was not seal training it of course was can a following a line in the dark a night dive n you are falling a line and sone as you are navigating with tools but something you are following a line under water and this idea that you can let go to that line but it you remember when it is yin can re turn to it that is cold of how i imagine the sense of self because in different contacts most healthy people modify themselves a little bit we act differently at a wedding or a fun neral than we do in class or without with our friends of course important part of being a human function of human seems to me that from a pretty early stage you had pretty good sense of self now i do not know if you sit in your room and meditate on who is jock willincon touch that that that central cord of self ism guessing you do not but as i say this i have to ask was there something in your up bringing your parents or or was it just kind of how you always imagine yourself as ye this is who i am no matter what happens around me i kind of know who i am even if ism engaging in some of the behaviors that i mightn't do in another contently i know who i am cause i actually think that many people do not have a very firm sense of self or the sense of self is rigid that they can only operate in this narrow trench of one domain of life and they and a very very isolated it'd look for you to cant a share with us what your recollections are a could the first time you realized ism i yet ism good in a bunch o different places ism safe for ism whatever cause i things is also relates to confidence ism glad you are giving me the benefit the doubt on going in the teams and and been a man looks go to drink in and i have not really drank before and seems these goes er have not a good time wit to have o god time with these guides and that is kind of what i did right am as far as and i look at it now and unfortunately for me i look at alcohol now as just have seen have seen it destroy many people that have now kind of look at in go man i do not i do not think people should drink u and look i get it ism ism kind example i i used to drink and go it have a good time ad it was not at ping of deal to negatively impact me in some dramatic way but i have many friends that it is horrible for it is all but ruined their lives and it is totally legal which is kind of bazaar am i think that figuring that out when i look back in it and the culture in the seal teams was fairy there was very alcohol centric and part of that is because in all that you got it just a fraternity is alcohol centric or a or a a football team is ow could you get a munch of young dude that a got to drink and have a good time it just sort of a a young doff kind of thing and unfortunately it ends up ruining a lot of people's lives and they make bad decisions in to do stupid things and it is not good and i think the cultures moving away from that a little cities seal teams you don't mi my alcohol brief used to say u nicely to tell my is if you go out you gold o do i you get put in jail for a fight you get hurt because you are doing something drunk you just did alibis job for them you just did alkottas it they want to take you off the battle field and you just took yourself off about fail you cannot got appoyment now and ad that would always hit guys and i think that that is the seal teams kind of leaning in that direction more realizing the negative negativity of alcohol i wish i would have realize that earlier i wish i would have be a better leader and recognize that an earlier stage and recognize that just because i was kind of getting away with it meaning it did not really i did not did not wake up tie one of o chatter can we'd get to i never i never y had that feeling i wish i wouldn't realize that there is other guise it do and there is people that can operate and be functional and it does not really i pack their lives but the is lot people it do not and i do not think it work the dice roll to to start drinking i do not think it is worth the let's what what he get out of it i think that over all that is why if you when i think about alcohleges think about all the all the all the lives that it is ruined and i do not it and i wish i would have done a better job of saying what this probably not good and we should not do this and enforcing i did not and i trying convey that message as much as i can now and it did bring me back to my roots because when i was a kid it was alcohol is weak and you look at these guys they they do not know what they are doing they are acting idiots ism not going to be that and as i got older once i got a the sixties i kind of went back to that a as far as kind of wear i became me i i just actually have to kind on give a lot of credit to the music that i grew up listening to and the attitude that we had back then listening to hardcore music being able to stand up against what other people were saying which is what you are doing when you are in that scene and the whole i we nature of it hey we weakness do this ourselves wekjust make this happen for ourselves we do not need any we do not need anybody else we can do this and that hard for attitude an sticking by your friends and standing up and getting fighting that what you are going to do that is kind of my attitude and i got interviewed for a documentary that they are making about hardly plant again and and the comas and when when i was a kid and actually through my whole life that was that that music is the sound track of my life and i always would have that music running in my head but to your question i had something in me that when i heard that music for the first time i was ulna that her it is you do not hear it is this is i hear the beadles i hear the grateful dead i hear the rolling stones i hear the whoever and you go ski hit is time but when i heard hardcore music for the first time when i heard the crow mags i heard o gnostic from i heard a bad brains i thought it was that was just it was part of me already and then it was the attitude and andagan you can listen to my podcast with early land again the way have sewed early planting in the way have viewed the crow mags was not the way they actually work i bean you do early was doing drugs i me horrible drugs use on hair everything else but his image was was straight edged kind of spirits will they had all that stuff going on and i thought o able that is without i did not know i mike a kid living in the woods and connecticut i have just can hearing what ism hearing he listen to the lyrics listen toe lyrics of miner threat listen to lyrics and you of the stuff i agree with the stuff and i i just think that that kind of kind of set my my and of said a at in my head of being o k with being outside being o k with saying no being o k with being rebel being o k with not going along with what every one else is doing and that kame the became very important when i was in the military and i looked it what leadership might be telling me to do and might think myself hay that does nothing a good idea and having the the herewith all to say harbors on not show this a god idea not to be a jerk about it but just to say there might be a better way to get the stone would you think of this or boss can ask you a question about that i i think if i had to trace it back having black flag my war side too on my record player for a year and a half straight that is going to lev e mark and i think it left the mark on me i love what you just said and when i say love i really mean it because as we both know we share a common love for certain music in particular minor threatens sone stuff from the punk seen in particular for me the north east punkcrok seeing the bruisers y it'll bar from the bruisers now people know as the least in for the erotic murphy we for that is the brews and we we we run the risk of going deep down a habit hull of of music that most people maybe may not be familiar with though must people hear the drop cakes but ism right there with you i mean i remember the first time hearing stiff lo fingers or rancid and even bouncing souls i for new jerk not even bouncing sorry sir it is marry behind i great no the balancing souls an going yes that that is me that is it but as you said it was already kind of in you it is a recognition and i bring this up and i want a high light in not because we share this although i do find that to be an amazing kinship that we felt right away and was we probably riff for twenty five hours just on that but it brings him back this idea that certainly is not my idea i she the first time i heard about it was from robot green who wrote the book mastery and ism some important writings i very what was it i think it wally forget how many laws of power but those books sober be mastery's actually a book that i high y recommend people read because it talks about mentorship in finding mentors an the fact that were supposed to break up and move on from mentors and that mentors are not always people that we know or that know us et camera amazing book really a but he was the first person i ever heard describe this idea that if we think back long enough there is some seed moment it was shopping for the pants tat something it was but also music where you see something an it s yes that is me and ism not and then that becomes a sort of sound track or visual image or something for your life that you carry for it with you the narrow scientists and me wants to say that that is the first time that we really tap in to this dopamine system in a way that is unique to us because every child response to food with a low bit of do not began when we are hungry response to warmth when we are cold response to at warm a dry diner after we just wet ourselves which we all did i not maybe jock you change your own divers ah but ism guessing it so one change your diver at one point not an image path we need o go down but the ideas that we all have these universal sources of kind of having our needs met going from discomfort to comfort and back again which is basically childhood but at some point something comes along that we really feel as unique to us and it maybe the thing that everyone else likes maybe it is top forty or whatever it is maybe is the shoe that everyone is wearing and it that seems good but i do think that there are certain people who are kind of ten or twenty or make even a hundred n eighty degrees off from what everyone else likes in the that thing is what is really cool and it is a felt thing and along the lines of felt things as oppose to things that every one values what are your sources of motivation and ism going to guess that some of them are internal we could point ahead or we could point o heart does not really matter but when you think of sources of motivation do you have a palate of them that you can dip in to do you even feel the need to dip into them or as it really just all about action steps throughout your day or if i can even venture unto t the somewhat harder stories that have heard you talk about you sometimes think back and it listen omen a do this because your bunch a guides that or dead now that cannot and someone to do it because i can what are your what are the paints on your motivation polite if you will well you pro you probably heard me say that mot motivation is not something that i am going to count on because it is just an a motion that is can ta common go and it is just feeling happy you feel happier ant now maybefeel happy in fifty minutes you feel sad now maybe feel have fifty minutes feel motive aver right now you might not feel motivating fifty minutes therefore i cannot rely on it ism not going to put any n icing put any money on just being motivated because it does not really matter to me the daily actions that i take are not from motivation there they are just from discipline like i said earlier ire not gong to get up and go through some big debate about well relish you i really feel doing this now i do not feel doing but his matter soaps can to go do it now if we start to look at sort of a broader movement through life and continuing to try and move forward and move on a my buy self died and he was the dealt u to tune commander in tasking to bruiser and he he died in two thousand seventeen and he was an a parish accident and it was it was i mean it is deafly unexpected a and an also he would already been through multiple deployments a was with with us with me in the battle or body he then went back in hotter city in and led a ton of very dangerous operations and then he did other deployments and was kind of done with his deployments con a done and now he is just talking about when he is gin a retire and he is a couple years away from retirement and ism talking about pay working to work together again and it all seems we are on a prettygood path to just move forward and then he ends up dying in in a in parachute account and he is a guy that was really just kind at youyoyou are not going to be able to replace and he a any you see cannot there is a uniqueness to him that is you are not gan find and a give got some stuff that he wrote he was an incredible writer and it'll trying write something him i cannot we cannot do it cause he had a bigger vocabulary and a more articulate way of writing and i cannot write anything as well as he wrote he was incredible at guitar he played guitar played you calmly sick an incredible at playing guitar and he is a total knuckle dragger a total meet head knuckle dragger his nickname was unfrozen cave man because he just he just a you know look a big cave man and yet he spoke french and could recite french poetry and was really good at learning languages and he was an artist and he had you what sensenesigia is that is emerging of the see disciple we they can see colors and he did not know what it was other i see colors out most people can see colors i sorry that can hear colors and and can associate particular colors with soundly i pendular keys on the piano it is it so it is pretty rare yet somepeople think they have it but true sin as theirs a pretty rare but they do not have to fight for this traits anus kind of emerges for them he did not know it but one day he was tanking me and he was embarrassed to tell me he is wit is weirdest you when i when i think of numbers i i have colors in my head and and i go what you mean and he says hollow was zero and i remember seven is yellow do notremember any other but he he just rattled off one to three for fives or seven eight nine you know he says hollow white clear all o e know just rattled off these colors he had this this he had that section and it gave him some kind of weird ability to memorize numbers he would being a bar and talk to some girl and he say what your number and he would just never know it for two years he would just know it and that also made him incredibly good at playing guitar because now the scale and the fret board of a guitar as this it is a mathematical thing that he has all in this weird this weird coloration scenario going on there is he is this guy and an and very a very emotional guy a very emotional guy who would i was talking earlier about being a balance for some one i had to balance this dude on a daily base is sometimes he would be mad about something you one one day i hate the teams i a always guys and id say in it'd get a man and the next day lie never getting out of the than now he he would oscillate that that and i would tell him hay your harbor your oscillating again and just w would do anything and he and he loved his guys and would do anything for his guys and when he guide where i whereat is hereat is it is not as funeral it is before the funeral woulds the yet the open casket thing the wake thing and myself his brother ale life bad in who i wrote extreme ownership with in joy to know who is one my brothers who who works with us at as on front hours with us in remodiand was very close to sat an and weir every one kind of cleared out for us and we we go in there and i think j p gave him j p had one lose memorial bracelets with guy's names on it that it died in j p a gave that to him and think life gave him some sir waxcaus also south was a was a surfer and and i gave a his black belt cause he start a train to sister with me and he had he had his purple belt he would got his purple belt i gave his black belt and i and every one just quiet and you know j j p was telling ta story the other day i and and i just said we will not fail him meaning that him mark mike cries say and countless all their guises they it they are not here they do not have the opportunity the things we do they do not have they will have the opportunity get up in the morning that is what it is mama i will not fail to gas thanks for share that i ye think to anyone less in this feels what i feel right now which is it is very clear that the the depth of emotion for people that we care about and lose is has everything to do with our love for them there is just no question about it it the grief and love are and intimately tied they there direct reflection of one another and i you knot i hesitate to got a stay on hard themes but i think it is really important m for a couple of reasons last time we spoke whit was in your office and i your podcast and after we wrapped ut whee started talking about some people we know and somethings that had happened in your community and count as spooled into some discussions about things that happened and nearby communities and civilian culture and one of the things that perplexing i think to people i including me but maybe with time less and t at this inion came up last night in discussion ism at home cause of some recent events not close tome but this that y some people go through things where there is loss they go through life in there is hardship it must people experience some hardship certainly some more than others and every one's in a while and far too often and even in the seating community and even in the varies communes within the seating community where one would never expect it it these a highly train tight community hard guides right that is the language some we sometimes here but as you pointed out theyusr people often the have tremendous emotional depth and ism glad t you brought that of cause i think we ah he sometimes think of his motion as weakness but you are there was a time not long ago forty fifty years ago where emotions jealousy and intense he think the character sunny and the godfather he will get piste you far it on fist right that pretty emotional response where intensity an emotion were kind of interchangeable words right at some level come to be direct there's been eyes come out the seal tams i been surprised to hear they kill themselves and yesterday there was a major suicide i did not know this side and presume was he followed each other on social meou but t i admittedly was not close to him to know him of know him at all in fact the name was twitch or something in use the sky was a yous a a public facing figure but listen happens all too often and it even happens in former operators and suicide something that fascinates me and intrigues me and scares the hell out of me because for the life of me i cannot wait to any specific thing in the brain or body that were aware of and yet my have had several friends commit suicide had undergrativise her committed suicide the point is not them were there story the point is what in the world dictates whether or not somebody who has a community who is doing well and then less well besides to off themselves to end their own life verses decide ism an a keep going and this is ism raisings o the question i wish i hadn't answer i you have ideas oh it is time perception whet these people are misefeeling miserable that they feels can to go on forever but then you start reading the literature on suicide have start to go into this it for those for you that can stomach it and i do not know that i want to recommend this move but ism juicing to say it exists they moving the bridge where they five the camera on the going gate bridge for a year turns out one person a day on average tries to jump off the talk to a good who survived it by the way he jumped off the moment he went off there he have thought i wish i had not done that he survived his kid with by poler by puller disorder specially mails twenty to thirty times higher incidences suicide massive increase the point is that there something that happens in the brain where somehow people also will get the idea and you hear this that this is something they are excited to do where that they are going to right the world somehow by doing this or that somehow it is a gift to themselves again ism not encouraging anybody do this only very clear but these are the things that you hear and sadly your community has lost a number of people through suicide and yet they are lot a guides that thrive and more as a templet for trying to understand mental health and depression in suicide what are your thoughts on why some people seem to thrive and some people just go all he way down clearly there is that is a very complex question and there is probably a lot of different answers in i certainly am not one to be able to answer that question however u probably where my where my thought has gone on this lately because enol have known some guys title killed themselves and have been totally shocked but and just been talked completely in tolly shocked that guys that i knew killed themselves guys that y you would think of this guy would would never do this a milliners and that is the feeling have had a lot about a lot of the guys that i know that have killed themselves i had a woman on my podcast name para wilkinson and she is an awesome woman and she was married to a seal his name was chad i did not know i he killed himself he and and to hear her describe the store that the shocking thing about the story is that the guy that she knew n the guy that she married was not the same guy that killed himself something happened to him that made him a different person and look there they are getting all this information now about c t and the the the brain drama that you go through and people or exposed to that and i think if you have ever seen you gorge formal he seems tolly normalinga to go right and mahamanaly not much and have have known fighters and you can look at any number of boxers that have had a career and some of them are fine and some of them have some real significant what is a pugilistic there is is pugilistic central right they have they have been punch too much and have problems different people you can expose different people to blast blast in pact and is can have a different in pact over time and i think that again to hear para explain that story and what she saw from her husband and how different he was when they got married compared to where they ended up it is tolly different it tolly different person i had another a friend of mine on who a marks colone and his wife came on with em and she said the same thing the guy that she married was not the same guy that was ready to killhimseffin and he did not thankfully if it was a different person and it is not look if that get yo free is married to some woman and free an jess a grow apart over time an and he and up with some other girl it is still the same guy right is still the same guy that is now tat they grew apart they are getting deforest we get it but the way that both of them describe their husbands as being different people it that is what is stuck with me more than anything else i again ism ism throwing this out there only because it is what have observed through the people that i know and and seeing and hearing those stories of people being totally different and and have known a few people one my friends have killed himself a never i never would a guess n milliners that have would kill himself it just it does not compute it does not compute and my suspicion is there has to be something going on mechanically or comically with the brain that causes them to get into a mode were they are depressed do not see a way out and that is the way they feel now and again what is what is interesting about this as we are to talked about the fact that the selection the selection process weed's out guys that are going to take a loss and not be able to get get up again no you have got seals steals can take a loss and get back up again that is what you learn how to down bit r that is what you you'n't learn how to do you you have it ani you make it though that training you have that ability to take a less are i cool shake it off get back up keep going they are going to do that you now you have got us that are taking a loss new do not see away out any more in fact to such a point that they're going to take their own lives it is o i my suspicion isn't some point the'reging to figure out that that this exposure to you know to the adrenalin the expose explosions all the time and mean you go out to arrange just just in in peace time you got to arrange and you shoot to earl gostofv and you are arrange safety officers you go out there with every guy that shooting a kargustoff to big giant bazooka looking weapon and every time you shoot it kind of rattles your cage a little bit wolf you are a range safety officer and you are out there and your gin to watch every one in the plane shoot three of those it is con to have impact then you go seas and you are breecure or you are part of a breech team cumin to a time where one of my guys wheat we are we are doing an assault on a compound ism on the ladder most buildings in a rack have a wall around em the way we would c duck these rates put the ladder up you the assault the breach team would climb over the ladder and i would go right behind the breach team and i would stand on the ladder ism looking at the building observing making for three no one waking up makes there is no threats and then as ism watching this guy in particular he puts the breach on the door explosive breach he is on a below the door up he is got his little team with him he he puts the breach on the door he starts to back away and there's an obstacle are was a freak table or a long chair something he could not get around it home at it is dark me it is the middle the night's two o'clock in the morning and ism all one who he's going to do a seem kind of stuck for a second and i just him lay down and ism oh he is he is going to take this thing and sure enough three or four feet away from this breach point he lays down and just clacks off this explosive charge and i jump over wall and as ism going in i turnip you do not get the rest of retune to going commence us assault i look at him he is y you look he just got didn't had of the baseball bat in guess what he did the next night another breach on another target guess we do the next night another breach on another target you get guise that have that exposure which is i mean every seals eating a breach i mat you are eating flash bangs you are eating breaches you are shooting fifty cows you are you are you are eating some some aromatic brain injury but then you you must have some people that have some sort of genetic a propensity to have this negative thing happen and and i i can only guess man that this has something to do with it because otherwise we would not be herein many of these stories and and of course we are just talking about the sell things we are not talking about the military it large which is in the same exact boat ism also nervous about the social contagion of suicide within the veteran community i ism nervous about that it is one of the things it makes me apprehensive about talking about it but i obviously out talk about a had people on my podcast to discuss these things but i i am worried about that social contagion of man free did it he got all this attention and he doesn't have to deal with anything any more ism going to do it too there is got to be some level of that going on as well it is it is it is a horrible situation yet the social contagion tires one that hits home from a different dimension the high school i went to which is name isn't important by gun high school an n gun high school is famous for being one of the better public high schools not that i attended as much as i should of i tell you more about the curbs in the parking lot that i could tell you but the classes i took and that is just not incurring people to not attend highschool please do it took a lot of really hard work to climb back up to where i should have been when i graduate but e has an infamous recreate reputation i say a reputation as an infamous school because it is one of the high suicide rates i any the schools in the country because there is a train tracks that run through town and that there was a kind of a contagion of cases thrown themselves on the train tracks this was happening a lot this as written up in serious newspapers at camera fortunately t seems to have die down again ism also hesitate i talk about this because no one wants to spark this but there does seem to be something about lack of ability to see into a future obviously or the future that people ever seeing into is dark that somehow they lose touch with the idea that emotions come and go you set it about emotion about motivation emotions coming go but some out people lose touch with that and then i i will venture a guess and here ism hoping someone to in a figure the sound at some point s we can have a more concrete conversation about the mechanisms and what to do about it but i think there is also something about identity about loss of a place to put one's energy i some something useful in the world an to if you are genera you for you are talking bout here guises that that are generators right they are not projectors they are generators they they live to have it affective action on the world for good and then and o killing themselves in youth it is a little more complicated to put put a finger on cause what what is going on there we assume depression but then in learning more about suicide there is also this kind of excitement of for certain people about solving something that seemed unsolvable any other way and again ism not certainly not encouraging this a strongly discouraging people from taking their own life obviously but something about time in the loss of perception about time and one thing that we know for sure here we can really hang our hat on something is that if you do the forensics on somebody that was suicidal attempted or took their life in the preceding days and weeks there sleep wake schedule was completely walked they they exit the normal routine of most people they isolate through inversions of time and i do wonder sometimes whether not the vampireshifs as there sometimes call the night time employments and the back and forthhemand that is a lot for a system a a shift workers kill themselves far more than on shift workers ism i do think there is something there and again ism not saying everyone needs to be in bed by nine and up by fore and no although that would be a great schedule for most people but i do think that there are some universal laws of what makes the human body and brain healthy and if you violate those laws long enough we see to er with disruption in your schedule you run the risk especial if there is a predisposition there and then other factors start to layer in yet i i and i ought have to apologize cause i do not have any real answers or more biology or psychology to firmly throw out this except the the warning for people who were bipolar and know somebody with bipolar they are twenty to thirty times more likely to kill themselves and mails and particular more likely to use i methods that will kill them the first time as suppose to survive there is a big a sex difference this the they throw alcohol and their too i you know a and makes has run in organization now where they are taking they are takin fats down to do the psychedelic i wit a can a journey your tat this is better in relations yet i i there a great organization ye and i should men to very by parts an organization i went attended one event at on tornado and they were people from the far left the far right politicians and everything in between talking about how critical this is there is not a political issues a is a mental health is you ye and even when i reflected on marks talking to me you was talking about how he's kind of in this downward spiral pard why downward spital he is drinking everyday and um thinking myself man i did not think of it during the show i kind was thinking about it afterwards how is thinking man you drink if your drinking all the time you are on a downward spiral that is one thing you should just stop let us stop that immediately i just wanted to throw that all than i i think when we that is another sign from the outside looking in if some one's self medicating with alcohol it is it it is not a good place not a good place they are not a good place in the they could probably you some holp i appreciate you saying it again we did this episode on algal i went into totally open minded i never been a big drinker have had i can drink or not drink was never really into drugs at all you have able a li bit when i was younger ever great it frankly brain is plastic early on i did not need that never did hard drugs never touched cocaine and we manor anything that i and if i had i would say right i an comfortable enough in my position life that if i had it'd certainly say but i think that it is pretty clear that calls bad for us a certainly pass a certain your to drink week limit people special w that propensity for alcallism or who are dealing with other issues that is especially that case for not drinking i and i guess that we got into some a hard territory here but i i think if this conversation cause up in awareness to anybody which i hope it would i either people that are in that space of wondering if they should continue or not or that know somebody who might be i do think that the takeaway is very clear which is that there are ways to avoid these traps and to avoid making these traps worse and i think we regular sly wakes scandals understanding that and i wrote this down that you have particular have said several times thy rather than looking for sources of things outside you a job or relationsbut which are all great but as sources of energy your motivation or inspiration to use action as positive action as a source of energy i think is it just a if i would i could put that up on a bill board in time square i would right and i put your name next to it which is that action is a positive action is a source of energy that then you can recycle into more things i think ye going back to the fundamentals i ye an and positive action is when you have to contend with something when there is something that you are afraid of right step into it move towards it that that is how you are in ta solve that prom you do not you do not solve problems by running away from them you solve them by moving towards them and figure not what is going on and and i me ow cause obviously a clear way to avoid the problem at least for the next four hours and you wake up in that promise still there and that is not that is not good but yen we have got u some kind of a problem and listen then we can get go down the whole path of talking about the indirect approach which is a theory of combat which i completely believe in but it also applies to you interacting with other people if you have a problem with some other person to think mister faggot i do not prom of t andreom to go confront him on it and that might not be the resolution in fact it is probably not the resolution for me to go confront you with the probicaus now e can have a confrontation it might be better for me to take an indirect approach and not confront you but unsaid engage in conversation with you about something that is may be adjacent to the problem that i have and then eventually that builds our relationship to a point where you start to recognize oh i bet jock feels something about this thing and we can move towards a solution instead of me trying to punch you in the face with some truth that i believe first the truth that you believe now we are engaging combat and that is bat there can to be cafiuleties it'd rather take an indirect approach and build a relationship where we can solve problems in a more positive way love that and i love it because really speaks to the power of thinking carefully and being patient an a lie bit slower at times i also heard you say something earlier that still flagging in my mind which is not thinking too much think seems to be a time where thinking too much is very dangerous and again we can keep the discussion that we are having about mental health or can even just call what is mental illness i think everyone would agrees suicide is some reflection of an unhealthy state we can keep that in the bishop as we talk aby this but this is not severely only about that you seem have an ability to engage in things without thinking too much and yet also to sit back and be pretty a observant and you have talk about third poisoning of the cell it'd love to talk a lo bit more about this even though it is a topic you delve in to before and in particular the topic of meditation have been reading more about meditation have meditated for different stretches my life different mounts of time and they are too basic forms of meditation that i only recently learned about one is a focus attention meditation your sitting closingyou eyes focusing on your breath body body surface or even a visual target in your environment and just focus and we know that that enhances one's ability to focus you do too late in the day it also enhance your ability to not fall asleep i wit lop you'll do not realize the meditation too late in the day if it is a focused meditation you are just camping up the activity in the prefrontal quarter it is a are tool for an getting better it focusing but then there is also this type of meditation called open observer meditation were you purposely do not include a target in your mind or in your vision or in your hearing and you just sit there eyes closed your eyes open and you go into a place of whatever comes up what you do not hover there too long the goal is to not hover on any one thing which sounds deliberate attention degas it disorder but it is at shy a pretty cool method it turns out for restoring our ability to engage in focus but also for one particular thing that you mentioned outlier whishes creativity in creative problem solving which of course requires accessing was you say more colors on the palate than your vision might be on realizing others alsoall these other colors over here in the parifery that ism missing to the viper focus do you meditate if you do meditate is it more of an open monitoring or a focused meditation and if you do not do it kind of standard meditation are there times throughout your day and your routine and your week where as ism describing in this it maps to something that con of feels open monitoring or focused meditation yes or no i do not meditate i haven ever i do not think have ever actually meditated for one second in my life and i and i refuse to e if not that at all i do i say arris sent me is a and he and we are going to upon cast is i do it'll do it for two weeks and will do upon caftan and it'll be more enlightened and everything and i didn't even give a arris to weeks you no i still oh say arris two weeks on his a of meditation we can see how it impacts me but no i have never done it before have never tried to do it and that being said if the goal is to take a step back and detach from what is going on i do that all day every day the that is that is something that have talked about it something i tried to teach you i tried to teach the young seal leaders not to get caught up and what is happening right in front of that but to take a step back detached from the situation detached from their emotions see more of what is happy you you you are talking about seeing more colors of the palate well on the battle field i want people to be able to see more ankles more maneuvers more opportunities more of what the enemy might do more perspective that is what that is what i always tried to achieve and i ism sorry i apologize i cannot give you any good discussion on meditation cause i have not have not tried it no apology necessary but i will ask when you go surfing you are sitting in the water waiting for a wave are you focus on one particular cation on the horizon or you cut of incuse of i a open mongering just enjoying just bouncing up and down in the water where is your attention during activities that ye surfing oftentimes surfing you you you your monkey mind than your just not thinking about anything something with you did to also with surfing ruin for waiting for a a eve you are you are your mind is just going i mean it is it is in another universe sometimes as you are sitting there waiting cause you are just looking out at the horizon and your your mind me my mind ism think at boy all kinds i i have to come have to come home sometimes in mike write notes because i thought of this i thought of an idea i thought of a prospective that happens to be a predict through that happens to be s talking to people were i some one's talking about something of mike in an idea writ i fret that down have to go and write it down have i have notes in my phone pages in pages and pages of notes in my phone of ideas that i had and i right him now you voice memo things oo i type i i only need t a type seven words on on and then i have the whole ideas in my had i put a lot into the notes in my phone as well and it e proxy looks gibberish to a love he with i i go back through when him on the plain specially problems i was challenged with ten years ago or something n i look i own i'msteal with the same thing difference an same same me right you there is that we had a a amazing psychiatrist on the so i but it'd loved it to hear a conversation between the two the two of you his name is a paulcontis trained to stamford and harbor's a making i i shall talks openly about the the tray that his brother killed himself which was what drove him into psychiatry and he is interesting i because he is obviously highly educated incredibly smart you wrote a book on drama but he has incredible knowledge about a number of other areas of psychology including narcissism social path he is works in a lot of really interesting domains with interesting people that everyone listing on is packs would recognize of course he is not in reveal who those people are but and he talks about the fact that you can look at different people bit he was italy the one that shared with me this notion of generators and and ism projectors and direct me towards that literature but when he him on the podcast you know he talked a lo bit about that is tut what he take mostly about drama but then we are thing about ways in which people engage in the world and different archetypes and how you start looking at stories throughout historians you trusting the same themes over and over right ism westerns this idea a guy rise in to town and does some repair work defeats the sinister person or things that are imposing on the tin that rides to the next town it is always an ends with the it is a going to keep continuing in the but then we got to this discussion of relationship he talks about he said this on the podcast of a patient who said have i been in ten abusive relationships and he would say to that patient know you have been in one relationship ten times right which is essentially it is all about nourish you right that is ism not you ism not purposely did not point at you for those listening and i think that those features of ourselves that we bring from condition o condition can be negative or that can be pause give one thing that is interesting and i here ism not trying to solve a or understand the sealteam community per say but i think they represent an important archetype because they are selected for this ability to take a hard conditions and a failures and turn them into winds that is one of the selection cried terra seems seems to be they are finding who has that capability i see a lot of and happen to know if you people from the seal teams to get out and do really well belly great business is your shining example this and they have a family and you a got german shepherd to ye we will talk about animals and lot a dog is you serve and you train and ism sure you have your dark places dark moments and challenges anybody else but things look to me their going pretty well and then i also know people in the we from the seal teams oke they do not go down the path of suicide fortunately but it sort they do not do as well as i would have thought and ism certainly not picking on this community i also see this from people were professional athletes i know kits it we are phenomenal in high school i me these were early admission all the vile schools cause that was what happen in the town that i grew up in and i look at them now on how i it did not somehow it is not working out and i think it is important for people to hear that that yes winning creates the propensity for more winning then why do you think it is that in a community where people are trained to solve proms adapt and make things work some people flourish outside the military and some flourish lass and some we already talked about really go down that the dark traps what what do you think it is the quality that allows people to be really adaptable in particular cause most of us live in a landscape where we have to deal with people who are not us people that are not good it what we are good at and sometimes that is an onset sometimes it is not you seem to be particularly good it understanding the human animal and working with that again this is a broad question we are going very broad band here an we will get narrower and again in i bit but id love your thoughts on why is it how is it what determines whether or not somebody thrives in novel environments i have to start off ut just by saying i wrote a now as you are talking i just put seal and then i put the not equals sign cause you cannot say that a seal equals anything by excellent point it is i mean there is guise there is guides that have been n the seal times that are are murderers there is real murder murders i rapid and murderers that went through seal training famous murders and their imprison for rester lives that that is of thing there is people that have ben i the seal teams that give got kick out of seal teams for drugs and i mean you you name it and we have got than we have got got that are just lazy if we got guise that it just physicians you could say this about physicians there been sociopathic am i serial killer physicians and then they are ones that are in thermal countries right now that would would not accept at a billion dollars to stop serving people at the level of the basic medicine that they deserve there is the my others there is the seals that get out and just volunteer to go help in the worst places in the world love got a full spectrum of people to say a seal equals success ain't any domain the only do main you can say that they are successful as they make it through basic el turncause guys make it though basic sell tain an there not good seals that happens you get guys that make it through basic seal training and they make it through seal qualification training and they make it to a salaam and bay get kick out of the settings cause they are not good seals they want meant to do that job that happens all they have proven by making through basic heal training as they can kind of sock it up for a while and there is also guise that make it through basic seal training cause they learned how to maneuver through the system they learn what to do in what the minimal requirements learn how they could scape thoughts there is guise that it is it is not a huge number but they are absolutely there we see them in science people that go to a lab figure out who the director of the lab is at the level of psychology and this is shall on of the more dangerous aspects of science it shall negatively impacts all of society it'll just say it and any scientistwill know what ism talking about they find the big famous labs they figure out who that leader of the lab is and they get that person the data they want they might not make the data up but they will certainly discard the data that do not fit by that which is one way of making data up by exclusion right it is not literally painting pictures of cells that are not their something but that happens a lot and those people often go far they rarely go all the way because pretty soon they reputation expand to the point where people go ye i known can repeat that rs all that but these people sit in very high positions not at stamford right i will say i do not know any on my colleagues at stamford t that meet that o those criteria but you see them and you see what they are doing and they're basely solving a social engineering thing they just happen to be doing it in science now why anyone would do that in science i do not know these you do not get rich in science he certainly they get famous but for whatever son they figured it out that is where they arguing to do it ain't surly and law firms insure you see in every single them may he r now you pointed out that there is some people that make it to the ivy league schools they graduate from ivy league chosen they do not do well and to me that is h very similar to some one that might make it o the seal teams do well the seal teams and then they get out they do not do well it is probably cause what i talk about earlier when when i want to navy book camp here is what your got to do if you do it well you will be rewarded well if you are in high school in your dad your mommindad say hey if you do good in high school you are gang to get into this ivy league school an you get in about ivy leave such here ischia you need to do in high school you to get good grades you to be part of the glee club you need it whatever the things are that you got o do you got a speak a different language you got a o volunteer in in guava mom in the summer time you got to do these things the you will get into the good cause when you get the good college you got to get this degree wenteyou it that to gree the whether have had a path laid out for them of boxes to check and they go in check the boxes and when they get done no one has put any more boxes out in front of us they do not now what to do and then that can certainly happen from in the from some one in the seal themes ore someone in the military that what they been hate this is your mission this what you got to do here is what you need to do do well check the box check the box check the box check the box in his time to retire and there is no one put a box in front o to check and unless some one in o some guise get out of the seal teams and they go in to a big corporal striction they kick ass becausethe're some on in the corporate corporate world saying he here which got to do next and they do great and that is super good for them and the actually really it i talk to guy the other day you's a for on in a corporation es doing a great job see he likes what he is doing it is possum but i think you get some guise that that they they do not really have the open mind to see where opportunities are and they young one thing as nice about the see teams is it is there is a lot of you get a lot a freedom o maneuver right you can really do a lot of stuff that you kind of want to do and when they look at the corporate world they do not see that they think a i no ism nocking to do that but then they're not quite sure o how to take the next step i think that is why you might see some guise that are not supersuccessful because the do not really know what to do and they do not really have a mind that is open to look for opportunities and and also you got some guise that success for them as there can o hang out with the family and their gin a getting good shape and there gongtoe run some try off land or competing cry whatever they going to do there on toe go do it and that is what they precooking to do you oh which is which is also tum go take time go in joy your family man you gave enough to your country go go hang out your kids that is success as far as ism concerned to i agree there i know far too many people who are successful in their professional lives but who have very diminished personal lives and it is not a pretty picture they you mention the the parent kin o driving the kid do this do that in that scenario i sense tones of fear it is all about not being a failure it is not actually about love of your craft or what you enjoy pretty early my science career i i learned that there sertainpeople are just ambitious they'd to win and ay's to joke around it is not polite but see you knight we should all just tell that person that i new cool thing is trying understand the biology of and i would say feelers or something and they would brolly work on it they have yes the grays thin cause they ash yet do not care what there working on for them its just the hunt and i learn that actually people that can serve an important roll because we there is ashy hole nicer by they are rashly laves to do work on ceases forgive me my nicer collegusthat work o mice bags but in all seriousness people who are just ambitious can be very effective because you put a prom in front of them it is a dog though just retrieve it is o u go as oppose to love of retrieving a for retrieving sake its i you give you give it that same dog the anally here you give that same dog a his jump in the in to high jumping it nor whatever it is or did in under water but i think of people more animals and more different dog species we as your case was with music particular music and communities or example of chopping for the pants and that prince it the first time you taping to something it really feels kind of unique to you there is something here to be able to find work that includes that but also is hard and also allows you to evolve over time i man i think that is hat's the real that is the real gift that i think most people are seeking and of course there is know short cut to that except perhaps one which is to be able to sense the difference between ambition and there is no better word for i let just call what it is which is love i i love this and the reason i think that love is powerful and here ism sounding likes freedmen but i do not mean interpretational love i i mean tore of the being able to sense what that feels is that i do believe that it allows us to tap in to an enormous number of things that fear alone an ambition alone and just being hard driving person alone will not allow us to tap in to things adaptiveness creativity and there is and i think there is a really obvious reason for it which is that the one thing we know about our species is that we want to make more of ourselves can to take good care of our young whether not every one has kids are not is irrelevant the point is that every species not only wants to do that but mean to do that and the feeling of love is really what allows us to be adaptable i do not think there is anything that trains up adaptability as much as being around kids you just have to be adaptable right cause there one moment the up than they are down than they are disappointed you know you and you shared really important story about loss of somebody that clearly you loved and that clearly loved the community he worked it was not just that you got loved him its that he got he loved bougie and i think that being able to tap in to these feelings of love for things for people and for experiences i think is critical and i do not meditate much these days but i have heard of this love in kindness meditation and i was sound soft to me i is thinking gosh what i is must do then float levitate at the end and were of more whatever it is can't now what is the thing but i my friend am whom fortunate to call a friend not trying to namedrop your mown very fortune call rick rube in the music producer a friend and he was the one who start turning me on to different forms of meditation once i mention before in this idea that there are forms of meditation which put us in touch with what he calls the source now this is really getting a lo mystical but i think this all maps back to the same thing which is that there are sources of data mean and the other narrow transmitters in us that give us kind of a superpower to adapt to anything and i think it is at least includes love because that is the most adaptable emotion by definition because of what is required for revolution the question therefore is in yourself and in your observation of people that you have worked with did you ever sense that just being hard driving was kind of it was great but it was limiting did you ever sense that by liking the people you work with you could perform much better even if they perhaps we are not as hard to kind of barrio the the common barrel answer around this they were not as hard as everybody else that because you each other much that you can kind o do anything well if you have a team of ten people and you all have a great relationship and you get along well and you are going against my team and we all hate each other and where oman went the team that loves each other is going win i was hop is it is not in close it is not a matt of fact if you work for me and you do not me what what kind of performance are young to give me it is gin to be tough what if you love me and have looked out for you and have done everything for you and have taken care of you what con o performance or young me of everything of i die for you yet earlier you you ask about the human animal and human nature and this is part of leadership i o ask this question one day by a as workingwith a company and the guy says how do i identify what are the characteristics of some one that can execute and how do i identify those characteristics in a person that i can get those people an i said well first of all the characteristics are f the characteristic that everybody's in your obviously some one that is driven some that communicate well as can make things happen these it this a pretty simplest know we know what they are how do identify i it is pretty simple as well i give you a task i give drew task it's pretty simple task if you get it done cool give you l a bit more complex task do you get it done yes i give give the same task to free he does not get it done he comes back with h bunch of questions he slow rolls if you have got all kinds of excuses in promise i give you an even more complex task you come back you get it done and then ism in a realize oke mandrel's a guy at that makes things happen he is a guy that can actually execute any little bit what you said in in there certain breeds of dogs but even that is it did them not as as as different as human beings are right there and there are some now there are some guys have got drew who will make things happen here is the problem with drew when i say hey drew here is this needless idea that i have can you turn this into a reality and you are there to start ism not sure we ye want me to go meanwhile i gave it to the guy that did not make anything happen with specific task i gave him and he comes backs as you it say my i got this nebulous idea can you so you has o ya and all the sudden he takes it he says had figured to a way to make this happen you might have some one that is very good at executing be they are not very creative ism might have somebody that is very creative but there not very good at executing what i do i build the team where have got and found free and they work together and free comes up with good ideas and we bring him to drew and andrigles and executes him that is what were doing from a leadership perspective is were letting people's nature execute and purple were putting people in to rolls where their nature is beneficial ism not going to take some one that is shy and introverted an put him out in a lead sails roll ism not going to take somebody that is boisterous and extraverted and put them into a cubicle where therein to be looking in spreadsheets all day clearly ism not going do that what we have to do as leaders is we have to find the right people for the right roll and we place them into those rolls now does it mean that i abandon all hope that the guy that is an intruder will ever develop more communications gills now m can work with him and over time we will get him a little bit moving in the right direction but ism not going to take somebody that is a a total introvert and turn them into a lead sails god that is not going to happen any more than on a change tiger stripes that is what we have to do is we have to help people as leader's got to help people find the roll and find the thing that they are good at now does that mean if i have some one that loves their job they are going to do better at it absolutely does it mean that if i have somebody that is driving just by achievement that there onto be good at their job no in fact but the they can be there is gin be certain rolls i can put him in right if have got sales note i been to hit and and drew super kinda achievement he what he wants to be the golden child tho wants to have his picture on the on the magazine that we put out about our industry cool i can throw this task at you and yet you are going to go and get it the problem is if there is something that is going to take more perseverance and the reward is not that high or it is a long term goal you are probably not the right eye for the job liking you are job is absolutely critical and if you love your job you gingko be able to you can to be able to most likely excel at it now you could be an unfortunate person that loves your job is not good at it that happens occasionally to i receives i i i turn ta ye very rare it re minds me of your skateboarding career loves a p is you just weren't that good i was not good t the know what i loved more than scapewoardin i love the community right i was in i love the community i was in and i put any n i proxy wouldhav gone to the industry side or work on a company side and not been on escape actual careers at or justcape word for fun there is a guy in the scape work communist names him thebe an he ski tat the i not hid in secret in in that community he is in amazing guy and he is sort of a early on left professional scapewording to run a company real delight o munch of other companies he is amazing got and he told me the wed become friends recently he said he realize he was not going be one of the big guises but he knew he want to be in the commune he found his place and i think everyone in scape warn looks to him as thug my who care he is he caries he truly cares about the sport and about the people and he learned to kind of just wrap his arms and his hard around the whole thing and it just works and i do thing ism everyone has a certain place i in a communiyern a team i think that as you are describing this aft to imagine that people are listening and thinking while this team thing is also it is just amazing i wish i had that ad ism fortunate to have that in my podcast up had that my lav as certainly in the my podcast team out i i would say these guys go i go i it it is not just it is the people at pressbuttons around him and take photos they go i go they go it is over and ism fine with that i should love that because it is it is less it is about the podcast but and about the in formation in getting it out there but it is as much about the team and working together just it was escape working i hole them better a podcast was escape where i kef getting broke off as the scare where to say in scape waring too often but i wont to ask in your family life do you look at that as a team you think this is my team and there different and how can we energize and you have got a look at everyteam that one of the strength and weakness is of the team and who is can be good at what and how do you put people in positions where there going to be able to cell i mean what is a name to is a him thebe him hero ye imagine if he had a men tor that was only say listen you got to be a prostate this is your only opportunity there is nothing else and he did not have the ability to take a step back and say you know atman ism not back ism not going to be good enough but i really love this industry it luckily for him he figured that out and you talked about the super power of being loving your job tithe one thing i claim to be a super power is the ability o take a step back in detach which i guess it is going back to your meditation thing but being able to take a step back and look at your life and say man i been scape boarding longer than that guy and he is better than me and i been scape brain longer than that of the guy and he is better than me ism probably not going this probably not the right job for me what could i do whet i could use my skill set and obviously he had some motroponoral spirit an and was able to figure that out being able to be a part of a team and it is goes to what i was saying earlier about the mob being able to be part of a team part of the mob part of the gang but still have the ability to take a step back detach from that and a less what is the best way for this team to move forward i mean you could have this brilliant idea that from now on you are going to make all of your pod casts about the molecular structure of whatever and the rest the team probing to pull you aside into layman i know you really care about that and that is awesome but everyone really wants to hear about this other stuff let us tie it in together let us expand what you the specific than you aunt talk about being able to take a step back detach and see the bigger picture to me is the true superpower of life of life and it is it is a lot harder than it sounds and this goes back to when you don't sort talking about people that are having going through struggles in life right and have described this before as youkow if ism looking at you and you are you are in a bad state right you are depressed you are sad you are moping around you are not getting anything done and ism looking at you from the outside and and ism thinking for me i see this storm cloud around your head right i see the storm cloud around your head and you are in there and all you see no matter what direction you look is storm all you see is darkness ism outside ism looking about the layman that is git is got a great education he is healthy he is got a good team around and he is got all these things going for him but you in that state you literally cannot see anything but the darkness of the storm and that is what is scary about when people enter that mode is you can look i can look at it from the outside and be drew you just got a move four fee forward and you are gin to be through this thing and yet your might hear me say that you and jock i looking head there is nothing but darkness helping people move forward take action and be able to get that perspective detach and get outside themselves get outside their own heads yours ten arris that get out your head get into your body that is one way to do it take action go do things but it is it is very it is very scaring ism sure you have had this experience where you're talking o someone that and they are ball down in whatever problem it is whatever stress they are and er and you are looking at ism going layman it is going to be o cay you can clearly see that whatever they are whatever is bothering them and dragging them now you can clearly see he lot t time's relationship right the the girl of the guy they they got dumped and you got payment that person was a disaster anyways you are better off without em and they cannot compute that they are stuck there or maybe it is the school that they did not get into or the job that they did not get and they get rapped up and that they cannot they cannot get out of that storm and it is it is it is such a helpless feeling to to sit there and toilsome one hey you you you youjust move a little but towards me and your in a we get out of this storm and it is much easier said than done and and that is why trying to engage with people in trying to give people that super power of detachment where they can take a step back and say what you are right man that that girl she she was not who i really thought she was i should move on yes but easier said than done and that is one the biggest challenges i think that that we have as friends and in parents and a teammates is helping people learn to detach learned to see the bigger picture learn to see that the the problem that you have that your whole world is actually not that big of o deal you when i wrote have written about you kid's books and one of the things that triggered me to write kid's books is realizing that you do not what one day my daughter came home is my oldest daughter and she came home from school and she is i she says ism stupid what he mean your stupid she's stupid ism dumb why do you think that know it what ever grate it is when you've must to know your times tables i do not know my times tables i so oh fellow much of you studied she kinda gave me the the the confused look what you whwhatd he mean studied i sud have you studied yet if you made flashcards to to learn them and she did not she had not she thought she should just know them from yer to teacher were over what they are now she you do not that some other kids in a clastic and and ism sit nigeria cool all just we will make someflashcards if she make flashcard she learn her tell timetables and forty five minutes and we are good but what struck me was to me all i own o bid deal to her it was her whole life and then i got to see that with my other kids somebody said something to them in the recess yard and i all screw that kid didn't wit the there do not worry bout them but when you are that is their whole world and that unfortunately does not only apply to kids you would applies to do not as well and they get this problem in their world that seem insurmountable and massive because that little ego system that there sticking is their world and they run into this problem in that and it is just eruptive in that world and they do not know how to get out of it not i did a podcast talking about these ego systems at people get into right another is all these ego systems yearn ego system we are we are both in it a shared ego system of podcasting and we could be all my gosh you lacks just came out with a new podcast and it is been the biggest success and what can i do to catch up with wax and and lathe i could get really by you could get rely by we could be bothered by that to think man ism a failure meanwhile you there is people that do not listen to podcast us people that do not even know what a podcast is and yet it is our whole world if we let it you are in the academic world he you go you you're professor at stampford which is a big deal in that world i know people that do not give a rat's ass they could not they do not know where stamp for it is i get that all a the i do not know while transfer that it is nobody deal in the salted same thing somebody has a problem in the seating and they think this is the whole world and i blew it and and now what are they going do when you are facing a significant problem in life relationship a prom with a job you got remember that you are in one ego system and if you are step outside of that ego system no one really cars and you could got over to old hey totally different ego system and and find happiness there but at least utilize that to get out of that storm rob that you are in and you arguing to find that there is plenty of light out there in the world move towards that and it is going to be a much better situation in the spirit of authenticity everything you are saying it is directly home for me i do not know what people's perceptions of me are i actually try not to spend too much time thinking about that and just really try and stay and touch with the source and i really do believe in the notion that our love of things is what can generate energy and i try and use action to generate energy but also i happened also love exercise that is an easy one there for me but i try and stay in that mode but ism to be quite honest have spent much of my adult life and probably too much of my teen age life an twenties we are not quite in adult right in your twenties at least that i certainly was not in challenging relationships that admittedly we are challenging because of my roll in them also of course right and each in every time i remember thinking moving on from this is this insurmountable thing in part because i am a caretaker and i cared and it was not just about me and a selfishness it was about wanting to right all the wrongs of that persons past you not found myself trying to be a time machine for people give found myself trying to fix their family lives have found myself doing all of that and also ignoring all the things i need to focus on in terms of bettering myself and making show f showing up correct and on and on and ism there are data in the world of in the form of these people that that know me very very well that i think would say that in a whole lot more right ism the point is not those specific relationships but each in every time some one would come along and say listen if this is not good for you it is not good for them or this is a bad situation or this is not serving either of you well but i was my opicthis big and the not even to strove you of the world sand speck of the world and trying a solve cause that is my natal i resolve that i one solvent o mana solve it and sometimes things were solved for some period of time and sometimes they were not and i think one thing that just as a confessional i will say ism i could really learn the art of detachment i could really learned to focus on that more if that is the proper language wort i think ism pretty good it adapting i thing am pretty good at finding good people an certainly love my team an this and that all feels natural energy although it is hard work you cabin in the podcast but i think the the sort of a tendency that have as a problem solver is to assume the every problem can be solved and there fore staying on this problem until it is solved is the answer and maybe the art detachment in getting some perspective would help because if i look back i certainly do not regret the experiences have had but i wasted far too much time and that frankly have probably wasted far too much of other people's time trying to solve problems that could not be solved and i think without going into this in any more detail and of course i you are not o you can send me a bill at the end by the way i think the the solutions are freeman yes i think that thing a problem solver's great being forward center masses great i think learning the systems of the brain an body and understanding psychology and in learning about oneself the oracle had it right know thyself in ways that you can maneuver functionally in your life and career in relationship at camera great but i think there is also a downside to being overly fixated does i my bulldog hostelled be chewing on something chewing us in next an i know you chin on is foot in your hay and you would have rip em off as own foodie b case that chew reflects was just strong that sometimes it would turn on himself that is kind o how how it feels yet wrote a book call leaders of travesty tactics in one of one of the things that i wrote about in that book is understanding what is important what is not and this is very very similar what you are talking about looking looking at a problem and takin stop backing on it well e is is important or not and be is it solveabore is it it and see what is the orowhi on getting it solvelem let us the efforts long to take to get this problsolv an how's is reallygan t impact my world and my life if i focus on it knowing and understanding when something is important or not is a very good skill and again it is a skill it is directly related to attachment detachment because when you are in that relation it is nothing i been toll people fly the the the the solution to your problem is not going o be found in the problem is not cant be found in there you have to get out of the problem that you can look at it make an assessment and you can assess how to solve the problem or whether you need to solve the problem not i mean there is a lot of things in my life for a now orbit shrug my shoulders got but it is look o some one saying this order that carry on no factor move on and then occasionally you go not of i this is something i need content with the something yo deal with this something i need to shape or a doctor move or or solve to use to use your word an reason i life when i say that is because problems you have to get in there but if you take a step back you can use my a o little adjustment here little adjustment there and that things can a sort itself out detachment is a superpowerment certainly is and it is certainly one that i needs o focus on more ism ism grateful for a bringing that up is this is the a biologist in me but i a what is your process for engaging detachment or for disengaging is it a active process re yo you i am get a detach from this i were t put myself in a situation that is pulling on me there is is gravitational force and ism getting i creatsome imagery in my mind of walking away from it do i physically walk away from it do i out force it to somebody else what it what are some tools for detachment the this is one of those situations where you and i had a discussion about the science and t a practical application a line my original experience with detachment was and this is one of those moments where you no i sad a lot of time's things are just small moments over time and you make a littleadjustment this one of those moments in my life and i wrote about leadership'straging tactics where i recognized in a moment what detachment was and how helpful it was ism on an oil rig doing a training mission my whole platoon is in a skirmish line looking at a a large area of the oil rig that were suppose to be clearing again that is not combat this is in the nineteen there's nothing gone onwards doing training and ism standing in a skirmish line and by the way ism the youngest and most junior guide mipletun and ism standing there looking down the sight of my weapon and ism waiting for some one to make a call and tell us what to do and i wait for five seconds and i wait for ten seconds and i wait for twenty seconds o no one saying anything and we are waiting for big leader in my platoon to to make a call to tell us what to do tell me what to do and finally after thirty seconds which seems an eternity i cannot take it any more and i take a step a a a foot one foot step twelve inches i take a step off the skirmish line i look to my left i look to my right and what i see is every other guy in my platoon is staring down their weapon staring down the sight of the weapon which means there field of view is tiny it is a twenty degree field of you you are looking down the the scope of your weapon ore the site of your weapon and that is how big there field of yews tat ism looking ism thinking oh there is my platoon commander he is looking down the scope of the sight of his weapon there is my pour chief he is looking down the did o his weapon there's my leading pettyoffsor he is looking down the side of his weapon there is my sister tun commander he is looking don every one in the postpone is looking don the side of their weapon which means they all have a very narrow field division we won't i take a step back and look to my left and look to my right guess what kin a feel o vision i got i to a massive one i can see the whole scene and i can see exactly what it is we need to do and at that moment look as a new guy you need to keep your mouth shut you do not say anything and ism thinking well but no one else is saying anything i muster up all the courage i can and i open my mouth and i say hold left clear right which is a basic tactical call don't no no this is not a pagan level genius maneuver it just the normal call to making a situation that we were in i say hold left clear right and ism expecting to get kind of slap told shut up newly but instead every one just repeats the call hold left clear right hold left clear right and they we execute the maneuver and we finish the clearance of this oil rig and we will get done we get the the top of the oil rig which means we clear the he thing r on the hello deck at the top and we going to debris and now ism expecting look a now hen to get told ay what weeyou doing you can need to keep your mouth shut and instead the fortune chief goes a hay jock o good call on the cellar deck down there and i was kindling that is right but then i thought to myself hell on a second why if of the youngest most junior guy in this platoon why was i able to see what we needed to do and make that call why did that why dit that just happen and then i realized it was cause i t took a step back to use a your turn i broadened my field of view which allowed me to think more clearly cause instead of being hyperbole is to narrowly focus i broaden my range of vision i took a breath before i made my call right i ad to take my u take a a nice breath to to speak clearly and i realized that taking a step back and detaching i got to see infinitely more than even the most experience guise in my platoon and i started doing it all the time in it i started doing it in land warfare i started doing it in urban combat i started doing it in all these tactical training snares just just training is the signs start a doing these trainksners and it always allowed me to see what we needed to do and then i started doing it when i was having conversations with people and having a conversation my portion chief an i can see it hes start to turn a little red in the face and i we we we are about to argue about something i o it a second it'll take a step back looking vote he is get alright now and he is the potion chief you better just desolate this thing real quick and i a know at chief that sounds goo in l take a reline retook at the plan or whatever and i started to do this kind o with my normal life was ton not get wrapped up in my own emotions not get wrapped up in the the the gun fight that was happening right in front of my face not to get rapped up in the details of what was going on but instead take a step back detach look around and then you can make a bet much much better decision and it is not it it is exponential you if you are looking down the sights your weapon and you take a step back and you look around it is exponential how much more you can see hellion if you are the only person in the gun fight it is on be harder for you to do that cause you got o be focussed on whatever you are shooting at but when you have sixteen guys or twenty guides there all looking the same direction it is very easy to be the guyticoes on to take a step back look around make a call when you talk about the mechanics when i teach this to people now the mechanics of it take a step back literally you are at you and i a a meeting there is bunch people the starts to get heated argument i will literally push my chair back away from the table change my respected perspective open why in my field of view the other tho thing all t in in the sixties you do not want o you do not want a sound panic on the radio for a couple reasons number one because when you panic on the radios can cause of the people to panic number two if you panic on the radio you sound panic even con to make funny you re don't you get back for the missioner t go towage you sounded a baby out there what would i do before i would key up my radio take a breath and here ism manually slowing down my breath ism broadening my field of viol if you are in a meeting or you are in a you know you are at the at the supermarket parking lot and some one starts to yell it you take a step back take a breath broaden your field of view detach from those emotions that you are haven't and make some space and that is that is how i go through the mechanics of detachment now i can tell you it now i mean when when when you do this all the time which i kind to do this all the time i do not i do not have to step back but when you are starting to be and to try and do this absolutely make a and not say in he's another weird little new ants thing lift your chin up and put your hands down now this is not not ta combats such a rase not not ta fight but here is a thing when when when i get defensive what am i gingko raise my hands upend put my chin down it is a fighting mode if you and i are have not a discussion and ism starting get heated n of starting to like oh he is not listening to me instead of me putting my chin down and and put my hands up up to i can put him in your face a little bit no i shall not take a step back from a put my chin up i changes my perspective a lota it more changes my visual perspective just it e change in the angle of my head take a step back put my hands down a popping into defense i actually when o hear what you have to say and if i start listening to what you have to say and not talking it is very hard to be detached when you are talking is another key component you wanted to watch shot your mouth ism in meetings an i in a bunch of different companies ism running a i have a bunch not i won't a bunch different companies ism in a meeting in my companies ism not the one that is doing all the talking in fact ism doing mostly listening when ism in task at bruiser my asking it ism not sitting there giving the entire brief now ism letting the fortune chief in the fortune commanders give those briefs i not why ism detached ism listening to what they have to say ism more capable of seeing what holds there are in their plans by not moving my mouth not talking ism listening those are some of the methodologies that i use an i advise people to use in order to effectively start down the pathway of being able to detach in various semariols i love it again ism saying i love it because i do love it and thank you i think it is a wonderful technique we have talked before in your podcast an a some of my listeners may be not all am this podcast will be familiar with the fact that when we narrowly focus our gaze on one target a number of things happened our visual world becomes constricted of course but also that we start slicing time more finely and the dopamine system tends to start doing a kind of anticipation and trying to guide and direct things in that narrow tunnel of view was when we literally take on panoramic visions and onto silly moving our head around although one could broadening our field of view or looking a horizon specially for walking but gain that kind of not kind of getting a broader field of view we slice time differently things do not feel as imposing on us this is the physiological substrate underlying what you you are describing and i think it is am it goes a step further because in that open larger aperture of visual understanding there is a open larger window of cognitive understanding and new option starts a surface right i mean i think this is have long been fastening by the fact that this i should be it'll tell us the real quick story i in twenty fifteen i was i i went over to spain to do some mountaineering with whim off if this was not as i want podcast at and have any social mega just went over there as it'd hard the sky whim contact in them somehow arrange a trip for myself and i went over there and we did some crazy dangerous mountaineering the no business doing almost ripped my left leg off in a stunt that was organized by others there at i never should have done in any case one day look and women crouched on the ground next to a curb in this parking lot before a height he is down the n the round the little stick and i what a you doing he is look there were aunts climbing up this thing in he is their mountaineering this curb and not on whisky different right but then i realized we were about to do the same thing up this big face and i thought well lake he is able to think at these different scales and see similar is i let let us prep go i would have never stop to look there and it'll i still remember it right i was it profound no was it interesting yen the sense that things are happening at all scales all the time and we we think we know the scale to pay attention to and we think that that is the one that matters most and i thin it is fair to say that in a gun fight there is a scale that matters most but new options new perspectives actually come from that broader feel of you wish is what you are describing and later that day it is interesting because this group going up some of them were really challenged in the in the decline and wen went back to this example of how the ants would stack on top of one anotherand he used an analogy from that to help people through this clime there is a beautiful pool at the top et center at center anyway i think that these examples am are in fact meaningful especially the ones that you gave because they do not just relate to military em you imagine around the dinner table have had this gets her there and partners there and times it is really nice to sit back and just a here it all in basin it all but oftentimes new information will surface ye said thine all ism hearing his worries out of this person they are not even really here they are all talking about what we are going to do new next time next time next time and unlike you anchor people half maybe let us focus on what what we are doing here or sometimes year hiperfolk is one one's happening there o they been to think about something in the future i love this i need to practise detachment in number different domains o my life ism one thing that i ism realizing after hearing you am describe the process there really need to do as i need to start taking i some time away from my work maybeven elicit of time parallel to relationship to get per better perspective on it because i think the problem solving nature an us really makes us myopic really makes us need sided let's a you see this a lot i mean i i get to see this a lot we do events with company's businesses and we go affright somewhere were they are detached they are just they are they are defect o detached from they are dated business you pull some one out the business for two days an all the sun they start seen the solutions but they net they never see them the it is lot order for them to see them when they are in the fire fight you get them out of the fire fight it is hard for them to see when we're in that acquisition at they are doing how we gan merge these two cultures thesis going to be impossible boy pull em out are i let us talk about two cultures and and let us talk about what possible outcomes are and all the o when you get them to take a step back the these solutions will appear and and it is true in a gun fin ollisan if it is a one on one gone fight even then be ability to take a step back and look around for use your serial vision you have to be able to do this is going to increase it is exponential how much eating that is why it is a super power it is cheating it is it is cheating n is speaking of keystone keystone took over a we he became a task to commander or troop commander when we got back from remote and now he is the going charge now i was running the training and a couple months into his training he broke his neck i broke his vertebra in his neck his spinal quarter's o get he was anal the guy with the big neck brace on and he could not downy arduous training and his his shall task unit which is troopltunes was going through their land warfare training and he could not do it he could not carry aroma could not carry a machine guns we could not do it i said him coming out let us go out and you can observe your guys and see how they are doing and there we are we about the desert his his troop is going through field training exerciser full mission profassoat's like a big fate operation there is a fate target there is fate bad guys were using these later these high speed later guns to shoot and we are work in of standing on this little burn and at a certain point in the operation his whole task unit forty guys gets pin down in this little ravine and worst kind of standing in the ravine with these guys and no one's making any decisions and the enemy with these lazier guns our starting a maneuvering starting it they're killing guys cause here later guns you can die and set its me on the arm is a can i cannot tell him what to do and it'll not but let him figure out another thirty seconds pass another guy god's killed with later he get's me a control let me let me say some to him and it'll no let let him figure it out another minute goes by two more guys are now dead just later dead but they are dead and he gets me again he is pro let me tell him i go i goad tell and he just crouch is down next to one the gun bangs him on astern per right and which is a again it is just a fundamental basic call and the guy shouts it out we'll right and they start purine in another minute later they are all out of the kills on and everything o we and then set looks at me an he goes man this is easy way up here and i said pro look it where we are we are in the ravine with the guys we are now we are on a knee and the guys are laying down but it is not this we were not on some elevated position and i said hey it is not that when an eleven position it just that we are detached and looking around he goes on my god and i said hey your member when you and i went through this training and he goes yang this is what it was for me all the time i was constantly just looking around that is why it seems a magic power right it is a superpower cause you d sets down there with this gun and hes shooting om hero move your guys over that go that kid's in right their such a curitypont and he how did how i jocko see that cockle must be attacked genus not amok tactical genius ism just taking a step back and looking around and this and you just said it applies to everything that we do if you are having a conversation with your significant other and you start to see that they are getting frustrated about somethingnow look if you are in the conversation a hundred percent you are going to get frustrated too you are in to get frustrated there frustrated next thing you have got a you have got an emotional argument going on where is if you take an take a mental step back and they waited why they frustrated right now oh because ism trying to solve they are problem really what they're looking to do as vent of a got it let him than o can he that sounds horrible what you think you are going to do and to say well that is the rob here is what yous should do was peopleare always looking for that year it is this thing this ability is and it is something that can absolutely be trained and that is what is cool about it can absolutely be trained it is not a natural gift it is it is some people we better at it than others but it is something that you can train i used to see guys develop and i see people developing now in the business world where they will they will report back to me hat we had a meeting with the union today and the union started escalating what they wanted to do and i just to i detached and we ended up desolating in now we got a solution this is an absolute skillet that can that can be learned and that is what that is what makes it especially nice because there is some people look if you are very articulate born very some people are born more articulate than other people some people are born with inability o simple my things more than others and you can train and you can become more articulate you can become you can learn to simplify things more and some people can be naturally good a detaching but but every one can get better out and that is a beautiful thing it's a beautiful thing and ism highly intensify eyes to do this i in their areas of my life they are going really well that i also want to apply it there i think that have tended to rely on people close to me as a way to access this detachment i will be very direct in saying that you know i am not the leader of my podcast there is a leader it is not me ism part of the team but it is not me and i often rely on his i put u and sometimes that in put is solicited and sometimes it is not one place for instance where you see people getting really myopic is on social media it'd and and have experience this you id love to say that's always non reactive and i think in general i take the stand that have filters i have have filters i i know why ism there right am interested in being a teacher and a giver and informing people and about the beauty and utility o biology that is what i say is not a mission statements it is a fact that is what i care about anything that does not fit through that filter i really have any business doing but occasion i likuta you don't make a job kersey but occasionally something comes roughing you and i find myself an way a second and you get sucked into that tunnel and sometimes it is observing other people an tunnels and when you are not in the tunnel it is obvious to what is happening right you are watching in some cases people just dragging their lives and some cay of sinking their entire careers i mean the former chair of psychietriate colombia university in new york made in absolutely foolish truly insensitive totally in appropriate treat that is my opinion and i think it was the opinion of all the people that fired him from his job this person was at the tapes of his career lost his job for saying something terrible and in retrospect was said something i do not know what i was thinking and dis guise a psychiatrist is that he lives in t in the study in the treatment of the mind it was just goes to show that everyone i think is susceptible to be impelled into these tunnels and fortunately everyone is susceptible to learning to teach themselves how to each themselves out of it i love this idea of a teachable skill ism certainly going a practice it in one on one and in group situations and and in variety of situations i i think that the tunnel is has a a gravitational pull as i can allure to that tunnel and that i always just go right back to the nor chemistry i think that there is something about solving a problem inside of a tunnel an animal on a chase but at some point that animal could get picked off by a run over by a truck because it was did not have enough situational awareness ism defiling in a practices through opening the gaze and broadening gaze and i think i also do for a a couple days off from things to just walk and think about work on these retreats do people work on work or they just there to do other things and that is where the ideas surface we will do a little bit of both we will do some stuff that is focastrong work but then will pull out and done things theatre completely unrelated to work to for that very reason whether we do something physical whether we do something some kind of a mental exercise but we do things that are completely unrelated to their work and and take those breaks in order for them to free their mind what bothers you out sophomedia this is will you say that there is some things that kind of make you man it mean not me but could of course of course human you know little things little things treatment it is not the things that are obvious is actually not direct critique of me it is am it is when people exploit misunderstandings to try and create a greater misunderstanding that does not exist that is what gets me cause to a scientist that is the most irritating thing i soft know what the analogy would be in the seal teams but it is some one his jacking something that they did not mean that but then they cold of this they distort the argument the word gasligting gets thrown around a lot now lot of be basally think that any time someone states a boundary now i do not believe that is that that that is gasping trust me tho psychiatric who were all professionally trying tell me that is not gaslight guess thing's a very particular thing were you ism trying to alter some one's reality in a very active almost sociopathic way am i just that is a editorializing right there what bothers me is when people a his jack am some time some one in a in an argument is not a sophisticated with their language o somebody else o some one will high jack that lack of sophistication and trying to flip them on their back that sort of thin no really gets under my skin because i feel that treated a unnecessary divide there a few other things but i i ways join my lab and all saying at an have three thousand series but i else have three thousand flaws to match each one of those hes ye i whenever ism in this is not just social media but it is just life what somebody says something about me your too me that i do not what i realized years ago is i the reason i do not is cause there is some truth in what they are saying and the best thing to do is to say either to yourself if you are by yourself or to them is to say yo you ye yet yen you are right i i am kind of a knocked sometimes or ye you are right i sometimes yo jumped a conclusion tor yet y you are right i was completely wrong about that and that is just much more liberated liberating and healthy then saying you n know what you are talking about or know i do not it just going into that defensive mode and and trying to close your mind and set o open your mind up to listen what somebody else has to say and a what is a good point i you are you are spot on without one next question next comrade let's go one thing i appreciated about you on social medias the the limited number of words in each of your respsthatit is a grating at for a sing you to be efficient and concise actually s is a huge advantage it also forces you to be precise at least about category you are right i thing there is there is something to be said for that well there is a good example i was on social on twitter the other day since twitters getting getting kind of getting a lot of gin a lot of a traction right now as lot of mayhem gone on tithe other had not it and somebody asked me somebody that ham going to boot camp soon what advice you have for me and i wrote back enjoy don't and you said i mean it is twitter ism responding to bunch of people and then somebody else chimed in and said you do not might is well not even answer jocko that is not helping the my at all ant look likely at your face because you do not watching your face just got a little bit mat right you got a little bit offensive for me well i think that is my nature i do not seeing other people sort attack an thing that is my night had a split sacking of who the hells is and i said you what he is right and then i treat it again back the us it is sorry man you are right what i should have said was hey read the book leadership tragedy in tactics it is a good book for some one that is going to be in an environment that is going o be challenging and we are going to be faced with leadership challenges and enjoy boot camp because if your mind said is this is socks and this is terrible you are it is going to be terrible and it is on to sock and if you go with a mind said of hey this is a cool experience and i should enjoy it your can have a much better time that is my full once sure ism striking to and it is perfectly fine that i was right to critique me and he was right in saying that and there as a much what is funny as i punch another people came to my defense i thingy that is really grand it but my point is instead of me getting defensive and crazy and letting it try me crazy open my mind a little bit listen what they have to say except that there is got to be some level of truth in it and there was i gave a guy a a very very nurse response and i could have expanded onto more and i did nobody real good times i a few minutes ago thinking myself wonder where your mind is that in the few moments before you fall asleep are you able to make yourself go mine blank i pretty easily it something have been practising more because i tend to again room and i to drill into proms obviously it yester did a sola episode which when we do those ere usually anywhere from five to twenty hours of grab and then the recordings i will not say how long they take but but i love going into the tunnel right the tunnel is the that is where the juice is for me and finding the structure and i have the benefit of amazing producer else me sort through it and but a kind lie came out o thing and then when home could not eat sos i soft want dinner and then us explaining a call i had with a colly the other day and yo mig i she mike coffin chose just like you i cay ism going to sleep and is up and like thing tasting thinking writing not own i thought a man li am costello chewing on the stick and lie they hewn into my pot i needn't i need sleep need to go to sleep i think have a a bit of a harder time disengaging clearly and ism this is why never touched locator infer of me because i think that some of us have a a love of the dopa mean circuitry that i always sense if i were to have tried drugs that that they might have been the the thing that would hit my marry circuits just right you are some do time but it'll call that way have read books by alcoholics the look dry and few other richroll talks about this that he drank it'll call for the first time in cause it was this a mixture that filled his body that made him feel right for the first time that is not how i feel after a couple of jingsthat it all o relaxed but i cad do without it but this drilling into something is really that is my i guess may be that is mi i do not think its the superpower but i have some some strength there but i think it is also the thing that cut that can cut on the other side you you started off this conversation early you talked about your getting up in the morning do you get up and you have these souls about to go down the path of it is at night time when ism trying to go to sleep and i have some random thought about some thing that that can be a hard for i have a a visual thing that is going on it seems like come on a solar coaster and ism going in a new idea comes in ism just on this assume ride and i get's nock an stop and i cannot i do not no how to stop that oh no i been i think it it goes with people who are very driven and and to master different crafts i have a colleague is name's cardie sprout the by engineer as five children and he is a psychatras he is an credit one these people i does a tan very likely will win the noble prize how he's an amazing scientists amazing i and he does this practice that he does is not a meditation which he sits for an hour late at night after his kids a gone to sleep and he forces himself forces himself to think in complete sentences with punctuation about some problem i tried doing that for about five minutes and and i fell off but it is a something that he is cultivated and himself which helps him in his career right i do not think that this certainly not something i recommend if i did that at one or two in the morning i know bad for my sleep because falling asleep ashes requires drifting into these kind of liminal states on other reasons why ism a big proponent of things non sleep deep least t or these yoga need practices which are basely body scans were you are trying to learn to detach from the sensory world and they're very effective it a it certainly for me they have been very effective at teaching me to have turn off thinking which is a interesting notion in its own right but i the idea of of detachment by stepping back and getting perspective my my father is much better at that he is a very calm guy and in the world of confrontation i always knew when ells a kid he would blank which ye went some was going a hap i was going to get it and now but have always does he can control his his responses his behavior others of us in the family the side from new jersey were more go to longer heads sit do not know this raise is a question i think it is a one that i and several other people i talk to hin anticipation is podcast were asking you mi think one reason why people are drawn to people who have ben in the seal teams and you in particular are that i think everybody not just males but females to i think everybody and wants to know there calibration point on their level of toughness i think people wonder you know i think when people talk about buds and all that i think a lot of peel wonder would i make it through i have certainly wondered at haven't spend hours on it i went my path ism happy for the path i went but i think people wonder do i have this thing that supposedly buds selects for and if i do not at how tough am i or not tough am i i think that we all can look at other peoplephysically and ism not somebody that does a lot of this i know some people are really obsess by this all that person hat an are not pack with a pains i do not understand that that is not me but i understand some people do that even to the point of mythology but i think most people wonder how resilient am i hand they can look to experiences that they have survived and say i made it through were i refilling tor not but is there a way that a we can i certainly that we can train it by doing hard things cold showers his kidding are small examples of those but d you think it is an even an important question to ask and if it is how does one go about thinking were wear it how resilient am should we put ourself into situations of discomfort just to test that as i will say i think a lot of people look to steal teams and tongues in particular as have a a a calibration point get they know how to do hard things at they were selected for the ability to carry logs and getting a cold water over and over and roll in the sand and go without sleep for a week or but that is probably not what they were doing when they were on deployments it is clearly a pressure last for something else yet it is a strange strange thing the basic underwater demolition seal training and quite frankly going and getting wet and cold and being miserable is is actually nothing a compared to being on deployment and a good example that i use to compare this to is a when i was on deployment and two thousand six in remove there was a as you were as you were driving off base to go to the city to go into the city an conduct operations as you drove out of the compound on your right was this area that was called the vehicle graveyard in the vehicle graveyard was exactly what it sounds it was probably seventy five or a hundred vehicles that were blown up destroyed burned am in serious twisted conditions that had been dragged back through the city and put into this vehicle graveyard and as you drove by that vehicle graveyard without question that every one of those twisted vehicles represented one to three for five america casualties wounded horribly wounded killed in there you are in vehicle about to roll out into that city where what you are looking at can easily be you in the next three minutes and your going to do that to day you can do that tomorrow you do that the next day in the day after that in the day after that that compared to and by the way this is not jobs seals that are doing that this is marines is the army guitar over there this is what every one is doing and they do it they do it yous i talk about market use one of my guys first seal killed in my reckon here was the lead turret gunner in the lead humpy and can fee it n om if you were the point man of yet noma your up l an infantry patrol you appointment of get of your at risk buy traps ambush they rotated you out you enough to stay up there all all the time you do an hour up with the as pointsman to get some one else up there and that guy the need turret gunner in the in a humpy column of four or five or six vehicles f you hit an mete that is the vehicle it is can hit it right if you could going an ambush that is the guys that is on to to hits the guy that is standing up in a fifty caliber turret that is the guys that is on to die and mark was it you not us a new go he is he is in that lead turret fifty cow and he never asked to get rotated out and ism his a very to say very he was extremely charismatic funny gregarious a commedient and you we got all kinds of stories about mark but one of em you a were in vagus and we are all gambling and i come down from my hotel room an i see mark across the across the he is playing back jack and we sees me eagles hay sir when or the new attacks coming out he is just lighten up everybody i just having a fantastic time but remember one night yo know he is getting ready to roll out and if i was not going out with thupletunes it'd let go out i o see the use off can my hand salute as they are leaving him i feeling o mi you do market good to go and he is feeling lucky sir that was his attitude and he is a guys gan ta dry by that vehicle graveyard drive right out on that city and he is can do the next day in the day after that on the day after that and and i said that is what the army guys are doing that what the rincorguis are doing they are doing it and as much as the mythology around basic seal training goes to me that is that that that experience combat and what guys do is infinitely harder and infill more important now all that being said base seal training as i sit is the is a very strange laboratory for human beings it is a very strange laboratory for human beings and it is aid h i it is it is kind of crazy the way it works it is very it is it is obviously extremely difficult but there is no o i would not put money you could put odds on somebody making it through hay that guy seems some be good to go but i would not put a bunch of money on it i and i would not take a hundred per cent i would not never take hon to present bat on anybody cause the is no one that is honor present going to make it trough that training and there is there is just brand m your some people see it is want it is cause your wife there is people that make it hour wheel training cause they're excel friend said they could not make it there is some other guy that makes it through because they promised god that they would make it there is some other guy that make it through because there dad said they con navy there is every one the examples toucan come up with and and it is good enough for some random do to make it through and it does not matter what your pedigree is does not matter where you are from there is guises from iota there is guises from florid there is guide from wherever that make it and there is guys from my when there is us from flora there's guys from wherever they do not make it guys from farms use from silver spoon in their mouth and you just cannot predict it and i i mean to has to have something to do with the fact that how bad you actually want do it that is it is it is a strange thing and i would not i would not try in you of i was in the world if i did not do that training i would not be trying to forgot if i could make were not cause you do not know you do not know the very strange thing and it is and it is mythical almost right now right it is mythical that how hard it is and is not too many people make it through man its fifteen per cent ye now you have from all the folks that have talk to there gone through been instructor's there some we both know i seem that that fifteen per cent number is unlikely to change as long as they keep the the process the same that just seems at about fifteen per cent people seem to have something in them that can perhaps grow during that training but that this it is being identified and select it for rather than somehow being built up across at least that face the early phases of training and then at some point they build on that capacity and this gets to this really somewhat controversial issue frankly are people wire differently and listen i started off in neural development and it'll tell you that there are some universal properties if of neural development in all surviving human that your going to breathe without having think about at your harts can be without having ta think about it but beyond that there is a lot of variation and natural levels of opening and ceremony and i there is nature plays a powerful role and nurture and what is interesting though as we cannot always predict from parents what nature is going to do recently we had soon on the podcast i n the side for you to listen to it if if i perhaps you will if i end it to you is a give talks about inheritable acquired traits you do not expect the because you work out that your grand kids will be more muscular and have better endurance but there is actually some evidence that that may be the case and you know how could that be we got two kinds of sells in your body it turns out you've what call sematic cells which are alveoli of the germ cells which are your sperm and your wife's eggs well why would not the dean of the sperm cells in the excels be modifiable by experience if all the other cells aren't it turns out there some evidence that name is not the dean but that the are in are think about that that means that whether and we known this that people that have been in a famine several generations later their implications for bloodshot of regulation in their great grand hits the idea that experience and acquired traits can change us as actually has some validity an no and and it and this gets into really complicate things tat be well this is the draft t head likes train it is neck and then get birth to longer lecture absence will not exactly but also not entirely untrue either i love the idea that there are inherited traits and that there are that nature and nurture play role but that hard work may actually transmit across generations the there is in seal training you have kid's that come through that that call legacies which means that they have a dad i think it i dad brother whatever and they do have a better chance of making it but it is not a guarantee chance at all an it great my personal piton is i think a legacy kid would have a better chance of ma it just do to the thanksgiving dinner that you are going to have to go through for the rest of your life if you do not yet if you are even invited which you might be on your own a but yet tit that there is may be there something through that as well but i think that is just more the the pressure that some one must feel hay there is no way ism going to be allowed back in my home if i do not make it through this training can have to jingo had and suck it up but not everyone makes it and i it is it is a bummer when that when that does occur well for people who are not thinking about going through seal training or who miss the opportunity or who are not interested in that for whatever reason do you think there is value to doing things each day that suck a little bit or from time time doing something that is you do not puts one end to a state of deliberate a discomfort under percent i mean under percent i mean even you in order to improve yourself you've got a you got a impose some discipliineself right if if you want to get stronger you have got a do things that require strength if you want a cutoff for you got a do things that require you to be tougher i think that is pretty straight port does that mean doing things that are not pleasurable for instance i you nave done some long podcast and a a few weeks ago idea a series we were doing a series o any galloping o all that exercise and exercisecise and we did six podcast in that we must have ever done which may doing for or five the next week not bad but i loved every second of it and i love every second of podcasting and it did not suck but it built up a greater capacity guess ism asking specifically about things that really feel a splinter is there any value to that i because i have to say there are some people i know some of them are former team g the art team guises he do not say forty mas it they were out they are out of the teams now but they are team is for ever who seem to not be rattled by little things those guys in particular they they do not seem to be rattle by little things then i know people that they they get the wrong sized coffee to cookshop and they dissolve into a puddle of feels there does seem to be something to this hull mental razilients thing and flexibility thing u and i i try and do something that is uncomfortable to me about once a week some the e really do not it does not matter what that is but i try and do something that sound unpleasant or do something in a way that is unpleasant guess the example getting into the cold water the first thing in the morning and making that decision from under the blanket's is a rough one for me but then it gets easier and then you wonder is it still serving the purpose that it is building me up should people seek truly bad experience is provided that they are done in a safe way i think that your going o just you would develop your legs by doing squats and you would develop yourvback by doing pullups i think you would develop your resiliency by doing repetitions of things that require you to be tougher that actualoquet good tit then the reason i ask is is because i thing a lot of you will think w i work out every day but i but then you prove them allowed we're but i love exercise and the well then that does not quite qualify as something that makes you tougher right or they think o the last raps of a set are really tough but if you love hitting failure on a set cause that is kind of what i seek in the him i love that aspect of the training that is i where i know ism getting better it no longer services resilient training it morris service as training n yes i think that the point is clear and appreciate your answer i have to ask about something this is can a seem a a total divergence but it is not which is animals because first of all they are a love of mine in terms of understanding the animal kingdom and placing humans into the animal kingdom second shall i know you are a hunter and also i know you own dogs and the question i have is do you ever look at people or did you ever work in teams of of guys when you are on active duty gave see that the difference is you now you mention before this persons really get a problems all in this persons a little bit more creative soever wonder whether not people of embody different on of animal archetypes that i do well that that thing where people say that dogs or owners look their dogs dogs win men your owners i think that is have seen all kinds of icyouan going inter at and find a bunch of examples of dogs that look their owners and owners that look their dogs i think that is true and i think ah you do not by my dogs are whom and do not tell me about you are dong wisnondogs my dogs a german shepherd is name is open and he is unalsome dog you lowlife am and she is got a personal guts o easy it got an interesting personality he does not to a cuddle right my kids we li go we does not to cuddle now even when we go to bed at night he goes to your four feet away from the foot of my bed even if miles hate jump up you eve told him jump up in here we want o pet you he will jump up in there and he just kind to goes in that low crouch position and then sort of waits until i say free dog and then he goes back down he goes for feet away from the foot the bed and sit there cause he is that is his that is his personality is two protect and sat security and do his job and and that is what he is and you known you have got other dogs that are you thither not it they are to till different minds that the have dogs have definite personalities and and look i also have ait it is not allgenetic two of my friends a got dogs that were brothers when they called do go argentines what is gas the others are hard to get in you ask there not and it it man not even be legal in the united states do not tell me o these people are not that i care but i layout where they are yet but these two guys and those two guys had different personalities b one guy is very happy lucky to smoke pot likes to hang out very just the chill kind o playful guy the other guys not hes the opposite in every category and they both got these dogs and you fast fort fast ford a year the dog that was owned by the playful guy his dog was just a big puppy lain a just wagon the tail the other dog you had to keep it in a cage or it would murder everything insight and and these dogs were brothers from the same litter and they were completely opposite and i think it has more lot more to do with with nurture then it does to do with nature but that being said when you look at when you look at souls i mean mouth have a personality that is very distinct compared to a german shepherd now look there is outlying mouths there is outlying german shepherds there is outlying what you name whatever kind of golden retriever whatever dog is known for being more playful you you get around the much moths a mouse are mouths and they are that w if you been around mouths before o oh o the begin you i a few of em that neighbor has one and that thing that is not terribly friendly but it is it is a security dogs i do not expect it to be dos them yet the there i know the they use him for work in the teams and have heard that you thought to keep a close i on your relationship with them because if you get lacks about it they will bite you the that true the first time i saw one a we were doing a a drill with using dogs for the first time into one of the team dog wanders came out and we hit this target building and t whether kind of debrief do a ha get this target building and this guides can be a runner o squirmer and and the we pull up in the homies satin jumps out ism kind of staying external con o con one see hit is can happen the squander goes running off and the dog handler whatever tracks his dog on this guy and then releases it gives him whatever commands how whatever the commands are that thing is boldly primed are not unlike anything you have ever seen your life it is just crime its tracking that guy he hits that release on that leash and that thing takes off at a thousand miles an hour it jumps ism not kitting fifteen feet maybe ten feet in the air away and just chomps on to this due to date goes down it was freaking all have seen sovidios was a malines i guess i did motor forgiving has before ton know your friendship but mouths mat a belgium mantis those dos running up tree jumping over little lo rivers out the it is crazy incredibly powerful animals ye well the idea that pep that they mimic their owners has me illicit concerning as my last dog had to put him down as my bull dog costs a bull dog mastiff i got him because i went to pick out a poppy basically and there ware aid of these bull dogs all them running around and then there is one in the background just eating out of all of their bowls and ills i on that one his bull dog biggest one in the litter laziest creature not is dog the laziest creature that ever existed but if you need to active eight he would he was just very efficient with his energy anyhow i do not think i have a bull dog personality and that is why gout to on balance me out i never retrieved never did anything a stole and destroyed every toy at every dog park in sandbag who is wont of famous there i had to bring five dollar bills to pay people for all the balls and things he would destroy and when my apologies told the dog owners not really i am miss him did you train your dog or did some hen else use i i it was he train to be a security dog or a count of family dog or it us con of a mixture you n i mean the true working dogs unless you unless you have the time and effort put in to him or you buy him that way a youyou do not you do not want one of those dogs that i were just describing in your house they are they are not for a house unless there is there is that level my dogs not that level a he is some did you apply some of the same a principles that you seen a leadership of humans with your dog ye there are a lot of similar principles but there is also there is there some differences there there there their pack animals right and they respond to you know tithe pack leader is tanto my my dog obeys me as if it is the command of god and my wife he is kind of maybe it'll do what you say the they kick up on thakatastov dogs are very intuitive i love this idea that i told early on that they can feel your emotions i think they actually can sense how we feel not just by the intonation of our voice but i hope some day some one will figure out in anonevasesive wake as on the idea of people doing experiments on dogs in invasive way don't what they are picking up on princes we know that sharks are paying attention to the amount of activity in the lateral line of fish at lot fish have these these stretches of her on they call the lateral line that allowed them to school andknow the distance to different things and be able steer round quarrel they feel proximity it be don't if you are turning going to and they can even recognize specific lateral line om signatures to be you and market walkingthe the through the dark but maybe people sift around e your you soft hae to look at that is mark you con's of learn him in to a fish can do that sharks can sense whether not the lateral line is is hut say bring but firing at of particular frequency to know oh that fish is a little bit slower than the rest i mean the you don't hunting animals just they develop these incredible senses and i think humans have some of these kind of senses and more rudimentary wave we are just not force to use them unless of course you are become a hunter of animals are a hunter of humans and you tap into these neral circuits that are very primitive and hard wired in everybody but of course they are honed in in m in warriors when i could spiral off into animal biology in a ways that i truly would take us twenty six hours i do not want to do that ism almost has notion to ask this question but i can at do it anyway many times on line you are asked whether or not you will run for office and i want to say that i hit is a true compliment i do not think people are asking just o find of entertain themselves i think that this country certainly in a lot of the world is desperate for certain kinds of leaders and people to have experience in risk his consequence chaotic situations and have shown prowess at leadership in multiple domains an you are certainly one of those individuals and they asked for that reason among others and have heard you give your answer you can repeat it again here but as a more broad theme that i think of people are interested in do you think it is an important criteria or it would be great to see people and positions of leadership who had wartime experience u and you think the a some of the shifts that we have seen in terms of m patterns of leadership over the last less just make it real broad that this is not eve relate to any particular person or stretch of of history but over the last less just say twenty five years ism reflective hat we have not seen a lot of that at least at the top tears of leadership you i think it be excellent if people made if the president had military experience for sure i think that then they understand the with the way the military works better ism they understand that each es civilians that control the military cause lot of times people at a civilians do not understand that this ens control the military a and i think that you do get to appreciate what war actually is and what the costs are i think that a you have have have seen in the same vain of people asking me to run for political office have heard you do not seen comment saying oh that is what we need another warm a a war monger in in office and it'll responded a few of those i think if there is any if there is any group of people that do not want war it is people that have seen it people that understand what the what the sacrifices are and i think that i think that being in the military people understand that better yet i think it be a great qualification i do not think it is mandatory mean clearly it is not withal a munch of presidents that have not ever served anything really were had a munch of presence that have not ever served anything but themselves am yet hopefully will get some more people that have some experience in the military some combat experience would be especially nice and till be good in my opinion well ism certainly not one to tell people what to do and ism certainly nothcan tell you what to do but should you ever choose to run i would certainly i be very enthusiastic about that and and i will just say that i with that stated a i hope people do hear what you j said i share that sentiment i people who have led others besides themselves i think is is the key statement there yet it'd look i just have i friends at er politicians and i really appreciate what they are doing and it looks miserable to me i do not i do not what i good for them ism happy that there in their trying to make a difference ism and and i guess this is me being selfish of meant look i don't think i could stomach that and i also think that you know right now ism you ism trying to help out for since were we have obviously got the leaders a consulting it facial on front which can to help businesses grow have got origin you essay were bringing manufacturing back to america we have got hundred four hundred four hundred fifty employs right now that are here in america working and growing that business a obviously supplement to everything that ism doing here right now is to e trying move the needle with with america bringing manufacturing back helping the economy as much as a can right now that is it is kind of one of doing right now an end my standard answer which you alluded to as if things got bad enough then i would i would do what i had to do but i do not think people appreciate my level of bad ism talking real a it is not there yet and hope we never will get there it'd it'd rather observe and hang you my friends and and hang l my family then do that and hopefully america can can fined some level of balance i think that is the problem that were having it now and a lot of these things that you talked about but specifically think you talk about a social medias not very good for political balance it is it is exactly horrible four political balance and a lot of it has to do with just a way that those conversations are had a lot it has to do withe ego as well because i do not every one who admit that ism wrong about anything and if if i can find something that i think you might be wrong about it is satisfying to my ego to just call you out on that thing and attack you and i think that is what a lot of people are doing right now now that being said also i also usually say this as well i travel around the countryall the time i work with companies of all sizes work with people in every different industry and there not they are not sitting round arguing with each other about what would the pot the political scenery they are talking about hey how can we grow business how can we take care of our workers how can we take care of our clients how can we take our our customer that is what people are focussed on and when you jump on social media yo you can get sucked in to the political scene very easily and that being said also we do have to pay attention because you you know we a citizens have to make sure that that america stays on the on the correct path within the guardrails of what this country is based on we you have to pay attention i but i will be doing my part as a civilian until there is total madam and chaos in the streets then it'll probably just be a benevolent dictator that takes over o be an interesting out hey ah you would be the man to lead under any conditions but thank you for stating your threshold ism certainly you ere in the right to make whatever decision is that you feels right for you and i want to say that i i agree i feel we are a country that still includes a ton of generators than the ton of projectors that our interesting projecting the good and growing the good i do believe both those pen types are important i also want end just say thank you for being a generator of much useful knowledge you in science we have a saying which is it is somebody is an end of one this is a rare thing to here about oneself or to hear about somebody because what it means is that somebody is in a category and which pretty much everything that they do and they say matters and serves a purpose which is a useful an important building purpose and i will look at you and tell you that you are an and of one you certainly would meet that criteria under any conditions and it is evident in the many companies that your running an the leadership that you are doing and also in your online presence a man that is how i initially came to learn about you am now fortunate to have an to lengthy conversations with you and a fou interspersed as well and and ism an think of myself as a reasonable to perhaps good observer of how people behave in different domains and every time you post or every

it is ashy about being really true to yourself that is how i thing about the puncroxperi is really about being true to yourself in realizing the the thing that you while it might be quite different is actually if that is you you have to live in that in that vain and unstick within it certainly served me well and sons i get served you well the most ad just one extend an enormous thank you ism you as a civilian thank you for the worth you did in the military but also teaching people about the military any lot people do not realize what it is about at any level and learning about your experience there in what you have observed bringing other people s experiences from the military more broadly is superimportant and sharing this and being able to entertain some of my unscientific reft thank you

a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in today's episode of the show if you prefer a beat version you can find that at our website this america life out o work her was is article that a comedy depside put out last year u see this one there is n city's first started going into lock down detain said nation's dogs effing loving whatever is going on right now apparently there was not every dog saran's dog taffy fifty pound box or me was kind of vigilant superprodective dog even before the pandemic and then once locked down started the problem was every one was ordering stuff on line and there were a million delivery people coming there was pedal u p s u s p s amazon all day long or my neighbors would be coming and going and the minute the i could not even hear a delivery trot coming up the street and already the dog jumped on a chair that was near my window was peering out just fully at attention ears pricked up that is when i are to see his anxiety camped up right he could not get any rest he could not calm down and thehause he was always barking and crawling and couldn't settle down the fact that learn was now home all day with him which plaza dogswould a been he greatest thing that a ever happened to them f taffy just made things lot words dogs him they need a break right they need a break from the vigilance to say i do not need to guard this person any more this persons out of the house ism chill that they need to not be on the job all the time and i think that he was on the job all the time that was the problem she took a new t behavior of a trenarian who told her the late dogs were going through this since the pandemic but saffron mess meat flavored prosaic he did not six the problem he got worse and worse on wake with suspicious of people which he had never been before he ran across the room and burst through the door to chase and by a pedal delivery man he landed end some one on the stairs of the building warn said of an appointment with the trainer who specialized an aggressive dogs and finally taffy attacked a little girl maybe eight or nine years old just burst through a lychgate to a community garden where dogs run off wish warn was guarding the dor to mature nobody entered while taffy was in there but he rush past er to get to the girl breaking through the gate and he girl fell out and the dog just got on do of her i my god terrifying i mean the dog probably weighed almost as much as the girl did and i mean my i was just devastated for the girl the girl was upset and crying a walked away limping warrant an experienced dog person she worked with three different trainers when she first got taffy to do with his aggressiveness towards other dogs but the fact that these attacks sits the pandemic were completely unprovoked and and people the fact that the mess were not working the taffy seemed perpetually agitated and just changed she thought about putting him down she boy she had no choice and i wrestled with those things an ts an excruciating decision to make have had dogs before that you have had have had to youthonize o us they are older there sick and you are putting them out of their mystery and this as a totally different experience because you are taking a perfectly healthy being that loves you more than anything that would do anything for you for yo an effect his trying to protect you right right an and trusts you but a completely unprovoked attack that there is there is there is nothing you can say about it there is no there is no way you can reason yourself out of what has to happen new if you go after a kid your don she is noted to put ray down it is truly the most heart breaking decision i have ever had to make in my life it is the anniversary of the first bovid case n then estates when you first heard of covet could you have imagined that it would touch you in this particular way that you would don't ta not having your dog there is no world in which i would think that this would be the logical outcome of covet that i would have to put my dog down that bovid would ever have any impact on my dreaming that you of of all f the possible probable outcomes of a globe pandemic my dog dying is not one that i could a ever imagined there is certain consequences of the pandemic tat we all know i were four hundred thousand america dead millions people out of work he's everywhere having these terrible school years was distant learning but there all these other ways the virus as altered and shaped or lives it is likely this woman windy and lion a brass by the thing it happened a few days after a dad dead of covet she is boning her many ten into the grave and realized aright my dad he isn't going to teach my son to drive i think it was i was just parking i think i was parking my own car and putting my hands on the keys and just thinking await the that is another thing that were good of miss now ears on garrison are a ad were really close an she's got good knowing that a dad was going t teach him to drive as garrisons really smart and funny but not everybody gets him and hear my dad really got each other and they could just hang out make funny jokes ask questions quiz each other a as it mat fact i was just looking i have there is a toy plastic soldier sitting own my desk e daddy open our surgery garrison brought a few of these little plastic green soldiers to his hospital room and said these will protect you why you are hospital great and my dad started staging battle seen from his h bed and here was can me me and clean and then he would text them sodas to my son say he arris look heres any way test the did of things the they would dustup each other any way driving not huge them just a small specific loss garrison six month first a another birth the at a driver's license which is a few weeks after her dad dive she as going to teach him now a well have to i suppose well take turns my husband and i cant we have not talk to that it any more though i din we know we all can know it is hanging there and in some ways am not moving on with it maybe his way of still and of that magical thinking out way we do not have to think about it another way even though we all know that is the reality sin he say this one thing to me they really caught me by surprise we ting about how since her dad died she is connected this whole community of people on wine if lost family members to covet and i asked her what people of sad has been helpful expecting her to say it is been company talked people have beenthrought you been through that kind of thing but the most important thing she is gotten from it i think some validation in that anger am when your surrounded bay still some denial people said the diseases n that serious year that masts do not really were after your father got six and he says cardileship were work on t one of his to workers at tested positive eight days before you are angry i t his employers absolutely and then you are angry at the government in general the way it was sandal the fact that we still have a functioning tell a vision in our house is probably a miracle because the number of times that i was ready to throw something and the occupant of the white house would talk about how this is no dead it is cut go away because we clearly knew that that was not true and after my dad got sick and then died ah i was just angry we we knew what we needed to do we could have done something in this country if you heard on job bidet talk about the empty chair ye it was actually the final to bay my dad date of death is october twentieth and the last to bate t was october twenty second and it'd heard that line have heard him music before and i i know am that is a part of kind of one of the things may be from the stump speech sort of doing am right it is one of the things he said a million times right he said it a million times and then ism shitty on the couch and he looks at the camera and he talks about it again after my dad died and truly felt oh right this is me ow this is my thanksgiving this is my christian this is my son sixteenth birthday and somehow even though i knew he would said that line hundreds of times before i tell he was looking through the tell a vision straight at me i felt he was looking at our whole family and i felt he was looking it all of us all of the other at the time you only two hundred thousand families just three months later of course the numbers doubled such a simple thing to acknowledge the lost that is all around us to day on a programmed wit the new president office one year after the first cordon of iris case was found at the united states it was in settle canary twenty first of last year the stories about some of the things that ad been lost this pass here things we do not usually think about is part of that empty chair don't you be easy chico it is this america life o mara glass stay with a one cops and robbers when you say exactly about what was lost two weeks ago on canary six when rioters stormed the capital building on reporter or manual felon watch that day out of all the footed ye saw one video stood out to him he mighthave seen this one it is of a single black officer we would all water find out is name he them good men and in the do he is backing up a staircase holding off a mob of rioters with a tiny telescope n a tom i gave a manual the idea he wanted to hear what the day was for black capital police officers e faced off with this mostly white mob a mob the cut up to the capital with confederate flags and other symbols of whites of primacy what did they think about what happened he eventually got a few of these officers on the found in the shared an inside er account that is really unlike anything we have heard from the capital far some of the experience of course was the same as white officers but as here some of it was very different he mnulput to gather this next story from an interview with one of those black officers capital police officers or job is to protect capital grounds and members of congress o because there not allowed to talk to rest we need to disguise this officers identity an we had an actor copy his voice as closely as possible how a quick wen in also this stray contains a racial say here is mantel the officer who ism calling officer ones was the person almost everyone told

black man you feel what the hell in the normal now it if the not tit it is what we got o do o prevent tit what happening it is and it y there is a long way somewhere a things we though on never have en in many of them have been loss struck off the list disappeared in the last year this was just going is the in my conversations with the officers e fort wick we were sings sure theroid of vows listen america but this but they could storm the capital the they could shorter er government that work to or banner manual them he writes about racon in equality for use news he take him with officer ones on inauguration day this week foster one said he was glad they w on o inaugurate the president that the rioters did not want to see inaugurated in public in their faces he said but when the actual they came he did not get to enjoyed himself he did not see any the speeches of the performances he was working on the east side the building far from the action the actor whose voice you heard saying officer one's words he is bank he nowt e see many up coming effect who serious the old man with jeffridges in john withgow coming out we share something with you that you need that is missing from your life that you may not even have noticed how much you need this that is in a minute chico love a radio when our program continues to smart in life my glass to day's programmed the empty chair wear stories about things that ad ben lost this past year things it seemed worse noting as we had into whatever new chapter is going to unfold this year we have arrived at at two of our programmed a too fifty shades of shade here is ut something els that we have all lost since a pandemic bothy it almost feels too small to mention but but really i think is pretty significant wracked commonly notices she is righter in onion our producer willie mulligan talk to her to understand why this thing race's missing matters much let start with a little story that two brothers e bank an we a coin frank can seen there slightly tifferentages frank is they older brother and he is kind of shorter or less let hunts seven the an consol brother but frank as and of worn carious charming in this knurly sunny guy they both our kind of attracted in different ways this happened to the beginning of the pandemic the brothers have moved back to their home town for lowdown in a kind of surreal second adolescence back with their parents social distance hanging with people that kind of known in high scold frank and stepped not the real names are in their early twenties they would spent the day drinking outside with some one they would grown up with and shes call bath and frank the the lest hansom book funny on he is always had a thing bath and he is kind of you know give ye meaning tostecus for years this night is gin t be our night and he said this to seven and i think this this is gone the night of mainly happens es the hey were drink he on day and frank just got drunk earn drunken darker and be as people a do to the they wont see something but tat once kind of me be responsible wo davit they will kindly faso he got by the and of to day her my crosses starring is words just so telling us in story of never again and is not end was ism just on do the nistthing here a just bring bring back frank she drank and does not liquors stepped tells bath ism going to be a good brother here he takes frank home and puts him to bed which is all very charitable in but once he had done this he ben runt back to bats his psyched back as well not eye walks and that is without pins ex sex sex is what happen next between bath and stepped the younger brother the more handsome the less funny brother who had not liked bath since childhood this is what we used to call gossip way conversation used to be for the pan daric to git away from us i found rather because she wrote an essay about how she suddenly in noticed its sons she put her finger on this thing that have been feeling to she wrote this was a year when everything happy need and nothing happen and i quickly got the word of talking about the news almost always bad ore asking people what they would been up to almost always nothing just is me calls with the same people to have essentially the same conversation which was what we don to say is like o verensi and that it would be wets going all an ever her o blink no thing actually really not really much all oh that is true though that moment you was new you nothingethe thing about this story rather does not even know these people ye ne not at all e she thinks she maybe met one of the brothers at a party once she just heard the story from a friend of hers he is the one who knows frank and stepped the best kind of gossip of course it is about people but she don't have the and she was hungry for it it turns out in a pinch are in a pens epic strangers will do you cannot sleep with the person your brother likes you just do you tin i o to i i i kind think is one of those drop things worth because some one so one's complice et you i mi to they even the work dislike i i i just o youyear i yer as li end ye rather and i are both living without kids or extended family we have not lost our jobs neither we nor loved ones got very sick i recognize how don our concerns are compared to what many people's lives have been but we both noticed a thing that over the course of the pandemic had kind of drifted away while we were not paying attention the ability to socialists a normal person talking it turns out is a muscle and when you do not use it much for months on end it can atrophy rather remembers the first time she went out to meet up with more than one person i it was actually the next day i felt i on maltha an or i done was extraordinary he job durance ho can it was just having conversation were than one person poor couple are it was a job like yo to have to really cion per saying i vocersonyoure body langrage have felt this also friends will get an touch and wont go for a while ism u snoods awkward it'll we yo after the pandemic is all that i do not want to see people there is just no fuel for conversation suffer before the pandemic is too well to talk about now what y supposed to talk about when there are no situations rather start doing this thing that i thought was pretty brilliant just and asking people kind gossip about any one and a kind of worked conversation was easier when you are talking about the tailor who lied about her husband's death to avoid an uncomfortable conversation about a missing shirt or the guy who hooped up with his room made and it did not work out and should he move now i could talk your ear off about a friend of mine whose face broke up with her during couples there a be remote couples there i be aoverizume how my friend watched your neon say down per from their laptop screen even though they were sitting side by side on their bed this kind of tot it was not exactly normal before but it was good enough thine pretty decent take meat take that story about the two brothers it delivers the thrill of being scandalize and that i rented little bond you feel when you handle up with some one and judge people together clearly the younger brother stepped was wrong the handsome sneak but also beth they brothers did you really have to do that but actually hold that thought there's wore and here is a rest of the story frank the funny one he did not know his brother had stepped it beth and about a week later he also sleeps with beth the crass she putties on back in eighth great he was really excited about i and the who siting with a group of friends we days after kind we know can boasting they would sing to have a locked on thing in the ye notice his finally happen a man one of these friends was i wat bit but stepped ism presenting you do ism frank's what an then he was broken to him by this almost o broken in front of a kind of gruff of people and then he had of how to row back and be life i was not i was not serious if i is i did not mean we would have a locked on thing which it is always is it is always mortifying when you have been talking earnest say aby something an then it is revealed that you did not have a piece of information the a the glue as lately frank called bath and told her the whole lock down thing was off he and his brother had a big falling out path was really sad because it turns out she actually liked frank bat the same way he liked her the thing with stepped was just a drunk how up frank was the real thing oh really she was we could have had a lock down thing yes she was the locked i things off cards but it should being thus show been we when an i show told him she is confiding all this in a friend who will call para wo then goes off and sleeps with frank even though beth had just told sea how much she liked him i ten everyone behaved does a human dolls which is everyone itself interested people do do things our of vengeance in spite that is just noble behave your at part of life and i think when we were discussing different chapters of the story one person would be totally appalled but the fact that some of cult you sing and li ya not i would e tat it'd cannot have been dreading this interview job i dead talking a any when these days i social skills a rest i worry that we would run out a things to talk about i had actually postponed our call for a week because of that tut it is really finished talk with you about this and ism an my got him totally paying attention ism following everything she is saying am relating i i operating see fly yo to as a human car that as a joke i under stood that it is ugjesi my jo was that the was it's very funny an i enjoyed i did enjoy it i realize it is one of the most fond conversation at had in months it is not about ship talking people it is about the ship talking itself and the fact that were doing it together i have not even told you the last part of the story that is matter her friend para for sleeping with a guise she tells us other friend saris a slit and then that other friend turns around and tells para that called ye a slit ye notice core old friend is limit well i not be come part of this i sh completely inserted herself into the tin o a she to me this is the worst is inserting yourself i this with no other li i she even sleep with anyone was she just was i i had to tell her a that she real the on you do people snit say always in of liaises everyone of there a ways thasently felt e let a and i principle compelled me a in stupe bi would not i would not wit thing but i felt i had to try i could actually see myself being the snitch in that situation she had the right o now it is her right i can hear myself doing that just inserting myself like the worst character in it a niacnostakes in it just leaving to be a stitches quiet i conversion thinker that me i her a what is a comedy being a just being to in be o person tell other people light i yours it again i batten is right who is wrong do be care be day we he sellotape this sad ever on ourself for you gossip and thoughts about gossip if i rather convoys essay that inspired this story and haslet was her firs came out is pretty delightful it is called the year in gossip tat three there is a german word for that when they thy we lost this pastures on tin big some the real took for granted i think something kind of frightening in its implications and that istle idea that we could come out of national election and agree that it was legit and agree on who one he rather on one side of this or the other either you think the man in the white house to day won the election fair and square a you do not to stated o clearly and unambiguously i and the producers of this radio program side with all the people out there who do not think the election was stolen in gouging apparently now former sent majority but ere mix my cell who said the people who believe otherwise were fed lies but right now millions of people believed that wrong guy is in the white house a third of all voters believe the was widespread fraud which is remarkable right back on nonmember herbalist in germany you'll and bidder was watching is unfold seeing the fate evidencethat was showing up under the hash tag stopped the steel reading the president tweets about supposed election fraud and for some reason what what is frank to my mind was than the memory else i the toy shall s againall the step in the beck it the stab in the blacksmith that a lean about in school more less every german would now the step in the bennies because it was such a potent o we thegerman history stop the steel is about losing an election the stab in the blacksmith is about losing an entire war namely word wore one but their parallels between the two eyes and the way they took hold herein settling the hi stay out goes this spastically here came a point in nineteen eighteen the united states had entered the war german suffered defeats is cured to everybody the german he was going to lose he fact navy sailors refused to head out to be killed on what they saw is suicide missions in a word that was doomed within germany lodes the population was against it and in nineteen eighteen the german surrendered german emperor visor wham the second abdicated the throw fled the country germany became a democracy for the first time but right a way starting in nineteen eighteen incidentally also at gobepandemac going on right then the nineteen eighteen fly fifty million died right then starting in nineteen eighteen right wing politicians and newspapers started pushing this lie the and of stay angry drumbeat of coverage swig that in fact the could have won the war if gets and social democrats and left us and state the country in the back by forcing germany to surrender you the creates off we stepson the weakness new that they were lying all the lenses o the loden off a woe like us supported the lassies they knew well that a the ollas lost was e lost cause after the smith begins one of tho thinks that you right is that there was no national consensus only reality yes on what had happened to this and it became impossible for a democracy to continue yes an that was quite true and their the disturbing effect of the step in the becomes was that it did not grow weaker but stronger over the was and you might have expected an that eventualliee people will see the trust am they will acknowledge the facts they will believe with aerialists and serves and historians tell them but and the contrary is true is i gan one of the big things that i took from noted that grand wrote about all this back in nonmember in the new york times that all this might not die off on its own i very well might stick around and growing power throughout the machine twenties the idea that certain german but to blame for the defeat for the bi loss was very selective and very atrectis and i would go far to say that tit have not been for the step in the backbites at the noises could have never been as successful as they were it was a central premise in fingers speeches and ideology an you bear yore diner is deeply aware of the differences between america to day and germany in the nineteen twenties he is not saying that we should aspect the rise of a new at off bickerer something that but he is saying hat when nineteen twenty's germany shows us is how effective and popular and alternate reality can be an a country this steeply polarize the other point along here lines that really has stayed with me and feels relevant to to day in america is that back in the twenties people who believe this mat the opponents is traitors is people who betrayed germany in this basic fundament away which tin justified anything that was done against them the the actual accusation am was that all the people responsible for the called step in the back were criminals an nonmember sabrecia nonmember criminals who sin the misses in nonmember to in eighteen the idea was that they were the ones who obstructed the legitimate course of history but when you say that it makes me think about the protesters at the capital who who feel the elections been stolen of course extreme measures are called for and elections been stolen from them that this is an interesting mansard is not it i mean we know it from people who are convince of the righteousness of their call that they believe that even violence is legitimates to thechieve their games it is more or less a terrorist monster or extremists sons of course they feel that they are the textual defenders of the true america e i i retreat an republicans which he spoke out against trump and against the of the steel company they know has to fearful their lives i saw that to the dead threats against republicans whooped to accept the election results a back in the twenties in germany the was violence starting with the german politician who negotiated their terms of surrender and were t were won he was murdered a man named a pious eritzburger one of his assassins from a first failed assassination attempt on on trial until the judge they did it was erczburgers stayed the country in the back in the judgeston where he got this idea he said the newspapers my present binds an office sign executive orders in talking about unity and trying to turn the page but all this big e did not lose a war ye don't lose an election on sic ground investor and grow if in we to be losing faith in the entire system of government fact germany stopped being a demo crazy by the thirties and can we do violence that for far twining they programs about losses that are on accounted for what of our producers to a drove wall is meting

children go every day a single dad says in a want my parents me come keep their jobs there is a programmed director his budget is about to be cut and he saying but i mean we cannot lay off hundreds of people in the mill an dead come on this is a lot of what the meeting was people talking about wither programs should not be cut e specially parents and kids the kid who has stuck with me many months later is a little boy he spoke i sitting up straight and stiff in a blue collared shirt clearly nervous i every one o my name is jolston tana a and om i sh one to say that at first he caught my eye because he seem little most kids speaking were tea nature he looks he could be nine or ten but when he spoke it was clear he is older an middle school he talks a kid who wants tho sound an adult and is eager for his vocabulary to catch up o draw my time there i got to no people and do engaging a chimneys with them and now i can call them my friend o he is king increasingly nervous maybe trying not to cry he cannot tell be can programrally helps people in a community that do not really heaven he were to go after school it helps it really helps with the om wit with the community and o sorry on second he turns off his camera and we all just wait looking at his black square is he coming back twenty seconds pass we love you jo o it is o hundred ye don is job love e men yo a he turns his camera back on and finishes ah i just wanted to say that and i just want to emphasize that it would be such a lost to hat some for cut that would o sort of o o to it it or om a wit om or growth in the community and it is om ten run o get was me half growth om again it would be such a lost to om many kids an you thinking about what is been lost in this past year have wondered about goal how scared he seemed of losing his after school programmed hows cared he seemed in that moment i wondered what was going on with him and if his program gas cut and what that twenty second silence was about last week i called him up introduced myself and asked him what was happening when you turned your camera off a i a you i r it it out ye ye re out ti i o beady a a her i a bait he'd t yo the outing that e that may a bi can a lie a e yo ye ha take it away joey told me he wrote out what he plan to say at the rally an advance he practised his comments practice summon different rooms and his apartment considered if he should print them no he should hold them in his hand no he should put them to the side job thought somehow if he said the right words in the exact right way the programmed would come bat he e a o o that i bet pit e i the think that we bi would be a e sure but i will hae that port li jell wanted that was committed to saving his after school programmed he cause there was a big thing that happened to him there something that was really big to him and is also really small his mam seritolo per refer gas says you have to understand who jell was before middle school there is ta reason jell speaks an adults he grew up around adults it was always him an his mam when he was little series used to take him to night school if she could not find child care when she went to law school they lived in the dorms together jell spent a at of time around a adults but with kids he just could not connect his mam tried sports programs jell was not a sports guide she got him together with her friends kids he would hang on her leg she thought maybe we meed to move r there let yo know servo thought made be somewhere more diverse maybe he just needs to feel more included hes a it before middle school they moved to queens i try to i the part with the to hid i go if i can goner half to pray with somebody here you would always o o life here could bi they we cig bring habit i cat e of pic o for a part i i word you do not i do lo you o ask you he would a pretty n he brick no bi a you have a part id e prink hat you don we would be i you a li your er nor you do not he be e bi ridedoi e began he go mam you do not earn you bard the o a be o e the a it i o e he said those words ye he would i bitter bat o for heard bi firkin your heir a rid ah then jell started middle school re to send him up for the after school programmed and that when something big happened for joey he made a friend too actually and after school names and richer and then locking home from after school one day joey met a kid named dance who as become his best friend jell told me that could easily have never happened the two of them crossing pas at the exact same time i i w want if o harder it the o ego e roblyat a a o a o er ye all have a have bull he says if dance went in just a middle a second sooner they would not have had a chance to meet and have a friendship and what would that have meant for you i yo i alga i do not know wo he we who bi a o e have we a a a r i could think that a i had a hi bat a i for a a to for oho e a all out roll said i men only child this was huge for him and after that he three himself into the world an a way he had never done before at lunch time he had a table a friends to sat with he send it for autography an after school he ran for president of the after school student council and he wont he saw a counter one day playing with devil sticks sort of juggling and joey begged his mom to get him some sorta told me he was obsessive about mastering it t was the first time she would seen him have a hobby jolt was suddenly enthusiastically responding to the people and opportunities and chance encounters around him his mastering the social aspect of being a kid and then the middle of seventh greed but the pandemic after school shut down it went before regular school closed and those first few weeks were jarring getting home early letting himself into the house unit did not be of wit id to a moral would you do with your time o a ai e we i at a felt i i but we a often a to o mi bet and i word it e ben bore or a old i that has not gone away jolsmom told me sometimes she still finds him lying on the bed no phone or book just staring at the ceiling wright when his world should have been getting bigger it is got in much smaller he goes from his bedroom to the living room to the kitchen he talks to his one i asked if he sees friends and on mine school n jet said ye that is not the same asked if he calls his best friend dance he says ye age ti ye i mud just thinking listening to you a a i know there is a lot of concern about learning lost kids missing out on the things that you would normally learn a middle school developing you are writing skills and learning algebra and geometry do you think there are things that are not a counted for on that list oo on on a wen i walk o client a li a o ta bi yah i really wit you get i no i the at not a countable it be a do not you a expectigor top than an no what a gigolo the social aspect ye an you had just gotten that yet o o there are the losses we know have been suffered by children this past year kid's of lost family members they have lost learning stability sometimes access to shoot there are the losses we know but what is it mean to lose your thirteenth year in the world what would have happened for joey in just one year he made a friend he learned how to make his way through a middle school cafeteria how to look around and say no not that table not there yes here this is the place for me he count his first hobby he learned he could ask his peers to vote for him and his ideas and they would what else might have happened no one ever says you are only thirty nine once but you really are only thirteen once joey finish seventh greet at home how probably finish its created home too and the next time he steps foot in a school building it will be to start high school he is never going back to middle school that is gone whoever he might have become that is gone to on a jury a is one of the juices of oho if you have not heard her pod cast ti wit parents that you made with

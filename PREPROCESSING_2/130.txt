we examine all legal angles regarding the regal prosecution against dona trump in georgia from clenches about to drop boy shell new revelationsabout voter fraud in georgia and the by administration seeks to avoid the law on the formative action i venture of this is venture so thedashosponser bag pressvepien do you your rub history being seen and sold to advertisers now neither get i frestypian right now express be piano come flashes already this ego prosecution in georgia is of course the headline of the moment it is also the largest legal barrier the donate trump faces going ford because it is a state level case which means that if he is convicted in the take of georgia he cannot pardon himself even were he to be elected president of the united states or even were a fellow republican to be elected presidents of the united states the turn governor of georgia bran keep does not have the power to unilaterally pardon dona trump estate charge hat has to go in front of some sort of pardon reviewboard to the bottom line is that dona trump is going to be slugging it out intort with fanny wills he is can to be joined by eighteen alleged to conspirators and today ore gang to go through in detail the indictment against dona trump and what it actually means as the lustra eternal point out the indictment in georgia against true for racketeering and does not other allege defense his represents the most ambitious and sweeping case brought up against the form president and is likely to posed on presidents at legal challenge as both for true but also for the prosecutors the case brought by fanny wills enters on allegations that trump along with eighteen others participated in a criminal enterprise to change the twenty twenty presidential election in his favor in violation of the states anti fracturing law that georgia law is monalton the nineteen seventy recon act that is the rackets your influence an corrupt organizations catch is really designed to go after the mafia georgia law is in some respects broader than the federal version regeorgia's ego statute allows the prosecutor to tell a lot of the story apparently according to for example when keys flaming formed to call county district attorney who as now at the law from feel piper which i the major affray wills is indictment is this long spoiling thing than encompasses donate trump's activities with relation to legislators and pennsylvania with relation to various members of his own administration with members of the d ogre with his lawyers the ninety eight page indictment is basically just an entire narrative story about dona trumps attempts to intervene in the twenty twenty election but it does not answer the key cuastione which is weather dona trump actually engage in what would be a criminal enterprise and that has an actual legal definition is where this was a criminal enterprise or not now's we say wills also faces some challenges here she says she wants a rialto within the next ex months that is very unlikely to happen very selection could drag on for month this likely go bypast the election more than that true could also seek to move the case to federal sort in pockmark memos is to conspirator a legs to conspirator in this particular case he is already attempting to remove this thing two federal sort basely saying this a federal charge why you charging this on the state level now trump did try to do that with his new york prosecution that was rejected on the grounds the trumplessn't carrying out his presidential duties with regard to elegy push money scheme but this is much more directly tied to his presidency and his unwillingness to leave it could this thing be removed to a federal court it is certainly could be and if that happens that i bigwig for trump because the would mean tat he can select from a broader jury pool one o the things that fanny wills is counting on here is that the judge presume we will not kick out her charges will talk about whether that will happen or not in just moment also she is counting on this being a sultan county jury as supposed to being a broader pool of counties that aren't included in the jury pool was to let us talk about the rackets your influence and corrupt organizations act it was really designed to go after themoff yet as i say it was designed for criminal enterprises now one of the reasons i think that fanny walls is charging this as supposed to say just the crime of conspiracy i conspiracies an actual crime you can charge some with come conspiracy to commit a crime f you and i we make a plan to go rob bank we are enough to get charged under redo we could just be charge wot the normal conspiracy statute tat is a criminal conspiracy because you and i are getting together to pursue a crime redo was written for the shadowy great area were they know that were kind of hanging out to gather but they're not really sure that i gave you an order or that i made an actual organized plan to go rob the bank they just n a lot of banks are getting rob and ism benefiting in some way and your benefiting in some way and some orders were given at some level this was always the trouble for themofya was the plausible den ability was the ability for the person the top of the food chain to say i never knew at that hit man was doing i never told the hetman what to do it just cannagat don how could you go after that i where they wrote the redo act in order to go after that gie the way they did that is that they said that you are not responsible only for crimes in with you are directly implicated in which there is a direct conspiracy youknow you and i getting together with the map with the gun and deciding to rob the bank down the street it that is not the only kind of crime he can be charged with now now you can be charged with the crime of anybody who is within your criminal enterprise what exactly is a criminal enterprise house that is to fine that is an enterprise design to do crime right's an enterprise group of people who have basically created bonds with one another that what an enterprise is and they do a wide variety of crimes that criminal pursuits is their business to when when you charged a mafioso with the redo violation we not charging with this specific murder you are charging with being part of the giant organization tat is responsible for a wide variety of crimes up to an including murder for example and then by proxy he is also included in those charges well what is this mean why we exactly is fanny will is doing this why is not just charging conspiracy well the reason is twofold one is not particularly clear that fanny wills actually has the hard evidence that downed trump told people i want you to overturn the election knowing that is false reft we to prove intend if i if the conspiracy to commit a crime yet have intend to do the sorts of crimes if to do the crimes willingly l that's always been big question for true as have been saying yous long as he is been under the legal gun establishing intent for trumps a very difficult business legally speaking because presumably you actually have to fine some sort of through line you have to believe that he does not believe the things he saying they'd actually lying about those thing and that is hard pigswill deniability does us for donaltrup what is you doing she is charging him with a regal violation why because in a regal violation the mafioso does not have to have specific intent to commit the crime he gets implicated just by being part of the generalized criminal organizations for example the do ja has run down on what exactly recon does here is what they say the government need not prove the defendant agreed with every other conspirator new all of the other conspirators or hat full knowledge of all the details of the conspiracy all the must be shown is that the defendant agreed to commit the substance of a concerning offense through a agreeing to participate in racketeering acts that he knew the general status of the conspiracy and tat he knew the conspiracy extended beyond his individual rule s that means that donaltrup would not have had to have specific intent to corruptly overturn the election knowing full well that the election had been decided against him and that that that actually goes away the intend as long as somebody in his orbit knew as long as run juliani knew as long as kidney plane as long as one f the to conspirators knew the dona trump had lost and then was pursuit this legal strategy if you consider it a criminal enterprise as the criminal enterprise then dona from could be implicated in those crimes without actually having to express the intent this is how fanny wills is attempting to end around the general requirements of criminal law you have to have intent to commit a crime in order to be held responsible for that crime now there is another promoter which will get to in just one second first company is looking out for you in the

america by america ugh fanny wills cant cannot really claim that he is part of a criminal enterprise tho come off yet lake is this croup of people a a off ye family that just dare to commit crimes e racketeering is an on going series of drives typically over a long period of time that is typically are you talking about rage for tong about alcohol hung about he is boot legging over many many years and then wolves shaking people down involves corruptly sending alcohol over state lines and over federal lines involves not mayor taxes involves at wide variety of offenses because is a criminal enterprise is dona trumpet sing pall criminal enterprise or should that theoretically really be charged on are conspiracy to commit a criminal act but then that raises the question of what exactly is the cry replace because dona true in say its not a criminal act for me to pursue a specious legal strategy i specious legal stradishe is not a criminal act that is free speech and this is wife any rules is charging it under redo and not under conspiracy again if the scheme was formulated in order keep him an office if the scheme itself was a crime should be charging conspiracy but she knows the scheme itself is in to crime since stay she is trying to charge it under redo claiming the entire kit and caboodle is a criminal enterprise she sort of doing in between she does not have to justify that crime actually was intended and she actually does not even have to establish that there is a criminal enterprise if she gets away with all of this it s it is a real discharge r the very least it is a big starch now the thing about a stretch charge this against the presidents of the united states is that once you break the glass the glass is now broken now let us be real about that ism not against the idea that presidents ex presidents pretty much anybody should be held should not beheld accountable for violation of the law the thing that really em against is the belief that a partisan prosecutor gets to decide who goes and who stayed one the big promise that we have in this country is that the only way that somebody gets indited is if that person is the political enemy of the people in power and this goes hallway back to for example barokabama or killer canton i said this about donate trumpet to grand o the class i documents two things con be tor once dona true pretty obviously violated class by document statutes they have not basically dead to rights on the charges an me he literally said tape folks legal advice never do the chiming notate he literally said onstage here a classified documents i could have unclassified that i did not he classified them you should look at them right m that is doing the crime on the take should he be prosecuted or not well in any normal circumstance the answer would be es sure why not of course if you come in a crime should be prosecuted for the crime the problem is once names come let killer canton off the hook for crimes at that point the answer becomes know and the answer becomes know because if only one side has to play by the rules then the rules are not rules that they are just a double standard they are just a weapon and the same thing is happening right here back in twenty fourteen she advocated for a full scale use of redcoat to go after politicians hes hit said listen but i would is actually widespread use of like to go after various criminal enterprises run by politicians i on in tire book the people verses barokobama in which i suggested that baracabama had very likely engaged in by fanny rules is definition redo violations take for example the irascandale the irascandal baracabmama and his minions went out in public and repeatedly said thatitwould be amazing if the tires daughter id and remove the tax exemption for pretty much every conservative group in america leading up to the twenty ton election and then the actually wen they did it and then the iris when did it and he said why never meant for them to do it well i mean again that looks very much the sort of mafioso activity redo was meant to stop in e first place now when i made this argument back in twenty fourteen the entire press that reviewed the books at this is crazy you could never do this how could you possibly suggest something this and my answer was what maybe if we finally started holding politicians accountable for the various criminal enterprises they would stop doing the chiming but the problem is this they ignore brokobama and then they ignored killer canton and their currently ignoring hunter bison and cordon by the way very solid case that the sort of recon violations that we are currently talking about with regards dona trump and election of twenty twenty those far better fit the criminal violations committed by hunter bison in mobile yours or it a criminal enterprise you r is look a recon criminal enterprise a family let us say they had a family an actual honest got family will come off a family a family family now them moffyor family start off nice family lets yo get a family family and that family sent a bag man to foreign countries to pick up cash on behalf of every relative of the vice president of the united states was e vice president was presiding over foreign policy in those countries i mean does the plausible deniability there sound sort of off yo situation when when jobidon was literally calling into hunter bison's business meetings and saying how is the weather over there does this do not exactly what a m off yo would do you get the dawn on the line and have the local bartender how is the weather down then then everybody knows pretty clearly that if the bartender does not pay off the of you then the place goes up in flames me at looks ala a recon violet and you yemen to talk out recon violations you find recon violations petty much anywhere and what i be kind of octet with that if this were even remotely evenly applied but it is not remotely even my applied it is only applied to donate trump only only only again if you on to have a set of rules tat apples to everybody evenly ism totally forbid but if the rules only apple to donate trump we can all see wat your doing well there onto get their wish the rules will be applied to everyone but not evenly in fully parson fashion there is a clip going round me an twenty fourteen talking about the bout that i mention t people for subarokobama here is what i had to say at the time about the use of recon togo after politicians i author recon inside washingtont i think that the certainly or suit something was don walking ans relativelyquan but but i if you look it that for shall be blue sh or if you look tat bell clansmen or i youloots o road dragon sir i mean the answer would be that that you could and and people should be wary i mean this is this is sort of the case that i making is that we have become comfortable with the executive branch of the government abusing at citizens and violating our rights and violating what there structure to do under the law the we have just become use to it and and if we start treating them as criminals may be the thing twice before they act criminally in the future but a notice what i say in that clip in that clip i say the could theoretically apply these sorts of legal violations to any present roam tong out yore shall be bush and on ligan both republicans and bill canton a democrat right ism talking about pretty much every president back in twenty fourteen including barokabama and the point that i making is if you'll evenly apply the law okay but guess what is happened no remote even application of the wall and here in lies the problem folks if your get to use recon to g after tonal trump you better damn well use it to go after pillory canton and that wood into foundation you better damn well use it to go after barokobama and broke boy is inbolvein wide variety of scandals under his tenure you better dwell use got their hunter and jo bide with look more a real violation that anything the dona trump is done here that is the point the all get it more in the sun just one second first simple fact into matter do not servals generals bad they taste terrible and the gods revenge on man but you need them you need them sadly because otherwise will not be healthy but this is where i rely on balance of nature balance of nature fruits and venues are great way to make sure thou are getting essential nutritional ingredients every single day the america hart association recommends forth five servings each of fruits and venues everythngle they that is a la of suits an veg's balance of nature can help you through balance of natures advanced culled back an process the fitments minerals and final nutrients of the fruit an vegetables are preserved seen get that vital nutrition in every capital balance of natures a wholeflu supreme with no additives fillers extracts enthetic passivizes or attic sugar the only thing in those capitals is pure fruits and venues balance of nature see to bunch their pro down to the studio for mi them to try everybody loves them have been taking them their covers i can use them myself as really excited to find out as i say that it was certify id cover i could use them it is made me feel a lot better given the fact that's not getting enough sleep and my kits are sick all the time but balance of nature dot commit use primal coach pure for thirty five per cents off your first order as they preferred customer that is balance of nature dot come from cool sure poor for thirty five percents off your first prefer order but waste the absolutely uneven states of these sorts of prosecutions it will not stand what will en of happening is there will be motivated re publican prosecutors who do bring when real violations against job and hunter baton for example a therneuse to be is the prosecutor with courage in a local jurisdiction to do this that is all that really needs to happen here and a friendly jury a wet now we can play the came all day long because they broke the glass the case that thy are making against me and all admit that it was a least case is once you break the glass and every one i be prosecute case out mane is fine let us do it but here is the problence you've done it get ready get ready because this is whirring to by and there will be a downside affective because it is not in fact ta non partisan d o jay even handed applying wall we now have a bunch of local dead all over the country deciding tat they want o get their name on the on paper n that's way got fanny wills in georgia a doing this anis way yet the prosecutor plan brag up in manhattan doing this people want their name in the paper they can expect this on all side one of the predictable results of this is the people who have families people who have a sense of shame people do not wish to see their lives at dug through are simply in a stairway from politics that is the natural natural effect of all this is that the best will not going to politics any more no be people who are pretty much willing to slug it out in court every sing we they because that is what it is going to take from here on in ism not sure the democrat's understand the the can of worms they have now open if therein sang for a long time the dona trump he is not normal it is just the bat normal use presidents of the united states anis behavior is not normal and i will not be the first admit that i think the dona trump has behaved in ways the are not typically associated with t word presidential but in terms of the behavior that he is rally being indicted for the notion the it is unprecedented for a presidents of the united states to engage in order line criminal activity in regal violating ways that obviously is not try and dona trump is not an exception in this way and he will not be treated as one for very long if re publicans have the wits about them and it may be the we have now entered the air of mutually sure destruction the only way to go back to something resembling normal is to absolutely go up against for example hunter in jobidon and not just pursues something impeachment but trust criminal indictment in some sort of state law against hunter in golden in exactly the same way that that local georgia recon violation is being pursued i i promise you there is something there with regard to the widens that looks a lot more a mafioso family than anything that dona trump did with rude juliani at the for seasons gardening store or something i a meanwhile dona trump is that responding to all f this pledging that he is going to give an irrefutable report on georgia election fought now i assume that the reason t he is doing this in terms of law n i do not know these the thing to his lawyers dona trumps not famous for listening to his lawyers he tens to buckram pretty often as have said before one of the hardestrops in america is being done trumps lawyer but i son one of the reasons the trump is doing this is to re establish that he legitimately believes that he won the twenty twenty election and that georgia was stolen from him because if he can establish that he did not have intend commit a crime he distend intend to for example actually upholds his rights that takes way the intent part of the crime now as i mention before if any willing may be intending to can v go a round tat by charging him with a regal violation with that said trump's best defense here in terms of the actual crime of all this to say i never had the requisite intent is just me pursuing a legal strategy all you think is specious but i thought was worth while betas it was apparent tome that i was being jobs he put out a a truth in which he said quote a large complex detail but irrefutable report on the presidential election fraud which took place in georgia is almost complete and will pe presented by me that a major news conference at eleven a m on money of next week in bedmanster new jersey they send the results of this conclusive report all chargers should be dropped against me another there will be a complete exoneration they never went after those that rigged the election they only went after those that fought to find the rigors again as i say i actually think to smart in terms of o pure legal strategy i think there is a reason the dona true is is doing that by in camp the governor of georgia he immediately responded by saying abatis this bullyrag he immediately said the twenty twenty election an gorge was not stolen for nearly three years now any one with evidence afraid has failed to come forward under oath an prove anything in a sort of law he says our elections in georgia are secure accessible and fire and will continue to be as long as ism governor the future or countries at taken twenty twenty four and that must be our focus again what trump is doing here i think has very little to do with whether or not the rest fraud n georgia and a lot to do with establishing that he did not hae intended violate the law he had intend to upholds his rights under the law but an unjust one second will get to the actual formation of of trumps o rest there is question us whether he will even get bale at this point first very tired of feeling in comfortable in your underwhearand lounge where especially during

case the formation of this situation for trump are are really troubling obviously there is serious caution ow as whether dona's trump is actually going to get bad according to certain attorneys gorge's legals provision on bail could act poses delemup ford the judge the cause georgia basically says that dome you are not allowed to release somebody on bad who may then pose a risk of intimidating witnesses or otherwise obstructing the administration of justice if a judge were to fine that donate trump could theoretically tamper with witnesses or that he call up his to conspirators or anything that or for judge finds that him treating things out insert of voted messages to witnesses could amount to some formal witness tampering there is a possibility that some state judge wants to get his name on the map or her name on the map couldtheoretically deny bales true which would be utterly insane mean totally i cannot imagine that is he the s in go but i mean we are in unimaginable place right now meanwhile they have army announced in the sort house in full and county that donate trump is going to and up having to a do a mug shop which is pretty absurd his typical among shot is done in order to establish the identity of the criminal i don't people on who trumpets i guest of a feeling there a few people what who understand who he is es only the most famous person on planet earth for my entire lifetime here is trumps to turning lamenting the we understanding hes got o surrender by the twenty fit the the debates on the twenty third what is the play i you suranderckin well surround her it thing thing that there is in o a bet o it are not go char happening in tor a were the than that that tin a worse tan have a on hat the purpose of the lug shot ins wing in tons reckon a the want thin tears the flight e o this e man is the must fan e per tan in the world the leptin cabin at right she is right about that obviously but everything as on sideways many times here that its hard to tell what scan o happen next meanwhile tiller blindness still out there making the rounds does matter the hilriclin foundation was complete sham does not matter the hilreclin in billion probably got away with taking bribes in order to pay o of pardons said killer could win her senate race in new york in two thousand the matter that killer engaged in full shall destruction of classified information non that matters she is out there still laughing and this is the reason why the indictments against trump could both be somewhat well predicated particular in e classified document scandal and also are completely removed from the reality of her modernity politics in which democrats apparently get off scout fore law republicans are the only ones who find themselves prosecuted here is salary laughing about all this all over the country right now people are wonder and what pillar atom can a sea lasing things annals an jornsat she is the apartment one at o ta eating of ta hereto from the a con secretary state ta li she has a new essay out in the adlansec on the well being of america an our democracy it is called the weapon as station of loneliness madam secretary fancy meeting a i a an we ate sh o this i no the sircumtanes an meiectin to medackingdal nor me rat she it is always good to talk to but on sly on i did not think that it would be under these circumstances yet another sat up in fitments o man could she possibly be any happier about this obviously very sad for the country she is obviously very deeply disturbed in sadden by whats happening or shes justshortlling at you and of the rest of america because she got away with it she is the one who got away with it and this is the lady who after true to on died own the classified document stuff put out a tweet of herself wearing a hap tits ad butter meals this is who hilly witness then you wonder why republicans are ullfiere past about the double standard you want y som in y republicans including people me who ant even in n even handed administration of justice looking something this and we say this is not even handed administration of justice or anything mostly it meanwhile you have legal experts an amid an be see claiming that race is going to be a central component in drums child trial which is just insane to say i mean by e way that is totally crazy is supposed to be about whether donate trumpet attempted to deny people the right to not or some such what in the world is this have to do with race but here's a gorge state university professor an miricseegall explaining that actually race is going to be the central component here with that many dependence do you think that that every one on that list is god bwana e play hard ball prosecutors or how likely is at this somewhat would want a cut a deal i thinks extremely likely that there is going to be a do cut and i want to make one more point if i may unlike the other cases race is going to play a central role in this case in all kinds of ways we all know donate trumpets probably a little more sensitive to back women than y is to other people and a are the soon county very pool is going to be largely african america if its says here i do think there is an undercurrent of race in this case especially given the is georgia that is going to make a little different than the other three cases i do expect some of those witnesses to turn and to testify against the press at race is can be a central component my go do just saying the apart out loud right there in my goodness this again it is it is much of this is politics now speaking of politics one of bit questions here is whether re publicans are going to nominate trump in themiddle of all this again i understand the emotional nejurc reach whishes nominate him just to say screw you to these people but you may be given them exactly what they want if join gets reelected i said on yesterday show i do not see one soda of data that president drums legal troubles are hurting a or hurting hemin a primary or that they are helping him in a general and that seems to be what the day to show right now true is a record high lee in the grope primary poles adoring five third gets national pulling average o the primary true has a near record high advantage of thirty eight point seven per cent over flora governor rontissantis that is out from a lead of fifteen to twenty points in late march but his favorability rating has been falling steadily after his second indictment in terms of favorability rating after the indictment on the hush money charges according to five thirty eight drums net favorability which is his favorability rating minus is on favorability rating rose point seven per centare points among republicans in the next couple of weeks his tune indictment was different story in the owes after that his not favorability rating fell from fifty seven point one per sent positive to fifty five point they per cent positive and his not favorability ring mong all it ends fell from eleven point nine per centare points negative back down almost fifteen per centare points negative it may be worse when i comes to the general election imagine in entire election cycle run entirely optional trump in all low jobidon to to run the campaign he wants he go back to that basemen in rehobloth beech delftware he just sit there by the way if you think that jobidon is going to debate donna from ye another thing coming it is never going to happen it is never ever going to happen number one he has the precedent of true nottobating inside their publican party number too he is just going to say i do not debate people are under criminal indictment that is all his on to say and the major can go right along with it that is how that is con or he is just gong to say ism not going to bate somebody who is in insurrectionist against the country now you and i will know that is munchocrap but will the america people know that and if there is no debate then how exactly does nounal from slap jobidon particularly hard is this serious problem what this realize amounts to i would betel dollars to donuts what you are going to see actually here is aside from true strengthening in the primaries in the towing twenty four race you're going see more support going to third party cans areca juniors a orca junior far has run a pretty smart race honestly bike he is going to alternative media he is saying things that nobody else will say not just about the axing as ben of course all sorts of coverage of his vain communion and what he says about cove n all the rest but areca junior has taken pretty heterodox positions on a wive piety tissues and he is been going after jo by non inflation out let us feu real about this the vast majority of america can much more about their pocket books and about the fact they'paying hundreds of dollars more per month every month now thanks to jobidon then they do about any of the legal foibles that are currently taken place in fulfil county trump is not talking bout that is tax cause he cannot how could h you understand at me us being indited every counting the united states apparently can bring n indictment against trump but meanwhile our f junior is going after biding on inflation which is what normal candidates would be doing these days there is no money for poor america and the people that i see are living because of the inflation because of what is happening at this with this desperation the average wage in this country his now five thousand dollars last lest and the cost of i of basic goods of food transportation and housing half of america or making up that cap i putting it on their credit card bills and this week we past one point one trillion dollars in creditor at that the first time in has re most of the or three hundred thirty million that has been in the by the trumpet ministration two man were saying i an i ism helping america the truly non crew car tat and most people are pain twenty two see percent interest if the moffyad did that in would be called loansharking he is totally right about this bat's more important is he is talking bat an issue that when is last time you hard a candidate talk tat inflation join sin in talk about is he's doing it but down trump its in talking about it because he is busy and on basis has not easy been talking about it or if he has as been obscured by the fact that down trump has ben invited the entire conversation for the two mane parties is not about the thing the most america hereabout which means there actually is a lane not for our f junior become president but for our junior to take away a are significant percentage of the vote a solidthird party candidate right now could easily take ten percentetot on the a third party candidate can win on thinking he third party candidate take thirty per cent of the not but could you see a third party candidate drastic three per cent of re publicans three per cent of democrats and for per sentimental i do not see why not and then the selection really is up in the air despite everything else that is going on again our f a is the only person who talking about issues right now that thing most america are concerned about i thing they should be concerned about the demonization of the justice system but i also think the down trump istle most politicized figure of our lifetime baron most america again and i think rightly our con corn more about how they put dinner on the table then the are concern about fanny wills and the details of the recon act again just one second we will get to the fact that creditor delinquencies are jumping first let us talk about the fact that ask the economy begins to waver as the chines economy prepares to go down central banks and countries like china india and australia our transitioning to signal currency and the federal reserve is contemplating the same for the united states with the digital currency the government can tract every single purchase you make officials could even prohibit you from purchasing certain protest or easily frees or sees part or all of your

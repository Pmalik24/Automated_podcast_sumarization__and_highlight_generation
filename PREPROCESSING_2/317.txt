welcome to the he bermanlaconcan us science science was toe far i manderhuberman and ism a professor neurobiology and opthomology at stamford' school of medicine my guest to day is avid goggles avid organs is a retired navy seal who served in iran and afganistine he is also a highly accomplished ultramarithon runner for those of you that do not know ultramarithons are distances longer than twenty six miles and in davit's case often longer than two hundred miles for his achievements and athletics he has been inducted into the international sports hull of fame he also held a jinnis world record for the most pullups completed in twenty four hours i should mention that not only was avid a decorated navy seal but he also graduated from army rangers school avid is also a highly successful writer having authored two books the first entitled cannot hurt me and the second entitled never finished both of which are best sellers davit's books cover many topics including his autobiographical description of what can only be described as and incredibly challenging child and young adulthood his home was abusive his school environment was abusive he essentially had no positive resources directed his way and in his twenties he found himself to be obis that is more than three hundred pounds working a job he despise for minimal pay and it was at that point that avid began an inner dialogue that forced him to explore the demon's borne out of his childhood but also the position that he found himself in as a young man and then began the journey to navigate that dialogue and transform himself into the navy seal the ultramarithon runner the best selling author and the extraordinarily positive and influential man that he is to day a see of you may know avid has done various public lectures he is a familiar face on line because there many eclipse of him on you tube and he has done podcast before however ism certain that you will find to day's discussion to be very different than previous podcast that avid has been future on the reason is that of course we get into his accomplishments we talk about the mine set that allowed him to achieve those things but to day avid really lets us under the hood he lets us into the form of inner dialogue that he has to embrace indeed that he has to grapple with on a daily basis sometimes multiple times throughout the day and night in order to impose the sort of self discipline that he is well known for we also get into some of the scientific mechanisms underlying will power and we talk about davit's current endeavors that include for instance his own exploration of science and medicine for which he has become and intense scholar and practitioner i should mention that multiple times throughout to day's discussion you will here curse words now avid ad i both acknowledge that cursing is not for everybody and that cursing itself is different than pursing at somebody none the less we do realize that many people parents perhaps especially might not want to hear pursing if you do not want to hear cursor well then this podcast episode is probably not for you however if you are comfortable with pursing or if you can tolerate it i assure you to day's discussion is highly worth while before we begin it'd emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching n restart roll at stamford it is however part of my desire effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and signs related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thankthe sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is make new venison more knew venison is the most neutrino dense and delicious red meat available have spoken before on this podcast and there is general consensus that most people should strive to consume approximately one gram of proline per pound of bodyweight now when one tries to do that it is important to maximize the quality of that proline an take to the carry ratio because you do not want to consume an excess of calories when trying to get that one gram of proline per pound of bodyweight more knew venison has an extremely high quality proline to carry ratio it makes getting that one gram of proline propound of bodyweight extremely easy it is also delicious personally i the ground venison i l the venison stakes and then for convenience when ism on the road i the jersey the jersey is a very high proline to carry ratio it has as much as ten grams of proline our jersey stick and has something only fifty five calorie again making a very easy to get enough proline without consuming excess calories if you would to try make knew venison can go to make knew venison doccam slash superman to get twenty per cent off your proud order again that is make knew venison dock cam slash superman to get twenty per cent off to day's episode is also brought to us by arrow press aero press is similar to a french press for making coffee but is in fact a much better way to make coffee i first learned about aero press well over ten years ago and have been using one ever since aero press was developed by allay adder who was an engineer at stamford and i knew of allay because he had also built the called probe frisky which i believe at one time perhaps still now held the finish book of world's records for furthest throne object and i used to see allay believe or not at park surround palowalto testing out different probe frisky he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different feats of engineering that turned into commercial products now i love coffee ism somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day usually about ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes after i wake up in the morning although not always sometimes if ism going to exercise it'll drink coffee first thing in the morning but i love love love coffee and what have personally found is that by using the aero press i can make the best possible taste in cup of coffee i do not know what exactly it is in the aero press that allows the same beings to be prepared into a cup of coffee the o taste that much better as compared to any other form of brewing that coffee even the traditional french press the are press is extremely easy to use and it is extremely calm pat in fact i take it with me whenever i travel and i use it on the road in hotels even on plans it'll disses for some hot water and all brew my coffee the right there on the plan if you would to try grow press you can go to aero press do all slash supermen that is eight e r o p r e s as doc cam slash supermen to get twenty per cent off any aero press coffee maker aero press ships anywhere in the u ss a canada and over sixty other countries around the world again that is aero press do calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off to day's episode is also brought to us by eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity have spoken many times before in this pod cast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now a see component of getting a great night sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees one of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriate times at the beginning and throughout and at the end of your night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that is what eight sleep allows you to do it allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energies i been sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover for almost three years now and it has dramatically improve the quality of my sleep if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep do calm slash supermen to get a hundred fifty dollars off their pod three mattress cover eight sleep currently ships in the u ss a canada u k select countries in the u and australia again that is eight sleep do cam slash supermen and now for my discussion with avid noggins davit yogins welcome a man yo see you give great to see you it was last twenty sixteen early twenty seventeen i believe when you are in my lab at stamford yes sir i we dial work later that that day down it is sin of ay and gosh see you everywhere but it is not enough great to her few vat mix e you embody discipline and doing hard things right think yo start right off with tat the that's go there the but but right before we went hop mikes right we were talking about learning right right now your spending some time learning and doing things that i think most people probably do not typically associate davit organs wright once you tell us about that well mot you will just look it me as the a tat runs and yells as he is running and that's a i i do that notes mort of eight people but pubes understand that my day is broken up into signets i work out at e i sleep by been most of my time studying ism in the medical world ism no paramedic in a in am canada but i spend a lot of my time trying to not every single thing about it because ism not trying to just be a paramedic learn about pains and arteries and how the heart pumps andstelp that ism trying to learn to the point where i can say some was life and even though paramedics are doing that all over the world ism trying to be that paramedic that can really direct exactly was going on and fer grout what medication goes where just trying to didn't know this trim leonine you'll the the algorithm up was going on have been what time with it i love the word algorithm because when i teach biology your trying to learn anything that is relate to biology and specially the human body i need know the nouns but it is the verbs that matter and that is really what you are talking about that just saying that that sits there that brain part there does not tell you how it all works together no what is your process for studying look like can we drop day a eh a camera the room but i microphone into that into your in her dialog right gosh would not when we all love that but if we drop to microphone in your inner dologare you waking up looking at the books and going yet fresh day let's learn or is some of the same resistance that you have talked about coming up around physical work is that coming up from time to time i i was nervous hat first i mat keep the mother on ism keep a real ism i real ism not a rule smargui and when i mean by that is was born entity adiasty aught i my brain can not retain information ism not some genetic frequent t comes to running when it comes to lifting ways ism i a absolutely the boy of the barrel and people well never believe me and they can just n to whatever believe what you want to believe we asking is question about what the study and look for me i have to go over the same page over and over and over and over again while geniphrik and look at that page while she is quizzing me she will learn it right than as she is killing on anything about it she will quits herself or quiz me and learn it as shes quizzing me it is the most flustering thing in the world how my brain works what i w i do as i merely sit there with the pin and paper and i have my books and i go through have to write everything down every single day i will study the same pain till it is photographic memory from writing the same thing down and then from there it'll go back through and we learned again it'll learn the bulk of it but then it'll go through and learn the small things with in that it is the medication it'll learn with the medication does it'll first it'll learn how to even say the medication because these medications don't it'll peter all not is this this very big words ill go through learn how to say the name then ill go through learn what the dose is then it'll go through in this every seeing go daysnot o i got it let us is go through not nothing as i got it every single thing is i i cannot wait to get this conversation as everything i do in life it is sucks everything i do in life is sucks that is why when i was three hundred pounds and twenty four years old it one has some big a puffy of he's just go be a navy seal lest loose some way no i knew my entire life was going to be a struggle whish is why i just ignored it i said ism not even trying to jump off into this shit and learn how to read how to write how to memories how to become something i am not but through that process some happen to me and i real i that this why i full sorry for no one and this podcast they are going to really not me because people are going to think that i am maybe lying or maybe fibrin or exaggerating no i am little i was the lowest form on earth no talent no ability to learn and i legally know what it is to be rock bottom and to build that up that question about learning is a pain in my ass and i do not have to do it thing about ism forty minors on i a man him lemonade i do not have to do anything sol i thought about n i was drawn up is man i cannot wait to one day get the point were i no longer have to do this stuff but wit happens i got over it became a way of living how i do every day is how i do every day it is a it is a discipline is regiment is tad it is said it was a choice i made and the choice i may was what a you willing to sacrifice and whutda you willing to give up to find every bit of who you wars human being and was going to give everything too that studying is no joke i love that your studying i recall a few years ago i heard ah something enter view er podcast o you and you just throughout i do not know what it'll do next maybe it'll be a scientists unit and i went yet i was cause i knew cause i know you a bit right i see your work out there but we would met before that if you decided that you were going to do it right and learning medicine which is wat you are doing right learning human physiology is detailed merry an people a out there have to understand when you look at attackspookin you see the the veins in the capillaries different colors in the when the bodies open there not different colors i in i a not i i mean somethings i have different color contrast but it is not it is all labelled when you profit o exactly and the process of writing things down by hand as it for if you dose you go back and read those notes do you think about that stuff on your runs two or you segmenting your day when you are done studying or you had not out for a run and thinking about other things or are you still rehearsing the material on your head when i write it down i write it down and ism able to ism ax you looking down at this table right now cause ism back to rite and ism any there bun has not speaking to you i write it down in away that ism memorizing pay sixty nine ism write it down then write it down in that pay sink together in my brain ism looking at the book in my brain in now that is how works for me and i have to do over and over against for that page its stuck my mind s ism surely flipping through pages as ism taking these tests own taking these national tests to become a paramedic or become a advance then you whatever ism curly as ism taking that test ism going through an i now's flipping pays in my head to what i pace was and how i do that is jest from how i how i write it and how as on the page when i run i cannot recall any of it i cannot i cannot bring any of that because ism running how my mind is wire now is that everything i do is whale i do because the focus it takes for me to it now ism running ism not a great runner ism not injury free my first twenty minutes of the run ism limping ism literally limping because have had several ne surgeries and my body was twisted and now was untwisting people looking of look i he is simple limping when you runs i i limping when i run m body jacked up s ism focusing on how you get the best have a broken body everything i do is a total focus som when ism doing at the at that point in my simple you really trained away or somehow gotten away from the d d then mention because what you describe as the deep trench run of the shaped branch i mi i are not there's a talebearing as i and it can only go forward in that trench right or back and it goes forward if it is not sliding round at the concave at the bottle right a tension is you train that up is there a similar feeling when you are in the full focus of running versus full focus of studying as it can feel o yet that is the same grove but different thing or is it just completely different world is it complete different world t is just both them for me is is suffering but suffering whole different way when i was going through school i never forget i think i was in third grate and back ten it d it h t in young here is his medicine o hear this thing they when it put you in a special school for me i was far behind and learning that the big thing was let us just put him in a special school because he will never learn and through that process of i do not want to be in a special school i do not want to be treat it an he differently it really that i never took medication have never taken medication for this that is all right now you see me looking right in your eyes what the hell is is no istruemen same right out and that is why do not feel bad for people who have mighty nasty who have learned disabilities an some are impossible because you jest cannot well lot of em you can and but people do not want to go through the process of focus of teaching yourself how to truly focus this is where my messes is lost bet gest lost as i may say i f or of no i may because that is the passion that comes out on because that is it takes every thing for me to learn a sentence when i speak about davit yogins i cannot speak about avid yogis in he way that is just common school because when i wake up i know the journey that takes for me to find my greatness and it is hard every nothing is easy nothing just all i wake up an i just do this i do that or at just now i with people every day go through life and is easy for me to be where i mat to day it takes every bit of me when i speak about it anas i get going here you will start seen me the temple will rise the passion will come out because ism back there ism doing what i do every day to become a human me and nothing is easy running is running its sucks but you have a choice to make do you want to sit down an go back to that guy you once were no this o what it takes this it it takes that is understanding of people and they will never we because they've never avid goes that is what it takes for me to do what i do o may take you sorting differently for me everything has to be in the study an they has to being to this ear nest me in everywhere i am has to be there me focus rim that is what you are my second polkas i does is rogue as the book came out i do not have time for that shit because if i want to be great ism not trying to maxim is money or maxim is people known me i do these things because may be some one out there we will understand me and get it and say i can grow from this guy and others just will not sounds i friction is something you are very familiar with i just this a word just a yo as i yes cast above us right now and yell's face high lighted underline letters is reckon is groriction yes your your up in the morning and i imagine davit going's going o the coffee maker stretching ow good morning sunshine and you are telling me from i lids open there is friction yes and that is the thing that people know don't fucking git the biggest misunderstand about avid got us of all time it is whether you believe in got er not i do he put this lab rat which is me on this planet its to let me fucking see would it beat up abused kid who has who can barely learn barely learn who have a twisted body messed up setup genetics sickle sell this in that let me give him everything the are us this qualifies you from the military the back then it would not extras in in s put him in this and see what comes out of it to do that friction you do not wake up in the morning time and go to coffin maker my fact sometimes when you sleep what it requires it is when i met two ofclockin is two o'clock in the morning and my brainiest thing about a fucking drug and i get a get up an look in my book to see that drug is but how i remember it and this is every day of my fucking lie that is for my train a fighter or i train commit you have no fucking i now great you really are because you are using such minimal minimal of which you have and if people can learn to focus this is was possible while it may not be pretty people will not do dock minor on me i go no i want you dock me on me because i will have normal every day people picking me apart on his life is miserable who wants to live that he looks is crazy how he most he sick he psychotic the most firstranything a work for me its when normal people judge a man myself in would it really takes to extract greatness from nothing it takes every bit of who you are if you choose that rout if you do not merry christian do what you got o do but yet all these things for me ti i tong o we idea keeper real i don't ism not coming here to talk about perform without purpose cause i go through an i write these books i go through try due down avid goes how can i give normal people and ism normal but i found some that most do not wantifid how can i speak to people and give them something from this crazy psychotic brain that have developed how can i give him that i sit down a gender for years an right down performithout purpose lawless your mine armor your mine the cooky jar the account o sillier shit that people can fuck in use in their lives no no ism glad it helps you but the barbaric life that i live that you have to live the almost obsession that you must have to be great you cannot put that shit o fuck in bookgrowl you cannot put a book u cannot you cannot write about it has to be experience has to be experienced and you cannot even after you experience it to write it in ta book it would seem hes to be locked up this eyot too gory is this too gory to make sense for go that everything every sick in the day he is trying to extract more from something he is constantly think he is constant constantly discipline never going off the path wolver is injured on i he figures away it is a conqueror's mind set and very few people of any it can really understand what that is at a ism almost fifty and have been this way for almost thirty years we do for fun you you never these questions i do not i do not get i i do not understand him i do not ye i get ask that sometimes when you for finest listing off all the self podcast in reading i working o i but some of that resinates but i think what is truly unusual about what your describing your process is that from go it is hard yet and i have to ask was being three hundred pounds having a sent ism using the word to you have described doit you have said it before you had a tendency at one on your life early on tell lies trying get peoples approve i y scoff crazy hair cuts and tension seeking and and yet all of that triggered something that now is yours extraordinary right do you think those hardships we are necessary to flip the switch i will knot there er necessary but it was something that made me feel i don't feel good it was easy the brain that i was given as a child it was easy to go home and think about what how don i want to be a free to day how do on my up to school to day and be a free it didn't require me going home and open a book up safe scold take me all year to learn the fucking page instead of learn that page it'll learn how to become a character and maybe that character that i created that three hundred pound insecure good that used to fake fake oud ti make it to got let me a become your friend let me li to you inti you me type a guy when wen you have any kind of any manhood womanhood a human been a soulless spirit any i had no i i must have just this m oh pride cause that is exactly wit open the door for me cause every day you were cart everyday you were a clown every day you open that spans look or that science broker english brooking you you look at is it looked a foreign language and your sent a word or i start when who do i star and obviously was necessary then who i talk about it was necessary cause would happened is i became haunted by the mere fact that this is my existence an you got a live with that i look at the for lota years it is i tat back a said o gay i i know it the ten and when you sit back it's fucked up as i was and i had a laundry list a a table this of what i have to do to become jest a human been that can make ins me that can make a

god i to day that haunting it is sup that still there to day because no matter how much you improve an my how much you change who you a it is not permanent you us wake up an say oh my god man you your avid hogans yo break records you do this you do that people know how were you how were you able to jest be her i never turn to fucking thing off us once it turns off i go right back to the avid

set on shall me dead elsewhere pod cast and utter now especially it is amazing to me and frankly it pulls in my heart strings a little bit i realize as not where you are trying to do but that in the course of your childhood and in our young adulthood that no one ever got between you and the world i forget where i heard it that if a kid has just one person that believes in them you anyone i had my trials in tribulations but i had great coaches great letterers i attached to them i found them if they did not a early find me but ism realizing that your situation was no one's ever said he immune stand here next to you or get in front o you put a shield up and it is almost you have got these different her it is all you but there is versions of yourself that you knew coo media i do not know that i have the hear with all in twenty thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen to get in front of myself while doing all this cause have already got much going on in here is that about right that is right but had developed a lot of anger i still had it and weld never go away for the normal human beings this world because when you put yourself in the seer i was in and please it is some one save

you to inspiration video not this be all your voice and way ah you are not in listening to your top ten favorite songs just to get rolling and then lace the shoes at the books you it is calling here on there i used to do that when i was fat rocky an me for azoth that tot's my thing i round fourteen wit my thing and as i got over an over an order that started to go away and i started to create it'd all these people that i used to watch rocky was one barns he lies from pe tune ism jack from a few good men you now he's on the stand going crazy i saw all these characters that i look tat nous man i isn't got none o that but they were characters after a while i lived a life disciplined the everybody that i once look to these fate characters i i i built was a man and when i ways younger i have this image in my mind of hook does a man look to me and i got all these people who were bad asses characters and in my mind i be came that and that is what kept me going a lot was i had this pipe dream of becoming a footle bit of this look bit of that can we have no parents rain you and you have no roll models growing up you it is not day dreaming you start to create reality that maybe i can be that and after be coming this guy that is the biggest thing i can never do in my life as i became that guy that i once looked always guys now look at myself go who the fuck can do that i can but when it takes is a the discipline that no one can ever even they ti this do not they do not understand it they do not understand everybody to billies do it but they is do not want to you man keep asking questions and keep going to seminars and the greatness is right in you n why once the gan say is a million times here i do not feel sorry for you i won not sugar coat but ism going to say to you because all of whet ism saying is the truth everybody now its the true this t what it looks and it too it to this i if if you are not got not the i hate the tilt what it looks is ugly its it doctor miners not waste bell special you are not a wash a ha mad its go wast this noise a goths looks a train rocks a night midst looks this god got no fellows hard work looks horrible is not motive eating it's not for vain at all are not rocky round forte we us nock down to go that dis to polo creed t looks a man being stuck in a fucking dungeon and there is no rockaway out but you had the fucking key but you refuse to use it and that is not motive eating about that yes no doctor me on davit goners the real life the raglans is that is the documentary it is all it is already being written you are it right out ism a share a little narrow science did bit tho what i think it is one that you will appreciate ism most people do not know this but there is a brain structure called the anterior mid singular quarter as we point out before that is a now it is a name it does not mean anything we call it the the cooky monster right but what is interesting about this brain area is there now a lot o data in humans not some out study showing that when people do something they do not want to do add three hours of exercise per day or per weak or when people who are trying to die and lose weight resist eating something right when people do anything that they and this is the important part that they do not want to do right it is not about adding more work it is about adding more work that you do not want to do yes this brain area gets bigger now here is what is especially interesting about this brain area to me and by the way ism only learning this recently because it is new data but there is a lot of it the anterior mid singular quarter it is smaller an ones people it gets bigger when they die it it is larger in athletes it is especially large were grows larger in people that see themselves as challenged and overcome some challenge right and in people that live a very long time this area keeps it size in many ways scientists are trying to think of the after amid singular quarter not just as one of the seats of will power right but perhaps actually the seat of the will to live power talking and when i learned about the after amid singular quarter i was almost out of my seat and i been in the narrow science game since i was twenty not of the same age and i was pump as have heard of the ligula er forefront of quarter its planning and action i could tell you every brain area and every i teaching or anatomy to medical students but when i started seeing the date on the after amid singular quartan i was wo this is interesting and all the data point to the fact that we can build this area up but that as quickly as we build it up if we do not continue to investing things that are hard for us that we do not want to do that is the part that feels got and ask we me that we do not want to do an if you love the ice bath yet i love the spend you go from one minute to ten minutes guess what your after amidsingular quarter did not grow but if you hate the cold water if your afraid of drowning and you get into water and put your head under then your after maids and survive then the after amid singular quarter gets bigger but if you do not do it the next day or if you do it the next day and you enjoy it cause e i did it yesterday who happy me merry christian is was every christian gets what the after amid singular quarter shrinks again to me this is one of the most important discoveries that nail science has ever made because it is that i do not want to do something but do it anyway is r that grows this area and it is almost ay have a friend he is been sober thirty years from alcohol and you always says the amazing thing about a diction is there is a cure the promise it only works one day at a time and sell you after renew it every day i the anger amid singular quarter to me when i learned about it to two things went off in my head wo this is superinteresting and two i got tell avid hogans about this and i waited until no to tell you because i felt i well for obvious reasons i want to tell you hen i want to tell you here well i love that because that is you've lived my entire life i no anything about that but people go mar you have such a strong will it is summer that you built i i never lotus on a poco one time and its do got you were blessed the strong mine like how you tom boys bless with a strong mine you that is semen that you have to develop do you built that over years decades of suffering an going back into the suffer that is why a lot people who graduate navy still train the were no i it my i talk about very openly all time a lot o gods do not go youon't do on go back into that water than went o go back into the hard stuff it may be not stay anything hard anything hard in life will not you get through it is like you become a peel dub i ho per days won about the pub you camp none when some suck bad in life this is a n its they were talking about now very few people when to go back they are happy they graduated i realized ism the same way i do not want to go back i have to go back i must go back because that is exactly where all the knowledge of my life exists was back there an with your exactly you talking about why i now thing about this but how i grew a will was constantly doing these things to now it is just life i wake up while still sucks is just life you don't sit back in li go my a i i have days i do not we do by known wen to do it i know from years of just doing it i that that is that beautiful this is why i came on here with you you day and ism ism glad you are talking about this because human beings need to hear this then ye stop hearing these hacks on this and that is no fucking hack brow there is no fucking hack yet you may this an that in son is in the all the shit that they at is great there is no fucking life hack to grow that thing how do you grow it do it and do it and do it an do it that is the hack the jacket go fucking suck and that is what i realized that is i realized life that is why want to come on here day ow do o come on here top o no fucking washin in purpose and how to get the fuck out o bed how it a fucking alarm clock all this catch frame bull shit because that was not how i lived to ho i lived i lived i woke up at every human being does and goes fuck man ism a fucking piece o ship to day hell the hell just go work out for me and you fight that an you fight that you'n't over ride it to over ride button it is the conversation in your fucking hin your head how you do that we don't have enough these conversations about the real conversation that every human being is having and they have no idea to get out but they do is that ship right there man you i build you will how you build you will exactly what you said man exactly what you said well i feel knowing the name of something after amid singular quarter does not fundamentally change us but one thing i about biology is that will power if somebody feels they do not have it i feels the thing that other people have but everybody unless their brain damaged a whole right through their head has too after amid singular quart one on each side of their brain every one has one they have to i feel it is just ta question of opening the portal and the portal what i again i bsintisay ten times can forgive me s i think people go oh i do hard things i do sets to failure and then i do firetraps i love training with weights i love doing sets to failure i even firetraps but guess what i firetraps i it'll tell you they do not build my asteroid singular tartar i cause i to do insight anything you to do is not an enhance this aspect of will power and it seem obvious once you hear it you kind go why of course but i think you really close that loop for people when you share what you are sharing to day and what you shared elsewhere before is well when you are trying t explained the friction is the critical ingredient right and i think people think all if it is effort well then ism getting better that is part of it necessary but not sufficient as i say in sine but the suck part the haunt feet being haunted the stick they're really unpleasant terms very it is by the most unpleasant terms we have ever used on this podcast e those are the those of the levers those are the gears and without those this thing you are talking about avid noggins as a verb right i it'd sometimes make the joke but it is not a joke right dogging is a name and it is a verb people got money yogins that right right but that is i think then ism not psychallojust bi think that is what you are talking about the stick the friction being haunted it is the suck part that grows this anteramid singular qartux now why there is many people have fail in this world the figure out they are purpose there purpose in life wore to i go because to grow that why you may not look me how my daily life looks it do not look fun do not look in is a choice that people have to make in life but hate funny about it is even the richest of rich whoever everything there always ask me this question i feel i missing something don't i missing shit it'll have which you all have but you never in my life hear me tell you ism missing something everybody is they are missing this feeling i found it long time ago i found it right there and that well power thing when you are nothing nothing ant change yourself into something me you call it happiness peace or the fuck you when o call it people are missing exactly what went on with dayfirgogins will not you smile i do i do but figure something out that is why i never you never hear me say i is in something give found it years ago you find it in the suck you finding this suck and you find it repeatedly in the suck to the point were exactly who you are most people a missing something because they do not know who they are they never examine themselves they they have never done this experiment on themselves the labret we are all brats but you also the scientist you create your own self most people are mirin some cause i much tracks in there i when y sing us a potential i think that is for yous out too much to there is much in you that god or of the help you believe in or if you are atheist in you that you have not ununlox hat you walk around this gorgeous wife or your great husband all this money got i a missing some od because it is bout seventy five present of you it still fucking in there still chained up because you just did not want to find your will power didn't when a find your soul your will your heart you determination your guts your courage wit that looks it looks scary your will scared lab wen in scary to make up every day and say ism stupid by one finger out away to be smarter first i say man is cannot do that you limit this box your box becomes small of things you can do my box waning a box it was a fucking lie lit pinhole and then tho examine in myself getting some will power some courage it became big in this table but that is what we all do us why one to come here to day and talk you bout real shit not no fucking hacks there is no hack pro is you against you you against you and if you misunderstand that you've a real problem you real pop i can understand you misunderstand you run on a street short off for does need i can i can get it i get it if you misunderstand the same right now to day the problem is you and you do not want to fix it wit the children of wealthy people are a case study in how not having enough friction can destroy a life truetayment e men i don't list off prominent names in the press but those are actually the least interesting what is probably more interesting as an example is all the ones we do not hereabout cause we never hereabout em right they just dwindle and whither or i think there is this big category of people ism realizing as we have this conversation today that they are not super successful they are not struggling they are successful enough than they never have to that you can get to the point where you do not have to impose friction you even said it r your bank account is in a place where you do not really need to do all the things you do probably not even a small fraction of you not right but you realize the stick in being haunted is the o the fuel in the engine right and you be it you be truly crazy to give that up because you you internalized all that right but most people they are they are good enough tenor them and they do not actually want be better badly enough in order to it start going wrung after wrung you do not think about when you build will power and think about hi must have built now that about this this i don't know bouts but think about must have built everything have ever done in my life i did not wanted to everything every day ism a lazy piece of shit and i want the arrest work people t us the for plan earth and ism saying that very probably cause i know what i do no cocky it'll tell yon stupid and i also tell you the exact opposite of what have don it is the truth it is the truth main how much have developed in that time for but this the scathing why most people do not want to do that it build that will power if coucals this care it unlocks the whole bunch of things about who you are who we're not and i lop wo l do not want to go down that journey to discover who they are who they are not cause it is is not of pretty journey ism have gone down it is not i went down at once i go down it all the tine and when you unlocked that and you cannot the turned off ut you'll say i yo how how can you have not retired yet have built all this will power do you think its to let me just retire because my my my niece hurt it is telling me every morning i wake up my man to my need hurt mouth my legs hurt my body hurts but you get to run why are not you run if you gas still run they will be a time when you cannot lace them up any more but you can still run is to run when the time comes i cannot run the body will say you jest cannot run but if i can still do something that will power that i have created it makes me do it every fucked day and that is what they do not get whit builds a human being if you start with the small building blocks and before it man you become something you it cause he make sense to most people because it is just who you are now that is why i can still run at fifty broke afore i we broke down eyes and broke down body because my body knows you still cannot therefore i do second you stop the will power's gone and that is beautiful ism glad you brought that to me because always wonder what is the separation thing now at twenty four years old i tart dizens up t i do even know wit going to be it is not for it not and that is all it was was this that this structure after amid singular quarter has i in puts and outputs from a bunch et places but you pro not be surprised to learn that it is strongly activated when we move our body when we do not want to move our body i feel it it is li you davit got it is the truer right it real it is and it also has strong connections to the opening reward pathway and everyone goes yea opening what ever i loves opening ism partially responsible for people knowing a bit more about doping but dopamine badly understood everything its dopemindopeming hits its about reward it is about motivation and drive and there are pain in puts to the doping centers of the brain no one talks about that everyone all you want the chocolate chocolate sex scene or yet that is all true right you released opening pain release is opening that enter amid singular quarter can trigger the release of opening in response to the thing that we are calling friction and that is a learned thing that is something that no animal or human being comes into the world learning we all are averse to pain and pleasure sugar fat do not hot surfaces right but this is a structure that learns it has negro plasticity the ability to change throughout the entire life seen and here is the part that i think again is is just narrow nerd speak for what you already know and have done and exemplify is that it people say oh has plasticity you can change it begets what has elicit plates in both directions it can grow but just as easily as it can grow it is silly puny it can shrink right it requires constant up keep right and that answer is not one that people are get alike know they give me the energy drain give me the supplement give me the yes give me the son o photo call that can a make my enter amid singular quarters that some one out there right now as going weight if i took transtranual magnetic stimulation and our stimuli ye you probably actually they've done that they stuck a lo wire during your surgery into this structure this actually discovered by a a colleague of mine jo harvest stimulate and the patients go i feel there is a storm coming and they go always it scarringthey go know i want to go through it they come off the stimulation and people alike this is the sea of what we are talking about right exactly and it learns the fact that you have kept this brain structure ism convinced if we image your brain be large and it would be larger in two years a year but this is the noways off rational cause it can grow and it can shrink i know whats your saying my now i did not know in this and i never always taught t i wish i could just put this on papering and your saying it in a way that people can understand i can never put in the words on what id built and the power that is within all of us but you put it in t in a scientific way most people for me he is us crazy it is what it talking about it man i know ism not crazy i know what i had to do to get where i had to go people look it as craze because your people that just if you cannot imagine yourself doing something if you cannot imagine yourself doing some the person has doing its craze because in your mind the logic behind it it does not compute therefore you to to give somebody a title n the title for me as usually he is crazy has this he's that no no for some reason me one to be om by a fucking bad in my life i created that n i been try o figure out years of my life trying to explain to you but even though your explain it now this is the easy fucking part them listening to this ship is h easy fucking part the part that why they're always be the ones of ones it is because put in that practice put put that in to actual work no man no no that is where the demons come in that is where you i the i i do not want to be better i do not wonder bat this to it takes me better i do not want to be better everybody's that is why was a lot of average and it makes me fucking mad every day i walk this earth and i see average all over the fucking place and they want to ask me how did you do it i cannot tell you how could you not going to fucking you not could do it an i could do it you could kind you you are going to continue bin out cause every day you wake up he says like get the coffee make that make the pancakes kiss the girl kiss the kids you wake up right to work immedyt your mind is in action do not must do that no one now not blame em but do not be mad an you laying there in your fucking bed and your in the fucking hospital n your seventy eighty nine years on you thinking if i don fucking do som cause you did you did not do it isn't you said you madly the great life man but your always you feel emptyinside i do not feel empty con which you want there is not one empty bone in my fucking body because

where they felt they were capable of something and now they are not and you cant want just graveling a weight that was you then it is you now and but people tend to think about how the conditions that we are a round success must have been pard of it and you can understand why it is i it is very rational i was in that situation on a successful ism in this situation ism not that was the pass this is the present up go capable right you see how people get into these loops and is you mention you spend the first twenty years o your life in a extremely challenge circumstances and then you can see how

message we will see what he does it is only far last thirteen years that is been no movement but have had other friends who a who're drugging it'll call attics who quit after one conversation never went back is alsethem the mes the they want it yet just it e one one guy i will not out em but walked up to me at a party in to nay nineteen jury fourth party and said a ism a pile and i go when he goes on a pile look at me on sixty pounds over weight i go t you drink he goes every day i go how much he goes a case he as i smoke a lot a weed but he is successful another airs of his life ans i said we hearts what i know quit it'll call weed for you you on to tollhim people wat to do do not eat until two p m get on a exercise bike and peddle in the morning one's chasing you with a poison dart till you want a puke and is kind a half joking right and then a two months later he is i have not had drink i lost thirty pounds he lost the sixty pounds he never went back now he is hes superfix it is amazing let some people flip the switch he is very self critical by nature that is whit please super self critically up that's what cliffs the switch ye think about it man we know what to do we do not need any superman to tell us what to do we know whit to do every one of us that is why he flipped is fast cause he knew what to do he did not go by your exact photo call he did not go by the exact no he knew exactly what to do and you dis saying some sit to him it woke up up be new it to do and that is the thing that people needn't get that what to do why'd you down it and ism talking bout myself now sunn those modes of just kind a passive consumption there easy to wash over us i yous to have this thing and ism fighting this now because i knew we were now this conversation o day where i to start things on the hour the half hour rid worst practice in the world for me because if i miss that half hour mi a it is twelve thirty three it'll start at twelve forty five right ah it is twelve forty five it'll start at one i just lost him right and then and bishops is stupid right and the other day i was in i got to tell avid about this cause my new thing is i start no matter what time it is right if i wake up in the mill the night i got a friend my paints in the mill the night you in saw m ya he is wont know i just do it then sometimes he goes back to sleep sometimes he does not at one's got there a thing but i thought about this on mike ism no more i i gin to say ism starting at one cause i i know me i if i miss the one o'clock ding right and o my pens not hitting the paper or not typing on the keyboard i can do it it that that is a self admitted weakness i love it man i i had that for lot a years i ism know in what to o it that is the haunting part is that i is going to happen it has to happen and that is the fact i her know good o journey carry not i that is a life i do not know i don't i do not have that ability or i have the ability i do not have yum ism not good enough smart enough ism not talented enough to do that some people are soebonyg be o tart at one somebody not to start all if you lack talent you cannot sit back and say i start half an hour i cannot do that i got start now and after i get back from starting i gassed art again an mi get down with that run or that studies lesson if we won't good not i or go back again cause repetition is with is is what taught me everything you can honestly out work anything but it is that you obviously are very talented man we i have worked hold at certain things and built up somethings that have been good at most of my life you are may gathering you organizing and disseminating information on the have been doing since i was a look get are to give lectures at school on money about stuff i learned over the week ain see check it out but they they took me to a psychiatrist were the same age back then if we got sent to a psychotic anon people thought you are crazy o want it not bexacexactly ism ever feeling a freak also i did notate a steer but a grunting tick it comes back when ism tired and the only thing that help that was hitting my head on something shaking my head just why scapeporningwas good cause it'd slam and it'd feel feel good that is not healthy now that is not good or just work the work is what gets it out it is in t it is a or pillar hi and anyway that is me the but yet i think certain things over time i feel taller gets or whatever one call them but they're many things that are exceedingly difficult for me and i and i have learned from your example i know that y you are very both humble and very clear that you do not have you say i do not you not can get it by examining you but i think the way you are sharing to day and the way you shared on other podcast before their pieces that really help people feel in to the process of what your talking about today were elaborating on it i think a lot this notion being haunted and the stick y i mean of course of course now it makes much sense why you soft want to talk about sleep or rest or recovery cause that is sure that is important have hard you say yes you sleep yes you eat yes you hydrate yes you you will stretch er as or what but it is funny how that becomes the viral message that is why s the fucktat but that is not the unique that is not the the unique message that you carry any one can talk about that do i have that right that you are acknowledging sleep is import and recoveries in per but that is not what you are about you have to forego something yes i pass sales sleep nutrition all this this fucking important you i do not have time for some of it to get distract or had to extract some how to give you talk about you when you are younger you'd you would give these speeches and stuff the same age you were gives speeches i was trying to fight how to say the without stuttering and i realized as i got over that all these things are important but for me to stop stuttering i get bill fuck confidence and see starapedin t help that nothing to that i have to forego a lot o shit to be as fucked up as i am to big confidence for me is stand in the fucking room of ten thousand or one person and notion blew from my head down let me look around to me let me ism read these paragraphs first and then before i read the paragraphs of the call me next let me just leave the room come stutter its som miserable life and that is one of many things i did besides lying besides being in secure besides being in mature besides been fat best is been one the only black is in my schmooze a lot of things i had to overcome to gain confidence and in doing law that i had to go lot of it i became the god tot became once we misunderstood you only see for hours a day to ours a day sometimes youon't sleep at all was this was this was this i know is all important i cannot sums got to go for me to git confidence cause confidence is e doting block of on kine to go for me to gain confidence an myself this fucked up kid has got you lot of fuck up ship to gain confidence an along the way the stutter went away and i gain confidence and now my life as rule a bit more there is is no balance there is no balance it is a la a bit more what it should be for a lot of people but there never be balance cause confer to something you constantly confidence an belief you building every day and mom's got to give and ism join to forgo a lot of things to have that cause i know that is that is if you want to give somebody trip to night take that should away from yet i i do not sleep sometimes and sometimes i will not eat the right way an sometimes i will not do this and do that and would ever man but you put me room of ten thousand people in time to day and it'll walking there the own with basket gorgerin here cause i know what it took to be on the stage and a lot of people would not do that that is what ties hair's a question i been wanting ask you since we started and i thought about coming in herein on thing about the weeks head of this and man a just come long as i do not exactly know how to asked the question it is ask you it is about relationships oh do it madam i know in myself that my discipline is much higher when it is just me but that is because ad certain things early on but then had was a terrible ton barely finish high school but then o when i got serious i got serious by did that by staying away from everybody and any one's who is ever had a relationship of any kind but in particular romantic relationships knows that yes you can derive tremendous support from those you got this baby you can going were yet i got this she said i got this ills great to finish something and share with some one share a meal get the huge but there is another side all of that right that i to learn more about from you which is there is a warm body next o you in bed in the morningyou do not want to get up they also have needs you have got your mission the people sometimes need things from us it also oftentimes the people that love us most that truly love us and that want to support us do not understand this thing and they are the first people to tell us listen take a day o and then this whole cycle at least in my head goes off you just want a vacation and then eats almost a paranoia i not sayingthing nice about myself right rid good a or my girl friends can be yet that they remember that and and support of people close to you as critical this con be friends could be romantic partners whatever but there also the the knife cuts both ways it can be the thing that can really under mine this thing that you are talking about because the people that care about us also want to see us comfortable right they once he is happy they want to see us peaceful they want we see is in a wake up from a great night sleep and they want things too right how do you one tangle that whole bit well funny man ism unbalanced but i mostly unbalanced toward the family side to do not get about me i touch being on balanced i get all my stuff in but would i do i make sure that my family has everything they need everything they need those who want to be part of my family some do not some nonmembers do not wont yo part davigotins i get it i got it that is life those you're part of my family i give this everything they need they can leave me the fuck alone i make sure your happiest fucks i got go to work and isn't mean smoke jumping i do not mean running i mean all of it it takes every i cannot have you in my fucking shit cannot i know for me to have a family i got make sure that you realize i may give you everything see we start bitching at me young as they her and on i dedicate it my life to give you everything you need i need this time right here for me to be the best i can be because this journey started without anybody and i make sure everybody knows that who course my life have been left thing about it i was left alone as long tat at young age to figure the shit out i figured it out for myself and it been very successful for myself no ones can ta coming here folk of my ship that is why i make sure i will take care of whatever you need but every need for me you got it money house my love my support i would give you everything you need that is sad i do it the highest level possible ism saying it would gender in the next room please comer and say somewhat is wrong in i wrong give a fuck saves you got say then was time for me to go to work i expect you to do the same for me cause it takes every bit of me to do what i have to do i make sure that ism very unbalance for my family can be exactly that ism balance for myself and that is how i do it i let people know right up front ism not what you want in a man i guarantee out do you be lot late nights by the early mornings a lot times i get bye by myself thinking about the process that is next o my mind i cannot have aggravation to have this to have that is a lot things i let no a front ism very vocal about that some times your relationships work for me sometimes they didn't but that is who i am one thing i did wrong in my life was i tried for many years to please people and i did it at the expense of myself i was leaving a lot in the tank not and when you do that you stop living but the perse thing your life is happiest fuck can you give them everything they want they have the the their life is full but you feel empty and that is not a relationship to me for me is important that exactly who i am because this wit life made and ism not trying to change it because i just figured it out ism not trying to compromise avid goggles i would not never fur ever compromise avid noggins there is a me i will not give you which you need in which you want in which you desire but i do not need money i do not e fame o we shit i give it all the way but i do need is it make sure that that will power its worked on every fucking day and every night for the rest of my life cause it's the one thing that is to keep me feeding you keeping you wen you need to be cause once that will power's gone three runs your pound avid yogins you may not be look it but i will walk around with it the things important to you in life you must do always or you are nobody and that is how i can a relationships am in to that something i could personally work on that upfront clearer communication cause i i resinates that feeling of there is something side that is not getting worked out that i was when ism all my own it is it is it is solo easier but then of course wanting relationships and family i think that is a healthy part of being human to a obviously you have worked it out i appreciate you sharing that think have ever heard you talk about or people a a ere they we an people star that conversation with the why husband gorfran for friend n but why you scared of it why you stare to tell a mother fucker your wife your husband who you are who you are exactly who you are and tow was upon my head that that is a problem the lobes hap in life no one knows who you really are no one knew who i really was i went to a school with your lot of black kids lo black is do on being special lops i never talked about special lops of blackbirds why i was wonder what ism not go to fit in that is not what they do lo black kid do not do that kind of shits it whatever i wanted to do nobly knew the real me grown up because i never wont to know the real me it's always afraid of which you might say or how you going to feel or whatever you got feelings you have a life that you have to live it is important at whatever on your mind you let that personal there for you are given them the option to be with you when not this who i am if you do not it that is good man i i got it but this is avid yogins is that that honest conversation's very important master everybody knows where they stand that person may not be for you that is all good this world could use the lot more of that up front completely honest conversation i feel somewhat of the world's problems a because everyone is dancing around the issues of hikes a lot recently in the news seem people losing their job cause they will not say something publicly you can tell they kind o wantons like people just i think deep down really crave the direct masters what a you about what you knot about but i think now everyone is afraid of kitgetting canceled is a big dead all right canna cancel that people think all i cannot work if i am who i am or wore i if ism not pretending to be somebody else than silence is considered agreement you another all sorts of complicated self and i i do feel for the generation coming out cause credit t have social media right and all of that that gain just wall off from that there is a real benefit from just not on attention people love a lie people love a lie i thought always own a person go not i no go about this own personal lot cause i live in the bubble and people love to lie about who the not they love to lie but who they not do and that is for me the real h ism vulnerable and ism real and honest find somebody come out tell me on line about my fucking life an for me to come er i came from and how the rest in me i have now you a confidence you get how i do not care who you god you goo judge me you a judge me when you done n your life me being honest an upfront an truthful that came with me finally figure not who i was but all conquering avid yogins the demons of avid yogins there fore now you is o open book cougar some look in mine eye that was tat what luck you are you walk away ism god broke o no exactly what this journey took to get here and that gives you a fire in a passion that people can call you nigger they can call you if your let be or gay or by a i we fuck you want if you put yourself in the fire and you come to every fucking day this rest it off no scare to go back in there again come on man your truth is real you come to every day man with a way of talking to people that people do not have causethere is no truth behind them and the truth is starting life you sit don ugly mere out this an this an this this you finally started your life may be forty years old an you forty years old five six kids wife ut see you look in that mirror and you say ism this ism this ism this of this i this what was ism not this ism not this ism not this i cannot this i cannot do this ism all these insecurities your life finally started and woke you start that life man the truth comes out big to you do not care that is the rob most people just do not want to have that conversation we for when they can go stays i the million people say ism all this an have a good day see e sis isn't powering very mirin it is the the way we are educated in school but also outside of schools were yer trained is human being as these young brains to try and figure out how to get positive ye back from other people u it is were were i lie dogs you you have able dog trig i had able dog saw the picture you build to i he as shes gray there charily dog there an amazing species there are i think of them a economy of effort y or amazing breedscuse me there n amazing breed economy of effort they do not do anything unless it is necessary it is ta to the s act off it of every r t they it of interesting t an the on a neediness you now it is true that they will they will die to protect you o ye and it is an instinct ye saw that with costello ism sure that is a wit charge ye tit is it is an instinct but if they are not in that position if there is no need to exert effort your rested yes your bulldogs resting for you yes got it exactly you do not need to rest cause act give recovery charge perfect it is the perfect that is can be your answer from now i to be be sly does you rescue now he somehow worked it out as bulldog doesn't for i right but were s indoctrinated into this way of being from a time that we are young where of course praise feels good right one tells you hey i that sure or goo job to day or nicely done or i for me cause i grown up in a big packet friends grown up and i was never the great stately was not terrible wasn't crate at camera a this bora a feeling crewed up and you've just yet but you have talked about this before in reference to the seal teams we both know a lot of people tat community an the teams component is a big part of it for a lot of people and it is a wonderful thing right but there is a danger to that do note mean hit for lack of a better way to put it from what we only derive when it is coming from outside you are talking about being able to either say good job but also just look to one's own personal history and say i have done hard things and i can do it again and again cause i do it again and again and again you are talking about parrintong yourself inspiring yourself scaring yourself ere all of that from the inside it's very different then the way were raise which is to figure out how to get the biscuit it is funny man people one to know how ism always motivated it is the unseen work which you you says a true statement those are false do not mean hits that people are given you man there is no belief in that these are team work do not me thine ism out running at two o'clock in the morning one o'clock in the morning in the him long lessons by myself you that is real i able to distract dope mean the good dope me never i want man have train ninety nine for sent of my life alone no one hat me on the back i did all of the work alone and well ism still hard on myself i know what i did when never times get backing to all this who you cure the boys to ut that is real i hate that people know me for that guy because that guy is not every fucking day tat when they see me they want that energy that is not me every day i can extracted immediately when i need you because when you train alone and i lived alone for many years and this misery and your able to get out by yourself i cant take myself to such a level of real real passion an purpose in the feeling i did its some nit came expect buy mice i do not mean any one hit is fa it is people come to me to motivate them no one can motivate me i have a rest an made full of fuck a motivation that when never ism down m it all hang all mother auger oh the truth that you the darkness of the fucking dungeons an the fucking deem is that fly you an then from there a say you were there that there was no one there to pick up the rucksack to pick up the boat to pick up the log to going that it was you you was you there was no patin the fucking back at three hundred and at two sent five tat two fit yet two in no that was you those things that come out o me that extract from me in the darkness people a looking for that pound the back where is it oh i do not need it because what have done it is in the fucking unseen work have built frankinstone en ever sickest nasty davit goodness goes you had no body anyway mother fucker see ism thomaself for you that is me that ship fires me the fuck up that ship makes me fucking nuts you had no body anyway mother fucker look around you there is no fucking team it was you there is no what loss programmer my an a within you up saying you can do it you can be better trying to build belief you built belief when you had then rock bottom you did that as times we hard for me the truth comes out an my truth is powerful as fuck it is real it is tangible i feel it it comes out of my brain as i speak about it ism reliving every single dark moment of my life to be here that is what people do not get that is what motive ate davit yogins is in seen work but everybody needs that pound the back they need that training port that they need that account ability coach for yes ship and neither do they but it is what we have trained ourselves to believe that we need is almost there is this pill on the shelf ism speaking in analogy right and we take it an we get based up belike ye but there is this other medicine cabinet behind there and it sin us your saying them to the real medicine carnet sin i yes when you continue to overcome and has many obstacles overcome as actually a benefit to me but the benefit is not a benefit that you have to have the courage and the patience to overcome and overcome before it man you have a whole medicine cabinet but there's no medicine in emalfor there is no are work out i will not take none o that shit all i god you is flip my brain from a fingering there the cat that is the good one i got do man i got the row of decks of test go fuck yourself yogins and oh but you want tit is do that on a day there is nothing i need and this is the thing that people do not get about avid gotten i cannot teach it in a one minute video we all have disability to have or own medicine cabinet but unless you go in there and put the medicine in there it is always gin be fuck and empty ma pals good need to rework out you i can see the lie dint coffee will not do con that i do not need i i can rub for seventy hours an a had before no can there i got all this wonder for shit that i over came on my own bi myself in the darkness that man what is cold ism hot when it is hot i would i i can feed myself all the time that is why wen to say man why are not you missing anything i cannot explain to you man cannot plainly yobbo never understand i found do all has podcast do i get i love you mad that is why you my first book you did a blur from me that is what ism here i love wish you doing for people map i cannot explain this i cannot i cannot explain this because people do not want to do this then want to done manhunt is it of know ami get i get was up even talking about it man because may people think my life is ti oh god is life is horrible i do not do not follow hem yes crazy really but there a good number of people i would say and the under tat that actually i think it i what ism hearing to day and it is really sinking in is that a great many people either partly or completely misunderstand you yes i got it'll put myself in the harshly category i to because i thought it was about just forward center of mass carrot carrot carrot carrot but it is the stick is the thick and it is being haunted and i do have examples for my own life which is not what today's about bout being really afraid and then turning things around my biggest fear is getting comfortable i do not have as much of a stick oriented approach but to days conversations changing the way i think ism li go step away from this and think okay there twenty five moral circuits that can explain tell other things that davit's talking about and what ism thinking about is the fact that everybody has a brain they have a mind forget the brain the rains is the physical structure but what that manifest what that creates is the mind and everybody has that i do believe that everyone has the capacity to do what you are talking about at some level i also will be the first to confess that i think you are highly unusual let us just say maybe even and of one as we say inside sample size of one somebody who's created this process for themselves and keeps them in this themselves in this forward center mass with the stick battering the back o their head all the time highly unusual but this internal medleson cabinet the your time bout building up true confidence not meeting anything from the outside i think i to think that people want that they want to be known they are afraid but that they want to be known for who they really are and that you are describing the past to do this and i will say ism immensely grateful that you are talking to us this way to day about things you've talked about before but we are hidden in a little differently i to think very different because what you talking about is a process it is verbs it is all verbs all action and it is not about success it is more actually about keeping that friction did to ten and that i no energy drink no supplement people often misunderstand me they think ism big on people going sunlight in the mornings except the circadian rhythm and get better sleep as they can et camera but then people always think they go straight to the supplements what should i take you know and then the course people thing em all about supplements and supplements are one piece for me but it is tiny fraction compared to the the doing the dos and do not that is what hi wont talk about that to day that is from gat was hung about this this is it this is it the brain istle most powerful wept in the world and is es crazy how a kid that was it real smart i was forced to go only internal external had to go away the external world had to go away in living deep inside myself it was me in this brain in figure not how this thing works and is many people are doing exactly that the supplements tho this to that i agree it helps but once you figure out your your brain you become unstoppable to almost anything yet you cannot beat death you cannot whatever whatever your brain's amazing once you feed it the right conversation the right mental nutrients the right mental supplements the right the right internal dialogue at the right time with the right hit with the right proof of which you have done in the past and you send at right to the right circuit do you are a fucking beast a beast but munch again you just cannot read about it you cannot sit back and be a theorist you have to be a fucking practitioner and in that practise is where that becomes proof positive what ism saying is like god avid goes it it is blow in my mind whit is this he is not t crazy it is many people a lot of people hive listen to me in the right way and they come back like ism told yo on board it happened it happened i they'll keep going may tor keep doing it but that is it man there is no sun there is no glory there is no curt here is no victory but there is all of it in one i cannot explain it we you to people man but would you get the other end it is something that you are not you are always found there's never lost any more theresn't men to journeys easy the not gentian easier but you areaways found we all that it is not a hover on that first set the same way we hovered on haunted and is not it i think people feel lost have certainly felt lost of times in my life ism many times and the there is that thing i do not think there is a nervous science or psychology term for it some one will say put in the comments and say oh yet that is what and said but take you said we are not trying to be theoretical here returned t be practical the business o finding yourself and knowing but it sore ism safe because ism in danger and have been in danger before and i got myself out it always always seems to come back to verbs again i do not have a language for this for once ism lost for words there is i it is it is about o a process the algorithm and you and the reason here ism just kind of try to make sure ism understanding things correctly one of the reasons why it must be uncomfortable for you to be who you are publicly it is because people want us folks on the running or the swearing and by the way the swearing is is welcome it'll say i came up through laboratories we are all three people i worked for swore a lot but there was one rule i could not swear at people my grade adviser brilliant woman ism torturing she died early they all died early ism the common denominator i had that internal like for a long time anyway she said but if you swear it people you are out right but you can swear as much as you want that is that is the rule i have it is i can swear as much as you want just do not swear at people if you swear it people better be had to fight right right being i can fight you s you can swear me get away i but the fact to the matter is the you must be frustrating that people cause i know people o it is tat it is all about supplements and ice bad i listen i supplements a love supplements and ice bad but that is not the full picture they just a gravitational pull it's the swearing it is the running it is his feet that are all messed up it is the fact that he got a writing it is is seal got talk about that too right and there is a gravitational pull for people and there missing the that is the tip of the iceberg is what ism realizing ism realizing that to day thanks dowry you are phrasing things cause the bigger vessel is all in here in as you said how d you put that in a book is impossible is highly individual yet you do it your way yes and you are saying everyone needs to go figure out how to do it their way for them yes and the thing about being minister's very first rating more then i can even imagine i i came sex express how first ring it is when the cousin everything comes from a place of o real i cannot explain would i do without it the passion comes out of me is almost speaking in tongues because when you put that much work and people oh ye there is been this baseball place this football player this the no no every thing everything is work everything and per will not do not believe it when i speak the mother fucker and the in the fuck an in in shit in is that is whit it took for me but it takes for me the anger the passion the the the the jaw dropping just it takes that because ism not that this hog look at a man what built this guib let us imagine been in the coldest water you can possibly take always go back to help i with this i hate it the water hated it you send the locked arms and you are in the water all time and they are bringing you in you the water in all the water when you have this dialogue in your head and these people are just me off for freeman one men it video and you are costly your whole life when you've figure it out twenty for that i got i i it is it is got this fucking got this is this going to suck every day is going to sick an live that to be better in i put is with in the water the water's on on my head the pacific ocean is freedom february to o shin bent thou three heal weeks for you to constantly win when when when this voice over here the real you is say it the hock out here go you are nobody you have always been nobody in it is true you do not hear that that is a true voice that is the real reality of avid yogins at twenty four years old it is not a false reality and then you had to create another voice over here that i saying you are better than that other voice and you are the freezing cold water that both voices do not want i u can begin but you when can goes from the water to the studying to the running to losing wait to how you eat to how you function as a man every day of your life your winning these battles and then i have normal people who only have one voice never treated the second voice the winning voice is t he second voice they've one voice and that is just ism a piece of shit that is all they her and then they judge people me who are out here trying to be better it is something that i can never really it is the frustrating thing for me cause i know i know the majority of people i know et goes on to brink out studied the my more than almost more than you cause i would not ism a partition or for you to be a piece of shit and come ut o that you don't just come out of it you spend decades studying your mine in the human mind on how it functions in good environments bad environments stress full environments patient of our you studied all because you put all this together to create the mine to become successful i hadn't what god bless me with this brain i had ta create of mine it in doing i figured to every piece of shit human being in the work as i mud i was going off be for myself i know why you go on aster grams i know why you cause you just have the time you have the time because you do not want to put that time into bettering ones self i know why i misunderstood i is understood by people who have plenty of time on their hands to is understand me because they are exactly where i once was with the low life lazy piece of shit it is the harsh reality of people who troll you who go after you they have nothing better to do wit your lives not som after schoolspessful it is the truth by once was that way i know where all comes from that is why it is first ranging me now cause ism not first ray at the fact that ism been trolled ism first if o fact that you'll have the courage the courage to try to be somebody better than which are not and that is the first rating part it is interesting because earlier we we talking bout relationships and you said in in a very candid way and i really appreciate you sharing that that you make sure that the people close to you your family has everything they need right and that they also understand that you're going to take what you need to continue to build you right period period in some ways it seems you also included the general public in that family you are saying listen i might give you what you need o man give you as much of myself as i can except man a stop right at the line s right that if i were to cross it is going to prevent me from continuing to build myself and by the way this relationship only exists because id do not cross that lines right and i think as much as there are detractors out there people that try right i mean it is pretty whatever they doing is brief feeble in my mind i man's cap gun i if if that verify u many of us men and women old and young here something and feel something in your message i it seems kind of crazy gosh is ne ever just relax what about is sleep is feet he is get he is in injure himself have her listen it'll be very draft i got friends who were in the teams you just go ye whats you can do when he cannot run and i know the answer is to keep running it is right right but it is more comfortable for people even high achievers especially hicheevers to believe that if you took one thing away that it would all go away it is absoluteclear that is not the case with you ism one hundred percent convinced i just know that cause we were talking about the comic times i have not teenage to run two hard surgeries most deny surgeries and after every see serve did you say nit to run again and of fine wit that there is no run a peer none this was what is all about after they lost would you cannot run give a fuck it was never about running why do you think i run it is the worst thing i hate doing it more than anything hence the will power right your answer amid singular coaches hence we we would start to regress if you love running think about it every day i wake up you is run a mile two miles it is the one thing i hate the most to do and i do it i love it two hundred and fifty sixty seven three hundred mile runs at one time no sleep and every step an i get to thing about this i get to the fucking startling cost seen at ginger why the fuck an mi here i hate to shit after sending some hours or running every fuck an question i ever had as answered every cressenthad is answer i caps success i do not pe go we ma you cap success for me to be who i am when i go smoke jump i smoke jump three to four months either year sometimes five to you just for those that are not i educatabouts a just give a said brief description of what smoke jumping an tails basically you you jump into fires not into a ut jump by fires that people cannot get to sot o plains in holacobrih to o plans i slavish you is this all par shooting you perish out air plans and then you fight to fire you and sometimes further guides or may be aide of their guides guise and gals and your prices fire out i lose millions of dollars every summer to do this it lost people's mines who help you throw and your breathing i brit bean soot knees a jacked up chitin the ground hurting whatever talking the normal people that never get it seven explain to him but this is why this who call cap success ism talking financial success for me to continue to having that will power the second i just become a speaking monkey and travel around and speaking gigs twelve months out o the year put campion do this put on lectures et supplement lines and do this and write more books an shit i ruined the exact thing i worked on my entire life and why i did not know it to the day but some always told me this is a very very very perishable skill this this will power that you have cause i do have a will power that i have never seen it an by my life is a haunting force that is keeps me going and i know that that is my strength if you have that that is worth every dime i never made in my life is ta fact i can look a man the eye finally new real conversationwithout going this cause ism lion or ism a piece o shit or i know how person in many people do this shit there talking to you on who they want to be there lying to you and they walk awetdin us only times you walk away god man my kind tell the truth why ta help can i just tell him the truth no good o fills me now look at you in your eye and every man at a man i see cause men will not get this women will not get this man to man that mans shit you look another man the eye and that everything your fucking saying as real and it comes from a real working place some that you earned it is the best fill in the world you can say that actually happened yet i know wit certainty what ism saying actually actually happen who i am and who i say i am i am no more lies no more skirting the truth no more bolshie and that is worth every dime a her made in my life and i is i swear to god on that thievery dime have ever made in my life building who i built i cap success because i know that if i ever go twelve months out of the year and all put several eve my day ism going at it but several months outer your i go right back to grounds hero this means ism just fucking avid got is no yogins no carry boats fucking logs bus yet it is just pick up that fuck an pullastyan dig hey get that fuck an pump walk down a mile put into fucker masters beaten you are dis avid yogins you are nobody cause that is where my growth is that is where my will power comes from and that is worse days that is when my talk to you now and than that can no talk this to people oft talk was cot pasticause isn't there it there they're they're be goes a taken some ship m thirty fucking years ago ism been going si taken ship for an hour ago hour ago come on mat is this be real and i cannot be on these pa yes they cannot talk o any without be real it'll go away it is go away cause i i i cannot give you what i want to give you you said perishable skill i think that is another word said a word to in a high light a skill implies behavior and when we are just talking a second an go about the deep true hetero sense of confidence that comes from looking some one in the eye and telling somebody something you absolutely know it is true because it happened you are going about actions not telling out perceptions you are not talking about what you believe happened it happened another is something really concrete about actions and that is what interesting as were tie about the mind but actions are the manifestation of the mind and i and the stuff that just stays in here people die with that it does not go anywhere i i long ago somebody he said tat i forgot what the context was was a now scientists he said most emotions they're just emotions there just in there but you do not have to do anything with em and i think certain motions you want to do something with right but think people forget this they feel miserable they are going to distant an to puddle of their own tears no one ever died from an emotion right but they feel that they overwhelm us as if it is a tidally that is going to pull us under and drown us it is interesting to me because i think what people the simp you have a gravitation for people can feel the energy i think was your either completely badly or partially understood there is only one eye on the plant that truly understands you i thin there is one woman decipher who probably understands you as much as any one's going to and then the rest of us are kind of grasp and trying to figure it out right but you are sin go inward first go inward and then it is actions inward an actions at the inward piece is something it'd you to spend a little by time on because there couple characters from history people that we are in concentration camp nelson men fella a ism not sure he had inter graham there in pestering did not and i do not thin there was any one coaching i on hay you are going to get out some day and actually you arguing to lead an entire country ism pretty sure that is not how it worked he had to find it here he had to find it between his ears right and there are other examples but that is a an important one the process of going inward does it for you and here i will ask for suggestions cause i think people want there are those of us who want to build this skill right wall yourself off town off for big portions of the day perhaps testing off requests o this to that any one that knows you knows that we have communicate a few acts but most of it comes through a filter she is great she knows you and she knows how to protect your time and the dustup was feelings be i get mad a a end god bless god bless you gan for cutting oneself off when you are in there you say it is just you and the voices that come up are not pleasant and then it is some point it converts to action of how much what is the process of picking the action that is the piece that i feel wee there is a a bridge to build here if you can if you would to the action me s what is next yes or what me when you go go to sleep at night when that happens you in what you arguing to do the next day it is preplan yes of yes is t it is always the same thing you are not building it on the fly no nothing on the fly nothing in how works internally for me is ism i i put that exactly how it is ism an artist and every can point ism ism painting morally everyday and buts ta different one is not the same painting everyday i wake i on o do the same thing it takes a different way to get there s every day my my ism going through my mind ism dislike and a good painter for not just pare not and he's to create and you cannot create i phones and everything going around you you got it block yourself off you may do too my casting to were you block yourself off and you are and you are painting this thing inside and you are going through all these different colors of paint and everything else and you can only figure out the right painting if you spend the correct him on a time in your brain every single day ism early gosh o in and ism painting ism creating this this masterpiece then master piece is always myself and but to do that you can not have any distractions because if you are talking to an artist and he is trying to think about the next painting you cannot som i is impossible to listen to you and listen to which your mind and body are telling you we must do you will not do enough of do not do any of it your they don't have passion that they passing drive determination because you have not spent time with yourself your mind will tell you what is next but you have not spent the time to go i the me dis figure this out you are looking for let me go go this and let me ogle that and let me you i can to find it there because there is things of people in this world and they are all supposed to be individuals we have a packed reality it is for you fuck and lost why an i unique ism been exactly tho fuck o spoke to be i am false said in mi did fall shit i everybody else the second i said o cay man hang on do you do not this you do not this you do not this who are you avid cigars who are you supposed to be morack'lously all these things just i i couldn't even the the list of shit i had to do just who fuck it'll a how why you sit down yourself are caftan will not be michael down or him brown that boy baron my birthdayside i looked at the birthdays hell might may me be won i cannot ism going to be avid fuck and yogins and that looks this it dis came everything flooded every single day of my life there is a different thing that comes up the have to do but no one knows what to do because everybody else following steps the republicannot democratic parties ism not political neither am i at all for this reason republicans in vote republican democrasican a vote democrat you not even a human fuck an being grow nohow you fuckers agreed all the same fuck as said and i know i do not once you figure out yourself and who you are all the answers come every night u different painting is being painted and it is a beautiful painting for myself mike coke thus us it it may look the same to most mother fuckers but the in result is very fuck and different that is why my longe i if you look it what have done in forty nine years it is more than most people every doing the cause they were a race car driver that is what they did they drove a fuck an car it is great i was all kind said because that is exactly what the painting was saying to do for the mind was saying to do once thing to drive across o thin that race care i know what toxic do they ye he me tire some best e race car driver and thee lost throw how are you still don't get it you you never going to fill your list but you never found you list cause it never was presented in front of you because your head with clutter with shit cause you never just stop for lots o minutes lots of years an is said is me in you get it go and it is mama is right there right there ism not a psychologist as i mention before but ism an adventure a hypothesis here i think that you have master the précis of internal dialogue but when i say dialogue i think most people think o the the inner voice that the the chatter but that is just one half of a dialogue at dialogue is a to was street i completely agree cause i know from experience that when we go in were often times we hear things and fore really oust with ourselves is in think about that or that no and then we start looking out word are we start trying to shift our attention and distract and there million reasons that are handed to us excuses and seemingly good justifications to be able to do that but dialogues a to ways street and it hit me while you are just saying what you're saying i was paying very close attention and i realize day bogbeans is talking about the voice that comes up including the terrible stuff that no one wants to hear about themselves from themselves but then he is also got the dialogue down where he knows the counterforce he goes yet you are right and to men to do this or maybe no remember this you are in a dialogue a to wag dialogue in there not a one wage chatter dialogue there books written by famous psychologist about chatter trying to shift your internal narrative you are bring me internal the internal narrative that is what going in ward is about but it is not one voice again the a hypothesis ism not claiming to be all knowing lord knows ism not all knowing e but you have master the dialogue an if the three voices strong medium and weak in there you are you are let us all come to the table you have got i symphony of voices in there that are all you that to be you and how to have those commerce you are not afraid to be in those conversations and then which what the outcome of that committee decision is and you put in to real world action and the world only sees the action island only you can know your dot internal dialogue and only i can know my internal dialogue and the only way that cording know it is to spend a hello a lot of time there it is right of a lifetime got it a lifetime i think about it for me to be sitting here in front of you you are not going to call three hundred pound equal lab guy to comes here you it to know maybe probably not i be not this about this we we teach people is kind kindness to yourself do you think if i taught myself kindness and i agree with the tossing people swing people take me out of contact this ridiculous take a hire fuck you want to take it when is three hundred pounds re think that conversation got me if i spoke kindness to myself i take where gets me right back to seven eleven another box an many chuck a do not us in the chucking milkshake that is the one voice that is the one voice that most of us have it your talking about if you never conversation in there the other voice that you create that sad a key how does this look loos very ugly that kind conversation for me went away along o time ago which is why the dialogue as now which you see a lout of action because most people have inaction cause this one person talking and that one persons always lean you down the same path the path that makes you feel very comfortable and happy with yourself the second you create that the voice there's conflict just battles is work just thereat one thing i learned i taught myself this and people it i do not understand wish your saying not try to brick it down we quick i did not teach myself victory first i taught myself failure i taught myself how to fail an you be that depressing is it when you three hundred pounds and you cannot read and write and your fucked up on me times you gin ta fucking fail on that process if you will know how to fail there is no victory i never talked about win could i knew the path to winning was would be years to failing first i taught myself how to fail properly don't teach you how to fucking fail but if you are going out for insurmountable fucking its that make absolutely no fucking sense a black yet that cannot swim threes upon to be navy seal o we you better teach tiny to fail first because if you sitting failure for too long you were never come out of it the first part of my success war's learning how to fail properly and then eventually i thought to gin a feu victories but that is what people do not get when you have buried yourself wit such a deep fucking hole you better firs talk about the failures you can have first and fashion that other voice comes up it tells you we got do somebody also tells you boy ism look a live your yogins you are in for a fuck and clime pro you are going to get your ass handed to you made fun of the outside nays the inside noise both voices are to be fuck and telling yo to go fuck yourself you are in for hell brow i am soberly fail this is what you mean when you say that whatever anyone says it is insignificant in significant fuck right it is the cab gun fire because it is just it because the voice in your own head is is far worse that the then i should say sorry one of the voices in your head yes i won being very detailed almost surgical about that because i think to thing about inner dialogue we think is one voice yes you are making it clear it is many voices it is and the thing about is you you you have to be really and sometimes all the voices are telling you the wrong shit man but through years years not podcast or listening to a book o mean a book years of sacrifice of suffering of diligent ten point fucking work on which you want to do for yourself not oh let me is do will punch to shit let me i want it be in every task possible no ten point what i want to do with my life what happens this you have all these voices the telling you your fucked up and this can be hard but for some reason you put much practice into you that you can ignore every one of em that telling youyou not enough fuck can make it and still be able fuck can make it because you have put to practice in that this is the process it is us a daunting task that all the voices are saying no but you still have the conviction that i know i can do this and that is what it took for me to get hear twenty thirty years ago i have this thirty five or whatever was thirty till twenty five years ago pipe drink and ever since then every voice was your fucking not but when you put that practice in every day you lace them up and it'll mean run it is just ta metaphor for life you lace the mother fuckers up every day pretty soon you wen pretty soon you are firemen if you other curlers in the heart in the dedication in the mind that everybody go fuck themselves i know what i know have listen to myself enough to know i know what i know none you can hear what ism here and that is what people's do enough up they do not listen to their journey they listen everybody else is s it before it ism crazy but be ocean crazy why'd y successful how that happen how misguided miss in locked up and do not listen to him why am i the only need to hold much a shit why am i to blazer why how is that pals how can you be locked up and also self made the same fuck d into no obviously you are not looking tat the truth in front of you the truth in front of you is at sucks it is painful it is fuck in in coming and that is the truth and that is why a lot of people do not listening to me cause this is what it ties creating another voice it is sometimes going out alone all the time going alone cause no one oo believing you that is that what ism about to say is not conjecture and i can say that with confidence because i did a for episode gets series with a brilliant psychiatric the giving palconti from trentony is a stamford hazard trained guide is also got last street no mes that his own hardship real hardship he is brilliant and he said something that it'll never forget which is we think that the the forebrain the part of our brain that create strategy et camera is the supercomputer he said my the supercomputer of the brain is the is the unconscious mind it is the part of our mind that is cut controlling most everything and most people unfortunately do not do the work to understand how they are unconscious is controlling them and that is the scary thing the idea your mind is controlling you and ism noggin gain to the free will debate i believe in at least some will i believe what you are describing and this internal dialogue i think you have access to your unconscious mind you have by listening to the dialogue going inward we know this is true in sleep in dreams in meditation and just by shutting out everything else shutting out all the external noise which is filled with things that pull us ways noise makes at sound bad but it is it is the gravitational pull of all the things that is allow us to distract ourselves without knowing that en was the ice cream the havacooky the merry christmason the unconscious mine this huge piece of the iceberg underneath that pal calls the the supercomputer he saying that with knowledge as a durable just psychiatry psychologist an he really knows that is the piece that if one does real introspect ice calls at the cupboards you got a look in the cupboards and it is often really scary what you find in there and most people are just only one know the cupboards are there it you are pulling all the cupboard door is open and then you are and ism you are extremely deliberate with what gets put into action you are not just going all on t piss of an act pest or ism tired some on a tired it is you are picking very carefully what to do and that is a process that it's guessing came to you does it come to as a monkey it makes sense why running make sense it makes sense why smoke jumping make sense it seems a huge portion of your time it is spent understanding yourself and making sense to you and when people do not understand you it is got to be extra frustrate yes cause most people do not understand themselves they we are all running round going you are this and you are that cause most people just unwilling to look inward but ism including myself by the wan right i man have done a fair amount of introspection but ism inspired to day that word inspired but it is true motive add to start going inward further cause it is scary it is we do not know what is in those cupboards and it is terror fine yes especially cause we do not know and those the first ones open up and you talk bout you got go through we cubers i do spring clean every fucking day in those dark cuber's those tho those dark habits and won just i with first that is the run me man that is the run me that is why i ism not ashamed i do not hide i use to hide it'll tiny more he is exactly right i i do not know all the fucking science behind shit i know what i know that won't listen by any more ill nistn' a shift thy most you were foolish shit cause i know i know the deep tart secrets of those fucking cupboards is ugly man an every day ism talking to m everyday clean i i ism clean them of talking to the same deem as that came out of fucking cubers at the as ism cleaning em sometimes to go right back in hem again it is not easy and this is why most of us jest bi i misunderstood because but comes out of those cabinets then ism cleaning sometimes they see on integral something thin they will see in the packet something they seen this one i turn people off open up your own cabinets and then go talk about it we me see how pretty it looks a mes ow pretty you sound let me see how put to gather your words are i bet you a fuck or mother fucker comes out because for you to go back in there again to clean the same fucking cab that that deem they came of take some big balls brow to do it every day of your life to go back in there in spring clean every day not once the fucking year once every decade every my ages dusty and every day youon't start with the with the victories you do not go all this is nice thin a out looking my i love me what me clean up this little dusty not i go right for the things the could keep me buried i go right there first cause if i do not clean those out first the day does it start what you saying to me it is truth and a told you man time to it i can never figure out how is explain the shit to people because ism not nohow nothing ism this the guide that said o get we got a start in the dungeon and we got a stay here for the rest of our life for you it become successful the dungeon is the place that has to be clean and it is the carious place to be that is why ism is understood cause in speaking from the punching that is why i am successful cause i go the everyday day and that is the truth whit he says is exact truth those cabinets are fucking dusty dirty and scary shit broken glass bi in dark spiders cob webs but most of all your biggest feels the biggest things that put you in the fuck the place you are to day in there we all that is keep shut on to lock him up at that never happens for we never grow you never improve you never have real conversations like could havehim right now never never o no no no no no no less not no no no less not go there i talk o many people who time in that let us talk about this cause they will tell me but they canonry say t once and they'll say it in passing they will not git deep in the weeds with it you cannot just clean it to fucker you got a spit shine that mother fucker you got a relict it every fucking detail of it you cannot lake of you have and my dab beat me in e know no is it it is what it is are not is what it is mother suggest is killing you it is taken over your whole fucking life but that is the conversation my dab it autism my now though ism good will not i it no your are not you i coif in this is this as real talk ye do not have that your boys right hon's be tat right scares shit is scary as shit but makes you who you are supposed to be and that is the test we forget es we think we got to breathe ere and have kids and pay the bills in shit and but what is what's this life about the man since being test it my friend tests come when you have not studied test come when you think that you are in the great place dust dust to test the test is every day your life and most of us fail because we do not know why we are here cause we do not go inward to it you came you lot o shit to fix man and this test sucks then you start that organs it'll think i could add to that i know i cannot thank you for sharing what you shared to day i as much as your process or any one's process cannot be completely understood from the outside you gave us a real window into this thing this process that you was as you said god put it on you i believe in god to people can believe what they want but it somehow you are your life god gave you these challenges early on and than there was a point where you went in eternal and you said you developed a skill but it is a perishable skill and you clearly live in the process of opening those cupboards reopening those cupboards trying to s bit shine those cupboards understanding that there never ever really done but that you can gain ground on them a you can win day after day after day and you really shared a lot of concrete things that i think be i know people are going to be able to apply if they choose and i agree with you i think most people will e li wo twas a lot heavy i think i wanted just can i bake myself in net flip and checks mix instead but there is also the reality that there men and women boys and girls hear that and go oke and start crack in the the cupboards open and i i just know that for myself ism extremely grateful that you are willing to put it all out there you are brutally honest brutally authentic that word authenticity gets thrown around much and i can tell you that for me and for everybody else that is what really what resinates whether not you want two whether not it is the purpose behind er or not

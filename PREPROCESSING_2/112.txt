jobidin travels to plasma for nine eleven while finding he six billion dollar give way to the eonian mullahs the fifth circuit smacks down the white house for interfering with free speech and re publicans seek new ways lose the house of representatives ism been sure this is the menscuro so to day showsponser by express at vision thousands of my listers have already secured the it rotate join them express pe piazza cams lawman jobidon not a god president not with it and his plan on nine eleven was somewhat puzzling he was envy at not and he want to fly back to the united states instead of presumably delaying the the rest of his nine eleven sort of tribute remarks he decided to fly to plasma from vexation because the shorter flight and hen he was going to do some sort of memorial for nine eleven in plasma which is really related to nine eleven in idea that there is no relation he is an plasma and say decided that he is going to do invent in plasma at this event an plasma he paid tribute to john madman which again i mean that that is nice but i do not know what that has to do with nine eleven perse and then he tried to do the by partisanship routine which is kind of amazing considering the he is called half of america the kind of people who wish to overthrow the democracy but sure here as the president of the united states yesterday on an a day of national unity for nine eleven wat they always mired about come push he put duty to control first task i puerperal did ago party ago politic upon is you person ten ta reminds us we must never lose that says of pastor unity islet that be the combed cause about om be us o suptemper eleven by re knowing our faith in one another let us remember who we ares ideation it is true he did put duty first just as what join was doing during the we unonmore he receive five student draft to to ferments first as an under graduated the university of delawareand the later as a law student at circus university and then after a metical examine aril sixty eight whichwould have made him eligible for the draft he received in one why classification which men he could only be drafted in a national emergency why because he had childhood use mass i just ta a quick contrast there between john cane who jobidon ran against remember jobidon was the vice presidential candidate for barokobama in two thousand eight i nowt is now decade an a half ago but that is a thing that actually happen and during that campaign join was not supersized to john my can't put aside all of the can the the real thing here that that canna sticks in the craw is jobidon talking about national unity because he is not even remotely unifier he is not some new cares about unity hes some who pretends to care about unity but the reality is that he his pursued the furthest left to agenda of any president of my life time andthat actually includes barokobama the stuff that he his attempted to do in restructuring for example student ones unilaterally from the executive branch the stuff that he is attempted to do in cramming down valines on eighty million people the she the insane levels of spending he has pursued post covet the the insane a mount of money that his poured down the rat hole of environ mental causes while in floating the currency and all the stuff is dramatic expansions in terms of the size and scope of government and he is bother on form policy as well plush is just an insult a i have to say join distrust an insulting person i mean i know that a lot people an left to look at dona trumpet was was dona trumpets an insulting person he insults the intelligence and he is vulgar and he is rude and all this kind of stuff jobidon is humiliating in the different sort of way jobidon is humiliating because hoiden is a corrupt politician who lies regularly he lies all the time went when jobidon opens his out the lies flow forth bobbles from the mouth of mosthenys an he just the the only thing that comes out of his face hole is untruth yesterday during nine eleven he was talking bat he just cannot help himself he starts talking about out he was out the round zero site the day after nine eleven that is clearly not true even jo marshall be button go to ground zero until nine fourteen so just making things up here because this is what he does and he knows that the media never an hold him accountable because when he was younger the meet if held him accountable when there are other democrats who is running against but now he is the president of the united states and the rule is that if you are a democrat who is the president of the united states nothing you say will ever be used against you it is the opposite of criminal justice an anything you say can or will be used against you well i mean for jobidon one your the presidents of the unitedstates in you s democrat nothing you say we will ever be used against you in any contact here is join just tongue lies about nine eleven broker your i remember she new the look at the glide out dot out looking through the g to hell i look test i the ware o tar to what seen oh you mean look bad nine eleven and he knower just to o i suppose the rest of us who saw images of nine eleven and all it but and this is who jobidon is now all of this we just began normal political garbage all this just be me except for the fact that on the anniversary of nine eleven jobidon thought this would be an excellent time to sin he six billion dollar check to the baronial mullahs now the junta position of nine eleven in that is pretty awkward not because the aronians participated in nine eleven not because all kit was she a they are not their soon terrogroup but because the over all thesis which is that if you give money and resources and sucker to is locater's the eventually that is going to come back and bite you in pretty significant ways that is one of big messages of nine eleven if not be biggest message f nine eleven and on that day the president who e handed afghanistan back to all kit that is what he did handed at back to the talesman and backward kit is now having six billion dollars to the leading privacy tours in the midleeast the greatest terresponsors on the planet in iron that is what he did on the anniversary of nine eleven me just for optical reasons youwould think that he had a brain in his head to think it may bash wait a week but no he had to do it now because jobidon wants a deal wit the aronians a broader deal with the aronians why less can put it on his rest in the same way that he wanted to pull out of afganiselic a moron because he wanted it on his remade not because thought would act to be good fer the world not because geese hat a plan he did not but because he wanted to say that he was the guy who got it done never put it above politicians never put below politicians for them to do things just out of pure egotistic desire they want it on the resinate an s they just do it it is not because they have the best interests o the country at heart that is clearly not career jobidon does not have the best interest the country at heart when send to six billion dollar check to people who have ben responsible for the death of literally thousands america and mildest remember during the rock war it was ouronian sponsor hate militias they were killing america soldiers an jobidon is signing those you will six billion dollar checks on the anniversary of not eleven well paying tribute to the heroes of nine eleven it is just it is beyond reason will get t the details that story in just one second

washington post the bidonadministration has now issued waver for banks to trains for six billion dollars in frozen baronial oil fun without fear of your sanctions a keys step and securing you release of five america citizens detained in iron people familiar the matter see as part of the arrangement the administration will release five baronial citizens detains in the united states it just to make this clear his not even a straight up trade of baronial citizens detain in the united states because we believe that they are involved in say terror activities for america who have been wrongly detained in er on its i i strap trade it is that plus six billion dollars i got a say jobidon's record here is looking atomic y the g am of the york eats at this point e e he's writing briny grinder for the merchants of death and now he is printing six billion dollars and five aronians we are holding here for five america citizens i just have question what exactly would be the incentive for terror groups not to take america citizens hostage at this point that the the sucker in the white houses get a sign you over the bank if you do the the central principle of do not negotiate with tears obvious there is play around the edges their six certain situations where negotiations are necessary but one of the key elements here is you do not actually n go shit with terrorists to the tune of six billion dollars plus five detainees in the united states for five people wrongfully detained in iron that is crazy talk congress was notified of the move on money it is likely to come as relief yous prisoners families in supporters say the washing ton but well is that nice a meant listen i want those people back as well also the united states has national interest those national interest you convolve giving six billion dollars to the worlds leading terroresponsors my god it is also expected to come under harsh criticism from re publicans in congress oppose to any agreement that allows for the release of frozen cranial funds money that is now being transferred from south care to cuter and limited for the purchase of humanitarian goods folder malison i kit that is the part that realizes there saying is going to be for humanitarian purposes there is only one problem the aronians immediately said none no you would understandwhrt not use whoever we please according to enbisinews baronial president ebon hum r nisi said his government will decide how it will spend six billion dollars in previously frozen funds do to beg do to be released in a prisoner exchange sat it'll be spent quote wherever we need it oh you mean you arguing to spend it to murder people because that is what you do becauseyou would rather thatyour country be impoverish and your people unhappy then that you actually stop with the terror crap and start building that is what you would rather do if you are the the evil regime in heron in a exclusive interview patron ready suggested the america held in iron would be coming home soon saying the us iron prisoner exchange you will be completed into time that the america detainees were in very healthy condition under the arrangement tawteron will be granted access to the roughly six billion dollars in cranial oil revenues yous officials are lying and there saying nor no they are only go it use it for food rocks that what they do if you had money to dictatorial chimes tho hate your got probably they use it exactly where yours if there is one thing about the aronians its that we can trust them they have never a natgonadyall ever if for example they say they are developing new clear power for peaceful purposes despite the fact that here one of the great oil producing regions on planet earth you probably have to believe them that is folly they would never deceive say the i i they never ever do that sort of thing i love that ran we s just saying the quinate out lady's at no where using it whatever we want that is how little the agrarians even respect jobidon belike yah you give us the money and then you go lid your people and you tell them that we will use it for for good purposes food or something and not then ism going to say publicly on america t v ism no use it however i want screw you old man am that is that is effectively what this is easy said iron would have authority over how the money would be spent quote this money belongs to the baronial people the baronial government the as logic republic operon we will decide what to do with this money he was ask directly by lesterholt if the money would be used for other purposes a part from humanitarians and a any said quote i whoop this humanitarian means whatever the baronial people needs this money will be budgeted for those needs and the needs of the baronial people will be decided and determined buy the roman government oh that that is a classic right there that is such in amazingly i a kind of love it because it is blatant that is you give e a craticard and you tell me m ism ism working for daily ware you him meat dailyware creticart you tell me i need to go use it for daily wire resources triton what you mean is you want me to go down to the local to the local office deep than pick up some paper an and and mike oh for dailywire resources perfect that credicard belongs to me ism going to use it for whatever resources the daily wire deems necessary and who deems it necessary will be me tan sure is gone pot a lamb on the credicard that's effectively wit they're doing except in ran for the government a lamb is just a bunch of shoulder fire missiles that that is that is what it is the prisoner exchange calls for the release of five america citizens held in iron and return for five oronians under mention in the united states and again gives them six billion dollars the five america prisoners were placed under house arrest august tenth as a first step in the agreement the mine administration waited until of course september eleventh to inform that just the optical this this is what happens when you have a white house that legitimately does not care what the america people think and believe that the media will cover for them to matter what they do crap this on the anniversary of not eleven assuming that everybody will just shrug an maybe there right maybe everything is baked into the cake in's the polarized cake that nothing can outrage the america people at this point i do not acthiething that is i a making bat i think jobidon made that bet on a kannistan and it is sunk his approval ratings into the lo into low fort es high thirties and he is been their ever since 'sidthing the sorts of endamage jobidon i know that he thinks he is invulnerable because he is likely to run againstonal trump for president and there is some truth to that that means a durable forty five percent of the america public will certainly vote for him but forty five ain't fifty sees playing a very risky game here by the way speaking of a white house that clearly does not care about america defense according to politico president jo bison would veto a righting to fence funding big that's slated to be considered on the house floor this week according to his administration what makes it right wing what makes a right wing that the republicans are saying we do not want tax pair dollars used to fun peoples travel to other states to get abortions was last i chat when i pay for military budget typically when ism paying fort is the basic medical care of the people or serving the america military they can go an break things in kill people that america needs to breaking kill in or to maintain its own security b that is what it is for but the white houses tenno unlessyou can to spend that money on abortion in the military were just not con sign it where icon a sign it it'd rather under fun the military its not onto pay for abortion is the white houses position here theadministration says including to visit policy provisions within the appropriations bill also dramatically increases the threat of a continuing resolution which red further damage america national security again all that was here is that house republicans included provisions to block funding for the pentagon's policy of allowing troops to travel for abortions as well as surgery and hormone treatments for trains military personal the the therepublicans are one increase the military budget you now to spend on military things but here is a not paying for you to take your babies where other state to kill it and you to cut of your those the things were not con to pay for t her's complete list of things were it con to pay for and white houses no you will pay for people cutting off they are they are balls that is a thing you will pay for or there will be no restock no on the black hawks which which partycares bout national security in the situation's just wondering you are clearly holding hostage america national security see can cut the balls off dudes that is what you are talking about right here which is nuts ism sorry by any moderate stretch of the imagination that is crazy and as far as the abortion policy if your parent dies out of state and you go out of state to visit your your grieving mother because you are dad died the military is not on a pay for that but if you go out of state to take your baby two to a in abortion clinic and get it killed then jobiton says that must be paid for by the medical taxman now re member for most of jobidon's cheer he is big backer of the called hight amendment which band legislation that use tax pair running for abortion he is decided that is no longer the case now you ought to pay for that abortion again the in the person them sell paying for you it is you paying for the abortion it is mean for the abortion and the media of course play this as though it is the right word tending the tending tilt of the of the spending bill the right were tilt of the spending bill they apparently the bill is a non star with sent democrats it is just it it is incredible it is absolutely incredible this is what they are holding up clearly in ad ministration the cares deeply about america national securities winning six billion yes see yes six billion dollars to the eonian no money is the military unless it is also going to pay for a woman to have a acinus sold to her clear our priorities are absolutely clear here and just one second we will get to the fact that again join is inaudibly vulnerable and the offenders of him by his allies are going weaker and weaker when we talk about abortion here and the fact that democrats want to pundit we should point out that abortion continues to rage across the united states by some numbers is actually elevated this year because there is many people here free to out about the possibility they will not be able to abort their baby that they are trying tactic do it right now but there is a way that you can help prevent this and that would be by giving to reborn reborn network of clinics experiences over two hundred miracles per day reborn gives women it in plan pregnancies free all for sounds introducing them to the beautiful life growing inside hero one she hearts the heartbeat the chance of her babies life doubles because of your generosity reborn can do all of this for just twenty eight bucks per ultrasound all gifts are tacteductable and go entirely to saving babies some day you might meet a baby that yourescued maybe they will save a life the way the you have to day one thing is for sure you are not on regret saving a life because life is indeed medical and can do it for not a lot of money i of to do is don't by dining pounds fifty and a keyword baby that is pound two five zero baby ogle to reborn dot caiman slashed that is reborn dot calm slash benyurno can do anything remotely important dago t reborn dot calm slashed and give generously case give in the fact that this administration is in fact a bleach and most that leap is is is appearance in the for policy from the metric policy's bad enough but you can spins master policy on on a foreign level what america is in favor of sinning chin checks the utopians what america and what it what america is in favor of putting america national security it is som person with general is fora can be shot up with testosterone what what exactly is that is the balance there that america are in favor of well the defenses of biding are now coming fast and first when you are defending your losing the something both parties you remember by the way the republican parts remember this with trump if you spend the rest of the election scale defending trump you are going to lose because again if everybody's talking a how bad your guy is and you just spend the entire time talk about how he is really not that bad you gang lot and for democrat's the same thing if you spend the entire election cycle talking about jobidon is not that bad we all know he is to here is anal of our trying to do work on h behalf of the bide administration talking bout it it is all is a far it is all in your head this is one i favored approaches from the genius is over the view is stuffy you can clearly see happening in front of your eyes is not real because anal of a says tit administration has really got a ton of very difficult by part of ton legislation through in a divided congress whet the very difficult fan make up o fiftificty by part of ta infostructior about by part of ten fat community a first major in legislation an tractate you as a novation and competition a by part o tan climate heal carat tacpapige faithful resposabilitiac and the list is long what o they ne to focus on man to focus on the on tenable job bison is old and that the narrative that ben created to was panic awful and that is o what the recon part of that neritic job bison is old and coma hairs is unprepared ism a that is not a narrative jobidon is old and hoiden is also terrible at his job he is terrible is job it meanwhile they are trying to clear the field against any potential democrat might run against mobile mess again he is intensely vulnerable here is the thing that that if you were truly a rebel as for example oleander o cosequetas believes she is if you are truly a rebel then you would run at mobile from his left you would cay know alexandra ocosocretas she is thirty three years old i believe that she would be the radically hello able for the presidency the truth is that she could easily pick up the ball where burning sanders left off and run against golden from his left because he is really really funeral but none of them are doing it why because the democratic party is in fact a vehicle for radical leftism this is the difference between the right and the left in trams their parties reminders do not trust the re publican party because they do not believe it is vehicle for their ideas democrats trust the democratic party because they do believe that is a vehicle for the principles that is why the all standing shoulders shoulder behind the old man meanwhile that old man is using the white house as ha military weapon again social media all gets that momentarily first we have a great dog his name is happy he is incredibly cue one the best things about happy is that he really allows my kids sorest ghat rub of him my my seven year old son hes extra energy now jump around with the dog and dogs jumping around with him it is extremely he woe want to keep happy sitting a happy and healthy life which is why we give him rough greens every morning the dog food you have been giving your dog is dead food does not have much nutritional value take look at it that brown food does not exactly scream at nutrition but green

green stop comslash men let rough greens bring your dogs food back's life that is argue f f greensdot come lashed pen today rough greensdot tom slash mentoday or call eight three three dog thirty three that is eight they three my dog thirty three o a meanwhile the bine administration for fraudtog about the doing on the foreign front on the domestic front what the bine demonstration has done with regard to social media is one of the most creepy and tyrannical things that have seen in my lifetime an extends the truth is beforebidon i i the governments use of its powers to cudgel social media into doing what they want is utterly insane this is something that the fifth court c explicated over the weak end on fridge they limited the scope of district sort ruling the re stricter communications between government agencies and social media companies but they found that several agencies likely violated the first amendment this should be top of page news and in en hero where the media actually cared about freedom of speech which they clearly do not at this point of would be top of the page news and when when when donate trump was saying things the person the enemy the ball animal we go was this an attack on the first amendments unamerican how can you say that there not enemies of the meanwhile you have actual government agencies going to social media websites and telling them to shut down fully certain street of information another metis because if the mainstremedia agrees with a thing it becomes truth if the mainstremedia disagrees with a thing it becomes falsehood and it would be good if that thing were suppressed well here is the thing makingthe argument the social media is a private entity and can make its one rules that carries only far as the government is not pressuring the private entity into doing the thing one too government agent you cannot do that thing if the government puts guns your head and tels you to do a thing you are now a government agent that means that whatever you do is attributable to the governments of the government those to social media and they say to them either you regulate to speech or we regulate you which is effectively with democratsmen saying sinceabout twenty eighteen if they say that sort of thing this turn social media companies into operations of the government once their operations of the government then the pressure that government brings to bear is in factiviolation the firth first amendment which is exactly whit the fifth circuit court of appeal says according to s in b s the ruling will make it easier for several federal agencies to communicate with social media companies still officials who remain subject to the modified injunction including goes in he white house must remain careful their discussions with the platforms will not be construe as coercive a three judge panel of the fifth circuit court of appeals concluded that the white house surgeon general's office and f bey likely violated the first amendment by coercing social media platforms into moderating posts on their signs it also said that the see c likely violated the first amendment the appeals court decision says that some federal agencies will not be subject to the injunction but they did say and it that it is a pretty amazing ruling they did say that the pressure brought to bear on social media companies by the federal government is a violation of the first amendmentwhich it clearly is and that pressure is obviously continuing here is the thing once that you near out a battle the campy undone let us say that the cedycy is not pressuring any more but the messages arty out there the pressure exists the threat is already out there if allophone threaten to burn down your bar because you would not pay the protection money and he did that a year ago if probably look in to pay him the protection money even after a court says he really should not do that andthat is effectively its happening right now according it to the washington post threads is currently blocking searches on the topic of bovid and valines histogram's tease social platform threads which is supposed to be the inserts you twitter rolls out it is new search function but not even twenty four hours later the company was in brain controversy when users went to threads to search for content related to covet and long bovid they're went with a blank screen that showed no search results and a pop linking to website of the cede s nowt is about government pressure about the government pressuring social medium to shutting down actual social media posting an just linking directly to the governments that is we're welling in crap media acknowledged in a statement to the washington post that threads is intentionally blocking those search terms and said other turns are being blocked as well the company did not give a list but those words include sex need gore porn o case far i suppose all right and then corona biraspacines an vaccination those are blocked now you will be delegate you will be directed explicitly to government sources the search functionality temporarily does not provide results for cures that may show potentially sensitive content is out potentially sensitive content because god forbid you should get the non government side of the story since the government was absolutely honest with us during the loved give i men there are there being stones with us now now that you've got the white house promoting masking again amazing stuffer and and the fact that that is not a national scandal demonstrates more can anything how corrupt the media these again the media you'd imagine would be profit amendment well not much of you imagine that all this would be wind in the sales for republican's going into twenty twenty four after all this is terrible governments this is tyrannical use of social media the america people are not up for all this all republicans have to do is be not stupid well oops republicans always have a way of a of doing dumb things all the talk right now about how kevermc earthy is going to be basically deprived of his speakership ism just wondering what is the upside i kep darkness a'veben asking the since there is the original rebellion against my earthy it is one thing to leverage my earthy for more confessions the conservative side of the ow that is fine that is a strategy the haft people land the plan it is not a strategy what if we get rid of my earthy and then we have no one to back him up what f we us have a random speakership fight people can get ontevy this sort of stuff is deeply in helpful according to politico rev my earthy is facing the greatest peril to his speakership since he clawed his way into the lobate months ago with multiple factions of his party outing and a looming revolt ahead during a battle to fun the government actor con sedative members of the house copper are talking in unsettle terms about turning on monarchy if he does not take a hard line in negotiations with the senateand the by administration at let me just point out here jo widen in the senate all they have to do as say we are willing negotiate in the not negotiate in order t win this battle they made a crucial tactical blunder during the last round of these negotiations jobidon are committed beforehand to not negotiating that gave my earthy rooms say that he was the negotiator and eventually by n had negotiate the rule in these sorts of political brinksmanship situation is that the america public our pro which ever party shays the come to the table and you say y will not come tot table then alike you if you are already starting off with were not coming to the table and the unless is something that you are certainly not going to get from the democrats well then the democrats probably win that in the battle of public opinion my earthy according to politico is a political survivor even his critics cannot and i his skilled nature as an accommidator his persistence in winning over even his most doge t critics but interviews h more than two dozen shut he members an ages reveal hitwold take only a few rogue law makers hell bens on his downfall to risk my party's satin an entirely new way sending the party spiralling into new peridotite case even if those defectors failed to actually eject monarchy some the speaker's confidence privately conceived there may be no way to recover according to bob good is vocal my carthyte tractor he says the speaker faces two choices he stares down the senate stairs down the white house forces them to cave in is a transformational historic speaker or he can choose to make a deal with democrats not let me just be clear about this there is no situation which he deals not cot wit democrats you do not won door why because the president is a democrat is the senate what is amazing to me is it i am morefiscally conservative than virtually every one in congress i also happen to live in this world called reality where you do not get to unit laterally dictate the terms of engagements when the other side hold most of the cards the president has redo power the presidenthasi the entire media on his side an can fight this battle you can say willing now the president really should cave on this and should really cave on this and you might beagle to price certain confessions away from don they are able to do this last time they got some small concessions from him but if you are talking about effectuating large scale change with a democrat president and a democrat senate good luck to you by the way would have been really helpful here is winning that would been superhelpful if you actually want to effectuate large shall change not be great controlling the house of representatives causes that be sum rolling folk is on running good candidates in swing district hell why do not we focus on nominating the most electable republican for president lizzinghan drive out democratic turn out that might be away to actually effectuate large sale change or is the idea here they just yell at your leadership class and in and if you yelled tom long enough than magic happens i i do not know but honestly it is it is one of these bazar tweets where the logic goes something step one yellow your leadership step too dot dot dot step here fiscal conservatism we the dotottot is the whole thing guides you need to figure out exactly what your strategy and your play here is again ism not saying you count leverage my martian to been more can sedative ism fined with that i think that is good i think pressure from his right is a good thing the point i makings tat if you start off with a series of demands that are utterly unrealistic and and if there people in the conservative ecosystem and the conserve immediate ecosystem who suggest that government shut downs are going to be a wave toward political victory here with a democratic sent and democratic president when at deal as can get sign i do not understand what exactly the upside is what republican all republicans need to provide right now is a sense of sobriety is the sense that they know what they are doing all ism asking for as always is a plan that is it give me a plan a ah i do not any republican strategy that is not a strategy at all its an impulse if t if the if the impulse is yell at my earthy until good things happen that is not a strategy and it is not a plan if the impulse is nominate whomever and run them against biding without any plan for victory what is the plan if the plan is shout that the last selection cycle was stolen and then have know plans to actually reverse that or explain even how you would attempt to do that is not a plan that is an impulse impulses do not make for political victory no democrats have continuously plans it is what they do professionally for example according to politico in he past nine days state and federal judges through out two congressional maps and help the democrats of what a worse case snare in oho kicking off an unusually busy redistrict an calendar heading into the election year all told a dozen or more seats across at leas six states could be re drawn in creasing the likely ho democrats could chip away the five seat goop e housematrorty through re distracting alone democrats could pick up an extra seat including in flora allabama and louisiaing their deep bred states perhaps several more in new york republicans could still pic up as many as forces o north caroling but the recent rulings put democrats in a position to offset some of those losses and then sum again they are finding judges who are overthrowing these districts that are drawn and then they are basically creating democratic districts that is what they are doing right not that is a plan when republicans by thewy play the game they can win his the other thing is this notion out there that republicans cannot play the game is the game is rigged bet an when it comes to ball harvesting yes republicans can play tat game and they can win that what happen in floated during the last election cycle yes the judiciary was rigged against republicans and then republicans created the federal a society and spent thirty years building up an entire bench of judicial nominee and then too control the supreme court yes you can do this but it requires actual plans i understand that the easiest thing in politics to think for to day and maybe for to morrow but never for ten years for now that is not going to achieve it and and here is the big question what exactly do expect my earthy to do my party's actually giving us what we want i say us to conservative not from o spending which is not capable of doing and no one's capable of doing any the way i do find it ironic that many of the same people who are shouting by hamocarthy is not sufficiently conservative spending our talking about the wonders of of for example president trump who says we should not restructure social security medical ormeticade which are the biggest spending programs in america life baron but put that aside my earthy is in fact moving toward n i peaches inquiry if that something you care about my party's doing it according to fox news cave my earthy will tell house republicans to day being an i preachment inquiry against bison is the logical next step the house job conference plans to hold the meeting on thursday morning for a see committed chairs to lay out their latest findings and the status of the investigations into the

support impeachment inquiry against bison is not certain that actually the house republicans have the votes to do it there is several people lawmakers including ken buck and don bacon of nebraska have voice skepticism about peaches which is interesting because buck is a fiscal conservatives also pushing my earthy from the right in terms of spending said cut it is come from weird bad fellows here

dumb ya i mean washington d c actually wrote black last matter in giant letters on the street and if that will not solve crime i frankly do not know what will they created a gorge flood square it was it was it was the moment the moment that all crime was goingtond in washington d c and then mum yet it turns out washington decks a terrible get a place filled with out crime according to the washington post a shaken washington copes with surging violence this is not normal oh is not it though according to the washington post stephany henchman a north west washington vent planner nose may sound almost absurdly cautious as she describes how after a regular sundae dinner at a friend's house i blocks away she travels by carninstead of walking home she has her reasons a yearago show waken by gun fire outside her dams organ apartment building and from her seven floor wind saw car speeding away and almost after a night out with a friends for user driver wouldn't reach her building because police had blocked office street where bullets had just killed two men in finally wounded a third it is ridiculous henchman said on whether hand i dot want a wanna we get shot filing crime as longbeen part of washington life the worst of it during the early nineteen nineties when drug traffic propelled the annual homicide told nearly five hundred and d c earned an in glorious reputation as america at murder capitals as show during this period that washington d c had to rename its baseball i you'll recall that washington d cs baskeballteam in the nineteen eighties was called the washington bullets and then they had to rename themselves because oops and that is hen they became the washington wizards as though and office walking the streets of washington d c the volume of carnal these days not nearly as hi most c review residents are unlikely to ever be a victim of violence but a sharp rise an rime over the past year punctuated by our ports of homicides at brazen shootings in car jacking by area name's is rattling a city already struggling to recover from them pandemic that up ended its rights on ravage it is once thriving downtown i i wonder how this happen oh maybe it was that you guises decided that the police were bad maybe that maybe that would be it the spike and felonies homicides in racers erupt twenty nine and sixty seven per cent from the same at time period last year according to police starts is not the only date causing alarm the number of juries arrested for car jacking has increased slightly since last year forty one of the sixty four charge between the ages of twelve and fifteen as of august thirty first eighty one miners have been shot in the city this year who while a preponderance of violence o cursewhere coffin has in the poor neighborhoods starts showed the geography of crime has become more diffuse with prosperous areas less immune than before well ism an equity equity suggest this is necessary voice to the richer areas also have to suffer from people being shot on the regular that that is that that is exciting stuff in washington to see keep voting democrat its working out great for you t same thing happening over in philadelphia by the way there is nuvidio the is emerged from philadelphia showing attics on the street in a trance state passed out on the sidewalk of the city's multiple homeless encampment i mean if this is not horrifying thurdwold crap ism not sure what is this is kensington areas in philadelphia for those cannot see tho idiot is people literally just lying on the street just in middle a broad daylight legonbeet out just people youwould think that this was some sort of a horrifying play it is not there is a homeless man who is just standing there on a street corner i mean this creepy is all living hell just people zoned out obviously drug users are seen according to the daily man hunched over with no control of their limbs others are sprawled across the garbage covered streets large groups have taken over the sidewalks turn them into homeless encampments were many people live in their own filth many of the attics living on the streets are force to turn to crime in theft to sustain themselves one local acts said businesses are using booby traps sprinkler systems to keep a drug attics away from their sore fronts business is and throwing soapy water on the ground it is wet and it is not a comfortable place to sit down there is businesses that sat a sprinkler systems as well crime day to reported by the philadelphia inquirer shows kensington has one o the highest drugrates in the city apparently one of the m one of the worst drug's on the street right now is is a drug known is thank for those who do not know that is a potent animal tranquilizer called diazine is a powerful sedative and a people mix it with sentinel to make that even deliver and worse that is something new your time'sbeen reporting on for a while back in canary there's entire story about this see glassine causes wounds that erupt with a scaly dead tissue called scar untreated it can lead to amputation in induces a black out super for hours rendering users vulnerable to rape and robbery when people come too a high from the sentinel has long since fated the immediately crave more because diazine is a sensitive not an opioid it resists standard opioid overdo reversal treatments more than ninety per cent of philadelphia's lab tested dope samples are now positive at ferzilazine it is too late for chilly said shown at westfall outrage worker with prevention point philadelphia thirty yards health services center in kensington chilly supply is saturated if other places around the country have a choice to avoid it they need to hear our story a study published in tune has detective delaine in the drug supply in thirty six states as well as dree in new york city zilasin has been found in then to five per cent of drug samples but the saturation is certainly greater and this is scary scary stuff the drug exists in a legal grown it was improved fifty years ago by the it a as a veterinarian prescribed the anal mesic it is not lis it as controlled substance for animals are human sot's not subject to strict mongering but it is started of course with them prescription opioid when tho those came hard to come by people started moving on to thank this is what we have done to large swats of our population its it is all working out great by the wayguises all all this is working out beautifully probably a little bet were left wing polices will fix these cities el maybe may we have some needle exchanges for the thank that will that will definitely help one maybe we get rid of the copse was really the prove here in systemic racism yow as i said oralear when i came to the republican congress yelling at bad things in life is not a solution to the bad things and yet that seems to be the policy that is being followed in these cities i do not thank is not a solution to drink i do not home zombies on the street is it a solution to homelizombson theatre you knot's a solution ore law in force me notes a solution monitory drug drying out you not in actual solution in voluntary commitment from mentally ell these our actual solutions the re queer actual funding and they fix the problem but that may require somebody actually have the courage to see that in an area wore s not popular and more than that is not about courage my politicians it is about voters coming to grips with reality at a certain point caplin the politicians any more if were not cutting our at maybe it is because we do not want a cut our get let politicians much as you want or we can lame the fact that people have no capacity to think second order when it comes to politics already folks time for some things at that play a pretty well one of things we here at the menspirshows burstcold than one of our biggest sponsor is obviously and we talk with them averse offer about the state of the economy joining us on the line wright now as fill a iatric a precious metal specialist from bersgoll chili let us talk about the state of the economy i in right now join is claiming we have strong economic growth in elation is coming under control how to you see it ye i mean we you can cherry pick the numbers an certainly make that argument but i think its o mistake to sit is just on economic grow an the real question i think is is how is the economy working to mace america in the numbers really do not the good o for the lost two an a hard years licit to rice's at home up twenty per cent electricity up twenty one castling prices up seventy two per cut let us tic of people's bust expense right am housing men payments race twenty nice per sand median mortgage payments up eighty five per cent and very important wage trace is trailed in fraction consistently an in a the words if its not just our imagination just dirty everyesensial is more expense i to day then it was before biding got in office and wag just just have not kept up i cansumat at is recently hid an old time over trivial dollars for the first time o i think people desperately trying to maintain their living standing in the face of by d not make slip tin that's to reality for most america to day despite how we thing dress up the number chilli one o the thingsthat their claiming now is that they have brought inflation under control the fellow rest are obviously has increased interest rates to sky migrates is why mortgages are now clacking in at seven eight per cent now the reality is that by historical averages the interstate tarns actually all that high et this point but also the the inflation rate is not all that low at this point is a at a talkwriht now about the inflactiu ran being under control but the usually tiring it two per cent it is its well an access of three per entails a still fifty per cent too high but they are till claiming now that may they an a stop with the increases in the interest race yet the inflation generally as good good news i but this a couple of points to remember first of all inflation is cumulative r i defend per cent inflation a one year followed by five per cent next means that everything cost fifteen per cent more easing inflation does not mean a return of purchasing powers just destroying it more slowly now the other side of things which i think is very important is the feds preferred measure of inflation which is corps personal con sumption expenditures they have been more than double as you mention the two per cent target for years now the only thing that is really been driving that headline inflation number down as been energy players and of course their starting to free epic and royal heat ninety dollars a barely just a few days ago it is particularly concerning to letting what is showing us now that is i inflation is becoming intrenched in the economy and i think this two per cent target the fed have may be a pipe dream for the foreseeable future its proving particularly sickly at the moment in told one of the things that is become patently obvious really since two thousand seventy thousand ate how much power the central bankers have over the economy and there used to be a time s now decades togo where legislatures really had sort of the chief control over the economy and you could hold them responsible if the policies were bawd there is still an interest in some level of physical discipline because you could just print dollars will evilly in then pump them ins the economy or below the debt off for a couple of generations o we less not true any more and that means that the central banister can given us extraordinary power to control how much you are dollars are worth particularly ones you vary pay taxidone in there in the bankaray ye i need's absurd the power that the feelers have have as is really showing itself in to days economy and the reality is as you mention there an unelected body we really cannot hold them accountable and this federeserve has a problem as well that the tools that they have available i think of very limited their ability to was rate significantly enough to crush inflation is limited the to what they did to the banks earlier this year and you know the ability to fix the economy by lowering rates and stimulating all very limited as well they have got their hands tired behind their back but but i agree with you the feathers as a body the power that they have over the economy is concerning when there unelected and and unaccountable missing the this pateric's a precious metal specialist and spokesmen for burke gold groups of thou i get the question all the time that in in a really sort of uneasy e economy this in a really is uneasy no one knows obviously where where to put their money it looks to me the real estate market is going to have some sort of sell off here just because the mortgage rates are high as lost stickiness because people do not actually want to sell their homes because then tell have t take a new mortgage that is not going to be at two point five presents can to be at seven per cent but it some point people will lose their jobs they'll lose their savings than there gan a have to sell those houses the same things happening in commercial real estate i ben talking with people in commercial real estate and the occupancy rates are a dropping fairly rapidly at this point and the lemmings the underlying value is is really going downtime lost journal has widely reported this meanwhile when comes to the stock market a lot of uneasiness there new i piss are doing a fraction what they ware doing just a couple of of years ago and and meanwhile if you if you put your money into a money market account you might be earning the best return it is a very confusing economy n obviously of a vested interest an with birch gold but what do you recommend in terms of things precious metals is a hedge against all this the tithing precious metals were very very well climates this simply because of the nature of our problem sri we have station which we mention we have potential resection on the horizon ti into that i think we have issues with our currently longer ton the world seems to be these amount distant sin from the dollar these things of course very negative in isolation but very positive dry just toast hate commodities golden us a the climates really good and as mention in i sections out there the moment a very limited a precious metals make a too sensing climate this chili iatric precious metal specialist spokesmen for birchgoll grub really appreciate the time folks if you do want to get involved with birchgold who talked about the malt on the show their responser of the program birczhgold will make surely have all of your questions answering ten end to ninety eight ninety it ninetyeiht toe free information cent on gold that that apples rating with the better business brows thousands of happy customers have trusted birchgall my self when it'd airs fight into gold go checking them out right ow by testing vend to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight fell billy appreciate the time thank you already time for some things that i hate what is going on in israel right now's actually quite astonishing om the supreme court of israel is claiming that it has the ability to strike down literally any law includingwhat they call the basic law in israel for violating the declaration of independence for israel let me put this in contact and it this has ramifications for the united states because this is the way that the left love to see court rule in the future and know the court of ruled in the past basically hears the way works the united states is worldly lucky be have written constitution which means that the very least you can refer to that document to determine what exactly quarts cannot do and cannot do in terms of striking things down whale late well legislatures canaccannot do israel is not have anything that israel has a declaration of independence which is not a piece of law it is a uses statement of broad purposes about how israel should be jewfish and democratic butts pretty much what it is it is not law there is no constitution there because the is rallies could not come to some sort of agreement about how exactly the government should work what laws we in bounds what what was constitutional what was not s they basically just a reed to disagree that means that every often they pass wat they call a basic law a basic law is a piece of majoritarian legislation that then carries with it in inability to override that law except with sort of a supermajority these basic laws exist that been created throughout is daily history the supreme court of israel typically has used basic law in ore to strike down non basic law sin the same way that the prime court of the united states will use the constitution to strike down particular legislation the same thing sort of happens here in israel the prim court historically has used the basic laws as it as a way of striking down non basic law now in the nineteenineties there is a seizure of power by the supreme court and they decided that from now on they could basically just reasonableness to strike down a variety of executive actions and legislation well be binityn ow whose current coalition thy said the supreme court has to much power r do not want them to do that any more shenanigan have to site something that is not reasonableness if you an a strike down legislation and they want o make the basic law are they they action voted this in a basic lasing this will now be the law of the state o israel and it is considered quasi constitutional one of the questions the big question that is now come up before the supreme court is whether the supreme sort of israel can strike down a basic law in the name of in name of lie again normal in the united states use the constitution to strike down at apiece legislation in israel the basic law is the quasi constitutional highest law how can the supreme court site something else to strike down a basic law the argument that is currently happening at the supreme sort level is whether the supreme court can use the declaration of independence to strike down a law say that imagine if the supreme court of the united states went back to the declaration of independence and sad that because the declaration of independence says the you have the pursuit of happiness that means that we can strike down anything we want we all go wo who gave you that power that is not that is a pretty vague sentiment free to strike down things but that is pretty much what israel supreme court is now declaring they're now declaring that because they do not the current legislature of the state of israel they have willy silly power to strike down anything they want in the name of an incredibly vague documents the declaration of depends of the state of israel which is not in fact practical law it does not spell out how the state of israel disposed to work it does not spell out how the cannetset is supposed to work it does nutshell out virtually any of these things it has a bunch of sort of base line statements about what they hope the state of israel will be i talking about ow it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of its inhabitants and will be based on freedom justice and piece and will ensure complete equality of social and political rights and will guaranty freedom of religion conscience language education and culture but those are pretty vague statement to strike down a piece of legislation that simply says the supreme court does not have the ability to say that something is unreasonable and then strike it down if the supreme court were do this its constitutional crisis in israel is effectively what they are saying is that elections can be overwritten by the supreme court anytime that any time a basic laws establish which again is supposed to you be is though the congress of the united states and various state legislatures passed the constitutional amendment to the constitution and the supreme out then stepped in and said in the name of the declaration of independent we strike down this constitutional amendment by well you cannot do that no one gave you the power to do that that is basically was happening right now according to the times israel during fraught exchanges between the court and the attorneys defending the legislation one justice indicated israel democracy was at stake again i have to say the irony of people speaking in the name of judicial tyranny saying that there doings on behalf a democracy is really galling it is really really galling basically the supreme court right now is arguing there should be neoteric name your limits what are the limits on the supreme court of israel there are none according to the supreme court of israel and according to many of its supporters they lost in election they do not let the results of the elections o now they are going to use the supreme court basically establish that there are no limits at all you on buyback is the attorney representing o the government the argue the justices are empowered to interpret the legislator's words there is no legal or constitutional basis for them to review basic laws in response justice alit stone askebon back what is the source of the contact authority to legislate laws buyback point to to i nineteen fifty supreme court ruling skin note the theconnessit was form before that the original power source was in the declaration of independence well yes in the sense that it says there would be elegislatturpreted does not garlic specific provisions on how lists o work all that was established later other justices also challenged buyback indicating that in their views since the declaration of independence to finds israel as a decision democratic state the cannesset cannot legislate laws even basic laws the are rode israel jewfish or democratic character which means that the high court continually strike down whatever it wants to sign strike down which is pretty amazing stuff again the declarasioment dependence oath state of israel is in fact a basic document but that does not mean the it empowers the supreme court to override anything in the name of the declaration of independence any more than the supreme court t of the united states can use the declaration of independence which they far more important document to the western civilization to to strike down law the supreme cortamost never sites the declaration of independence because there is no purpose to doing it is not a piece of legislation if if the supreme court n israel does that it is going to be a a rather large mass cause a huge percentage of theserealy populations an believe that elections basically have no consequences at all unless you are on the left in which case they just run rough shot that is really negative stuff and have have railed in the united states against people in the united states doing this routine where if the bad guise whin that means the democracy is over there doing it n israel to it is really bad for any civilization a divine the rest of the show is continuing right now in oconormisit we will be talking about our

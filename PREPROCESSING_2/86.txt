the benshfir show sponsor express if the pan protect our online pray to day express plan dreams lashes there is no substitute for america strength and here is no justification for america weakness that is what the world has been finding out over the course of jobidon's presidency when jobidon entered office iron was under heavy sanctions and its proxies increasingly and perish the graham a cords were beginning to consolidate a powerful antiranian soon judicial lines with salty arabia widely assumed to be the next shootadrop afghanistan had not been surrendered to the salaam grain had not been invaded by russia less than three full years into jobidon's term iron has been emboldened and its proxy strengthen all of this is linked to the by administrations decision to seek a deal with on involving the in freezing of funds and the freeing up overanian oilily as well as the by administrations early attempts to marginalize the south government and two weeks ago cranial back terrorists group comas launched the worst attack against jaws since the holiest cabala another cranial proxy which effectively controls lebanon and has at least one hundred and fifty thousand sophisticated rockets aimed at israel north has been firing spastic rockets into israel north swell thanks to comas the tax on israel and israel necessary response the sauries have now table talks regarding normalization with the jewfish state and things are getting worse just yesterday the iron backed soothes we seized control of much of demon's north fired three missiles at israel an america had to shoot them down using a carrier in the region there is brigadier general strider pends on pressecretary explaining just what happened by pestering these us navalasets and advance fighter aircraft in the region we aim to sand a strong message intended to deter a wider conflict to bolster regional stability and of course to make it clear that we will protect and defend our national security interest to that and the crew of the guided missile destroyer us s carny operating in the northern red a earlier to day shot down three land attack crusemissiles and several drones that were launched by who the forces in yeomen this action was a demonstration of the emigrated air and missile defense architecture that we have built in the middle east and that we are prepared to utilize whenever necessary to protect our partners and our interests and this important region there were no casualties to u s forces and none that we know of to any civilians on the ground information about these engagements s still being process and we cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting but they were launched from common heading north along the red sea potentially towards targets in israel remember it was jo bison's administration that listed the soothes those the people just fired those missiles as a terrorist group ins twenty twenty one despite the fact that their charming slogan runs quotes deft to america death to israel curse the news victory to island it does not in but you can do what it same also yesterday baronial back forces launched ta drone attack on a military base in southern syria where you as troops have a presents one drone was down but another causeminor injuries the base is located according to the times of israel at a sensitive juncture often used by baronial backed gratis to theory weapons to the vessel a terra group that same days during opposition back this said that drones were used to an attack an oil facility housing america troops in the region and that is not all on thursday night according to the jerusalem post drones and rockets targeted the in all sad air bates which hoses us and other international forces in western rock and multibal blast were herd insidethe bates this is upon testing the united states without question and so last night jobidon had a really important job he had ta reestablish america credibility particularly in the mildest he had a shoo on and its proxies that america would not allow the regions spin into chaotic islands he had to demonstrate strength of will he had ta show he would not be side tracked on to other issues an that he was not under the misimpression he could simply throw money at his enemies by early indicators present widen has failed last night he gave a discombobulated and confuse speech a bazarmics of solid promises to back israel againstkamss and off topic promises with regard to additional aid u crane strange blathering about america is lamafobia combined with a weird utterance regarding the necessity of a palstingan state was not particularly reassuring for anyone which means in all likelihood that iron will continue testing the united states they will continued to poke and prod and up the anti in the expectation that jo bison is bluffing and will full and here is thermel problem no one really knows if they are right including maybe hoiden right now on the northern border of israel casually is mobilizing according t the pastry journal israel order the evacuation of a city close to ebony's border reflecting the is really militaries growing concern that a second front could open up to the north as it continues its bombing campaign in gaze including a strike on a church compound overnight now by the way that strike on the church compound which was originally report bahamas it turns to was strike on a church as a place near a church as always comas they la israel on fridge also released more details about the hostages captured bahamas israel defense ministry said residents of curiochmona a city of twenty two thousand people will be moved to guest houses now provided by the states usually forces and lebanon his ballad have ben exchanging fire continuously in recent days now casually maybe attempting to up the anti in the north to draw troop presents away from the gasestrip or they maybe testing seeing how far they can go without the america getting involved cabala has been attacking idea posts yesterday two cusblan members were killed and one moderately hurt usually tank shells were preparing attacks there ware drones that were hitting mortar launching sells swell things are heating up on israel northern front all of that as happening because iron is testing everywhere from a each two serial two yeomen they are testing literally everywhere in the region to see how far they can push before they get push back which is precisely what you would expect from a regime that believes that its opposition is week and that means that it is up to the less to demonstrate strength obviously with that means for israel is they need to destroyhams wholesale without is out every one agrees on this comas has to go i comas word to survive the accistential threats of the state of israel is quite real not just because cams would continued to exist in the goes strip and continued to prepare further terror attacks but also because this would in flame the paining authority and his woman method to start to increase the violence in the called western today and to very and it would prompt hes ballad to increase its violence in the north providing israel with a three front war if israel is prompted into that three from war by the way israel have to strike back with all of its strength which would presumably prompt the entry of serial and on into any sort of war which would prompt america intervention of you wish this thing to slow down if you wish for this thing to cool now what you need is for israel to be given a free hand to destroy compass in the gozistrip wall making clear to the rest of the region particularly iron eonian proxies that if they get involve they to we will be destroyed an a second own t give you the latest from the situation in goa because it is becoming increasingly clear what has to happen over there and then we will get to jo bison speech from the oval office last night again it was meant to be a speech of strength and resilient and instead it was confused it was dis combobulated it was off topic it was very weird he said some good things and settle lot of things that were either irrelevant or weren't attempt to essentially cram a crap hand which down the throats of the america people in terms of spending willet to that momentarily first n a talk you about dailywars most

get started to day i get the situation in the gotestrip continues to be disastrous for the israilies there still up to two hundred people still unaccounted for on clear ho many those people are dead israel is every day discovering bodies that mutilated beyond recognition still in the south of israel this is why whenever you see comas issues statistics five hundred dented to hospital by the way it ended up being ten according to the unpins from a rocket fired by palling in his comity hod just to put a cap on how many lies commasstellsin it what in extraordinary clip the they tell this like israel is still digging bodies out of the rubble and it could be the dear two hundred people our hostages or could be that their one hundred people who are hostages in one hundred of those people are dead and burned beyond all recognition at least thirty children our among the confirmed at gaze hostages according to the idea we should recall that ecus everybody seems to believe that they are under the weirdness impression hat we do not have a massive hostage crisis by the way worse tan the banian hostage crisis in the sense that these are a these are actually small toilers there so small children women for almost as surely being raped the rest of the world is ignoring that calling for a sense fire and by the rest of the world i really mean the international left lot of governments are our acknowledging the israel has to do what to has to do in order take out commodities when including the european parliament shockingly enough the m the gosistrip again continues to be a force of rocket fire apparently the run to electricity an water bat not rockets that continue to fire those rockets israel is is faced with a a basic choice and that is do they wait to go in until they have thoroughly devastated the areas surrounding the tunnels such that they can blow up the tunnels and thus save thousands of hisraily lives or do they go along in the international community put a found soldiers into basically somalia a black hawk down snare or there just walk in through heavily crowded urban to rain with high buildings with terrorist in them and tear supporters in them and terra sympathizers in them there has been a lot of conflict inside these real government over exactly the timing on this thing you have former preministirenoug tolly bennet for example who is been saying that israel needs to crush its opposition that is going to take time and if israel needs to wait to do that until the i f can do everything that it can due to clear the ground then it should absolutely do that that seems to be the prevailing thought among more frailly members of government these days an i thing that that is the right thought by the way if it were america it'd be saying obviously same thing i have said obviously the same thing i do not the idea of america troops going to heavily crowded areas with lots of terrorist in them in the mistaken impression the minimizing civilian casualties is in some way more important than the lives of america soldiers that in it that is not correct if the reality is that any country worth it is all has to protected soldiers you have to give them rules of engagement that they are capable of carrying forth effectively and sacrificing blood in order to pro test civilians tat are being used is human shields by terrors is a bad strategy gives the upper hands to the terrorist obviously israel may continue the bombing campaign for while that presumably is why humble is can have broiling up in the north in any case israel is still warning the possibility of ground invasion may be imminent according to the times of israel seniors rally officials talked up the prospect of that imminent largescale ground campaign in the gosestrip to root out the commons terror group thursday man a series of visits to idea soldier station near the territory predicting the fighting will be difficult long and intend the fence minister goal gallant told troops near got of the or to enter the commons run at pasting an on clave would come soon you said you see now gossip from a far sunualty if from the inside the order will come now is quite possible that that is a misdirect by the israel the government that what they are saying at this point is notrael because what they want commossibelieve is that the ground invasion is imminent get all the civilians out of the way in the sense that we the ones we cannot use its as shields are into be an obstacle to killing is rally soldiers to get them out ogle that is a possibility it is also possible ground invasion is imminent not clear exactly what is happening one thing is clear israel must get rid of comas and this conflict should be contain now that was supposedly the purpose of jordan speech last night drobidon gave his second t oval office dress of his presidency and again the idea here is to print project support for israel strength in the face of terrorism that is really all it about showing to current strength two baron's proxies and iron to contain the conflict and making clear that israel is going to have the material necessary in order to eviscerate commas from planed earth by the way a secondary conversation is going to have to be had by the israel govern about what to do about cowbell on the north because cabala obviously after watching what is happen over the corse last couple of weeks cannot be allowed train in southern lebanon either because there firing rock its it israel have a hundred n fifty thousand rocket point that it israel that would take out twenty to thirty thousand news if they were all fired israel can have to do something about husband president widen correctly for america interest is saying we do not want that border meeting up er things are you to get very hot very quickly but israel in the future is can have to do something about that northern border and everybody knows it it is beginning to emerge exactly what israel wants you about gaze it is exactly to have suggested at deva demilitarize zone that is significant in territory all around the gossip strip and then a new security regime inside gosh capable of allowing the isralies to actually go in and target terrace in the same way that israel still has the ability to go target derris in large scale cities with huge terra presence gonna in the west bank judo an maria in a second will gets you jobidon speeches will see if ye silly hit is marks will gets that moment first we take prayer really really seriously in the jewfish community you will regardless of your religion you need a lo more piece in your life and hallo is an incredible a that offers unique approach to prayer and meditation unlike other meditation as hallo is tailors specifically for people faith to deepen their relationship of god the hallo a is filled with studies meditations and reflections rooted in judo christian prepractcis you can pray alongside mark walkers jonnathon rosy who phrase jess in the chosen even some world class athletes you can a us the number not christian podcast the bible in a year with father macschmits on hallo with features progress tracking in streaks hallo helps you stay motive ate and make prayer a regular part of your daily routine set prayrminders invite others to pray with you tract your progress along the way and we in the jerscammee we pray three times a day minimum and i got tell you without that it'd be going totally insane right now if you are looking to deep in your relationship with god and approve your mental an a motion well being try hallo for three months free at hallo dot come slashipiro again that is hallo dot come slash chipiro o case to last night jobidon gives his oval office address cat's regret late and then he get started the being o the speech is totally fin and then as we will see it goes off the rails because jobidon strategy instead of being the twofold strategy than i am talking about provide israel the material that it needs in or to destroy comas and contain the conflict with the currents i those it that is the only two things in you to do last night instead of doing that he decided that his going to somehow link israel aid and you crane ads can make two thorns of the speech vatu crane which makes no sense at all and adagio political level that makes no sense at all o you make the case for you ran have made the case for you crane aid i believe that a continuing military aid package do you crane sufficient to prevent the ruffians from moving into further u cranial territory would be good have also suggested that there needs to be some sort of all from there because everybody knows that the frozen conflict and the lines of conflict are not changing very much to spite the amount material being poured in something can be negotiated that it hardens those lines and and we move on with our lives that would probably be a good thing with that set continue to aid until that point is reached would be a goo thing what in the hell does that have to do with israel fighting back a terror s threat on its own boys in real time why are those two things length make can make the case that those things are lingo because they have the same opposition and that is a fair point iron russia they are basically on the same side however the the urgent my of the moment is being generated not by the situation you crane remember that urgent situation arose a year ago it is strange it is it is connecting what happen on nine eleven with america conflict with with china or something i settle yes many bad things happen on the planet at once these things are not link and one the problems with linking them up is that all the people why are not supportive of ad u grain ire now going to be forced into the same boat as people who are supportive of with of ait of israel cabin is trying to rap everything into a nice bow here and and it does not work on any sort of intellectualevelant and he is also in this speech minimizing exactly the threat that israel faces which is not useful will go through it he starts off by pointing out the the corrected of is the compasses evil tar cepomonly pure on in evil in the world be sally the you people no perhaps penis anyone that there is online to the the gravity of people on that on on the cannon and it israel i a people tong the terminisiin also angry an a in keep deep pan g that would be correct obviously but then he moved in to this weird nether region this heard grab region where he starts talking about the two state solution and the peace process dude israel just got hit wit the worst terra taxons the holiest ism pretty sure that come ass new be wiped off the maptheran no two states solution there whole comes to the pelican authority is lomacyhod there are not no two statesolution they are either those of the governing parties in sudan maria the called west bank and in fact as i will show you the palcinian authority is fully supportive of compass's mission to destroy the state of israel where exactly is the two statesmen what is he even happening about now maybe you could take tactically what he is attempting to do is cool the waters a little bit that he what he is attempting to do is throw a sop to many of the arab states in the region do not worry the united states is going to still put pressure on israel who should let israel what they need to do maybe strategically that is what he is doing if ire to look at it in those positive possible life for present o bison sure or he could just shut the hell up because this is not the time to talk about a cuincld two state solution in the middle of genocidal jaw hating murderers murdering fifteen hundred jaws and their body's over in the west bank rallying in their support which is exactly what is happening right now here is join a to the present abs the police non authority a return the gotta common committed to the politician people it to dignity andiself termination the actions a looters do not pay that right away i many other ism heart broken i the tragic losing polishing lie concluding explosion i passion goes is not on bis celli we on every innocent lie lost we can nor you vanity innocent polishings o on living piece and have an opportunity get what he should have said then is and the only way that can happenings of come ass got but he did not do that in it by the way this is ay li okay when he is saying here that there is a full full shall suppuration between say the palmitin authority homos or between the population of the goes strip and commons hat's a few bad apples in the bosses trip an the rest of the people to totally diserithmos there is no evidence aback gat none in fact obviously there is tons of footage of civilians from goof running into the kobold seam stealing things in taking part the violence does not mean that every one there deserves to die in some sort of is really air strike it does not mean that they are cannot be some sort of the eventually deal that might be able to be out with a brand new leadership and a transform population not in indoctrinated with several generations of you hatred sure maybe some time if that time is not now in fact when he says things the palsinian authority tho ism telling ism tong mahout boy that that the palmitin piece crosses still on the table much loud a boss paid three million dollars two the terrorist who pepper treated this attack he has a paid for slave program it is still fully in place is against america law for us to employ that money does mate pausing an authority is still paying the families of derris a monthly seen for ever if they killed the u it is not just that ill present you evidence in just one second of what

issued to every mosque within its control to to give its it sort of fridge sermons here is what it says it says apparently there is a document published this morning you see it in the a big er by the ministry of endowments and the palcinan authority an reveal by research departments of the jewfish voice and rid of you movement the tels a series of instructions and messages for fridge sermons among them strongly antiseptic inciting messages including the famous hath quotation quote the hour will not come until the muslin fight the news and the muslin kill them until the new hides behind the stones and the trees and the stones of the trees say of muslin was servants all this the u behind me come kill him that is literally the palcinan authorities telling its mosques to say to day those are themoderates the jobidon is saying it is ouralmost cut a piecemeal with in the middle of a of a crisis spurred by genicitled you hatred and the great lie of the palstinin piece process since onset has been the you can negotiate your way ins piece withpeople who literally want to exterminate you that is not the same thing is t e territorial dispute any moron who compares this to the called troubles in ireland an anybody who who compares this to one party having a territorial dispute it another party religiously base but yes a dispute that can be solved territorially that is not even remotely what you are talking bout hereto have one party openly calling for the genocide of the other party and the rest of the for on wold mica diplomacy our way into this thing yet good luck it is worked out amazing over the past thirty years at my any one with half a brain could have told you from the very beginning solo was destined to failbeges again you cannot negotiate with genocidal derris i do not know why this is hard to for anyone to understand it is why again maybe maybe the vesicate you can make for johnnies he is trying to be tactical here to minimize conflict to cool the to cool the temperature but you coldvolseger shut the hell up because he is wrong on this just deadwrong then he decides to link us with you ran that gain utterly superfluous no reason what soever to do this the conflict in you crane has its own logic the conflict in you crane its ton ration out's also been going for a year and a half at this point for eighteen months that conflict has been going meanwhile this conflict is broiled up in the last two weeks and seems significantly more urgent and yet yurts jobidon spending half the speech on you crane you know to to gallons cosine twenty months of for tragedy e calling in flicking on the people of you crane people the er very badly her san to locks all out a we wot forgotten the make craves the body tor begin signs of torture great you is weapon bathe wish in thousand thousand any children forcibly takin into rush pollen from the cars its missend put represent different trash they hear thisni't common they both want to completely an blatant naberintomocrisy completely an fly at well i mean that may be true it is all o trough that china wants to annihilate i wan i but what are are all things the same when what is the rational for connecting the things seriously it turns out the rational for connecting these things i that jobidon once in out hose one hundred billion dollar package through congress most of which will go to you crane not to israel most of which will go to you crane now it may be that congress because it is completely dysfunctional pass the pass the craps sandwich as a posed the what re publicans could do in the house if for example thread speaker of the house which is issue a single issue build providing are to israel which is really what needs to happen rat now it may be that the best available bad option is just to get this thing through because the urgency of the situation requires that israel get the ma trial a necessary to finish come of right now but that is a pretty cynical play by jobidon obviously and linking israel and annoy crane totally unnecessary the speech last night should about should cavemen about to own case law come ass the threats to the united states interests into mideleast that is what should a about but instead half the speech was about you crane and now hem he was time again there are two purposes ton speech theoretically one was standstrong with israel another other is throw the araneans off the ball an push them off the line and this part he tried to do and the question is con o be whether an in believes him in clip five he talks about why we are not with drawing and why ere going to trying and push iron off the ball i just two weeks ago he told the world that if whodunit e states an our allies with drawing if an i sates o draw ow as well as well notecase report you crane would have cot a week left to live but we are not with drawing i know these confess can seems far away is not to last why does this matter to amebic any are with you why making sure is on you crane succeed is vital for america was o security no hisses cats that when cares do not pay price for their care when dictators do not pay a price for their egression e was more cars and dead and more destruction they keep going now again all that is true the question is whether he actually has the doe turn power to do anything about it and whether any one actually believes him and i agree with what you sang rat the i also agree with something he said last night where said that america leadership holds the world together that of course is true america leadership does hold the world together and in the absence of america leadership the worldfalls but not everything he sat was bad last night is just a mishkababble it is the mass we here he was is clipped seven talking about america leadership in the or again this part is good there is a lot of good mixes with bad which by the way is what he is now going to propose to congress will get to that momentarily medical leadership as what holds the world together medical a lines what keep us america san america values what make us a partner that an takes on a work put all that a risk we walk away for you crane e turn our back an israel just not worth it's quite afar ism i and to congress a urgent outer quest the fondimaricis mass secures to support our critical parts including israel and cranesaagain all that is perfectly well and good that is that is that is totally fine and then he luncheon the truly bad part of speech given goes the bad par of speech the bad part of his speech begins with him talking m how much pressures can put on israel and how much money he is going as son to commons not getting here he is talking about how he talked with the leadership of israel about how they mean to operate by the laws worse ho first of all being lectured on the laws of war hell you are under terrorist assault is the most insulting possible thing israel spends the lives in the treasure of it citizens to not kills civilians compass is deliberately hiding behind and we again what where where is this sort of care being taken with any other ally of the united states anywhere on earth after seven seven was there a lot of talk about no brutish human rights oh what why is it that when it is israel all the senders to while we we do have to warn those news off of their brutality as at what thethell is run with you here's what tells run with you here is jobidon again this it this is foolishness of the highest order it place directly into comas propaganda you wonder why the media jump to that comes propaganda and nonsense at israel had boy to hospital maybe it is because the president of the united states pretends that israel routinely violating human rights when in fact israel is they country that on earth there only two countries on earth that have this kind of standard for preventing metics millions america an israel was the only ones and israel has do at far more frequently than he united states here is hoiden we the same corn present nan now and i discustigan yesterday the critical nature is o the operate by the laws of war that means protecting lives in combat as basis a can r he people of gonna personal fun what medicine yesterday an discussions with the leaders of israel egypt i secured an agreement for the first shipment of humanitarian is distance from the options to polish days in gosh tombs is not deverterstilltess shipmentthe shipment were in a provide an opening per sustain delivery of lifesaving uminitaring i silence for the polishings o case what in ookingquestion there's still two hundred hostages being held by compass in goal where is that money's can go what distribute of mechanism d you have for that money the answer is they have no distribute of mechanism how d we know that it is because they are openly amino for example here is he widen state department spokes person explaining his name's matmiller that sure come ass might seal thrash is literally yesterday the concern the is rally government has they said this publicly in the serve editor privately dos is that any assistance that goes in will be diverted once its inside goa that there is not a there is not in is daily military force in goat is not a you in escaping keeping force in goa the people with guns inside gaze a mamas and mamas ma try to divert this is stand in keep it from getting to the civilian to to it is intended for we than that the loginmac concern ah we have mane clear that this a needs go to innocent civilians a bahamas were to be watching very carefully a how it is delivered a because we want t decency of those concerns which we are well young watching carefully that's that is that is important is that if you watch really carefully if use your binoculars from afar which is what you will be doing then probably comosulant still the day by the way if wouldn't believe him you crosolistens the by deputy an say director on finer who easily said we truscomas the terra what we will just give hem a hundred million dollars for pray fine the president pledge to hundred million dollars in in a package to palistinion civilians innocents o visions and gas in the west bank how is the unite takes going to in shore then non of that and a in the hands of mama a getting assistant in to posit is a complicated undertaking it involves a essentially securing an understanding among a mamas fighters a who control the check points on the other side of the border among ivy government of israel and among the government of egypt but the question is we y a fad i tin new and tan stand of is o were it had ton take the war o mamas that it will not be take in what other n guarantee in their be we believe there is an understanding now among all of the a players who control that crossing the off crossing in egypt oh there is an understanding is there with comas well that that that changed everything long as there's an understanding again this is the kind of weakness than invites further terrorism than invites further exploration of america weakness again robin kept going along these lines again he kept over and over and over pushing on this to states solution stuff in the middle of a war against people for dedicated to israel destruction an the murder of just get pushing colic over and over last night and when that was not enough he then started ripping on america as lamaphobia have give a question there there is a horrible horrible evil case of a tormented person in evil person we should get the defiantly killing a sororal palistinian ked in america that horrible evil condemned by literally every one every one meanwhile there in mass protest across the united states on behalf of come naturally gobidan is going to put heavy emphasis on is lamaphobia in reunited states lecturing the america people that we cant be is lamaphobic in this moment and then reminding us of hows lamaphobic we were after non eleven which is heard because there is not a lot of evidence to suggest masses lamaphobia in the aftromafonon alevenot by hate crimes statistics from the aria in any case here is a gabion again this s themiddle of speech in the affmeth of the worst terror attack onus the worst slaughter of jurors pogrom against due since the polices followed by widespread public demonstrations in favor of the massocurring in favor of the terrace and gobinzic well we would you have to worry about how in tolerant you the america people are you might be is lamaphobic watch yourselves here is robin last night no were at home get be answer we can yer to mama is giving too much cars and full races rise of an feminism comic phobia right here epic salesmen terrified in the wake of recent e wants he leg to the horrific thanks in the tacks of both sacks and break our hearts a cock seven tar tack have cared deep scars an terrible memories anthem dish commune to day i family worry about being takin in the school in singles o the face walking down the street e going out about the daily lives i now many of you in the us on america coning the aroma the polishing my i soy others a out was an hardy samiels her we going is noma cobia an this tress west i know that is chef lorry to day i know that as as as the jewfish people are under existential threat in israel my rebury is that they are offended passing in america in america who are marching with cross flags i know that that is that is deeply worrying to me by the way what he saying about the jewfish community in reunited states that is a under recentrael a every due that i know in the state of lord is arming up every single one without exception i spent party yesterday to grange the entirety of people at the grange were orthodox clues all of them there is a reason for that anis because comose call for goblterr and cause lot can for globlterror and there is a d h us notification that is gone out global to basically everybody about the rifeness and jordan focussing alegar be on what matters is lamaphobia as always cause america t it were the real problem were the real problem the also made sure to point out that done he that that he lectured israel agansomore this discombobulated speech it is supervise common again a strong message out ben this israel is democracy israel is i jugs stake israel deserves america support in the face of existential jenisidal terrorism israel we will have america supporting the extermination of compass and everybody else better get the f off the line iron and it is proxies there evil and if they step off that line they will get clock hard that they will not be able to walk in the morning that is the message because that will pusher on off to ball and all give israel the space at ease to get rid of comas that could ha bent entire message last night instead he decided to tidy the waters tons bat you crane and america is lama phobia and how he is been lecture israel about not making the mistakes of nine eleven by the way this mistakes of nine eleven hen me just point out that did not in clue america destruction of the tarlatan and all kit an afghanistan the reason he has to talk you the mistakes of nine eleven is because of his mistake in reversing all of the progress made n afgannison by abandoning the place of the talisman but here he was trying to pretend the big mistake of nine eleven was us sou no trying to kill son ben old and going depose the talisman how is the i mistake a what tells he talking about here si is yesterday i a said that when america experienced the hell of nine eleven we s a rase as well awe sat an a cassis we made mistakes si casting the covin of this of not to be blind an by rid not to be blinded by rage gulf a toast take a long walk off short were blinded by rage yet your you are right that that is that is the message america new to triton on eleven also when we watch three four an america citizens being slaughter and people having to jump to their debts from the eighty eighth story to avoid being burned to death probably what what america really needed was a message of you know ticket the easy guys super insulting stuff now not again not everything the president say last night was bad him calling for the military aid to israel is necessary but the fact that he keeps muddying the waters in the middle east the only thing that matters is perception of strength it is literally the only thing the matters moral stations is not work in the middle east appeals to western notions of liberal enlightenment and the individual worth of every human being those are things that do not work in themidle east pretending that they do is idiocy and the fact that began keeps going back to that well well if we just if we force israel to be kinder or ma concessions the pout if we give humanitarian aid to gaze that dude you knot's going to stop us bel off from attacking it are not humanitarianade gaze but genista us belong from attacking in the north is the notion that if they do israelwill be rearmed to the teeth and this america mericraft carriers open bleach their power on us bell that is going to stop cusbloff from doing the thing in the first place and it is jobidon has not has done a lot of good things since this conflict broke out last night speech was definitely definitely not one of them an a second we're gong to get to the aid package that jobidon is pushing naturally he is tempting to rap everything up and ball cannot have a bell passing through congress these days that is not a crap sandwich first everyone here at

now a daily wire at dot come slash subscribe also the sundae be on the look out for a new episode of the sundae special talking about the launch of monkey wit my best friend and to founder of the aware jerry boring it is terrific here is om the trailer a little over a year ago those tapes from cries up leaked of what was going on inside dis not and you said we should do something which had launch into kit is content i wrote you back and said you do not know how to run a bra to impossible what you what youthithin could never possibly happen another it'd laid back and bed to go back to fleet for another forty minutes and as i sat there i thought tacit he is right i drive in to work by an hour the john lexises his involved in the conversation and we have decided that were just going to dit were gan announce this initiative were gin ta change the direction of our company an a deeply profound way this is not launch in chocolates and we decide we'd holthosta live town hall that day and i would announcethat to the world while announce in tar staff the daily wire was going to launch into kits entertainment with one hundred million dollar commitment that we are going to change the paradox and that is one to work or man's always great to talk to germy even if he is lost somewhere in rope listen to he whole conversation check it out on sundae it'll get meanwhile jobidin has put forward a bill this bill is at one hundred billion dollar bill now you might ask yourself how much of tat is after going to support material ad for israel since that is what we are really talking about heres an emergency aid package for israel the answer is of that hundred billion dollars fourteen billion fourteen now listen it may be the because the republicans could not hit the side to the barn if they were trying to pea on it t that that they have to vote for this thing ait may be that because republicans hen you have a speaker the the best of ail election because of the urgency of the situation and because israel needs the epic right tho hell now they need to be rearmed to destroy compass they need to be rearmed to to the to work cabala and prevent the region from spending into a broader war that there may not be a choice but push for it which again just exposes republican and competent in not having a speaker of the house was if they had to speaker of the house they could do they could separate these into individual bill and four democrats to vote no on israel aid in order to get them to push an omnibus package which would expose the real agenda here which is the omnibus package in any case but jobidins to actually proposing is hit one hundred and five billion dollar urgent funding request four the next year it includes sixty billion dollars for you crane now remember vary spent seventy five billion dollars on you crane minimum sixty billion dollars on you crane a lot of that is for replenishing us weapons stock piles ha have already been provided fourteen billion dollars for israomiffits of existential threat ten billion dollars fore humanitarian efforts you might ask yourself what is that ten billion dollars for cumenitarn efforts have beenassured by members of congress that is for gaze your word about a hundred million dollars being given to hammers right now in the middle of a terror war where they hold america citizens hostage get ready for ten billion dollars to be given to completely unreliable sources in the gone strip now what we can hope is that at least some of the senators republicans end democrats in the senate actually prevent that aid from being deployed absent certain conditions in the bill we can hope and pray because the idiotic idea of giving israel fourteen billion dollars in military aid to destroy commons and then giving the people on the other side ten billion dollars to re build all of the terrorist in for structure that israel just destroyed is totallyinsane totally crazy given billions of dollars to the paling an authority is totally nuts that is totally nuts again this bill is eight total craps sandwich now the bout station n only option may be devote for it because again republicans have no leadership at all but if they did have leadership they'll be separating reuse build fourteen billion dollars is in there for managing you us medical border and fighting dentinal trafficking seven billion dollars for the into pacific begun wend which includes titan of that one hundred and five billion dollars the actual amount that this build should be theoretically is thirty five billion dollars fourteen build for israel fourteen build for the us medical border and seven bill for titan that would be the stuff that is truly urgent right now when it comes t you crane ism not surely unity sixty billion dollar allocation obviously toxin is trying to use america good will for israel to cram down significantly more aid four u crane in the form of sixty more billion dollars to you crane now again ism in favor of more aid to u crane i am ism not anti ad u crane however the situation you crane is not anything remotely the urgent my of the situation with israel is the fact that biding is trying to rap these two together in or to get his u crane aid is pretty grows considering that again america are pretty split on the future of you crane ad absent o plan to exit that particular conflict an america are not split at all on aid to israel bison is trying to use good will for israel to cram through sixty billion dollars and you crane that is what is happening right now as i say it may be that the only options to vote or it because republicans do not even have a a speaker right now because of posturing idiots but that is what bison is trying to do into really really cynical play speaking of white house stupidity yesterday the white house axially dock america forces not getting you a care o fox news the white house took seriously on social media thersday for posing an image of mobile meeting with u strips in israel without obscuring their identities the while house o count to leaded the protozoon after sharing you an histogram but twitter lash ex users re ripping widen steam for the dangerous mistake because ism it you do not want is four terrorist who know what your soldiers look is who israel very oftenwill obscurer the name's an identities and photos of its own soldiers in really dangerous areas because the menu the permits identify them they try to kill them hoiden once again the t white house doing an amazing job day by day over there meanwhile speaking of the wite his terns amazing job it appears that the america federal government is honey combed with commas supporters according to huffington post a piece from bar shared armed at the huffington post he has a priest titled mutiny brewing inside state department over israel palestine policy moral is low and some staffers are preparing to formally express their opposition to jobidon's approach according to officials now the sate partmenthas always been are a repository of u hatred and artist propaganda for long as ism alive the take department has been anti israel in the extreme for ever now just coming to the fore according to the huffington post officials told huff post that secretary state antsy blinkoln and his most senior advisers are overlooking widespread internal frustration fine fire them fire them seriously it is what jo is that donna rupture to done when he came in son of cleared out testate apartment fired every career staff on replace them with people harngarbage down from did not do that i came back to bite him now tony blink show do the same thing some department staff that they feel as if blink and his team are in interested in their own experts advice as they focus on supporting israel expanding operation and gaze there is basically a mutiny brewing within state at all levels one state department official said two officials told huff post diplomats are preparing whats called a dessert cable a document criticizing america for i policy thy goes to the agency's leaders the ad protected internal channel now because it impost be in a a internal channel is must be secret naturally the week get tote media to try an undermine israel war effort an america support for that war effort the cable would come in the wake of josh poll veteran state department official announcing his resignation on wednesday he said he could not morally support though us as moves to supply siren's wareffert quote in the last twenty for ours have bin getting an immense amounts of outbreak from colleges with really encouraging words of supports and e lot people saying they feel the tame way and it is very difficult for them the of course of the state department official who just resign and he resign because he supports come ass in this war effectively speaking he does not want israel rearmed but do not worry the entire federal government is honey combed with people more than four hundred capita whole staffers are apparently calling for acres fire and gaze again a a huffington ghostwriter game rowing obdalazes apparently muscle and jewfish congressional staffers but by the way what they get is a few token wild left news ware very interested in intersectionality signed the sort of stuff ask them one's last time they had a shabotmeal when is the last time they had a kosermeal wen'sthe last time they the gave a crap bout israel and wielding your ethnic jewfish identity in order to undermine jewfish safety all over the world is true garbage human being kind of stuff an there a lot f people doing it from not in our name to jewfish voices for piece all the recites jokers the letter which huff post has learned ma has been some by four hundred eleven congressional staffers come that small handful of members speak out against the bide administrations approach to the conflict the letters has nation whidah and congress the voices calling for desolation and piece have been drowned out by those beating the to ms of war as muscles and news we are tired of her leaving re living generational fears of genocide and ethnic cleansing all are you ism sorry that you're tired ism sorry thou are tired of just defending themselves after fifteen hundred of them are murdered raped kidnapped i ism sorry that that tat makes you feel very sad in your in your cloistered puckers in the cherished halls of our congress i that am sad for you you brave sols you who will not even sign in your letter by name your anonymously signingyour letting pathetic specimens and giant shock right there again meanwhile it is worth noting that the as govern actually hired a pro homes niello spokeswoman to handle asylum flames according to the daily wire is an investigate o report by lukroziac couple of days ago out immigration in foreman agents he hired a spokeswoman for the piano and put her in position to determined who gets asylum which seems canniscary she at you right be oka with giving asylum two people who hate news for example and hateamerica now the t chess officer is repeatedly posting pictures of common terra parts shooting in with guns and writing f israel and any new who supports israel sushi leave worked in twenty sixteen ad twenty seventeen as a public affairs officer for the passing delegations to the u s which served is the niello office in d c that officer then expelled from the country by the trumpedministration but good news she then secured a job at the chess as an asylum officer this now an in medication officer for the u us citizenship an immigration services where she gets t determine who exactly gets to come in the country that does not seem dangerous at all she literally posted videos for picture's graphics of commasnec flying over all ox with a a with with hangliders and guns to murder know dancers an shes working ford cha she still is far as ism aware an office of members of congress rushing to the defense of thecomoscok is cord bush is an maturing member of komoscock is yesterday sh treated out in defense of tear supportershud i to lead quote i denounce any action to centaur ricotta to leave the only palcinane america and congress these as lot of comic and rase the stuffer turn attempt dis credit her perspective and scared those courageously speaking up for passion in human rites solidarity with my sister in service again intersectionality is one hell of a drop wit is more on the interjectional coalition in just one second first the benshvrsho is sponsored by grand canyon university in affordable private christian university with vibrant camps in beautiful phoenix arizona it's rank to top twenty in the country according to pistol mom g c you is sobmissional christy enter university that strives to foster a culture of community giving an impact g us goal is tell you developed into a servant leader who makes a difference through finding your purpose with three in herd thirty economic programs on over two unasemndial line as of tune twenty twenty three g c you integrates the free market system with a welcoming christian world view into your bachelors masters or doctoral degree thou's have support from your own university councilor who takes a personalized approach to helping you a cheese your goals find your purpose a grand canyon university private christian affordable visit g c u dot e d u to day seeing of the interjectional coalition i think everyone is excited to here from great tuner the idiot woman child who was trotted out by the media for years as the spokes person on be a o an entire generation she a she treated out a photo of herself sang week two seventy to day we strike and solidarity with palestine and gaze the world leas you speak up and call for an immediate sees fire justice and freedom for palistinians and all civilians effected she has treated zero condemn commons zero in support of his ralesvions zero this the picture of this moron holding a holding a card that is stand with gaze an behind her there is person holding a since is climate justice now it the picture of the palistinian flag because obviously if there is one group of people on plan part who cares deeply about environmentalism it is the palistinians they they love environmentalism which is why they burn shine piles of traction t less bank without any regard for the environment damaging historic sites in the prosit they love it they love it why is that happening that is happening be again the environmental movement the radical environmental movement of which reditoenburg is an integral part internal cog and she is an adult nous i can make fun for f being the complete dim witted moron she always was tat the fact that she as trotted out again as some sort of spokes person for generations as more about the generation an less about the a the intelligence of the spokes person shouting how dare you at cameras and yelling at adults i understand that that is the left wing substitute for actual thought but the fact that she exposes herself day by day for the complete mental mentally defunct person she is and coralline funk person she is should tell you something the reason for all of is is because the radical environmentalist movement was never ever about the environment it was never about that whose about the i a the western civilization is at root evil and that is we environmentalist a siding with the palistinians that is why your being been side withe palistinians that coalition is pretty damn telling again the red green axis the communist comes axis is extraordinarily realign of course includes environmentalist as well that of course is bled down in to our schools because america schools from high schools to colors have ben infused with exactly the same level of a morality and moral relativism here is somnvidio from a san francisco high school is hare kids running through the halls in what appears to be the worst remake of high school musical ever there there running through the halls wearing terror supporting outfits and shouting from the river to the sea palestine will be free i wonder how jewishtons the school feel remember safety and feelings er safety only apply if you are a if you're not wish apparently and not why those are those of the restrictions from the over to the sea palisade will be fer bettor is genisitlesloge because that you may notice that the river is the jordan river and the seems the mediterranean my there talking for them phthisis a slogan that calls for the manslaughter of news i always one my favorite things is always seeing liberal minded young women wearing tang tops standing for the palistinians see of that goes in pals in palistonian control territory the other goes for you ad the queers for palestine routine is one the most ridiculous routines ever i saw shall assign at my a and my speech then night universe afflorida and was the transfer a colors that set on at free police and yet try that in the goes stripes yet that goes for you y that that is all fun an games until they cut off your head ah but they gain it is not about that they they know that they know that they are not boldly stupid they understand that and they know that and the reason that they are doing it is because again the coalition about destroying institutions of the west and standing against the west and then they will figure out what to build after when they're to fight with each other in fact there are some fifteen hundred barrel student who walked out of school to demandises fair because this is the generation that we have trained which is you can be as ignorant and stupid as you want to be and we will treat yuan a herosalongs you walk out of school we have now created n entire system of students walking out of school to get less educated and be dumber and we reward them is what beam was all about and now they are jutgingto carry that ford to whatever the next interjectional causes and today's interjectional cause is genicideold you hating terrorists we've avid a palestine remember the coalition of the judo oppressed they are going to rise up and strike down whessrn civilization that is that is what this is that is what this is meanwhile it has of course bled up to our colleges as well as bled down from the colleges and blood up to the colleges as on yesterday a you see dais faculty adviser literally called for the murder of news this was exciting stuff is to be memo d wrist e listen pro lessor of america studies undergraduate faculty adviser she wrote quote one group of people we have easy access to in the yours is all these honest journalists who spread prop pagans and is in formation they have houses with addresses kids in school they can fear their bosses but they should sure us more moi of an if moi of an ax three iemogis of blooddrops that is an a listen professor of america studies at a major america universityesponser by the state that is a threat of vat that islet incitement to violence obviously but and the the question is why people feel comfortable post that stuff and now why people think people thinks people think top ale things all the time why do they feel in university land that it is c else that it is acceptable to post all the stuff and the answer is they feel it is acceptable because it is acceptable to post all the stuff a faculty senate statement put out by the staff at pen is pushing buff in favor of antisemitism there's from the faculty senate trichina quote as try chairs of the university of pennsylvania faculty senate wee write to a firm our commitment to freedom of thought inquiry and speeches foundational value of our university there talking here about support of compass we stand in solidary with all university of pensylvania faculty staff and students whose research work or study has been effected by the recent efforts of intimidation by intimidation they mean peoplewhare pulling their money from university of pennsylvania because they do not wish to subsidize terror support i all this culminated in a colombia professor last night going out to the lawn of colombia and telling parents stop sending your kids here and stop funding this university i a a i i i die i o all or ta i i w i i a i i a i r a a i e i o i i i all o i i e i ow i a a lei new i et you a e our i a iyiiry a verygintn a iverytii a in o uni i w you all to morrow morn a ya get i i i ta mi a i a also i a gie an that will be the big question they will be the question again america sport for israel over all is very his but university compasses are a disasterary the been disaster for twenty years i wrote a book in two thousand for i was twenty years old talking about what disaster area the university camps is war in there's an entire chapter about the anti pianist anti somatic garbage on college campus wot people last at that this o what it was not matterwat happens on college campus and the answer is they end up in the halls of power making policy for you and making the educational decisions for your kids that is why it matters an meanwhile you don't be super helpful at this point i i got a say the will be really really helpful at this point is of the republicans had a speaker of the house it might be really helpful you mig gablashy impact policy on a lot of these issues good news the republicans as always are busily just kicking themselves in the not over and over and over according to the pastry journal republican speaker nominate representing jet jordan wat set's fall short and authored round voting to secure the gave on fridayeight morning which means there is basically no one left to run for speaker of the house and no prospect into what the speaker of the houses actually going to to be able to do at this point this is all going perfectly well ism glad that the republicans initiated a circular firing squad in the middle of a very serious time then the number of clowns in positions to power in this country again clownishness is all well and good and it is all well and fine up until the point where life gets very very serious then it turns out that having clowns in charge of your country on every side is really bad policy and a coss lives presumably this is one of the reasons why the pulling is now showing for example that job n is lagging dona trump in a wide variety on swing states he is down to biding his down to trump in merger by five he is down by trump to arizona in four he is down by two in wisconsin he is down by one in pennsylvania now remember trumpet actually have to win all of those trump and biting are tide in in michigan seems unlikely but all of that very very close now again it would be who republicans to think whether trump is still the strongest candidate given the fact that one the big breaking neckpieces here is that kidney well who you remember as the crack in releasing lady you remember that that crazy lady when he is doing about itwsthe voting machines that were hacked an all the kentegarbage and sick she will she is got release the crack and a all the idiots from from nonmember eighth to a to canary sext there all a my god she she is she is about to release all the evidence the so e and not none of govern materialize the ton of being sued into the ground hell now it turns out but she has cut a stunning pleads ill in the georgia election subversion case on the eve of her trial which means she is now going to testify presumably against donate trump in that georgia election trial that that all is going to be wonderful what could she testify about well she is dint attend to white house meeting in remember of twenty twenty where some of trumps most extreme support is encouraged him to name her as ha special council to investigate supposed voter fraud michael flip was there was rude the pee documents make clear she is expected to testify about her direct involvement in the breach of election systems in coffee county georgia as well and what exactly trump was doing in how he was involved none of this is good news for trump in a serious time serious candidates would be a very very good thing already coming up we are on t be join by gift major general yahoo men throw his formerly the amnesia to the prime minister of israel he

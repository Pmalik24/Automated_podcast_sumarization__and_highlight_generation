a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in to day's episode of the show if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our weight this america life outwork avid what problem was dis supposed to solve the teachers were trying to get the kids to stop tattling and why was that important cause it is a great class room and it is constant there right i should say by the way that you are avid castenboum you are one of our producers a managing editor right now and up and this a classroom is your kids classroom right they have both of them went there i stodn't get it seems kids tattling on each other is just a fact of are say it is but you got twenty something kids i mean it is hard being one parent with two kids doing it imagine you are in a classroom the twenty kids and if they bring it to you as a teacher all these little in justices you got to get involves in all these cases right age just a timework yes just the timework and one of the teachers had this great idea she took a tissue box hung it on the wall and then took this plastic phone receiver and hung it in it and said something that is the tattlephone tell it to the phone and i thought it was just brilliant and i just one t say this is a place that loves kids i would go to pick up my son man and i would have to wait because you would want a hug every single teacher and i go to get doggy are older kid and youould be any five minutes in the middle e something they just en a stay longer i i m i get choked o think about this place and i loved the idea of the telephone just as as a vessel for all the little injustices that go on every day and i wanted to hear what was said into it these little three year old for yer old talking into this plastic phone oke and i should say this is the part of the story i knew very well what happens next we asked if we could put a phone in the classroom that would record the tattles the day care was find with that i reached out to the parents i did not now they were going to feel about thus recording their kids it the worst moment of the day but every single one of them said yes some of them said please yes do this so we got a phone it was this chunky red phone can i nineteen eighty style we had it set up to record and we needed an ow going message for it and up and that is where i stepped in peter you reach the telephone o a tell me what happened after the beat ho me the whole story a i really apt make and rods in that for your old market i real that hos a ratings and what were onto do now avid is that your going to explain what you heard on those recordings on the telephone and when you are done ism going to come back and all explain what to day show us about i brought the one into class and i said it out the kid started to use it immediately and with great enthusiasm i o me o a i her i non i very a i i watch that one nothing faded in my face and i said each than but the real crime a n i thiktere was enormous excitement just having a phone in the class it was larger than they probably ever seen in their lives bright red with buttons on it it was an old touch tone phone every one wanted to use it even if they did not have a tattle kid sang a song into it one tried to order a beats a some one said ism on please pick me up early a i y a a o no how i ha aka we a a we a a ah i i meat my you are several calls later conscience heavy that kid calls back i o a a the tattlephone was a magic portal into one preschool classroom in america which is kind of incredible most parents it ask my kids what happen in school to day they get nothing school is this black box it drop them off pick them up and you have no idea what happens in between but now i had this phone i was set up would send me the messages as they happened here is funny listening to them from my desk the portal into this class room would open for a second i get this little report from a kid a little sound of the room and then it would close sometimes for a while then the porter would open it'd hear something and then silence again there are never any tattles between one and three o'clock because that was native then they start again the little dramas om oi o ma ma ma ma er an a n a no a a e i a ma in i a no no a me my friend some one it is always their friends who are bugging them my o a ma i i o a aryl that me my a a a me no in n a o i o a e can me can i just say ism much sure that one is actionable you are pretending to sleep and complaining that someone is waking you up i do not know i no ai ow on how much their day is about a justice oh i could not put to put a per centageonit but i could say the majority they d this is athlete ones the lead teacher in the class it is everything is it is a rules they lived by rules they can sit down to play game and the whole playtime well be nothing but arguing about the rules and then there is no playtime left and they feel good about it is funny they cannot make breakfast to themselves they cannot get dress they can barely talk and end there they are just full f that is not fair theft their dynamos every one of them has something that it is yes exactly it is a some they are wonderful there is actual scientific research on this kid's know when something is unfair some when they are just twelve months old my kid's were not even walking them and i know this is kind of obvious but many the conflicts in this world come down to some version of what is c going on in this class room what is fair how d ye divide up something that there is a limited quantity of magnetizes we only have one the critic one that is yellowish goldfish that is it that is the pries in the class who ever gets that is on the king or the queen and ha the gold that is what they call the gold i sometimes think that the main usefulness of numbers for my smack how reason he knows how to count is score keeping how many s something he has and how many his brother has it is a waking of the scales of justice no matter how tiny do work for you did they stop coming to you with their comply yes it it it does work yes that phone holds a lot of tower gave the teachers the break they were looking for i wanted to see if the kids thought it worked whether the tattlephone helped them deal with stuff the other we and i interview to munch of them which i have to say these were me of the weirder interviews i eve done in my professional life bob woodland i know this is not right but i had to pay one interview a piece of gum another kid nickel insisted on performing magic tricks before granting an interview i did not have high expectations i i o ore wait that worked really well wait that was actually amazing i that was good we nickel then refused to talk about the phone at all but others clearly used it a lot ye ti tell a tattle phone the strapped that is ariel this is denial tell me the hole it tats i an o lender one girl's parents told me that they were on vacation staying at a hotel which of course hate landmine phone and their daughter some one said look a tattlephone as if there was some sort of national telephone network staffed around the clock my government workers entering everything into a data was my friends kid than who just turned five and who i a more was the only one could remember a tattle wordhthe event from school in any detail he whispered it to me hots clearly kind of excited about this his friend it kicked him why kid ki you the pets ti you all the telephone t i tat tat a o a the tattlephone if you at the tattlephoe which youftsounds it might have been an accident shun stood up and acted out the whole thing in slow motion for me s lucky it was the scene from an action move his friend was trying to kick the ceiling we attlthis should have security camera the classroom but they do not i do not just the tattlephone he a bonce kids told me they felt good after talking to the telephone though though why it made them feel better it took all my interviewing skills this is ariel how did you having the tattlephone in the classroom good how did it feel after you said something to the telephone gid how come you felt good ah the time we i felt od be is i to on the resin one girl told me talking to the tattlephone felt eating ice cream it is nice to think that just getting something off your chest console a problem that if you just released the fact of the injustice into the world we feel better an sure o i think they can be true but we hade the phone an class for a month and i did notice toward the end we got fewer messages they came in regularly but not with the same energy it is possible the novelty was wearing off i think there something else going on as we before we put the phone in the class i had it set up in my house just to make sure it was working my kids used it a coupletimes and then our younger son man was complaining that his brother orgy who is a year older and pinched him tell it to the tattlephone i said it is not working he told me i picked the phone upward that there are some technical glitch but his fine its working man no he said it is not i did not do anything i the to the venal work to me day teddy n it listen to your tattle not at seeing it listen it it did it it gains so on pinching me it did not stop okay pinching me i know acts i know sometimes you want more than just to speak you want actual justice then ye limit your of and that brings is to what are we twelve minutes into the program it brings this to what we are doing to day on our show get may way have people some of them young some of them old wanting justice feeling a sense of in justice on things as big as the constitutional foundation of our entire country and things as small as the question of whether a ball is in or out and in all this cases people young and old not trusting the system to deliver justice ten maybe easy chico it is this america life stay with us a one who dreams the journalist michael leis who run money ball in the being short in lots of other books and who contributes to our program now and then he was looking round at what is going on an america these days and he notice that one way you can describe the current moment that we are all living through is it america do not trust the rafts in all walks life the do not trust their impartiality i talking bout police spring put justices journalists the people regulate the banks of wall street an student ones the people sitting medical coss judges many people to day filled the systems rage i men burning sanders an down trump both round on that many people feel that the figures of authority charged with enforcing rules impartially keeping everybody on lever playing field that the failing at their jobs it is not fair michael leis as not publish this reporting that is been going on this and a new book he is decided to make it into a pod cast it watch to this week it is called against the rules michael has adapted diversion of their very first episode for us to play for you right now the first episode is about people not trusting the rafts in the most literal sense of that it is about basketball aperies here is michael is for me this story really begins with my eleven year old son walker he plays on a basket ball he run by a japan's buddhi temple my son isn't a buddhi the most of the time he could pass for one he has no conflict with his teachers or his class made or his japan's buddhi tea mates i would not say his mind is exactly pure but usually it is come the exception is when he deals with rafts even in what amounts to a buddhi basketball gay then he time a real blows the whistle and them he throws up his arms in astonishment then he jumps up and down with his little fist bawled up his mouth clench tight everyone knows just how much in justice he suffering then he marches off with a scowl tan e does not get over it after a gain this season he gets into the car it starts bitching and moaning all over again how did it make you feel whet the reft made those calls ay now do you feel any better now no tell me out feels yes someone he is poking n about the show annoying for how for to have you ever would out in your career no did that you ware risk o felligout yes but son if i don't it would be nonfat because i knew that he was calling stobiti spouse hull up baking alias bone household clay wit the clay with a bathe thing is i know why my son does what he does he thinks he is clay common the all star shooting guard of the golden state warriors when clay hit is a three clay pounds his chest and points to the sky and when walker louis it is at three he too pounds his chest and points to the sky when clays called for a fowl he scowls and throws up his arms in astonishment the sometimes even says something to the rest that gets him slapped with the technical far in clays the famously most laid back all star in the entire national basketball association something has happened in the relationship between referees and players of the last i guess year to that is remora schelbern she is covered the en a for the last decade for is p n it is been quite frankly ugly this year one of the warriors head blooded a reft another chucked his disgusting mouth guard all for rent's chest and some of the stuff have see when tram on green is is getting fine for calling barnacle cabin can we cuss on your boy ask i think we are he hae you i fucking bench when when he is saying that to a few mole referee man that is next level and i have not seen that before at this season it it is the stars now who are really pushing theassiu right it is cave dora getting thrown out a gains its staff curry getting thrown out last year bad behavior got various golden state warriors tossed out of ten different basketball games cave demand their best player got thrown out of five four more than had beenthrown out of his entire career up to that point the men who coached the stars are not much better even stove cur the warriors famously decent civic minded coach i can snap i can completely lose it if you back away from the goldstone warriors i mean there exemplars of the way people should behave the especially or stars they impeccably behave people ism pleased to have my son emulating your pliers the only time they have problems really is with referees yet i cannot imagine you in your life have another relationship you have with referees now here right you are right i would never say the things said i do to referees to a a person and normal life it happens two or three times in year been caught on camera yow a thing a rough an know my daughter will some your tabs i that which do when it is deliver twitter i can read your love sis subedit and and ism embarrassed why is that now it is a sensor right a wrong an o i i feel the this personal fats something unfair as happening loathe players get find if they talk about the rest we will not be talking to him but is not just then ere their coaches or my son who are treating rests in ways that never treat an ordinary person it is the fans in every arena who been meaning full amounts of their time looking for the rests mistakes on the jumbertron it is the cable sports channels playing and replaying the rent's mistakes their viewers can tweet and between about hem it is this entire inform structure seemingly built the focus attention on whatever mistakes the rent's make for the sole purpose of generating ora there is one thing that you nights america just now it is their belief that the reft suck which is were because they almost certainly suck less than ever before before you hate me for saying that give me a moment to show why were walk across a parkin lot in caucus new jersey and there chain hotel in motels in some one's idea of am all and is rate on all sides by freeways it is what people think about when they tell jokes about new gets a and the pushing a fore story rectangular otherwise non rescript concrete build there is a discreet little sign here that says n b a and shows a logo with he basketball player inside a recent confession to the world we live in the replace center a place where basketball referees review the calls made by other basketball refers in real time to minimize refer error row the replay center was built to persuade people that life was fair and the door is locked i no no some one eventually unlocks the door and leads me down a hall filled with a lot of old basketball stuff jerry is in bobble heads in basketballs and posters of michael organ the replay center where the ultimate man cave i ma game it is also the latest weapon in the battle for fairness this place just on first to is amazing it really it is wall to wall screens one hundred and ten of them hit is on them is whatever is captured by all the cameras in twenty nine end a arenas across the country they may have a screen somewhere with scores on it but i did not see it and they are all muted which you her is referees staring at basketball games which you see is nothing but angles on professional basketball costs nobody's hove a walked in here walk downside is place suck that is job boogie whose run the center son's two thousand and fourteen before he volunteered for a caucus done he referee and a games his father was an envy a reft before him with break in the late sixties a boogie has been reffing professional basketball games since nineteen forty six if you went back to your dad at the beginning of his career and said this is what its cat look what you think he a said if i told them we would have repeat eternalveran is gray forget about a replace center it is at right o absent you see the reft used to insist on their authority and every one agreed that there was no better way to insure the fairness of the game than to let the reft play god the replace center is an admission the reft is not god that he makes mistakes i think the mention of replay none of us them won we first heard it it is a necessary even it is necessent you half to half it to tat everything's tape now every one pays more attention to the referees mistakes the end has to as well now when a reft thinks he mighthave screwed up some call or did not get a good look at the actions what's the reffreon bottom secrete twirls his fingers in the air there you so that is the signal to the reft in the replace center who goes to work reviewing the tape looking for the best angle to figure out would actually happen herder see e you god ai l w that is the first one the other on you g go the rests here sit dressed in black staring at screens waiting for a signal from somewhere in america the end of games is when they get most involved because that is when fans and coaches and players a most likely to a cut some wet of having made the mistake the change the outcome of course a mistake at the beginning has just as much effect on a game as a mistake at the end but the end is what people not is and get outraged about the justice that the end of the game must be more exact than it is at the beginning the is replace tat a rests have video technicians with him who can freeze a moment on screen then fume out resume in that the entire screen contains only a player's finger tips or is toes here you just scroll through tiny slivers of the game not the game itself the sliver is wearying justices might o cur but in good de scrape is if you don have slow motion and her frees ran s very difficult the course in slow motion you can see things that the naked i misses magicians sometimes perform during half times of the envy a games when job bore just slows it down he can see how they do their tricks it is kind of the same thing with the players exactly i a as sixtieth of the skin of the time it is o tie a low noble i the these players are getting good at its great optical allusions it the a castle sort f the sort of things an a magician it all is not slopping an optical illusion flopping is what they call it when a player pretends to have been knocked over by another player tricking the rests into making bad calls is now consider deskill the possible finger there is blood on the screens heaven loves front tooth got knocked in love plays for the cleavelind cavaliers and the question is i the guy who popped him in the mouth do it intentionally we are look confer the onmattual tidy throw is elbow out the rests need o decide if the violence was not just excessive but sportsman which sounds our a use we sort of lost the concept the fouler we the fours on catalog it that he was out as id will not heres motion only am i o quick one no in blink i that yet ugly the players all stand around scratching themselves while the rests put on headsets and talk to the replace center the blood does not slender decision wat at i on contact o lot wit ax an you i withal the only thing stop in the replace center for checking every decision is that it slows the game down here in sicaucas they still trying to figure out how they might talk to the rests as they run up and down the court cause if they could do that to you just fix every call on the fly the special forces we found but we actually use a chip from the bowler that work off the vibration on the ball even not we that we we got a handful of deny re free added and we test the that to wear chip over their me but it was not od enough because they did not know where the voice was coming it as just a place in their heads it in a war one i that a cooks pocket gets insane the time and money now being spent to insure the fairness of what after all is just the basketball game a filial miles the libra optic cable connect this room directly to the envy arenas around the country all for two calls again at two calls again fifteen million dollars to build e two calls petty gan but you got to do it e got to do it can i just pass here a moment just to consider what the evil has done in the past few years to improve the calls for example they brought in serious managers to hire and train the reft jo border calls his balls the general because she actually was a general end near force pilot her name is micelle johns and before she supervised be a reft she ran the air force academy it sounds overkill to use a general to make sure basketball games a well rebut the end a thought it needed overkill adjuster mice the ore at least atom silver the evil commissioner did if people do not believe that the lead office is unbiastan that the officials are on bus you can have er problem regardless of the crazy of the calls people watching at home were scrutinizing every call on their phones and their tees they ad just enough information to be suspicious of the league there is eighteen n cameras covering every game that there is eighteen thousand people watching games with suffisticated smartfalns that have high definition audio an video we started to get into trouble silver took over in two thousand and fourteen and all hired job border to run the replace center since then he is taken a ridiculous amount of grief just for trying to improve the justice on a basketball court here is what else silver is done he is brought en the pool of people from which rests are selected they use to be mostly white men mostly from the same back rat at one point for n b a reft came from the same high school he is hired more black rests and female rafts he is insisted that refers be physically fit they can get into position to see all the plays while everyone else in america getting fatter the rats are getting buff they are also now getting new feed back on all their bad calls silver decided to publish the mistakes made by every reft in the last two minutes of every game everyone could see them he gives the teams and the rests a private document listing every referring mistake all this new data on rests means that we an they now all sorts of strand things about their minds princes we now know that their calls have tended to favor which ever teams losing the calls also favor the home team some large part of home court end vantage is just the rests the analytic department of the stop rockets has even done a study that shows that the home team that gets the best calls is the taw jabs why you talk who knows but you can be sure that some one will figure that out the is now basically a small army of geeks analyzing all this new data ooudern't really riding pipe is about sports federal in vat the economy that is just in suffers a behavioral economists at the universe of michigan and the to author of a paper about end a rests but the things dismiss demand way the india referees have tremendous senders not to make the wrong cold ism every error they make is tract thus air is determined whether they get mom game huge games determined how much they get bite this is arguably the most analyzed work force in the country basket ball referees are now picked up part in ways that not long ago would have seem preposterous not just for the fairness of their calls but for their unconscious behavior wulferis took data from over a decade of end a basketball games more than two hundred and fifty thousand of them then he set out to look for evidence of the rent's racial by us the question here is not whether people are are not black or an't white but whether an inherit bus ism if it if e redolently black team is playing and the referring crew is redolently white they morals called against them than on nights when the same tam is playing settle podomently black referring crew in it suns at the answers yes suffers wrote his paper back in two thousand seven before this new age of referee transparency well it was a bit of lesson mama you can truly told by my accent mocalom an australia i that it was intriguing pace of social science turned out the the real times put on the front page and the end a was not happy the commissioner at the time attack the study and embarrass the league by trying and failing to refute its findings this morning well hear from the en be a commissioner davits stern i referee to the most reviewed most rank at most rated and that why we take reception to what the times id here that stirred on en pair in two thousand in seven the result of all this coverage every single referee was made aware of his unconscious by us when the dust settled just in suffers was curious to know if his paper had had any effect he made another study of referee's after the controversy he would created an guess what the distraction study that we did seems to suggest that that for of racial by us is gone a whet for a while anyway he has no idea why maybe simply making the r it's aware of the problem was enough to correct it by the way the tibia disputes the study too but in the end this became a case study not in ref an aptitude but in right reform in be a rafts if now achieved whet police forces can only dream of though the rafts have no choice the world's now too good at seeing their mistakes look there is no way any basketball referees can be perfect but there is also no way these rests or anything but more accurate than they have ever been i mean even whole court advantage means less than used to and yet these rests are treated as if there trying to ring the games it istle sound of those eighteen thousand people scream after a booing you i the sound any different than it sounded when you started y there is there is a little more anger involve than it used to be sort o of the garden variety you terrible you saw any of those kinds of terms that is many my cutches who start a refine in nineteen ninety three and got to see first hand the effect that the arrival of the inner net has had on referees a few years back i twitter exploded and game five of of the mime heat no came city ah thunder a finals from years ago one of the players hit a three point shot my cutches was giving the signal for three and running to beat the players back to the other end of the court when he realized he would lost his balance falling for a refer it den get much more embarrassing than that it is it is bad people are on your pretty goods and ism ism trying to hold it up and epic was on the side line and he sees me fall epic is epic poster the my enemy heatcoach and he sort of just stood on to the floor and braced me and our arms sort of and are locked as he braced me it righted me i yell out thinks as i go on by and i run on down to the base line i after the game twitter exploded that the imbed is rigged if you do not believe that watch money my clachan give a high five ceric posture after this three and the reality of that which is far and away wrong up against this real human moment of just a reactionary thing that a good person does for another good person you see some one falling you help them not fall he says that when he started out reffing no one would have even noticed if they did it would not have mattered that is changed mistakes get made is in be a referees and they are just mistakes but they often get interpreted in this this wider scheme of thought process that a lot of our cultures is dealing with right now which is there must be a fix him there must be a reason for this do you think the world is looking for a fixed more now that it was when you started i i think that the the shirt i saw recently has merit ism not saying that your fault ism saying ism blaming you he feel abused yet now people do their research they teething are out there on the anger net they know your record with it with their team they they have done all there is all these sights on all these if they know personal things about you it'll sure of course some dead threats are made from time to time and play off series and you will get security all the way to to both the hotel and then the hotel the next morning out to the airport they security to the hotel not every night but when those threats are or unknown factor it has happened in my career it'll security to your car is mandatory every night it is some point you feel this question rising up in you in me it rose up while i was talking to remote shelburn the is plan reporter why would anybody want ta be a raft seriously i wonder that too you knowitey there not a lot ti say anything they're not a lot to explain themselves and not a lot to defend themselves look obviously the hey get paid they started a hundred and fifty grand a year and if they are grate at their job and work extra games they can make as much as five hundred but they're lots of ways to get paid without spending half your life in hotel rooms and the other half being insulted by a rents filled with crazy peopled you think the referring gotten worse or better i show thing as gotten better of course it is gotten better how could it not have the mystery is why the stars an the coaches in the fans actins if it is gotten worse sitting in the and be replace center an som caucus new jersey i get a hundred by that u after i see all these people on all these eve screens jumping around and hovering at reft the riches appears to be confined to cleveland but in here it feels the entire universe is disturbed there is a reason for this we born names is upset she is argument there you when jet's going from reshes reft e things to know which rest to argument with arm a gallant there talon to the yon er man i think the might chaos the changes changes an another yo had t best angle you think that we broad jane has any effect doing that oh the rough an cleveland is not twirling his finger there is no signal to us to do anything in the replace center the bronze drama strictly speaking is pointless it is strange the way these players argue they must think that if they make life unpleasant enough for the reft you will think twice before the next calling reviewing that boning you sir it is then that it occurs to me just looking around the room at a hundred and ten ties screens have had a hard time following the games never mind the scores i sometimes do not even know which teams are playing but every time up player gets up into a refers face have recognize the player and i actually do not know that many anteing players but i know all the ones who pitch these his fits because the only players getting up into the faces of the rests are the famous players or the coaches who protect them remora shelter put her finger on it the more aggressive behavior towards reft is not coming from every player it is coming from the stars it is just different then in the pass and when you are a star i think there is this feeling the you sort of risen above reproach you get used to a certain level of treatment you get used to people who treat you that way and then you feel you should be treated that way they've refer an referee to that person comes as a shell oh yah now it is when at with any star in any celebrity there comes a level of entitle me anybody who goes against that who does not treat you a star it is put in to that hater category you wont o understand the way the rests are treated stop thinking of them as people just doing their best to try to make a game fair and start thinking of them as haters we just got really interested a very simple question of was this sense of being privilege make you disobey the rules of the road of the laws of the land that is darker kelter he is a professor of psychology at caw barely and some one who wonders about the effect inequality has on people's behavior it experience i had it berley wheres within my back up this hill and i and i got to the fork stops in and i was half way through the foray stops on the sky an a black proceeds rolls through the stopsiit is half way there it is a foot away from you about to take me out he is on itself and i looked at i i i dread to take him on anybody this is tit and and what was most telling about this whole experience was he looked at me as if i was in the wrong and i should get out of his way even though it'd made it trough the stopping first darker in a colleague dreamed up this weird experiment they hid two berley under graduates in the bushes near four way stopping the under grads noted the makes of all cars coming through the intersection the sign them numbers one to five according to their market value a new persuades was a time behind o was a three and an old pacer was a one we position o bird the under grad buy a pedestrian on and we make sure they look they wan across the street a there sort of leaning in to the pedestrian own where it is required by californium law to stop it is a game of one on one the californium crosswalk one car verses one pedestrian and a zero percent of the drivers of poor cars a mum through the pedestrians on they all stop and forty some odd percent forty five per cent of the drivers if the fine than fives said rich cars blaze through the pedestrian o and you say the rules do not apply to me it'll carry o this one study led to a bunch of others that showed basically the same pattern of human behavior norther experiment we bring people to the lad and as their leaving a there is this big ball of candy and it is it it says on it for the children of the institute of human development on the ball and we haw run t tike a candid if y as you are leaving and well to we count up how many candies they take after they iigfarmet privilege people grab a big handful of candy compared to poorer people let us turn the converse something much more immortal's basketball most the pardon of all in the last five or six years the entire is embarked on essentially a dramatic reform of referring at the same time the friction between the players and some of the owners and some o the coaches ye and the rests its going through the route a the source of the out rage is the star players o people getting thrown out a games are cabin to men stuff curry and names pardon a and the warriors the most famous team ever walk on the court are the chief culprits exhibit in bad behavior towards rests you got this weird combination yet not as fascinating ye a i still remember being a layers fan you have the great magic johnsanteams and watching lady bird do his nine stop lay a and into come to make the call you for most players of his era that would have counted his travelling the gharry bird was learn the new decades of his day he played with certain assumptions about the rules and how they applied to him the inequality on a basketball court it is workout it is profound it it is more profound that was not saury birds era i got marry bird was a millionaire lebradjines might be a billionareye and a these guides are global franchise ye you got in a funny way a microcosm it can nod microcosm on a basketball cord what's going on the larges society the envied is set out to reft the games more objectively more accurately more fairly this is enraged the stars in their fans and coaches you wanted a who here is what i think the star is used to get more calls in their favor than they do now just because they were stars objective rests have eliminated some of their privilege the more objectivity there is the less power they have and to them that is outrages i think america life just now has at least one thing in common with basket ball the authority of its refers is under attack if people do not trust the rests one day you make up in a world that seems not just unfair but actually sort of linked that is it is incapable of becoming fair because the people who benefit from the unfairness

fair stayed about people young and old liver our country feeling a sense of injustice feeling wronged and not getting satisfaction from the people in charge we have arrived oat to our programmed at two the fairer sect for this act that is go to roadway to show it now that stretch with this true story i when i fifteen ears all y would travel the country giving feels of about the constitution an america leads an halls for prize money the to the i the she mean but o by my man the me pay for college i i would travel to big times bi tan er an not frat an a i i would gives meets when a hell i o money an men bra to to but my little i to the posit not for later this is hide shack and t show what the constitution means to me i rule this shell it is totally original in what it is about in and how i tells its story its my funny it is a very patriotic show in this totally unborn way in the show a higtystreck recreates the idealistic speech that you gave at fifteen that wonder and of money to pay for her whole college education ad that she talks about the constitution and about her own life our show to day is about fairness and a hidysrak to be clear says that for fifteen year old self definitely saw the constitution as a powerful instrument in forcing fairness i believed it made our country fairer more equal more democratic i believe that wholeheartedly at fifteen at fifteen you said you said that is a kid you had a crush on the constitution yes what is that mean i is really excited by it i i was a very idealistic am nutty young person and researching and reading about the constitution my doubt is the history teacher and talk very passionately about the genius of this document and it is ability to of alive and and to somehow surpass and a rectify the in the flaws of its founders this idea that there was a document that could be created by food people the could be better than the people who made it when you said the i reminded this of this famous cot from big clenwere he said and if thing it is such a beautiful quote to we said there is nothing that is wrong with america that what is right with america cannot fix yes i mean frenetic doubles has the similar quote which is that yes the constitution was founded on the great evil compromise of slavery but that it also contain the means by which we could rectify that evil and into your play is is partly about that hopeful feeling that you had about the constitution when you were a kid yes but also how you came to see it when you became an adult as a deeply food document am you talk in the play about how especially the constitution and america law really did not address things that effect you and members of your family s es women in your family yard a long time and when it did finally get around to addressing a women it was last and it came to it kind of kind of creakily n vercryaly large section the play we talk abut how how to get women to be covered by the constitution lawyers in the justices had a kind of juryrig women in to having rights using for temple the ninth amendment coat you you just explain what the ninth amendment does sure sure the ninth amendments which was my favorite as a kid says a the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage other rights i just the i for readout sang you are just for setting that from yo residing from memoriaaat a what technically shall not be consoled to deny or disparage others retained by the people meaning that just because a certain right is not in explicitly given to you in the constitution i does not mean you do not have that right this amendment blows for the fact that the founders could not have imagined the future that were living in now wen's the admitting it its thing every possible thing in this one doc you right i also to think that in three hundred years they knew that the world would look very different and and in the play though you say actually li get this thing to a ply to women just as willing o doubles has to come up with the concept which is strange and promised poetic this idea of the penumbra right what his up number here i am standing in life and there you are sitting in the dark and a this space between us this space right here partial illumination the shadowy space fate here this is o panama willing a duels ill tat his chenoera mat foreign said that you could therefore think it to this idea that somewhere in the shadows of the constitution we are in the kind in between shadowy space are our rights we have not yet named you could use the nine amendment to essentially shine a little light into the dark corners and say came over there and then is you sand to show the nine amendment combined with the fourteenth amendment in a kind of wonder town howascivatian mummer yes to decide reverses way but as but the nintomemen is also of the way the birth control gets legalized in the sixties and and was hear when here an and now from the play can and this is where you talk about how that came about and it begins with you explaining how you an a friend gods birth control yes the same year you we intis contest when you were fifteen argument men per i neither of us were having sex yet but we just we wanted to be on birth control just in case just in case we were in a hot to and and and thaws firm smile up an attack us of i mean you can laugh but be careful fir you known case of a real attack i what i do realize of the time is the first control had only be legal for all women in this country for about fifteen years i been i was fifteen i thought i hade been legal since the the down of time but no no in nineteen sixty i this incredible women a you resell got herself arrested for dispensing i does to poor women at her connecticut planned parenthood she face the year in prison talk her case all the way to the supreme court and this this is actually when willing o doubles first pulled out his big number metaphor this is money said for the first time that one thing the constitution surely guarantee is the right to private and that this blows a women to put in an i see as long as she is married and as long as her husband says that it is okay this la very scary moment for willing o doubles because i nobody understands the night amendment nobody ex see for me at fifteen just is silly us said hedging a remember studying it in law school but they had to dig up this amendment that nobody understands because here was just no other way to de with the female body because they wanted to make birth control egg they did they wanted it betas well because i found out that willing o doubles who is my hero when i was fifteen just as willing doubles was sixty seven and he was having an a fair with ha tone to two year old college to ism thinking right they that i to find away to get the firth control flowing act the rubella can you play at as sniper of the as supremcourt recounting this is the actual argument remember it is it is nineteen sixty five there will not be a woman on this court until sander dale con arrives in nineteen eighty one here are nine men deciding the fate of birth control own i er or e you wen do o on a e we banana probably only wo would bee show be ton tat i on the him oman i oats e i i i as done e they re they are o i r it i four hours of that when nifty struck was cropesize march as she did this interview with a tony cushioned the the playwright an the per surprise winner prop a best known for angels in america and in this interview they have this interesting exchange a prisoner says to her that he thought that her show was partly about this thing that he has been a writing about in thinking about ever since he wrote that a move about graham lincoln a few years ago that stepped spellburg directed crispier said a that in his view e central question of democracy is that there needs to be some kind of mystical bond holding everybody together lincoln talked about the mystic cords of memory and very consciously tried to pull everybody together into allegiance for the union but parishioner said that if you actually interrogate what the thing is that is actually pulling us together it is really doing just a stack of paper wright is just an act of faith that we have with each other and he pointed out that how of course everybody knows wrist now this act of faith this feeling that we are all on this together and we are one people who can workings out together that is in such short supply and the very idea of than agora giving speeches about that stack of papers about the constitution and it is importance and its values prisoner said ism a voting here is feels an those of a not very distant and yet somehow very distant past were people believed in fairness that the superstructure that we have all son allegiance to o the constitution is going to create opportunities impossibilities that am really hit me when i read it and i asked how to track in our interview if if she agreed that the america where you gave those speeches when she was fifteen seems very far away yes how a well sos the ladies between make eighty six and eighty nine i first of all i felt i m i was very liberal and high school in as heinous liberal i get my speeches reflected those values hen i remember giving a speech about the second amendment which i was arguing for gun control cause there had just been a shooting in californium and a mcdonalds and i was arguing for strict gun control was in front of a room of men who all owned guns and went hunting and and i won that contest and and i always felt a sense that these men i was giving the speeches for a supported my right to have a different views than they did supported my right as an america to express myself believes it was important in a democracy that we have these conversations together that felt different to me have also say of as that was this as the very beginning of of rashly by and then fox news and the men who gave you a word money waver you argued against the the second amendment you think that that would be it would be might be harder it ay i think although i well say i looked on you to tat other am america legion speeches and they still seem to be am the winners often seems to be quite liberal at least maybe in the spays of the america legion and there is still room for this kind of dialogue i hope i hope to mighty track if you visiting new york city her show what the constitution mans to me is running to we on roadway little ism constitution of footnote here after we reported

a quick warning there are curse words that are unbiased in today up ta sort of the show if you prefer a beat version you can find that at our whibslike this america life dot o work kits con be confident abut what they know what they think they can do and then they got tested what are producers on a baker talk somebody whose test that is girl heathen hi ire a at the person in the story her name molly and mollie get up in an apartment complex but tat a hunting lots of families an and the parents they worked a long hours some mull jobs which meant that this complex was really run by the kids they had total free rain and they did all sorts of things that you could only do if there were no dolts around to what there is this foreland highway up behind the complex and the kids would go up to the highway and we would play leap frog across the highway this is mole and we would wait until a car came that way would to be kind of carrier if we could see h headlights coming this is when we are are it nose the time to keep frog oh mike god i know and then sometimes those lights would be a police officer they would turn on their lights and turn around rail quick and start speeding toward us and this is when it was fun cause we are we are ditch an the cops right now a we would run and bock in to the complex and just spread out and hide wherever we could under cars in bushido in truck beds and a watch through the cracks mollie loved hiding to burner best for and ariel they come up with his reason to hide all the time they decide that they are spy detectives and it is their job to sort of spy on everyone in the complex and at the time their ten eleven and they are tiny too that these tiny girls they can fit everywhere they they would go into the laundry room and hide inside the machines with the door cracked they could eaves drop where they would hide in the laundry room trash cans which is disgusting but we did not care the hiding in spying people all the tat of ya whit is funny body is everywhere if you were a kid in this building you you never actually hathyyou think you had a moment of privacy and h you turn and you would hear them giggling you they were there and there they are did the other kids in the complex like know that you gas spies yet you because they always knew who was stalking them all this is going on for every year and then mollie and aril they leave the apartment complex one night to go to sleep over this is to shouts n five there twelve and thirteen and when they get back to the complex the next morning they see the swarm of cops one of the other apartment kids immediately us rite as we got out of the car ran up to us an us some one just got murdered and we are what and he was yon the cops ere looking for you because somebody said that you saw it and we are what you mean we just got home we were at sheridon's birthday party and he was the apartment below me somebody stored somebody else and because the kids ne we knew everything they are yamolli and ariel not they had to have seen it we did they actually see know they did not but the kids were just confident rolling ariel they see everything kids are to scum talk to them that is what happens and they hear these please are looking for them they ran up to the cop that they know officer cook out s he lives in the building he was haul and looking for yo all and we are of car friend told us but we just got back from her birthday party we were not even here and is o call am you'll stay away from the area were of that is not an a happen cause they think they can solve this yah if they think they consult the murder wed how's kidsigan there twelve and thirteen oke but you do not in order to solve this they are o ka what we need we need to know the facts they go back to the boy who told him about this in the first place and they are what happens and he is o case that that happened right underneath my window and they are let's go we we run up to angel's house and we look down and to the fence bottom floor a apartment court yard aria and we just see blood my god this is we this is not a roomer this is not a joke at real there wins a puddle blood were we have to help the cops obviously we need to be involved in this because we are spy detectives we run back down to officer cook and we are what happened and et was a this woman stab her boy friend and he die and she through the weapon and we do not know where it is they hear this and immediately they we are going to find these murder weapon and it is weird because i mean that is impossible how do you find a murder weapon but we just knew we were going to find us weapon this apartment complexes our world we know every hiding spot because we have hid stuff there oh it is all coming together other hided yah they either hidstuff there or they have hidden there themselves and and a they go sit at the top of the stairs and they just start brain storming there a right were could this murder weapon be could it be in the dirge that runs behind the building could it be in the field at back and then molly has this idea let us look on the carports why well think of it is you have something of your siblings and you are on hide it because you do not want them to have it well we wore to throw it up on of the carport because we know we knew there was no way they could get it once it's up there the carports there ten feet high an y part under them e and it is impossible to see the top of them from the ground but you can easily see it if you go to an upstairs apartment ah an aerial's apartment overlooks the carports that a closest to the murder we run up trial stairs and her bedroom window looks to the back of the apartment where the carports are and we are looking on their carport and we see a knife and we are all my god that is it that is the life she used to kill er boy frit and when you first saw the knife we just shocked yah we were shocked cause we are there is no way we just salt this stuck quickly that is really quick ya quick i mean if you think about it police had been working on this for hours and this is the very first place that they looked we run down the stairs back officer cook and we are there is a knife on the carport above oriel's apartment and there what we are ya and the officers are oke i we will we will get to that in a minute kids and n y they do they come upstairs and look at the window and to the shock they see the murder weapon and then they send an officer out there with the latter to climb the carport and i remember the officer how one of those thugs for evidence and he picked it up and there was blood dried on it and he put it in the bag and they were great job girls and we are thanks ore here y time end need us that is exactly the way the dialogue goes in dining d version of the story what you are the girl for them t is is his huge triumph i mean ever in the whole complex finds out that the girl sofas murder were excited we were proud of ourselves cause we did d likely proved we could do it when she got and our to wad tell that story and when she did so play for last but then som meg happen recently she was telling it to one of her coworkers also from taxes in their doing this thing re their swopping only in taxes stories and she gets to this one and i think it was more her reaction to it that made me realize oh that is not actually a funny story to tell that is a serious thing that happen to me ism a child and i just saw a puddle of blood on the ground and found the real give that killed this real human being it was being able to see that blood on the nice that is what stuck with her the most and also the they they sent people into clean out that puddle of blood with bleach an note as she can remember the smell of that and watching that the blood spread on for the pavement and where were my parents did we ever have a conversation about this do they even care how do you just some a murderer an there are no adults around how do you leap frog across the highway i mean it does not it does not mean a out about childhood but i would never follow any of the rules that they followed is parent of envy test chico its this america li on our glass to day on our program we have stories of stuff that happens when the grown ups are not around ut they are there but you would not know it they stay fully on the sidelines leaving the kids figure things out on the round sometimes with incredible caecilians and inventiveness and good level headed legman sometimes not say with us that one magically malicious this all strike pretty small but a little kids left alone on he class room not even at long before it became a school wide city wide the ago the the id said to make sense of we sellivan tells ha story those really vivid early childhood memories the one's were even though they happen long ago you recall them more clearly than you remember most things for avid quits his happen when he was seven the second grate back an nineteen ninety three his pe teacher told their class for will not wat to move to day and she know she rolled the a cart with the chief in the v we a on it she popped in a blockbuster rental or whatever it was she press play she turn off the lights and walked away she made mention of the fact that she needed to go to the teachers lounge to make copies i do not know of what but she was just gone and we were just there ah the move apricot maybe are familiar that if you are not apricot is in nineteen ninety three horror felt starring a young genitor venison seat at our it is about a apricot who goes on a murderous rampage to try to hunt down his stolen optical is ti the ss e go dote n sitting there watching the moving and i remember immediately people being afraid and people being giddy with excitement at the same time we are her wars kids who purchase oh have seen this my older brothers showed me this and its scary and everyone else is us i do not know about this it of avid remembers think king what the power as happened fly a i oh i hated it it is terrifying i remember people crying and every one had this you halve to staying your seats and were going to obey because in adult pollens to here's en er things that happened in the mot there seems of the leprichind biting you her face also anear he stands people in tacos he snapped the neck of a body pelts officer then big cat officers eye from his chorus only to shat sat eye and to his own gown stout eyesore its stupid aunts carry ti o and also language again these kidsare in second grade exhaling yourself and i remember especially in scenes the lexicon was a tacking people that they were kids who were holding their eyes to their deserve doing the heads up seven up when you put your head down and they were kids who were had their hands over their ears this is near honoring kids remember the lecher saying you shut tod the moving ones o get every on in the holiday spirit wit is worked for some kids avid says some of them were in and notes whet i got complicated because the kids who were putting their heads down of their desks and covering their ears were were being ridiculed by the bully kids because why are you scared white why you scared of this this is not carry this is funny so why i guess i should also point out i went to a school i was entirely medical america as i was the on reason i say that is because in medical america culture f there is this culture of pressure till be tough particularly in his neighbor had avid sat out of that the place he relate ti panicky all pelican all wish o lass all side a reputation for being kind of a taut part town and oftentimes assesses were siblings ore helping to raise one another have seen some things am there was a number of kids in the class where walking to school by themselves at six years old or seven years old and we had some rough asked kids and those rough asked kids had way differ perspectives than the kids whose parents tried to we scary things away from them and half the class was enjoying the horror moving and half the class was terrified and crying at some point the teacher came back into the room saw that people were visibly crying saw the people were crying and were visibly upset and then admonish the kids for crying she said why all crying this a holiday move and i was just all right ah beg to differ it and then with just roll yelling to toughen up that kind of thing and then she said of well if you do not want to watch it i do not want to teach and you can sit outside and sitting out side was not it was sitting on the steps and they were the outside main entrance es to the school his teacher dunno on it speak to me in the story avid and about half a dozen this class meats walked outside stone we were sitting on the steps and none lass talking no to saying anything and yo trying to comfort each other or anything that and we are all suffering indecency next to each other when school was finally over davit's want picked him up usual i told it the the thing happened at school ye saw something she was concern because i could not even get the words at i was just scared to talk about i guess which was really unlike him avid was a titty hype reversal kid the smart hatpin class when he was suddenly unable to talk she and davit's mob knew something was wrong but they did not get why he was freaking out bad about some move about lepercons and my older cousins came home i would just no that is a horror move not they they could not have shown that to the kids there is no justification for that davit's cousins like a lot of older cousins for find of that weird mix between body cards and tormentors this is our nerd no one messes with him but us davit's mam hover that says that after the move avid could not sleep alone for weeks he would not did not want to take a shower behind a close curtain i had to sitting a bat an with him cause he was old enough to shower and by himself but i had to sitting there hade the curtains in my old ben his say i here son go ahead especially when i had to wash his hair in his face when he washed it if he closed his eyes i had to make sure i hailed his hand avid felt any time his eyes were close he might open then and find demon let recon attacking him holy this told me that after the move there is a way that fear just kind of wormed its way into the rest of davit's life tit a the grocery store whole be to time he was afraid to go down the hallowing aisle did not seeing the mask s a anything coss to me holy about i bat man night lie he never been afraid of the dark before a lot of people have a move this when your kid the move you see way too young after which you kind of cannot get your life bat sometimes is the exerciser something or i heard from some one who could never recover after seeing a documentary about said rain and second great science class for me it was the piano a period drama with holly hunter about frontiers men new zealand and eighteen hundreds strait at a for moments of quote extremely graphics actuality also a guy chops off his wife's finger with an axe ut i will never not remember saw one was ten i do not know why it didn't turn it off for what is worth ism also letting out toughness was a point of bride and my family to but the big difference between avid and me is that i saw that move and it was over it did not talk about it it did everything i could to shut it out that was not possible for avid because in davit's case over two hundred kids in his school went through this mandatory horrid together all at once four teacher is played the move to bunch of classes second grater is up through fifth graters parents all star to call each other about it and calling his school avid could not put it away cause it was all anyone would talk about became the this that happened that year an i you think this is the point where a adults commit and make things better it is not because what happened instead was what oven's a lot of the time when you are a kid and a dust swoop in to try to solve something which is they sometimes make it much worse a we back we call er us an element my school teachers on your i for showing an already ivy to study some one's mam called the news the leap con controversy started an rounding on an to more than two hundred grounding turns leprcod is up bland talk of a murders let i be an on would he be nasty wo wont in bids an biting wads parents and you is are outrage terrible i the is up of the should have been bat a school at that i should been tater home out tear help with trouble bloggers bowling to thou lis to be call trouble or unacceptable schools order davits mom happened to be one of those moms who kept the news on all the time and whenever the local fusion nusecasters word talk about it they would show a clip of the moving in the backgrounds to be voice over over stockfooti u the lepercom and heart them he does in some rather graphic ways the now ts avid would be at home sitting at the kitchen table suing his homeward when suddenly the leopard goes the men to visits would spring into sight out of aware terrifying him a moons time e anatnews clip this sold at he played wine he played pogo on his lung was happening in this clip is the neoteric come his jumping on a pogo stick on top of the man's chest somehow impaling him with each jump blood spreading everywhere this was on the news all the time i have twenty seven then clips i could find with every story he but isle and they say this would be should not have been shown at all i be i it'll be do it scramble to coverdavid's eyes in ye but she could not always get there fast enough three hundred and thirty parents signed up the kitchen asking at the school fired the teachers for weeks reporters were at the school and the two factions of kids the ones who were terrified by the move and the one who thought those kids were losers this wanted at making their case on the we making the divide between the scared kids and the brave kids even wider it and publican came offearly well ti the brave kids that other children we talk with say was no big deal e be was to carry do do we was o is to be sing you be train a no won do not thinks a lot an recur a so wutyoubut a few kids did talk about how scared they were the one everyone remembers little chance that he a walk out of quest during the moving i saw a had the a and and en join in an that per tin cane notion yetis ugly o the movyscared yes charity was one of the kids on the steps with avid that day it was different for her though she told me was tit much the move itself that she was afraid of it was more scared for my soul i guess this was the height of the satanic panic and my parents were whole roller people and i had been told as a child my whole life satin could get to you from things movies or bad books chastity only watched a couple minutes of the move before she books at out the classroom bless than five she was sure was not enough for satin i mean it i was literally frightened that i had in some way participated enough to where the devil would come in invade my soul not the sort of kid who wants to end up on pa but one afternoon reporters fer in front of the school interviewing her mob who was not just outraged but also the my talking of the news the most about her outrage charities just standing there next to her feeling embarrassed and i felt everybody was looking at me and people were kind of laughing and stuff and i kind of stood out a for on many ways cause i was the charity by the way t was theory white kid in her glass pale with blond hair and blue eye i felt i could not just justappear blonde even if i wanted to but i remember talking to the reporters and i just remember them asking how did it make you feel or how was the move and i just said it was scary the kids a school ran with that she skids in the hall and they felt it was scary behind her and charity had never been one of the coolest kids to begin with i had a lot of friends and most people were nice to me but i also was very insecure at a lot of is she is at home am and then just too physically how different i was and everybody else and than with this whole situation it just brought more attention to me i felt and i felt i was bullied more i cried about it for share sots the little prase that has gone down and infamy i guess she was you was scary at ism mad cause i am thirty five now and i will still when i run in to people from elementary school or some one gets in contact with me on social media they will still say the whole it was scary and it is a kind of fills sometimes if people do not even remember the whole situation they remember that it was carry part and that was the sound bite i guess cause whenever they ran out of material to kind to make fun of me without it would never back to that because of it was carry and the fact that her mam was vocal on the news charity says kids and teachers blamed her for squealing to her mam and for bringing all this chaos and negative attention to the school when charity looks back on all this there is a whole list of a dolts who put her in the situation german the heavy reporter who made her the poster child with the losers her parents and church who told her the devil would come after her if she saw move this and of course her teacher who showed her the move the four teachers who shown the move were all removed from the school two were substitutes who had taken off the lists of says the school to call the two full time teachers were suspended for ten days and then reassigned to other schools in the district including avid and chastity's teacher the teachers apologized avid an charity's teachers that she owned the move but did not know what was on it that is the closest thing i found to an explanation for all this there was one thing the adults school did to try to more directly help the kids much also what a little weird avid remembers a woman coming to his class she told them she was a grief counsellor that's an introduction it medic my you are to talk about things if you have any fears to concerns that is exactly what ism here for bus avid thought that sounds o quiet do have fears and concerns but when she started the session he did not how she started a if anyone would to talk about what they saw n leprichon please come to the nurses office now whatever office they raisin and you had to raise your hand after they asked basically they were just is anyone here sillafra t ta leprichon thing raise your hand if whatsit you do to raise your hand or lake did you o yes little stood up and walk to the nurses offs as a group a group of sad kids and all the asshole kids were just making fun of everyone who stood up or rase her handle you are less you wet the bed you have bad dreams a you sack that crediting let me just p of the structural flow at this plan bat us the kids who are already been teas is elf identify as weeks in front of their peers and get marched always a group anyway the grief councillor sat the side kids down the did little group she starts asking us questions and the questions are presumably basic grief councilor questions what is your name do you feel safe at home what is your home life questions a appropriate for kids when experience and loss or abuse are neglect not does ten scarily leopercons specific and then time ran out knows it is decimally wasn't worth the public shaming en she canes ta cross the next time lot of the kidswho come to the first session and dropped out avid for whatever raisin one again and the grief councillor again she starts asking basic questions about who you are and if you feel safe and i remember raising my hand being are we going talk about the leopercon are we going to talk about how to kill this thing because in my mind it was a real fear the six year old mes this is bullshit this this counter is not worth the dam she is not giving us practical advice why we wasting time talking about this we need to focus on killing the fucking leopercon whetted i remember asking the grief councillor if the leopercon come she we just be carrying change with us you i need o carry gold to exchange my life because think there is a scene in the move where they distract the leopercon by throwing coins in the air i guess the the idea was that if they talk coins they had to count them or pick them of for something and they were throwing shoes because the leopercon was a cobbler and an to clean shoes but it was those types of questions do i do i need holy water for real i need somebody what educated in this who seen the move and can tell me the actual practical recipe to killing a leopercon what dis she say i remember her being kind of taken aback by the questions and and just giving the same kind of stock answer f this is not real this is not something you should have to worry about u which is not helpful it filled more a recenter of the poor brown school and make sure the kids are all right avid just remember s feeling the message who is getting from a adults kept being the problems in the move the problem is your reaction there is no reason to be scared avid did not agree again he was a really bright get in a class with other brightceats and people were more able to express you i do not have anything at home that ism really worried about ism is really worked about the leopercon or ism afraid of the darker one girl wet the bed as a result of that pushes sad and true how do that cause we had to disclose these things in this fucking group session to this goddamn grief councillor the grief councillor was cousin one in here what the bed and some one had to raise their hand oh yes somebody had to opt into that and it was a little girl in my class your her name topaz please sleep that ill my bit it'll brief it oh avid consider all these years later was not discreet low pass warm stole is was yen it an ha be and s honestly along a is as marabou promise boring pain nice many wallwayseon as one of the produces a echoing out than ages left in he room with other teen ages at church whet could possibly go round there that is in a minute for scagaboblegridio when our programmed continues tamari life from our glass today's programmed the kids table stories of what happened when the kids are on the warm the grunts have left the room and the kids had to figure things out by themselves we arrived at at two of our programmed a to classified that the stories about what happens wen on a door really is never around at all for a long time and the strange consequences and desires that can come out of that cristpendera explained in twenty eighteen georgia cad was on a cruise with her mam in the day this all started was not as fun as she would imagined their ship had been scattered a dark at the picturesque wetland islands off the northern coast of scotland but instead because of bed weather the boat had docked in an unremarkable industrial sottish town we were repeated to a port called in for cordon which possibly has a lock going for it it'd imagined that we would be in wetland having this wonderful time looking at tiny horses was wetland ponies and unsaid we went to a very dreary museum looking at a reproductions tiff escape from nineteen sixty five and then an peter our friend peter popped up peter was a seventy yer old man from wales who georgia renamed met in the crush's dining hall a few days earlier he told them corny jokes and a lot stories from his days as a fire fighter they liked him know in the museum he invited the two of them to go get coffee we found this community came and the three of us sat down on a table which hat and empty seat and bow two three minutes later a woman came up he none of us had met before but was also on the creisship and she asked us could she sit and join us on the table and without skipping a beat peter said oh was just telling my wife and caught it be lovely to have some company and she sat down none the wiser my mum i think ground possibly rolled her eyes and then he spotted my mum's reaction to what he would said and he an he corrected himself oh ex wife ex wife we like to go on holiday still for georgia an to see the family to gather gorge's man mostly set out this practical who georgia meanwhile pride gage whether peter was really going to keep the our he once he was saying things oh georgina's very clever she is a river she is published a book a she did really well at school all true by the way georgia decided to playing or popsworks in the fire service he is a retired fire fighter he is to go up and down the town and wonky asking the ladies to go on his fire truck and have no doubt the woman thought we were very strange family but she seemed to believe that we were a family eventually peter georgia ream said good bye to the woman and last out in the street they laughed proud of pulling off the stupid little caper as they walked back to the ship peter mentioned a georgia i always wondered what it mud be to have a daughter and i thought immediately we have always wandered what stroud be to have a at o gorge's dad was not with her on the crews because hit was not in her life never had been left before georgia was even born an she was twenty five she found out where he lived and arranged a visit she packed her bags and was on her way to the station when she got a call from her uncle telling her that her dad had died hit had health issues closer she got to him was at the funeral she would never had a father figure in her life until in really small silly way was fifteen minutes in the came with peter it been such an odd thing but it felt good and unusual an she just wanted to see could that be a relationship that she would have in her life an older man to give advice and my dad got and be proud it is he lit a little spark wit something i felt very elated it seemed a little donate pen kids i glimpsed something what what would she say that was i think i think it was a need to feel acceptable and lovable bi bi men with out a hide a gents this is sort of a big thing to discover on a sight seen trip to invergorden that she wanted a dad's love but it stuck with her she did not gorge peter's in provision but the was not exactly what she was after then georgia got an idea and you should know gorge's the paper person who gets very creative when she tries to solve a problem she once worked in a funeral parlor to deal with her fear of death took scubidaving lessons cause she was scared a fish and she made an ad for a dad classified at it said she was looking for some one to act as a father figure nothing sexual she could be reached at never had a dad eighty seven at sealed outcome georgia figured a lot of the man who could be her father still read actual newspapers in magazines say i started with the magazine who new scientist because i thought it'd quite a dad who knows science and i decided the i'dvit to run just stuff to christian because all the dad type likes would have got subscriptions for that christian presently that numbers would bat accessible that is very strateache oh i was yet very strategic very step taxi she might expect she heard from a lot of creepy older guise but they were not all that many people saw the ad for what it was and seemed genuinely interested she emailed with a bunch of them in particular this one guy live he was in his sixties had had kids fremultiple marriages was estranged from one of his children something he seemed sad about georgia in lived emailed for weeks then started talking on the phone to i mean the first time on the fine we would both acknowledged the old quickness of it which was a great ice break an a green flag for me live stood out from all the other fakedads that she female with some of these got as they rule just waxing clerical about life in the universe in everything but life was very engaged an remembered details i told him showed a real interest in me an my life an i was interested in him in his life and he was open about struggles that he had with mental health an also and we would easily be on the fine for ninety minutes two hours i think we clips which is clips they talked about kids georgia was wondering if she should have them and they talked politics more than she liked even though the politics were the same red it red tit would come up often i guess much a dor to my dey to that dad sis i me can just she was just oo about something else as about something ell desk i have babies or not i i tell me they never met faced face but they talk on the phone maybe every month or for a year and a half it was getting really well after a while the things shifted a little bit and we had this fame cold and towards the end of the call he said that he had been drinking and am he started telling me that he he love me and why would not i call more regularly he would love it if i would just call more regularly and i felt a cornered and it was not anything the tine of conversation wed had for all these months up to that point and i got scared and i rat raped it up and i melt him that i did not feel able to be in the relationshipany more having had what he said in that cool what did it due to you that eighteen months into what seemed a kind of success full far a had situation that that he had actually seen it romantically what's is interesting that that you say romantic because actually it did not feel he was being romantic it even that e w sang i lover you and i i did not feel he wanted to get in bed with me or anything it just felt he craved he was craving the company which is to say she would gotten exactly what she would asked for a relationship what a lot of people have with their parents who understandably wont morphine calls in time and attention and i could not be that i could not call i call the time and i bailed i think i got scared and went into hiding i felt i felt i till fix extremely guilty than that about that unit seen six months sin sealed lie which by the way is not his real name she could not bring herself to look in the into again till our interview still has not written back georgia is still in touch with the guy on the not the one gave it the idea in the first place peter the talk now and then a friendly while back he mailed her a box of cakes when she was feeling down and by the we when she told him about the ad he was horrified worried your no get murdered he told her like a real at would said crispendra to produced her herenofsho that three stations of the double cross shonaday is about kids trying to make sense

great our one white priest whose punish was terrible he could not roll his ours and said a their mom does not go to the mass any more when he is there because she does not understand him every one laughed he followed the procession all the way to the actual crucifixion at the top of a hill and sank apart and then suddenly the mood shifted the youth leaders seemed to straighten up they got serious stopped talking to us retreated and stirred a whispering among themselves we all need to get to the church a sap one of them said they rounded us up once we were out of the park and saved a head count when we got back to the him the than leaders continued to be quiet every one needs to sit down and formal circle around the room a youth leader said now w creators whispered rumors of what could have happened maybe someone was ditching during the walk or they caught some one smoking weed out of an apple from the snack table maudisil though one adult supervising the retreat walk in to the room looking down at the floor with his hands in his pockets he stood in the middle of the circle and took his sweet time to look up at us look at basuaoara look at basafuera for absolute theme the erispetoso whahappen to day we happened out there was absolutely disrespectful now saying this and punish really kick things up notch the whole retreat was in english up into this point and getting scolded in english was something we got from our teachers at school but for kits us hearing disappointment in the language your parent spoke made it all much more intents he paced around the circle he stopped again shook his head at the floor we were participating and the crucifixion of jess christy our lord and saviour who carried the weight of the cross to which he was destined to be nailed to who took the whippings of the roman and his mother our virgin marry washed your son suffer for what for all you to take a joyful walk in the neighborhood to buy your raspy those a met your ill is and talk and laugh his voice trembled and he started to cheer up he had one hand over his eyes he walked to the podium and grabbed a heavy crucifix got o one to those ti this tiki the simple ambition sad every single one of you should feel ashamed he shouted how could you call yourself a child of god you cannot stand there with him when he sacrifices for you when he has suffering he had the crucified tight to his chest and continued to cry it was my first time seeing a grown man crying real life he was out of breath that times and between the yelling and the crying the room stayed still and no one was making eye contact with each other i quickly tried to recall the whole walk in my head and what i was doing thinking oh shit i was talking was i talking loud did i laugh damn i did laugh panic i looked at crystal to see how she was taking it and i notice tears werestreaming down her face she was still loosely holding the corn on the cop she bought she got up through it out and a bunch of retreated being in to do the same you see this he held out the large crucifix and quickly walked towards the center of the circle this this is what you did to day he yelled he slammed the crucified at the center of the circle i closed my eyes a tragic at the floor it shattered scattering pieces all over there was a collective flinch and gasp audio walked out it was watching some one spit out the way for you get at communion back into the priest's hands i looked around to see a lot of repeater's headstand hearing disrupted breaths from crying this girl carl who went to the same middle school as me and was known to be someone of a trouble maker was sitting ripe behind me she took a deep sigh and with the exhale let out o what the fuck which in away was exactly what i was thinking dude be folding respectful said the boy sitting behind her dude do not say fucking we at church said another whisper behind him you just set it carrot quickly snapped a collective sh followed i turned and looked tat carl she leaned in smacked her lips and whispered man de do this every year a a said he told me i could not even process it sold this is an act that they put on every year to make us feel bad that seemed really unhinged like every year audio car is yes and breaks the crucifix as i was thing to make sense of it my neighbor sepia wo happened to be one of the youth leaders walked to the venture of the circle microphone in hand still crying the other youth leaders took turns hugging her finally she wiped away her tears don't worry you guides she said she raised one of her arms up into the air closed your eyes punish gospel music began to crescendo in the background a move i look over at the speaker to see a youth leader slowly turning up the volume not the rest of the youth leaders followed sepia and closing their eyes too slowly the crowd of retreat kids still sitting on the floor did the same sophist opened her eyes and looked up at the ceiling if we repent he will for give us i looked up along with everyone else pressed against the ceiling i could see soccer balls had been kick too high and got in stuck i glanced around the room and at crystal whose writ next to me she was completely moved listening and crying transfixed was this the moment was this what they were talking about and was this what i came for we on the walk home i told my on the whole story she was surprised and thought the breaking of the crucifix was more disrespectful to god then the eating and talking during the reenactment the part my dad could not get over throwing away perfectly good food he said that was the real son guilty kids into that it did not fully set instill that night the lank they had gone to to play with our feelings that a grown man dot would be appropriate to pretend to be angry that the than leaders cheated us up try to be coo with us only to throw it on our faces and use it against us i wondered how many times wit could have possibly done this and how many kids never learned that it was scripted or i guess eventually did when they became the ones who tried to pull this on others i almost sit and go back the next day but i for a real did think i might get my epiphany i might get closer to got i just needed to trust it more and at the same time a small part of me thought this was just it too how far i the vent take this what other spectacles we have planned i did not want i mi said ki was not disappointed they three was even weirder when we all arrived at the him there is these tall wooden crate in the middle behind them hung a large white tarp no one explain it to us instead the youth leaders asked us about the times we felt our parents misunderstood or neglected us lots of kids stood up and it got very real one girl talked about how much her mam expected her take care of her siblings they were her kids some one shared that he was gay and he knew his parents would never accepted it got to me it got to all of us then one youth leader pulled out a bucket of water balloons there filled with paint she said throw them at the crates let out your anger and castration at your parents people hurled them hard paint was everywhere when they finished the youth leaders went to the back of the crates and opened them up several parents stepped out covered and pain no one saw this coming see see what anger toward your parents does this is what it us look at what all did the room got quiet the peasant look somber some of them kept their heads down their kids run up to them sobbed in their arms and asked them for forgiveness welders told other kits to join them and they did and just stood there i looked at the crates and i could tell that the paint could not really seep through the small openings they painted the parents before the even when inside it was yesterday was just a warm up there was a pattern a formula they use they invited us to be ourselves again but this time more fully people were being vulnerable and they used it against them it felt cruel and dishonest and gross in a way could not describe why did they set it up said wed end o feeling we had to beg for forgiveness tit was the only way they knew to bring us closer to god was to trick us a parton me was waiting for my piling but now i was sure they would not get me there and have to get there on my own machine far is one often

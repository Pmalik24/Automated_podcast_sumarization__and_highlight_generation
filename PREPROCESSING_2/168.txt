i can before you can understand how bob sister became the talk of the third grade and the big day that that led to the people still remember and he to explain first that bob's sister is a drawing the teacher in this third great class mister a blow spotted it one day while teaching mat he saw one of the students anionic working on a picture i went over to him said but the picture way ism probably did that two or three times and in the fourth time i went over it i just took the picture an a he have not said a pe attention its botglass and i put on my desk he came up wit before rest lesson as i can have my picture back knows what is this picture of anyways and he say it is bob's sister and i and i mi who is bob's sister turns out bob's sister is opinion an which am i do not you think bob sister exists in the minion world yo say saying the minions from from the give despicable ma yes exactly and he just invented a sister character for bob yes patently mister a bob take the drawing to the bookshelf behind his ask n your fellow of a wolf that was already there cause it was square of anionic kept the drawing i would continue to be a distraction him and a couple of his friends who at that point were the only won's in class the really cared about bob's sister that is i do not worry she is not going anywhere show be are here he time one s sheer shoal be behind me cause he his were into the picture bob's sister ye i did not really quite understand why i never investigated why this was picture was such a big deal but yet they would talk about they would go up and look at it is a thing why were you i excited about bob's sister do you thing i think it is because it was that can begin distraction in class that people could talk about i straight forward enough this a down when of antenna's friends who was in to bob's sister from the start described the drawing it is just it of to puss and then it had to is and then tent class coming out an he was bob's sister was an back tor puss bob's sister was not of to puss but bob's opinion wit it did not yearly have anything to do it that and was he referring to the minion bob reminds now knows not i see was it a good drawing it was and et holds locate drawing it was an amazing but it was he knew what it was this sole question is t a n onto puss is an opinion a santonica who do boys sister about that he tended to see bob sister as a pack man ghost with big eyes but he said and at tholes surprising a mature for somebody in elementary school he thought part of the a peal of bob's sister was it was open to interpretation i really do not know what it is it is just a thing i do not know what it it is just lots of different things you could think of it as a minion that looks for it you could think of it as fly out with the legs you could think of as pack my got with tigers it bob sit was different to everybody ut everyone with one of them which just n it we did not a thing i any more play with the lit but the thing was see to bob's sister was bob's sister was not actually anyone's sister is am was just bob's sister in is face that is very foin e e did not do up wit the enter either bob's sister generals specified were don the book shelf near the fellow of a wolf and tall one week when mister a bob wen on vacation and the kids hat is substitute when mister bob came back bob sister was gain banished disappeared and was all that kids wanted talk about this is the point where everybody in class is very very interested a bob's sister this kind of all the speculation about what happened to bob's sister a she stolen which she murdered a did she die and i go in you not look a little bit looked under the desk a look be in the bookshelf and just substitute am i did actually he they had no idea what is talking about which was good enough for me a really for me that makes him suspect number one interest there's y i dodo not watch any crime drama at all an or the all kinds of theories about what happened bob sister in toting i don said it was really fun to talk about various abductors cutting animals from an alternate universe but done says the prime suspect for is classmates that other picture on the bookshelf they just decided that the wolf at the cause it was e was tin right a bobs the wolf the wolf was jealous or something the reallealy know why they guess that is er that is what they said who said that they finally everybody i mean he is a wolf yet the chatter about bob sister does not go away which is funny but also mister blabs got a correcuum to get through i a kind of vaguely annoyed because is not going on in a school they do not have much time to think about a picture of bob sister but they're kind of pestering me about it and than one other student dean actually pipes and says can we have a funeral for bob sister and what are you talking about and and there well she died something happened om and i funeral for bob sister or picture and i say yes pagan just to get them to stop talking about bob sister but also this is the kind of teacher is he said sometimes it is mart to take some detours farthings way they lead and they wen li i do not know when i do not know whet this funerals can happen and there wen ones it can happen one open we are going to have a funeral bob sister and then finally after the recess on fridge and that was money rest the week o pretty normally mister blabs or hoe that they would forget about the funeral by theanowe but no way they murmuring about it paring for it which she has no part of the eight year old of t ones organizing us and thinking it through finally fridge arrives the big day the day a the funeral gets come back into the room from recess they are pretty giddy and pretty excited fin can okay game o let us go funeral i have no idea what what is about to transpire all of a sudden whom tables kind of move out of the way the leader of the funeral comes up with the stroll two other students bring two tables and crab the flowers apparently a bunch of girls had been making posters they right bob sisters funeral on the board tone's leader of the funeral and he prepared to uvula said t his friend the do not gets in front of the class holding micrfound mister bad keeps in the room the rest of the class is totally on t e edge of their seats is waiting for this kid to to start the funeral it paying more attention to him than they ever pay to me ready for it o he starts out kind of all being about welcoming every one thanking everyone for coming to celebrate the life of bobs is sure now how did what to say in a owed we we get we just said lie since things that sounding about way something that that you might say i funeral that might make someone cry you have you your wild e there yet tinker it out could you read it and gets and tit ta sort of my obsess was sort of back and forth she an who sell is et can being ell bobs sister was a great person people that that bob as just a drying on a piece of paper for i know he was anything bat back but she is still in here she mad e think i can do things in school if she was see to a she would a keep on trying that is going eyes it sounds you r trying to be set of inspiring ye had you seen a you would and a move or something that that you knot never wo the other you would the shoot was also really good i just when ti say something about the special person here bobs sister as show such a good friend all the potatoes and especially mister potato had a potatoes were another fascination an mister rebate's class at year what an honor it was to have her with us god class her and tan from the back of the room mister blow here is a boy crying i would say almost wailing but it was a real cry and at first time thinking oh i got another just turning this into a joke and then i realize that he is actually seriously crying this is not a joke cry and i walk back i walk back there and everyone cant of turns back every one's looking at both of us and i ask him i what is wrong what is going on how why why a you crying ah and he is it is because bob's sister did and i was it is not about anything else maybe and he is know it is to sisters died it is just sad mister blow thinks maybe it was really about his dog dog that boy had grown up with die just two weeks before his mommison an demon to let him know but mister class boy not shore it ain't your plenty old enough to catch a glimpse of what death means and then they look up and then the whole kind of feel of the class room is changed it is gone from kind of giddy excitement this is a fun thing to half the class is nervously laughing and the other half looks there on the verge of tears there about three girls that are kind of really sad and i was oh no what if i created this was this was reaching an emotional level that i actually had never experience before and have been teaching for about a fifteen years and it'd never felt kind of this not that it was getting out of control but it was it was leading to something that i did not know of can and honestly i do not know what is go to happen next if three other kids step crying i do not know how to anal e situation i like id third never experience kind of that in a glass room it is interesting it is it is it is it is it is they were playing around with aneralike with a weepy board and joking around and suddenly they accidentally summoned a demon into the room ye and a way and for me t i was i was right there on the weepy board with him and stand said this monsters in the room you've run wish this really good find o of primal force this grief it this yet greet death and a i mean one of the really mean things about their grad as it is i mean there is to saying you they stop a learning to read and are a reading to learn such that it is an age where their world gets a lot bigger they kind of are experiencing real things and i think a funeral is one of those things they probably all heard of a funeral they read them in books but most of them probably had not been to one and did not know what that felt an mister bola felt responsible tell them through this near experience he had lots of others that year he took control of h room back from the its and ad dress them all that was well funerals a can o serious sometimes when you go to a funeral it make it is very sad because you are missing the person that is a move on and sometimes it reminds you other people who've moved on a and it is important to remember those people and it is important to be sad o and this is the end of the funeral which work give body shaped to of it the deeming left the room next as free times they ill enjoy everything it's fine but at the end of the school year when the class stood in a circle when each came something they remembered and liked from third grave a couple of the kids said bob sister's funeral here is a moment for mister anal to sometimes you know the joking round not light and fun and trying something you have never done before and some bigger subterranean force gets on wast that is what i just going to be about to day those moments you get a glimpse of all that feeling it is there down below hidden from sit o to easy chico its this america life am or glass stay with as nan enact one music of the night after night after night after night after night after night after night alright when you go to a big theatre you see all the people who are on stage the brightly wit the visible to everybody they're bitterly there to be seen but then just below them down in front there is the orchestra pit than it seems straightforward enough what happens in there musicians play their instruments but other things go on in there all kinds of in reactions and feelings it usually we do not get much of a picture of you there old saying hell's other people not she comes from the theatre come from play no legs it that boy was not widen by somebody who sits in the orchestra pit but jam cast bin hang is the story but how many musicians and theatrical orchestras might understand the sentiment refers brat casts the story back in twenty twenty we are bringing it back to day with an update here is yet tie team it to new york and two thousand six to try to make it as musician he had just finish a college and had all these dreams of playing the trumpet for a living but it was a struggle there just art many cops for trumpet players any more he must be waited by the phone for gigs rein magnet church service is experimental plays and the occasional substitute cob with marry point on roadway and then a spot opened out that is favorite show its might be the am i but i remember i was in my apartment i was on the toilet i got a for car and i did not recognize the number and i listen t to voice to saying hi sis prison and free tout this is one of the conductors for phantom in the opera she offered him a chop in shut six days a week and twice on thirsdays and saturdays ism not sure i probably t letter finish your sentence you know yes ism very inerrant varying sit an viable those s the lie change n really disevalon one e water oh yes i shall remember the next o day i had to go roster hoping and i remember i remember by coin to water i know why always my treat cause i always one my coin water but it was always too much of ut as joking swat this is as do not need to spend i remember mine coin a water an d feel mike such a bat ass an tat is fell i can buy anything here it was not just a steady income nick was excited about and i of the offer was a show take its love since he was eleven years old he ha just tarted playing the trumpet and with lay on his living room floor listening to the music of the night it slowly manly nigh frills it slender that call changed his life he would finally arrive fan i on broad way on his first day nice enter the majestic theatre on forty six and eighth avenue he walked through a back alley pass a gintub of dry eyes down a flight of stairs into a lock room where he changed into all black he then headed into the pit to play the music he had loved as a child he had his own seat there now and a music stand he played the first show next day he went back and place it again and then again his brain started to a jess to playing the same show eight times on we and then he started to notice it was not just the music that repeated it he to seen the same actors f exam him tire in the same is is signs of exact same time and seeing same people the bafthrim i thexactons in every time one of the dancers comes through to put her wig on she says to one of the other dancer is sold good jaw brick lie every vicinal day is very ground hark i at first is his funny almost charming nick was thirty an the youngest person in the pit not by a few years but by a few decades he never been in a situation this where everyone seemed locked into routine this colleagues would sit down in their chairs at the exact same minute every day there is the challie to would say marvelous every time they asked him how he was doing there is the first horn player who had pull out a stop watch every single night to time how long the second on player held a note in one of the songs some days it would be seventeen seconds and other days sixteen point to you you deffully start to notice people talking about each other men complaining about it the same people are await every single week if you bumping to a stand by accident you will get i light wat the you doing come if the luck take a deep breath ion o what what is a bang at the the a is are o easily ill not is hated haves the rest of them a no by say anything that is now a i now solo beer e i i even be vertigo e yo sill no you sell o in o people kind of walk in the li acid less again and some of us us in the boy language the way they walk in the door the con a train ago at one some one says to i have to do this that i final of the opera open on roadway and canary nineteen eighty eight it was an instant hit at my one i a thing is at is about comes a can come an the show is virtually guarantee to run we into the next delicate it did and then another tractate an another the musicians of the pits on contracts with the provision which guarantee their jobs until the show shut down he expected two may be three years but the show kept going this three years turn into five years win then turned into thirty two that is over thirteen thous an performances fvannam is now the longest running show in the history of roadway there's almost a feeling a she t you have to do in again you have to doubt again that s many felt he hobo as who as been in the pit for twenty eight years now t on ate describe it a physical sensation that i get a literally ton only on o mi set my it is a legs i cannot stay a stay when crazy only that thing as happened i first heard about the pit at final through a friend whose wife had recently supped in the viol in section she described which she had seen as a horror show waiting for gunman but thirty hard years down the line i could not quite get it out of my head s one of the first things people ask how can you possibly stay saying and play the same music every nigh he wright has been playing fans since opening night he is a french horn player who times the notes on hi stop watch every night no there is something in that we you i would look in the music sometimes and it would just look literally look shapes i would just see circles and wines and dots i would have no idea i will not even know what page to as on the this get the s associate of failing almost like hearing yourselves speak and you do not and you are not sure it is english i that is i do not think that ever happened and then that is the funny things you see someone else do at you immediately know what is going on with him but what is their face like oh there just legal they just it is as if they do not even know where they are they are waking up in another room it's what happened where am i what day is it what week is it when i start o talking to the pit musicians a couple of years ago i wanted to know how they found meaning in the mandating inevitable repetitions of life and lots of jots people do the same thing every day bud nothing quite this you hearing the exact same lines from the stage playing the exact same not for the same songs even they got sating next to you breaths in the exact same them every day the final is is pristine for the first time in the same handler comes crashing down in the same spot on the stage i have seen the archaist remembers were sand archers o pull back the same bow it the same motion until they die i talk to a trumpet player an well hereby long been at the showings day one and everyone says he is the same as person in the pet and a kind of drives you nuts for the first few weeks and then after that your mind deals with it and just flushes it out when you are not there i do not think about it do the words to the songs at your play a no thou not entirely where any girl here any fondly whatever i may i remember one at one time after a show had been running for a while it is somebody asked me to play able bit of a tune from the shell and i could not even do it i could not even think of one had submerge ti mut prayers look base just ejected being cognacs under the music is going on the thin that typical of people do to shows that the right time of personality as that can hands is shop ism descended from a long lying of serfs and pe of you ow people who are use tell papering in the feels for for hardly any money and than are relatively happy with that the final players are not exactly sir's they are well paid they play beloved show and they get the playing small orchestras on the side but the is are highly trained musicians who went to the fanciest music schools in the world drew laid waver one end the best of the best for final which means a pit will always sound good though it also create some creative and spiritual problems for the players who have to get through the score night after night after night ism a violent operator how you describes that is that is how you describe o you i fun's it is it is very technical i have i have no emotional connection with it that is a violinist named kercobel he is a composer his dream was always to write scores for chordophones hes now been at wanna for twenty two years long enough to see three people in hi section die ism playing the show nobody's interested in my creative in put have often compared it to working in a hospital doit is just we just keep the s o alive as long as we can here they all are and this heard social experiment trap together for decades twenty seven musicians crammed into this tiny space e trumpet player told me it is playing in a summer have been down there and you can barely turn round without knocking into something in the pit you notice everything the way your neighbor blows out as pit van way some one brags about their kids the smell of some one's perfume every little annoyance every receives flight accumulates one of my favorite stories which should drive any one who has ever played in a band crazy there is his present player who has sat next to the same clarinet player since nineteen eighty eight she is convinced he plays half in flat on every note he is ever played he denies this the person i talk to the muss in the pit was meany the oboist she is one of the rare people you meet who has no real filter i was complaining about something which i imagine was that it was really cold it is always really cold and then e some one else from the orchestra said just tired f the sound o your voice an ism tired o the some of my boys toothy i con is sympathized with her then ti was a violet is that man because i say used round up in my garden she she would not speak to me for i to weeks during most of our talks melody was making reeds it is an extraordinarily meticulous process there is all sorts of medieval looking tools and tiny bits of wood everywhere oh most a the most onanistic people in the world because overtime tan agreed they think that at my work f usually do not at anyway this part only is gypping the more i you made to pick your color of thread and it just makes all that ever that i never know what color he i is as always find that mi have that got awful noise meany studied it dullard she dreamed of being the principal obsess in the mechrupon opera or the philharmonic but she kept bobbing her editions her nerves got the bass of her every time she was up for a big seat and then life and bills intervene cannot in that way is a very good job in a feel where there are not a lot of good cops anymore he put maladies kids through college peter mortgage and provided security while the music industry classed around her but at the end of thirty years sitting just inches away from your coworkers you lose all sense of proportion your enemies turn into monsters for many the monster in the pit was always the trumpet player named francs bani everything he did proof melon not from the black biking shorts he wore in the pit to always eating his dinner in the lockeroom with his pack turned to her francs was the miserable sone of ice and at a certain point he is story o working bi he put this black sheik shed on the side of his glances yes where those ins cause of one to see me i that is why hes where is i really truly boy i wanted to run this all by francs it just seems unreasonable france is the only person i had talk to who had actually escaped from the pit he got in a troll an trove out to the middle of nowhere in colorado he says he is much happier now you pelham melody oh ye hevythi i undersea that you too did not have the best relationship one of things that she told us was that that he c basically made an eye patch that you would not have to look at hers is this a true story that justellingus i did do that some join but elbowsn't just because a million oh she is taken too crucial it was actually anybody that was on my right she told us for a long time that you sat in the lockeroom and that you re turn your back to every buy because you did not want to look at them yell yell was in a lacker room i came there i my dinner looked at the white will minivan play the show and then left the theatre left the premises as fast as i could and o it worked beautifully can you compare that relationships that you have with other relationships it is family it is espies you cad stay in a putting up with people did you just do not want to hear their voice again you sit there thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of hours this is a cart of a life time the musicians in the pet do not play the whole time which means there are thousands of hours where they are not actually doing anything and during those last they read books spy thrillers and mysteries and do the crossword with their neighbors the trumpet player has taught himself three languages another musician ran a wood shop business on his lap top during the so and socially it is a bit middle school there are the loners the jocks and the french horns they are the boys in the back in the box they bring in fart machines and run the same practical jugs over and over sometimes the even mass of the audience the front row is right up against the pet close that their feet sometimes dangle next of the musicians heads occasionally one on the french horn players and take out a bottle of white out and writ little messages on the souls of the audiences shoes those guys there is sitting where behind me they are always chattering and laughing i being me if i play badly i think i go their sang how terrible an oh god i do not want you reallocate myself this more than anything meany told me is one makes her want a sound good every night she is worried the french horn guides will make fun of her ism not playing for the adding cause he audience does not and ism playing for those french horn place i do wane to say on one of the complete have gotten over the years is how do house to play well when you have just bee doing phantom for all those years itsthit is a choice that i fat my choice is to play this music its any other music full i ply and and make it beautiful an you firth can cite really hard one if it is really battle i beg you now during the pandemic the rest of roadway random shut down the unstoppable show as put on paws for a year and a half i checked in with meany during that break she wasn't doing very well she was not getting paid by the show and she miss wanna this was a rising to me meany and all the other musicians had told me about their fannassins a finally leaving the show and i had believe them but now that it actually happened she miss the routine fantom i miss the the comradeship the re petition of the silly jokes and watching everyone at and i do not know the routine i count of lake routine in my life this of course is the coppice of what she said in the past before covet was always easier to complain that it was boring and to complain about driving into the city and wasting all that time in the carat playing the same music and going home again an and right just thought i knew i was lucky back then but it becomes very real now i me what can i fay now i really no what if not having this job i it is s much fun to complain about things that do not matter ah the women in the bath from they are just always talking about their expensive hair and make up and i its the women in the bar and i ye it'd be happy to complain about that again before the pandemic every time i talk to melody i would ask how she was doing ran are always depended on parking it is hard to park in mid town manhattan the good parking spot was a good day the bad parking spot was a bad day this is how she made sense of her life i think about this all the time most of our lives are spent finding parking for the job we do not want to do melody's not alone in that and after any number of years those routines accumulate and that is more or less your life of all the people i talk to in the pet one musician dealt with the moaning inevitable repetition of life in a way that really stock with me for the past two decades in the pit cart the musicians described himself as a violin operator has been dreaming up the most elaborate and metaphorically perfect coping mechanism it is a ban made up entirely of automatons i met these robot musicians in a warehouse in yorkers the pagan stands for partially artificial musicians kart's automatons are made up of scraps of medicine string all wired up to a soundboard that kirkman program to crate whatever sounds he wants there is magnet an electric corn organ a creep the base guitar and then there is rosy the ferment this is each a solid body electric violin using be ex skeleton design this is what how o alleviate the word of of the redundancy of phantom o ism constantly thinking about this project and how i can cruel he out o nation and the con music that i would the createwhat why did you decide to do this oh if i ever see a therapist maybe they will help me under solo i and i there i was a part of it where you are man i am playing in this orchestra ism not expecting a it is not the expressiveness that i want i also a kind of feel an automaton and may u just make an automaton a short violins i may i can i can see exploring that am i looking for some kind of soul heeling from this dehumanization of being in a violent section possibly i ask cart if the pagan could play the music of the night or all i ask of you or any of the peanut classics he was not into that at all this band was not design tod play aneroid leper but something inside him just can't get away from phantom of the opera back when he was sitting in the pet he would can pas just in his head both the prequel an the sequel to than both which involve india a ones type characters in years ago he got a copy of the nineteen twenty five silent film version of peanut and wrote an entire score he wanted to play it for me he turned out the lights in the warehouse and projected the film on to the wall the pagan started to play the score features him curt as the solo violent is from the star of the show the automatons all play the same thing but curd always improvises not of his show wherever the than can casual can staffordr from the new yorker lost for the pi cask time to say good by vestry was produced by miking we a first brook as sat stop three years ago and now the deputes of repetition in the phantom on the upper pit are finally coming to an ad after thirty five years the long is running show on roadway history is closing this week curious how the musicians in the pit were takin the news ja caught up with melody the boo air which she just had four shows left to play ja asked about the human when everybody w works on the show her definitively doing a big numerating actually the show was finally close it was your first thought cause i remember that we had talked about in you sort of you and and all and he had all sort of fantasized about because i asked your was e long less wot waiting in at on you leave like hausigan a feel i and the habit actually feel as you finagling at confirmation that o cad this is acting in and the first things you yes that the dropping of your got into the cellar kind of feeling of shock just complete shock be the bottom is falling out of my world kind of feeling i was upset om what i do i a i do not want to be sad i will be angry let us choose anger and i said ism going to focus on all the things i hate and that way i will not be sad and that is what i did so it did it work i did at work meter i was successful to just focus on everything you head and yet a you knead whatever feelings as sad that sever grad ran a fear that might have thought the now this is at the beginning o k i was good right i was successful om now that it is imminent i do feel different om now it is much more but dollar poster up and down right now there all kinds of exciting activities going on and then you can sort of forget that it is closing i am certainly sad about it it is an entire way of life om i i cannot even really imagine knowing it will never be back but most of those people ism never on to see again are people being nicer to one another the thank you for us people a man nice ism trying be quieter up things that annoying me but fewer things are annoying me and it is all very festive and fun we had really fund photo up on fridge we they had a full company photo call i really enjoyed it because everybody was up on stage they all gave as the poster and everyone is getting their poster sign your high school your book and when i first interviewed you several years ago one of things take you told me that a o made me laugh a lot was that you after playing twenty something years at the time on the show had never actually seen the shell and that her blue my mind because its i bayou in stink you never actually the show yet om i realized that i really wanted to see the show and i asked the management and they set me up at the soundboard and it was wonderful his just last week i think and what what amaze me was the pageant the of it the beauty of it i had no idea you see them bringing in all the ice back stage outside of the stage short everyday theresthe giant ice container the dry ice and the they carry it in and then and then we used to complain about the the smoke but i never knew what the smoke did and it is crates is incredible atmosphere and then there is all these lights li we see the candle of under the stage but they are not lit under the stage and i got to see them on the stage an i got to see the final in crisceen at the end of i do not know which number it was but they just disappear i made it is a trap door but is o is this just disappearing ad i feel a little kid in a way just low struck by always seen that other people have seen many time a eleven people home in the pick closing night the musicians who ere there on opening night back a nineteen eighty eight was able to reach old hurry who as ja wen at the story if it to cause the sanest person in the red many well has other gages lined up rafter van closes here and there nothing big nothing to challenging neither of them imagines playing for another roadway show there is a sub as regular player well i have to say was very chill about the closing i cannot say that i did not enjoy going to work i did it is fun for me to do that and i will miss that but i i think i could find other things that will interest me i do not feel it'll be word how old wee you on the first opening night i was forty can ask you to go back and imagine for second forty year old you on the opening night of phantom if you could somehow have said to him you will be here for thirty five years and you will be here on closing night of this show what would that forty year old have said a well i would have been really happy to have heard that because at it's a time fandom open i had eleven and a thirteen year old in two kids and college was coming up if you has told me the phantom was counting out more than just a few years and go thirty five i would have been thrilled because that would have bent i would have some security ye i would have been very happy to have that information coming out a mam goes under ground goes under cover to get an urgent message to her daughter that is in a minute jigogobup a great wen our programmed continues ti smack on live from my declass to days program what lies beneath stories of things and people usually hidden from view coming to the surface we have arrived at at two of our program act too how i met my mother sone some families what is beryl deep below of the true feelings people have about one another there is many people out there who have trouble saying directly what they really feel one the produces here it i show on a baker comes from a long line of passive aggressive communicators by the way they know this they own it when a grandmother wanted to get a must cross message do not weave change lying around one time she put an article on the fridge saying toddler chokes on penny and then just left at everybody else to connect the dots on his mother communicates in the same indirect way which became a problem in the years after ulna left the church on his family's merman and a mammal some important things that you want to say to or here is on this all started when i made a joke about my abying wed to my brother careful he said if mammal were that she would send an email to the whole family about how you are an addict i laughed and then i was wait what that was wage specific did mom sent an email to the whole family about me being an addict and he was nothing never mind which could only mean one thing she did it took several round a questioning before i got the whole story the ego he was referent thing my mama rented ten years ago at the time i was about to house o comedy showing new york where me and a bunch of performers but played drinking games on state it was called the drunk show the show was being promoted on line my ma'am a devout wardens a an article about it and free down warrant do not drink it is against the religion and what i learned from my brother years after the fact is that my mind was worried that i was doing this show she sent an email to my family my extended family uncles cousin s and family friends who i grew up what life the riches the cox is highly my middle school drama teacher dear friends it begins i am writing because i am concerned about the direction elm's life is turned she is spiralling downward fast my mind then explains to them that ism doing this event called the drunk show then wrists i am very concerned and our family you are either in alcoholic or a mermen and i think she may beheaded in the wrong direct son i do not know what i can do personally she does not hear me ism get reject here that i did not hear her because she never said anything to me about it in the e man she inserts to link to the article about the drunk show and then reveals her grandmaster plan she is been commenting on the article under fake names warning me not to do the show can everyone else please make up fake accounts and also comment this way all cancel the she she ends thanks pray for us both please when i read this meal i was mortified i drink really ism not an alcoholic but since it'd never intercepted the email i worried everyone who got it hid thought this for years i immediately clicked on the link to the article at the bottom of the page there were four comments from for different people trolling me all clearly my mother her first fake character is carrell from the west village who says quote encouraging irresponsible drinking that could end in hospitalization of performers is an invitation to a law suit do not be idiots the three other comments to escalate from there here is the weirdest part she wrote all these comments while she was staying with me she was in town the week of the drunk show we slept in the same bat but she did not say a word to me about it as interventions go it was the least successful one give ever heard of or could imagine no one else among the family or friends chimed in and i the target of the intervention never knew it happened i never heard of or read the comments on mine until my brother accidentally let it slit years later since i found out about this have wondered why my months to communicate this message to me the way she did but have never asked her because i figure which able to a fight and no answers but we are much closer now than we were when i did the drunk show why not try to my surprise she agreed to talk about it but on these conditions dad had to be there in case we need a mediation i had to come home for christian in exchange and most importantly i could only do this story if she got to write the ending which will get to later i talk for sic i olla are you to monger yes sexy am i i trying out a lower voice cause i thing my voices discreet do not do that the whole interview not being yourself we started at the beginning how did my mother decide that anonymous comments on line would be the best way to reach me she said my sister dulia told her about the drunk show i land there on the couch am at your apartment probably about five in the morning and ism stealing over this candy have slept for hours and then ah i just the this littleepifany i can put this on here in somebody ease's voice i do not have to use my own voice an then may she will take it seriously you just need to hear it from new yorkers why on only you are from new york you live in new york and you value their opinions more than yours oh absolutely cause ism now this buddy duty old fashioned moron lady hat does not ow anything no from nineteen fifty om tune clever are you saying that you are better that i think you think i think that is what i think you think i am ye before things gets you tense my moment i pull at the comments page together snow it ki the first thing i learned was how fleshed out these people were in my mind's mind carrell from the west village who warranted that irresponsible drinking could lead to losses she is a lawyer cause that is the way a lawyer would say things is not it she is dealt with law suits tat have been blovealve the drunk drivers or a something with alcoholism involved i to be clear nowhere in the comments does it say carol is a lawyer for each entry there just a name and local son can from the upper west side pretty ritsiaria right who is down in your mind on is a a comedian oh who is older he used to do kind of old style comedy again reading the comments you would never know don was a comedian ye he is just discussed with how comedy his a evolved in the last fifteen years or what does don think about me doing this show he says comedy where you are laughing at the performers and not with the performers is not comedy it is tragedy is this really what and why see comedy is reduced to are you really not cleverer than this why did you think don saying this to me which would reach me what you love comedians to means all about the comedy for you of course if's this not going to be funny than h maybe we should not do this the next comment comes from these village from a commenter named please the case ism thinking this is a ah a policemen and his name is please ye officer please it does not say officer what why's this policeman writing me whys he offended by this show well he says ten years after nine eleven and this is where new york is come on the show was on september seventeen i think this week of all weeks we should all be a little more sensitive and full of introspection am can we just i think we can both agree that you went you went real big on this one i hat the nine eleven button her last comment is is straight a moron talking point a'lcall is am and all other editions take away freedom of choice seven minutes after she posted that she sent the assemble my mam said she went hard because i have to uncles who died of a'lcoll ism poisoning my uncle died age thirty ma other uncle came to my wedding completely drunk and ended a dead about two years later from alcoholism carry's grandfather died abalcoholls an that is how i get there it is no it is a moron thing it is a an experience that has affected a me it affected my mother she was just devastated over her a brother in his alcohol ism stopping the drunk show meant stopping me from becoming one of these people my mam says she saw the promophot of me sipping a drink on the page announcing the show and thought i she lost her mind she has relatives who died of alcoholism she is been taught since yours little girl to be careful around alcohol is she completely locked out everything have ever taught her did you ever consider just calling me en we have party been there you do not hear me you just do not hear me it is just a joke you have to hear it for somebody who you think it is credible come on admitted lime you would have just laughed you would call even you would have a good laugh and you would have the show anyway but you did not outthink gabon admit it w it you would have world your eyes of me but you did not even try lama just just tell me what is the truth on your end well i do not think i here's the thing i think if ism you just told me not to do it i would have at i would have done existing what you are saying but if we would had a full conversation were we really talked i for example i did not know instill just now until we have had this conversation i did not really know that much about your family history with drinking you do not talk about these unpleasant things that one year against drinking i think i did think it was just had to do with organism and not that it had to do with really painful things you witnessed in your life because you never told me about them ism sure i have said this statement before in your life in our family you ere either ah merman or an algal it alcoholic ye ye yet i heard that one before ye i just in believe it she would said this to me all my life but i was missing the context have never meet any of these family members who drank i do not remember her ever mentioning any of these stories i saw my mother as sheltered almost all her friends are moron i just thought she does notknow what she is talking about which was unfair when i make a radio story i listen to my inter vise over and over i gan and this time something in usual sided to happen with eachlyson my mother sounded less and less my mother i stopped hearing her the way i usually do rolling my eyes getting defensive and actually started hear what she had to say this is the line that truck me the hardest elm we have party been there you do not hear me she is right and i can hear in her voice that this has been hurting her feelings for years and that is my fault i see why she thinks it hopeless to talk to me about drinking about anything ism incredibly dismissive that is my part in this in her part she was totally up frond about that she did not want to confront me about drinking because she has much trouble with confrontation of any kind with any one going back to when she was young lives as lit keep i used to e just admit fault to anything that happened in our family in order to get the conformation to be over with i never understood before this conversation but that feels for her she panics feels trapped she needs to run tightness in her chest which is what makes this conversation hard is is for owe are doing exactly what i hate to do what talk about conflict was happening too when we do it a well see ism totalling my thus right ism feeling i my neck turned to stone this cord which is army coiled up is the triple coiled d to or the headwords o yell thank you for e putting yourself in your most uncomfortable plays sure your welcome elm anything for my daughter i knew what this meant from the tone of her voice it was time to stop this was the must direct conversation have ever had with my mother and the longest real conversation we have ever had shed gone above them beyond and did something she did not enjoy for me i could return the favor and call it a day well folks might toe et on for christian is baked and now for the ending my mother requested it comes down to three words she was right not about me spiralling downward fast but about the drunk show for the record the drunk show was the disaster i was the one who organized the drinking games but because that only recently left the church i was brand new to drinking and all the penalties in the games we things take four shots of whisky things went of the rails quickly a performer through a chair at an audience member i drunkdal my ex from the stage and the call went badly that i started crying in front of the audience era who was in the show got black out drunk for the first time in his life he said and then threw up into a trash bag and some one ended up in the hospital my mammet knew none of those details of course but big picture carol from the west village knew what she was talking about when she said your responsible drinking can lead to hospitalization another words mom was right on a bigger is one of process of our show and the author of the book the

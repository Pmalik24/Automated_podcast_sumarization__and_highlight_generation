always a lave and knowledge and imagination in me those stories would be amazing and she would tell me that when they would begin the story she would be afraid that she for sleeping the meed and then if she first keeping the middle they would never finish the story basically nobody will know how the story in i candy grew up about the a dears that a story was kind of a hug or ate t would just something that you give for share i somebody t you caveat after that a car grab to be a short story writer hes car carried as to ta books there were a times that his mother would not invent a story

whose little chard and her mother who is carrying a baby basically if ice a race the are defend for the last place but but we mam kind of sees a up the head of them somethings that they looks a big grandfather clock that seems to be moving a mat somebody is carrying a grandfather cock with them as their flip apparently there was somebody who was carrying it on the back but for my mam from the distance just look kind of a cartoon a capture as from where they were behind which e sees is the fog it which a feet sticking out underneath a trying along and then an arm looking out on either side than it kind of amuses her because she is city chatting and even when she told me about that yo know many man years after that i use it when she would tell the what she would always laugh and and it also amused her that she was in middle out of town running and she could tell what the time was every second which is something that is amazing when you were five year old out in the country to have e cooks hat would tell exactly wat the time you do not have to a ask your many do not he to ask anybody for her it is fin their flaying and she is not feeling danger she is just thesis kind of fan y e but when the the got closer to the cloak she could start hearing the man gasping the man who carried this cloak on his back because i patently the cloak was too heavy and she said that just was the were bout to reach him she the man callous flat on his face with the cloak on on top of him o my go and an my mother wanted to stop to check was with the guy but her mother said wet to run with to run we do not have time and and the ran a little bet more and then her mother said decent the no way we going escape the german a i only chance as if we going to a cabbage fill she was cabbage find on the side of the road and hides her until they pass and they the went into the cabbage filled and lie down but as soon as they lie down the field her baby brother begins crying and my grandmother my mams

at her mother who was breast wedding and baby and there was something at ta it i guess at is kind of strange seem that they effect that the soldier and the soldier basically looked at them but the then that as if he was looking through them as if he was not things them even he was very close and then after a few seconds she just cant turned his back and left as if he was escaping and and i guess from perspective of five years had she really really felt that her family index say father was able to win against the dances her baby brother was cut enough her mother was motherly enough she was sisterly enough and the guises were blue enough that the soldier suddenly remembered that she knows that he had a human side to and he could not take t she would talk about the soldier as if he

the was something about i my parents that they felt that the moment that her was seen a loco survivors they were kind of losing something at this moment that they became less of an individual and more of i do not know a simple my parents really really dislike that i felt for my mam that the moment that she was seen as the loco survive it would be little bit a wild horse that they it was as if they nates a branded her she cannot take this find offer but the moment that she could be is ay funny red headed woman who reads a at and enough to dance and who had happened to be in the horoscope this was her victory a can rinse without a mind but may we should step summers very quickly what happened her in a word just to get westerners the general sense i know her family died the am the changed up in concentration camp no my mammal my is with her parents in the work to get and later the would transfer to another we to coming to the end of the for she was the too on her own and thy kind of running from one hiding place to another trying to get food from where she could than hiding no mammy made was never in hiding i sag the way that she survived was more kind of mingling with the polish pretending to be anunjew and my mam told me that during the for it was much easier for children to move around an they and to smuggle things then grown ups because usually would not ask them for idea and and it would be more difficult to defranciate them especially my mam that they did not look very jewfish and that they she was they not only fluent with polish as the first language and not isedish many other news but thy she spoke fun in german how did she spit german that can when the for started my the first find her father did was e to teach her german and he said to her is at the moment you can communicate wish people i it makes it more difficult for them to dehumanize you he felt that this would be something that could save her life there you tell me astray about her on a bridge just tell that sit there is more than one but i it'll tell the one and if you do not it i pay another one a gay a a e one day when she left the get a a on some smuggling mission she took a a her little baba she would usually get broaden than put it in the baba and as she was working in the streets of for ay a german soldier grabbed her empty baba and when she came to take it from him she just kind of a free to another soldier and they started kind of a to counting her not not giving her the baba and basically my mam was e about nine years old outside of the get if somebody would catch

she said the excused mister officer but my can you help me the two soldiers here who a this respect me and t site not acting the way a soldier should act and they she protests officer wisdom and she shouted boy those soldiers an they gave her the baba the series amazing that she had the presence of mind that young yea i think i think tit the wanted she said says it it is kind of my lad grandfather he trained her and she would pro to all kinds of things that my grandfather would teach her when she was in the get one of the thinner that she said people came look inside you they can never know how hungry you are but if you dirty the see in a second for example she told me that pat of of her surviving e outside of the ghetto was the we deer that she she made a point of being extremely clean even when there were no means of being clan and and all all he life my mother looked somebody on dog magazine caver always with madcap and everything in place it is this i dear that you can carry yourself and show your confidence and if you do that then the chances that the word would trampled you become slower storinumber three fabric before i was born my mother worked in advertising she invented slogans produced commerce's and bag into with newspapers over the ad prices she real loved it but it was the demanding jo and she wanted to devote as much time as possible to her is when i was a baby she quit and open the fabric stor it was called fabric basement and it was in a basement with no windows she chose it because of the location a cross the street and a you dose down from our apartment it was damp and dark and a little mast but everything inside the store was decorated in good taste mom use to take me with her to work every day and put me on the counter in the bassinet i grew up listening to her stern pronouncement on questions of cleavage and rives and closely watching the eager women who ended the dimly let basement to search for the perfect fabric and cat for the dress of the dreams when i think about it now i see my mother hoisting heavy rows of fabric grand in that narrow dank space i know it was hard work and did not pay much but when i was little the fabric basement seemed to me a sort of secret kingdom where my mother rained supreme her subjects came to her with her hopes and dreams and she the queen mother proclaimed which options made them look thinner and which fatter what was flattering and what look cheep she spoke with no hesitation or excessive politeness just as the queen should and the women kept coming to a lit the side certain ragman from all over the country that my mother could flip three the stars of bread magazine that spied nature y on the counter and select the patterns that would accentuate er advantages and con seel everything else not every one can be beautiful on told me once but if you make an effort and you do not give up you can always be less ugly story number for rain day it happened eleven years ago my wife shell my son love and i got up at seven am she a was making a too of hi sand which for live we're just started first great lev and i stood by the window looking out at the rain and i explained in a fatherly tone he would have to stay home and play with me in on to day instead of going to school because it was raining leverecev these news joyfully shell not much what do you mean is not going to school she asked sharply if training i replied pointing outside she i wanted to know when it rains you do not go to school i explained of she could do was repeat my words when it rains yo do not go to school i nodded o ka she said and who made that rule we had very few roll when i was growing up we had to be polite to our parents we had to give a going to every homeless person we in the street if some one elderly got on the bass we had to offer them our seat and we could not go to school on any days the reason according to my mother was that we oud you respect for school i did not teach anything important enough to be worse getting wait for my mother lost her parents at the very poundage which is why as she explained to my siblings in me she never learned how to be a mother girls learned how to be mothers from their own mothers she said every girl watches her mother to see how she raises children but i did not have a mother for long enough to learn everything which is why i have to isn't promise now if you see me doing something you do not think he tat great you should always tell me i was very please to rely mother says that and on the few occasions when she impose the rule or a demands that i found unfair i always told her and she really did reason but as from staying home from school when i rained i was completely on board with that sadly sher as childhood was not as magical as mine and let had to pay for that the proofed grabbed an umbrella and went to school i a yes i e i pul just wondering this next story if it is not it it does not feel kind of bit strange it is that you get those short pieces and then suddenly a very long one and there is no something before it i do not know li can are as stoking go music or i don't know o well the only the thing i gas before the thing that your saying right now i do not know your your a had your give if you think it to work it'd i dead about a here is that story story number five you never

till one of the kits yelldancer and then it was over everyone would head to the corner store for chocolate milk or popsicl nothing had happened in other words no one school was ever afraid of a little fist fighting but every one even the strongest man a skits was afraid to get in a fight with ta mill the mil was a year ahead of me he was not big and he was not very muscular either but whenever he got into a fight with someone in the school yard of the kids to gather to watch we overcome by a terrible sense of the sir because they knew a fight with mill never ended with chocolate milk and a popsicl at the con store best cabin trial the mill one and some one an the dap in the emergency room worst case he lost and the fight went on forever not a single ki the school ever i surrender is much stirrers and him were already shaving would pin into the ground for hours hurt him humiliating begin sand but a mill would still be cursing and making frets as the fight wore on we all new that no matter how plainly and painfully the are kit was winning the second he let go the mill would be up in a shut and chasing him down with the rock a meter rod or whatever weapon he could find if a teacher or another grown up try to intervene they would get clabbered too outta line if anyone had asked me when i was ten years old what i was most afraid of in the word i decently would have said ta mill every wednesday after school i would meet my mother at the grocery store and help her carry the bags home she would wait outside the store dressed a quin in a dress or twenty suit she always wore lipsticks that matched the color of her dress o scarf and the fashionable had perched on her head crown as i walked along busy dirty basic street beside her loved wish grocery begs i thought she looked a stubborn in the fella one who insisted on remaining a princes even after the clock struck midnight and everything turned back into a pump kin our apartment building was at the top of a hill

sounded cats sill mixed with h human say the second my mother heard this peculiar sound she to a cigarette on the sidewalk and started quickly marching up hill i the direction the noise was coming from i picked up of the begs of groceries and tried to keep up with her before it'd even reached a building i could see a mill standing on the side for waving a stick over his head at his feet lay yack a not for my class wo leave the cross the street from us and when ta my something on the deck with the stick any whimpered she early moved i was completely paralyzed but not my mother she marched over quickly on her stilettos ta mill ignorer and ended another blow on yack's back my mother trapped a mil's arm with one hand and his her with the other the mil try to right out of her grip swearing and blistering let me go i screw let me go right now it'll flat you up you bitch terrified i looked at my mother she did not seem to understand who she was dealing with i sent the mill stab a teacher with he compass and for a brick at the principle and i knew exactly how this would en my mother would eventually have to let go and then all hell would break lose i wanted to say something to warn her but i did not know exactly what to tell her the only good advise i could give her about ta mill was not to mess within but it was too late for that madam twisted ta mill's arm behind his bag which made him drop the stick wacky was tell on the ground just win you bitch the mere his it'll tell you a new one my mother looked at him coldly and signalled for me to come closer i move toward this dragging the grocery begs and stop the few steps away that seemed close enough but madam beckoned me to come closer it is all right she said in a reassuring voice do not be afraid he will not bite i took a few more steps until i was standing within spitting distance of the mill's weary face lev me alone i screeched let me go i wat you s madam said still using her soothing voice in a minute as soon as you listen to what i have to say the me stop talking and turned to my mother with an expectant look do you see this boy my mother asked and she held ta mill's face close to mine this is my son now take a deep sniff good you never forget a smile the mil's face was very an age away from mine i was close that i could see the bad vessels in the wives of his eyes as he gave me a dancing look and this madam said turning ta mill's head toward yack who managed to sit up on his knees is his friend yack as far as ism concerned this ho on neighborhood is yours except this to you can heat by stab steel anything you but if you much as gauche them if i tach them then what the mil said with the chinning skin you call the cups have had the caps call on me ten times the police gat for bid madam

was pulling ta mill's her now making n look right into the dumpster and the next morning a track will come and remove your body with the tress and buried far far away and no one will even come looking for you or try to find out what happened because no one will is him as a child you quickly learn to identify when your parents are making empty frets and when they mean what they sail madam stone the catch almost word was her ordinary voice the one i recognized from conversations with the ladies at her fabric show or people she ran intone the street and within second i stop being scared that the mill would break re and bit us up and start being scared that he die my madam put her face right up to tells and he looked at her why died you might be a bullet me but ye not stupid a i wanted to look at me very closely and tell me whether ism lying or if gets really going to happen ti ma kept staring at my mother as if ye were hipintises and after a pause ye said almost seen a whisper i promise

room an in a red dress in the high heels madam slowly lifted her hand and caressed the mere sweaty her very good she repeated softly now that e clear on everything we should go home it would be darg soon and it is getting cold at a yes i think all the stories that you told far your madam as the hero and i wonder other stories where ye felt embarrassed for her she embarrassed ye or she is not the hero an that way for first what i think that she was inherently the hero and fighting for things but i cannot say that you knows that some times the she she would protect her laved one the little be too much i remembers tat when my father a was dying from answer she had a room all alone in the hospital and my dead was was a heavy smoker he died from me smoker's answer and he used smoking this

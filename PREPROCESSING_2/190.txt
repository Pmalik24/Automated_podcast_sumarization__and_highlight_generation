five you crazy and who er up a few hours from reeve but move to the city five years ago and when she told me the long frightening journey she had made that day escaping the city while the ruffians invaded it was none of this worse stories were you think o i cant imagine what it would be to go through that if fact was exactly the opposite for anybody who has ever lived in a decencies city it is a shockingly instantly easy to imagine every moment of it happens in such familiar kinds of places she was not woken up by sounds of bombing abut by her stepfather calling on slype from inland where ye win and he wot me out and at tat i russia boning into report i i i was reeeslepi and i did not believe it and then felt ta the went and a i was just freaking out i was panicking they were ending i somewhere it was free to close to me and it was free to her fine terrifying she says but a very specific kind of terrifying and you do not usually run into i felt a baby exactly pin an my i felt a baby because i was along i in the darkness of the many i empty street i a strange sound nobody round and only my state very at me from the you we on the street i felt like a i not woman ism a baby what what do you mean you fell a baby first told you a not able to protect yourself you are not able to do anything because you a baby you you a helpless i say and day i you just not somebody to i and i to save you she as she did one to eel this way for another minute she packed her things and calls a friend to have a car told them we have to get out of the city very fast they headed over toe pick her up it is not far but the gest second traffic many people were trying to flee finally when i got to her they decided o head to a suburb card gearing just outside reeve maybe twenty miles should be a forty minute drive on a normal a one of the friend's parents at a house be cause there is the cellar you know and again we got stay in traffic because people we banking as w as we did and on the a we a the russia he coffers the holcopies were shooting she says to other yourpin was close to one of the big battles and key of that first day over a never part in host mall ruffians sent helicopters to sees it hoping presumably to use tit to bring in troops surprise to take the city at one point during the day it was reported they had captured the part then later that you cranial soldiers surrounded them and took a bat at this point the ruffians seemed to have it again anyway that is what nation her friends were driving towards seen this it was not to refine anymore because we o in the constant stead of shock we was just taring at it just tearing and o we were just trying to save you li its it they got of the friend's house the come at the cellar too look around they were close to all this fighting and noway decided this is not right she was going t turn round she was going to undo everything she had spend the morning doing go back to reeve wench should just come from he tried to get a train from there to the border which would been leaving a place where i we through be some shelter an heading in who knows what the harder aside because everybody was we saying no say you just have to stay but i was listening to my in a was y i i was just a i needed toast to on to get out the country ore at least to west of yo train we were afraid that may be the borders will be close on o it is my point to you when you move yo stay it is my point i just and also o very anxious and an i just to better when in ta something when and the move bets and protecting myself one go decided to go with her somebody who should never met before that day but yo see mike a rational guy said you want to stick with rational people in emergency situations the friends drove them to the train station local train they could take them back to leave and when theyarrived in my they hope to take the subway but a keep subways were close cause they could these stations that or deep underground that double as boy shelters and that is hat they were because for and we had to work we gat to work and we were pretty lose to the aria where rely to work i can me it exactly because iwis just busy running were you we really running bet say joking they fin i get to the train station with trains the could take them west to the border they had no tickets it was moved now aweyhad money ready in case i needed to bribe somebody to get on a train but it was such a moment of solidarity the con doctors just select people on without tickets richer the economic corresponded was on that train with her and he told me he had never been in a refuge we situation with many cats e aid if ill everybody on the train brought the cat eight hours later she is half way across the country three hundred miles away hotel far from the fighting anything easily may happen and everything changing fast like it was just two days ago she told me she did a to shot with a friend in the center of eye it was sunny bless she to to me some flowers ad police for something and we we just inn can coffee and now i am epic and o less range is hard to believe it happen even those you a somebody who had thought prudent would invade and she thought that he would quickly try to take reeve she had actually been in the process of getting a visa to get out but she said most people did not believe out told themselves it was not happen you know is late be to lie verso doe hell safer i go back on the line with richer from the economist he is a actually take to lots of agrarians about this and pointed out that the country's media and it is president for weeks have been saying nothing is going o happen prudent was his posting unless you had the foreign press you nobly would not believe prudent was going to invade ow he says the first thing that any eucranian will tell you wit that country has been at of i yes and the idea that this or that russia battalion coming near that border suddenly means that an invasion is likely they will say the invasion happened to thous and fourteen do hasn't fourteen is when the russia military took crime from you crane and pro russia separates and two oucranian territories seceded from the country and there's teen all so matter of different falsalans and sense fires coming in going threats in a crazy record since then and such a roll just boride the idea that in that lines the the idea that an a bunch of troops tutting out on the word o changes the gangs for them at just the latest chest for the latest drama and an lot of people of work out a great recipes happiness which is just sitting off the you car the time line and and not reading any of this what did you see three months ago that convinced you that this might happen and you got an apartment on the other side of the country well the thing that really worried me was it was not any trust movements it was the negotiations on remember the seventeenth russia on filed ta list of the hands and ah you read these demands and you tout to say until god they do not care because that asking for things that they know they cannot get and the only kind of thrusting who conducts those kinds of negotiations is someone tho does not really care was an a good weather the negotiations succeed or fail and when i saw that that is what i realized that is going through the motions seen that that not serious about theses negotiations that they are serious about the troops on the morning it is crazy that you have an entire country with millions of people who basically just have to guess what one man is going to do here may be more than just sin entire country that beaholwol to don't or programmed we have an epersoid of our shore that we put together back in twenty seventeen about that man waiter prudent at the time it was inspired by news that had people guessing what his intentions were and what he was thinking we wanted to understand him better and am there is one story we found the fact one of to day show that i have to admit i bee thing about for weeks is prudent am asked thetroops around the craning border is the story about whether he came to powering nineteen ninety nine by killing a few hundred innocent russia we have that you even heard it you really sure and more including what ruffians think of him stay with us i gone going in with the bang you heard the story is sone thing people speculated about years ago but now seems mostly forgotten lav been rite when claimer prudent was going to power is s back in nineteen ninety nine boysielson was president running russia prudent was the prime minister not well known not well polling at two per cent as possible presidential candidate and then butt only been prime minister for a month there was a series of bombings of apartment buildings in mascot and elsewhere three hundred people died queen blamed it on checked rebels invaded chechnea started the second chetchen war which he won it was popular war catapulted him into the presidency when he took office he had fifty three per cent of the boat and even back then when he took office in two thousand there was a question did he bomb those buildings himself to create the protects for the war and his own rise to power if he did of course a caused the legitimacy of his presidency into question in a big way murdering his own constituents exactly the kinds of ruffians that claims to be surveying and protecting as president whenever producers robin simian talk to reporters who covered this and reviewed the evidence with them there we get to the more mysterious aspects of the bombings a quick summery of what happened the bombings came in fast succession four bombs in two weeks in random locations and mascot and two other cities early september was the first one a robin a truck went off right outside an apartment building collapsing it were sixty people died days later thousands of miles away another bomb goes off on the ground floor of a nine story apartment building nine stories flattened killing over ninety people within days there was another one and that a fourth theildings destroyed in the night while people were inside sleeping avid matter was in and out of the country of the time he is been reporting on russia since the seventies the was in thatmosfere of panic the whole country was certified people began to fear that any apartment could be blown up in the middle of the night and any family could be buried unto the red there were thirty thousand apartment blocks in mascot and patrols night patrols for anise in all of them to prevent terror from u in bombs in the basement the government immediately blamed the bombings on check gorillas scout andiron as another reporter who is written about the attacks chickens tend to be more darkly complected than you topolesnic ruffians anyone who was darkly complected on the streets of mascot was subject to a rest er being beaten up and a lot of people from the carcass did they think they would to stay inside they were they were fried to go out in the streets but this story that chetchand were behind the bombings kind of fishy for starters it was three years after chechney an russia had finished a war the first chetchen war chetchney and basically one they signed to piece treaty again scout what motive did the chechans have to start this bombing campaign against russia wind they pretty much had everything they wanted there was no reason to fight the ruffians at this point right they would won the war tat that is right they had won the war why command acts of terror that were big enough to start another war and just logistically it would have been hard to pull off even in nineteen ninety nine russia wit it was a very heavily police state and surly by after the second or third boring there were police check points all over surly all over mascot all over major russia cities the idea of these bombers moving round and these were conclude explosives every heavy fifty a keel sacks of of explosives he need hall around you needed car sure going through check points and with the whole history against against chitchats certainly anybody who was can darkly complected going through it a check point was going to be thoroughly search even some people in the government question the official account avid water was in mascot right after the bombings and a friend who had good connections told avid there were people in the security services who suspected h at best b that is the modern version of the cog b basically might be behind the bombings avid asked to meet some of those guys on person and they agreed but this was such a dangerous idea they wanted to make sure they were not caught they had this very private conversation in a very public place in the center mascot y do not one to give away too many demons bother was in in in a store of some sort in the building not far from the bolshy theater and to off people coming and going but we did not give any indication werwere talking duchess couple men standing there talking bout some agent did not prove but some things busted not up for example of the simple fact that the buildings were blown up withexigon whishes a very very power from expose of the cause to talk off artillery show and is disavailable only in one factory in russia which is tightly guarded by the access b it is also it military basis how would terra get exigent at all agent said let along drive big quantities of it around russia unchecked when you heard the stuff were ye thinking these arguments were convincing or were you also thinking well i waste ta completely convinced that this was ta government provocation but what convinced me was the bomb that did not go off the fifth boy the fifth on and yet another city reason and this is where the story about the chickens seems to really fall apart and where the story gets truly strange september twenty second nineteen ninety nine two and a half weeks after the first department boy a couple of residents and a building an azan notice something weird one guy a bust driver who lived in the building saw a car a white city on parked outside the building mora renal was a foreign correspondent for the elleytimes taken living in mascot she talk to the guy who told her the license plates on the car did not look right they had a local city cut on them for azan the number sixty two but he told mora when he looked closer he saw that the number it had been written a hunt it had been drawn on by hand it did not look it was stamped in to the medal license plate with a sharpy or something yet a magic marker on a piece of paper taped over the license plate oh and that was immediately something that kind of he thought huh calls ta police in the meantime two men get out o the car and start during heavy sacks a of something into the the buildings a basemen a the people jump act on t barley cake off that is got andiron again the local police show up they went down into the basement and came running back up saying it is a boy its boy risks essentially sealed off within hours thousands on thousands of soldiers and police a sort not the city and i begin s massive dragnet for these two men and womanwhos in the car also local effete start coming through evidence the get gator was found in the basement wat owns were e pain here is a train newscletfon then from a documentary about the bombings called disbelief the reporter says the sacks were discovered by police gie en that a to belaegi a tree yo the sacks were taken to a lab that concluded the contents were exigent the same explosive used to blow up the other buildings the stuff that supposedly only that best b and military had access to one day after the bonsai prime minister of ladimir punter who remember has only been in the job for a month launch is the second war against chechnea over the bombings he says quote the question is closed once and for all we will pursue the terrorist everywhere if they are in an airport then in an airport and forgive me if we catch them in the crapper then will rub them out in the crapper meanwhile back in reason local police find the mysterious white sedan and the two suspects they were not chetchen they were russia russia afespb agents with a fop ides the head of the fess nicholay petunia goes on t v and is there is a totally reasonable explanation for afespagents to be caught doing this the whole thing was it drill this audio of that announcement is from a documentary about the bombings called glowing up russia the enables of festoon that was not a explosion an at explosion was not prevention but it was not good i it was an exercise he doesn't for the cameras he makes this little statement again shot andiron he does not tee questions he walks away is just yoga that was the was just a bit essays as for the exigent there was no exigent he says they were no explosives the white powder in the bags he explains with sugar mara renounce talk to people who lived in the apartment building and reason back then she says people were angry and they thought their own government had tried to kill them though of course since this was russia they would not say it quite that way what they would say over and over again was in the form of a question whose interests were served by this who had something to gain it does not make sense but who had something to gain would you ask them who do you think yo and what would people say who else the government but let me say that some did not were willing to go to say that to loud they would say who had something to gain and and then there would be a pause an they would raise their eyebrows and i would say who do you think and they would say who do you think at the time there was still something of a free press people could speak out and did especial aplasia tape send the wee c this escape from a the special on an independent channel that enate bin at for which has since been taken over by the state the special is a tockshel with the host which s mat es be higher as an people from the buildanksun who are pretty mad again this comes from the documentary disbelief eases an the on owed will a which he a early saying if you people everyazon and many other towns just do not believe all these stories ism sitting here and just cannot believe the story the a best is telling i myself am a military officer i was a senior officer for twenty eight years i was in charge of countless exercises what these generals are claiming about this called exercise i just cannot believe my ears all of this unfolds very quickly button becomes prime minister in august the bombings are in september the war starts in september also button is the public face of the war and it is going well this is when is popularity source and on news he at midnight president at the time boraskeltson makes in and the asthma again he more the see orseltson announces complete shocking annoutsment and he is going to retire he is going to resign the presidency affective immediately he names flatter button acting president button's very first act is very first presidential decree is to stop all irruption investigations into borisyeltson these investigations have been going on the elections weresposed to be in tune instead he moves him up to march which gives opposition parties very little time to organize and then he he wins the presence outright in march in this this incredibly short period i about eight months he goes from being a complete unknown to being the present of russia marrenald says when re as on happen she said in locally reports but it was not a huge story hat vest mayor may not have planted explosives it was not clear what it meant and twas quickly drowned out by the invasion and the war only in wretch respect end it start to seem significant an a wretch respect there were other pieces of evidence that started to seem important i telly near right after one of the bombs went off in mascot this was the third boy the speaker of the russia parliament a guy named slesnyaff mention to the boy but got the city ram mind you he was in mascot and the boy was in mascot the he said the boy went off in vulgandots here scout andiron you could make it say i well he somehow he said volgodonskinstead of mascot except that three days later an a apartment building in in volgadonsk was blown up well raising it the question of how a it is less enoughrom you ho bout the bombing three days ahead optime the next thing the happens is after the boy finally did go off in vulgar dots another member of parliament a my named zerenovsky confronts the speaker about house suspicious this looks he says you told us on money that a building in vulgar dons was blown out three days before the explosion dearnovsky calls the act monstrous and says he'll tried to keep the speaker from being reelected but he is hard to hear because they keep cutting his mikrofonon someone calls the argosy has command and then a scoundrel who deserves to be shot finally dearnovsky turns around walks away and gets hit in the back with a folder there was and official government investigation into the apartment woman trials convictions all held in private not open to the public a rest people were convicted they were not anvestiagents they were not catches either there have been people outside the government who tried to look deeper into the woman but over a that isn't gonna most notably an independent commission of human rights actives politicians and investigators again scout ahead of that commission i was killed was murdered shot death in front of his house another member the committee died under mysterious circumstances and a poletkovscota investigative journalists one of russia leading investigate journalist was murdered in her apartment building she had written about the casting doubts on the apartment building bombings a and of course meander lit for yank came publicly accusing the paten crime of of doing e ponpinbones hes poisinpolonian in condone two thousand six en dogs radio active poison polonium two ten slipped into his tee a brutish investigation determined two effespiagents had killed we finianko and that patent had likely sign bone it is to a biography which came out in two thousand paten roundly denied any efespi involvement in the bombings writing use what blowing up our own apartment buildings that is really utter nonsense it is totally insane no one in the russia special services would be capable of such a crime against his own people unpaid star has been researching the since it happened and has written two books about it he is convinced the story went this before the bombings even before paten came to power for as alto and his administration were plagued with corruption investigations he worried they could eventually point to him and his family especially if some other party or some one in sympathetic to him became president he looked to a pointed prime minister who he could trust he fired two other guides and just three months before landing on paten then he and paten together had the apartments blown up as the pretext to go to war and in the patriotic glow two in stall paten and quashed the corruption investigations cotton more are not sure for mora when it comes to the bombings she gets that something was done by design and that it appears to be for political purposes but as for who was behind the bombings exactly she cannot tell mean if you ask me what i think i have to say to the day i do not know but this is what i would say is that right now it does not matter what do you mean betas whether the government or people around paten petrol or whether they did not the effect is the same either you believe what they said about the blaming that they were terrors out to kill ordinary ruffians in which case you are frightened and the world is a very scary place or you believe that your government or much connected to the government could be bloody minded enough to kill three hundred innocent civilians in their beds in which case the world is a very scary place and you should be frights this is how it works in the police state you should be frightened and that how the government exercises control been nearly two necklace since the bombings and i wanted to know what a people in russia think about the butene tell their president have a a deal are they our people walking around wondering if their president came to power by killing hundreds of mission citizens i interviewed four people who live in mascot none of them said they were big see porters of paten three of the four had heard the rumor that he was behind the bombings none of them believed it or wanted to believe it i cannot know the truth i cannot say a forty two year old screen writer told me a twenty two year old stunitocti said she did not want know if it was true as for chazan only one of the four a tell communication specialist had heard anything about reason the acts of sugar any of that you you all the details thou ride a book about it and he believes reason was and at that sperm the one person who never heard the story that queen might be behind the woman's with dulia a forty year old lawyer i thin y sola ye set is temoselin hamate its is just not something that people discuss the media does not say anything about it the families do not talk to each other about this and francs do not talk about this each other does it just seem old news upside you yes absolutely i ran through all the facts with her all the evidence that prudent might be behind the bombings she said she did not care does tit sound our ride cultus theory i asked yes she said most likely some ridiculous theory robin semi h to mister popular one of the notable things about bat him of queen is tit for years is that stunningly high approval ratings among ruffians in canary not february of this year as mentions rose with you crane is a prove a numbers rose with them to seventy one per cent from the sixties back in twenty seventeen when we first broadcastodays program the presser's re porting the it his approve a ratings were something eighty four per cent which for you best president that would be just unthinkable and we wondered is that real at all that eighty four per cent we is tat from some institution controlled by prudent back then we ask charges mains to look into this forest he is now impairs mascot correspondent well it is real i mean these are real poles where large numbers of real people really do answer questions russia has two big pulling firm that or mentally statesponserd a and one that is independent and all three of these get basely the same numbers this month queen drop by two per cent to eighty two per cent and america punsters gallop in per youknow they also get the same results in the cities yo dies but a people to saying that they prudent because they are scared to say anything else well it is part of it i mean especially with older people there was a pull done by this lava enter this is the independent poster in russia saying that twenty six per cent of all respondents said their afraid to share their views of the government with posters that probably in plates the number but just how much is pretty clear c if eight to per cent is in the right number do we have any sense of what a more accurate measure of his popularity might be we will some poster say it is the called electoral rating this is when you ask ruffians two they actually vote for the lava enter has this a poll they do where they say if the presidential sections were held next sundae who would you vote for and then only fifty five per cents say they vote for prudent and that is the gather an independent posters the state one has a figure that is a little higher sixty four per cent but you now that is hardly the eighty two eighty four that we seen what a get from this is take the eighty two eighty four percent a privarating with grand about but it is true that most people approve of him ye he still really popular a case o to hear of what that prove as all about and what people think of him we ask you to talk to some people who him which you did people across the country and then you put together this story about one of them this is someone i knew would not exaggerate their feelings about the president because they were talking to a foreign reporter some one have known for decades ye one and e l that is her talking here gusto gave n the demerit companies i live with old e her gam and or two children back in the midinettes when i was an exchanged student in mascot good five years before queen arrived on the scene for the year she took in several america exchange students similrlylily en we let us her telling me i was her favorite and i tell her always say i of russia ma'am y deletes comic that that met t she says i always say i have an america son who i do not see as much as i segelan you aceviutyec we took the tram to her apartment building through the neighborhood i lived in with her family back in the nineties and she started pointing out all these changes log quite an new playground he stores t would be the we e and just by the new museum there building a common it pool for busy now none of this was here back when i lived with them it is all part of the prosperity that is come to mascot since paten came to power and it is why old srgeevna and lots of people in her generation shes in her sixties it is why they love patent to when i lived with old sergeevna an her family bores nelson was president and things in runs were really really tough in fact there's a poll for that it says sixty eight per cent of ruffians think nothing good happened in russia during the nelson years nothing novena who chunk usually blast isn't is to being ogussergeevna says life was hard back then people did not have enough r money we grow stores were empty and the only began to clear with the arrival of ladies paten not the bull bogus before de put it seems almost hard to remember now but when paten first arrived as prime minister nineteen ninety nine ruffians had no idea who he was he was this awkward public speaker back the his suits were fitting the quit never smiled yebelon tain bi step in past chest hardly says old sergeant the specimen she sees now even you guns a she told me put's appearance was predicted earlier when mister said one day a man named the logia would save russia melodia is short for later lots of the older generation will tell you stuff this yo don yo dumpster the most put nobody thought that savor would be prudent a men looks face that she says he is cone to short e bi shiver was the ta go no one believed he change russia that russia would rise from its need lavas prints but it did rise from its need his predecessor boys nelson was seen as this buffoon visibly drunken meetings with world leaders in embarrassment paten was younger he did not drink the fact that he was a former cage be agent it least meant he was disciplined and educated he spoke german practised judo and he brought an end to the chaos of the nelson years during which the ruble had collapsed several times government was constantly reshuffled and a few insiders the called oligarchs became billionaires almost everyone else lost their savings but as soon as patent took over the economy boons mostly because of royal price is shooting out and soon he exiled or arrested oligarchs who been running the country behind the scenes a lot of people talk about how paten saved russia yes we bur i tot my seine din lotectutevorude e the admit senate gutetenobsmena if you compare nineteen ninety four and two thousand seventeen old e serena says the difference is night and day when you got yet me cede very nineteen ninety four nighty five we did not celebrate holidays nobody was in a festive mood we theatre were all clothes because nobody went nobody had money lee a can brisk wustabednan ta were it on her paten she says she lives a comfortable life a the job can afford to travel can go out a eater to the theatre yemagobasvolisidestote as hard over state how important this is during queen's first deckhand power ruffians had never lived better particularly in the bigger cities people old serena became part of something that was happening for the first time ever in russia the merchants of a middle class over time this economic miracle turned paten in the sort of a folk hero there is the side of him we know in america the guy fine jets riding horses shirtless but in russia he is cultivated this image that he is frugal lives modestly works all the time political analysts told me paten scene is the only one who can fix anything or improve people's lives the one who keeps corrupt bureaucrats and check he is the goods are for guys organ it was not just that paten made the country better it was that he could do no wrong i lav paten luxury but that was the one because he is smart tat you intelligent it cultured athletic she says he is even a musician to tells wonishe plays sings wat do not tat buy you donas asked her if there is anything he cannot to response that toditnaed en you meet he cannot cook but he does not need to finally i said come on is not there anything you do not about him anything at all yet yet yet yet lo while we were talking bogus rgavenan brought me over to computer started scrawling to her faceburg palette gan she subscribes to a paten fee just to see what he is up ton gad and if he is filled with pictures of him and ye paten snarling paten laughing does not he look a benevolent lord she says men yoga sure that's i just one to point out here that bogus or game ta doesn't work for the government or queen's united russia party she is an account she has been for decades were the daughter who lives in onion and a son who works for an america tack company when you it see yet then one of the things plus organ likes best i that paten stands up to the west and this a big thing for russia we that dit men to o a was pig is paten likes to say when they curse me n the west it means ism doing the right thing when it comes to the bad things america here about paten that he is corrupt that he secretly one of the world's richest men or that he is meddled in the america elections oldest so game says that is all lies perpetuated by western journalist people me remind her the we have this on going joke the where she tells me to leave our pen alone and she says she means it we sh e she ask a be to o ta need theta ash butene ask her about the many opponents of puts who have ended up dead the journalist anapaest cocoa or oleander let penyenka the ago be whistle lower who as poison with the radio active into active who poisoned him she ask some say it was paten i tell her but hes no o hooeveryone says it is putenthat do go do the dit that you'll the moment somebody sneezes or farts in russia paten is to blame i say but what about the opposition wider borsnemsov he was killed but she interrupts me and says it so badonma e jo badnoonetco bad ma neck badly nothing of the sort you nothing to the sort there wasn't investigation e so died over satin a see then you wish does not buy any of it in fact a lot of ulgusgavnas opinions her things you might hear on state to but i think with bogus organ and the other people i talk to people who love paten the moments i understand them best or when they talk about the past everything they went through before paten arrived it is why sometimes i think the real reason people paten his not because they believe he will keep moving russia forward into the future it is because they fear some one else anyone else might drive russia back to the past charges mans o mascot is past wee he found alga the day the mascot hated you crane fin dow what she thought he thinks queen mad the right call he es going in he the separatistinystrn you crane if decried themselves independent of you crane from mascot she believes you cranny an authorities who can no attack people in that territory bwithames they got from the united states president of you care kolinsky don't charleshe is a crown biding the do paten still the smarts to the pack coming out another basin russia see paten the way they do we get to know the disinformation master mind who reshaped the world of russia politics into what it is now that is in a minute chico but a radio when our program continues to samaritan life yer glass today's program the other mister president stories of ladies prudent and this around him we arrived to fact three of our program a three may be paid a little attention to the man behind the curtain is s quit that we heard while we were working on today's program backing twenty seventeen from writer named peter pramaranziv he said that if the old soviet union was seventy five per cent violence twenty five per cent propaganda to day's russia this members are reversed it is twenty five per cent violence and seventy five per cent propaganda in propaganda was radically reinvented ondivadama paten it is tactics and its methods but this one political operative johnkoll explains the operative's name is ladislov sir you he was patent's deputy of chief for more than a decade starting in nineteen ninety nine in russia he is what is referred to as a political technologist but those are a diamond dozen at the top of his powers servo had a much more ominous if an official title he was known as a gray cardinal he does not look a shadowy master mine he sort of resembles roan atkinson the actor played mister bean except handsomer and he actually does not manage propaganda at the preplan any more but the methods he invented to manipulate people in information have even heard them called artistic see in the soviet era the country was run by the communist party and the propagandists pumped out literally the party mine and tried to suppress all other opposing messages and then the iron curtain fell a whole bunch of new political parties were created and it was the messy early stages of a real democracy with parties bickering in vying for power and then when queen became president and obviously skipping over a lot here his right hand man sermon helped solidify the gremlin's power by putting together this party called united russia which gained majority in parliament and backed paten and then instead of tamping down the opposition the old days sermon built a new system were there was position but he dictated what the opposition stood for you do not law political parties to crate their on agendas you just rite this ends for them this is silly gator he is been a very high level player in russia media for nearly twenty years these stasis a visiting fellow at the aninburg center on communication leadership and policy well we decide bonofour parties is left party with som sort of communism another parties you were a socialist and the third parties sir deep conservative and off you even radicals and the fourth party would be as a of liberal radicals and the that is whats skol actually constructed and he created whole new political parties and wrote the agendas for example a he created a party colts prutudlywhere i see just russia just russia aye that was a it was a political cadaver are you saying waver a corpse cadaver a cadaver a eellike frankenstan frankenstin data created from some sort of pieces of socialists labor activists more progafroman time e labor unions he also decided that he cannot allow eighty dratrutec tilt is which would not be that ta by kremlin he decided that you will create also use movements and ritagande for them and he also try to do the same think we agios political agios or those that control e actions consparencs y or exposed option we writing it gan de for every every one of them in the kremlin it is directing a move in a way absolutely i would even provide you with a very finny hypothesis in two thousand on i think cassia has being invaded by reality shows her thinks survive breather and he was amazed how scripting can improve even those likely spontaneous interactions between people and i know that he was very good friend with all the producers of this er reality shoal actually and actually i think ho was once even present at the filming of the russia personal survivor no way and he is if they can do that on t v sort of far reality and t v may be we can far reality in reality in the way by two does three about four years into sermon's tenure's great cardinal the silly says sermon had built up a whole code of deputies that would carry out his agenda with these different parties and other groups i asked icily for an example of how all this work and he told me what everybody told me when i asked for specifics he said it is not i was in the room with him i do not know exactly what he said to whom nor when he did tell me about this one case that he heard about from someone who worked with sermon in two thousand for claimer paten decided that governors should not be elected any more they should be appointed by him it's long story but at first every other political party besides puts was against the idea genuinely against it but then sermon manipulated them over to his side it help that he control their funding in the number of seats they got in the duma and then the parties went through this whole drawn out public drama which had all the trappings of democracy the bill submitted their arguments for in against it protest surround the country people announced they have changed their minds r several votes and finally after three months it passes all of this vastly says was scripted by sermon's people the name you here for all these techniques is managed democracy sermon uses the phrase sovereign democracy i suggested to one person i talk to that managed democracy sounds a contradiction in terms he said exactly it just means there is no democracy any one overstate sermon's tower nor his malevolence apparently he was much more carrot than stick in his approach explaining why no you really want to aline yourself with the kremlin here is what is to be gained and he didn't try to do this with everybody he maintained under this manage or sovereign democracy a certain level of dessert some actual opposition actual opposition both in society and press and even enjoyed this dessert because it was developing nature leaders nevolny that is elective of any he may have heard of him he is a high profile activist he s considered to be the only real opponent to paten except he cannot run against paten because patents people had him arrested and you cannot run for president and russia if you have a criminal record to be ones evil emerged within this saltboxes of for aloft freedom that sermon created and and it was important for him because it was kind of making hes kameflash of autocracy much that a loci the more you here about sermon the man the more it makes you understand how his whole trumensho theatrical directing of society developed he has all of these opposing factions inside of him too all working in an unlikely but perfect concert together back in the early nineties he was a party designing ads for the richest lark in russia and that point sermon said he wanted to be quit the hero and pretty woman that the richer veer character but he is also a huge fan a the anti autocracy gay but is to beat poet allay ginsburg this is sermon reciting ginsburg's am sunflower sutra from memory and you there standing before me in this sunset and all the glory in your form at notice beauty offish flown you might be able to tell that sermon studied theatre but he got kicked out of the mascot in side of culture after a fistfight reportedly is written lyrics for a russia man called apathy wrist and you marry or and are in performance phasis time at rush's main state taint work channel wine manage democracy was just the natural culmination a he was kind of entertaining himself again easily gator was really funny for him to to make this thinks happen to a chi certain resorts and and there sot of creative build in all reality a again as i said it is it is a very much big brother type of scripting he means the reality shop brother imine you you need to create conflict and this conflict will create the conflict and than an than we us arulagowd and people will out and that would be found besides which he could totally get away with it because not only was he good at it but in sermon's time is great cardinal not very many people were paying attention at this moment people were absolutely uninterested in politics because russia had and mayo economy grow of about in prostate here an the ruble was sir kind of taking sang fir a credit was extremely cheap the country was booming i easy to bald atokrasy when wanting men gets nobody cares about politics i and i think zero was not during this women because he was and not only kind of far shadow garden bat hejectury was openly gardening the visitation that is after a certain point he would not take very many pains to hide what he was doing which i can imagine the feeling here he is carrying off all these feats of manipulation in secret you think he would won a little credit on this point there was a moment when sermon seemed to be showing his cards a little bit deliberately it is a story that peter pomaransev likes to tell he is the journalist that i werequoted earlier peter used to work in reality chevy in russia and he is written a lot about sermon this liberal bloke a little fetiloga he ad very greepopliplog twosome sodas of the office a sermon's office the he was there to photograph an official meeting but he said on his blog that he was much more interested in what was in the office and that is what you have the sons on his ask with the names will opposition pinsclpossis literally there is a whole mess of phones and on one of them in particular next to the numbers there is a bank of buttons labeled merino zurnovsky zugonov all heads of parties and e have the portrait of to the fish tupacka next o makiavetou something yes two psychic for the rapper it is actually next to a picture of barokobama and a a the time rob i my god while we got seensisirkov's office and that many years late at when we ever realized the sirklof at ben funding this liberal age auras i omer what he leaked that he wants it us to been his power and he wanted to create an atmosphere where you can never really tell what is true any more everything is suspect that was absolutely intention zero himself has come just shy of saying it openly a he talks about it in his book this is another shape sermon is reported to have shifted into he wrote a novel under the suriname nation dubovitzky he will not admit its really him but szerkov's wife is named natal dubovitskaya every one's body coincidence the books called almost to zero were close to zero it about a parlay who grew up in the stick sermon did move to mascot to hang out with bohemian artists szerkov did and is now embroiled in the seedy murderers under world of the illegal book publishing in distribution oh and it is got an english subtitle gangstofiction any case peter says there are these really telling passages in which the hero realizes await everything's made up language politics every ideology everything's fake i can see through it all it is an epic kind of cynicism it is all citizens as in mi own o blevlything but almost i oldy got give burst through nor the shallow shells of morality an ideology and belief si am seeing behind the matrixkye exact very much i the matrix of a superpopular firing russianan tat but you make sense if you think about russia history and men l this generation circle we person the have life through communism they have live through and the mafia state the miso far democracy through as from the religious national socialism an emailing which they have now and it is all the same people and the have gone through through many different modes of being in the lost that he is in such blistery progression hat that and of left of the feeding that everything is is a moderate when zero says everything is a everything's controlled in a construct what he is at she saying is not a confession it is a piece of psychological propaganda to say there is no point struggling for anything do not even try to do any of your city protest movements oh sot son away you will killing if you tell people that everything is a conspiracy it does not lead people to revolt it leads people to go give was that i might as well give of yes e but get we might be overinhepreti but is a books where last but yet is in i said before sermon is no longer the grand manager of propaganda in russia he was sidelined in two thousand eleven after a dispute with prudent but he stayed a personal adviser to the president and was also an organizer of rushes take over of the krimean peninsula in crane and two thousand fourteen his involvement in that annexation got him sanctioned by the west eating he is not allowed to travel to the lessor rope any more and he cannot have assets in the west either zero was unfazed the only things that interest me in the us he said or tupokshikor alingen'sburg and jacks pole i do not need a vena to access their work which could come back zonked s one of produces of ours zero by the way seems to have been one of the people overseeing russia you crane policy to a few years ago there is am hactemals from his account in twenty fourteen promaskowv separates groups in yeukran to cry the two territories in the russia border were no longer part of yourkran and thermal servo seems to be managing them one of thermal sermon received a list of potential leaders for these supposal independent regions of your with astray by certain names is the best options he at om name out a head a statement hat legally came from youkranians living in the separatist tow of territories twenty twenty sermon is fired by vatemar without any public explanation one have line about that red queen fires his poplin master at for a m t er principle but did be her people in russia who do not madame prudent they been protest against the invasion of your can a cross russia an mascot saint petersburg other cities we've the monitors the protest of d info said he e just the first two days since the invasion over eighteen hundred protesters were arrested in sixty russia cities but hin twenty seventeen when we first protestodays program therefore protests all over the country organized by prude's most prominent credit the charismatic opposition lead air flex naval about government corruption and hears a since twenty seventeen vole was poison fly to burin for treatment german authority said the nerve agent the poisondit must to come from the russia government when you return to russia he was arrested is imprison to day but in twenty seventeen ho as turning out huge crowds of young people you showed out because of these great videos that you down mine about the issues after the protest seen yours streamed posting their own videos to the internet of their teachers lecturing them about the protest towing them they were wrong about the issues kids arguing back you now you recalled in for a lecture by your principle you think that her idea of your principal lecturing you on the subject of protest as either unjust or absurd or fond or whateveranc you fhalmenad posted just i think you a lot of sixteen seventeen year old might be tempted to do a anywhere joshayafa is a correspondent for the new yorker magazine in mascot and you rote about one of these videos there was filmed ton the provincial town of brink to win your mouse from mascot apparently there was a student there who tried to enlist other kids to go to the protest which led to their principal and home room teacher to talk to them which they formed i it is it is obvious that it was show surreptitiously you see a lot of the desk in friend of you in kind of half cut off shots of the school principle in front of a chock word open i should say that most of it is just completely black you see nothing and you hear sound and up and that occasionally the camicshit of as she is essentially saying with he tone in her voice suggest you and of nave juvenal somewhat i am mature in the ways of the world students are interested in the guy no only what is he really stand for what is he really offering or suggesting other than just getting rid of the country's leader is a principle says guy i can see that your looking at this pom one widely and that you lack range in your political view you seen to only watches video boom you believe it all when you rode about this a recording in the newyorker you described your tone is a hectoring and frustrated i would say that is really the most interesting or striking thing about the whole video to me which is to me it sounds our petrovna the principle is experiencing something between a confusion exasprexasperation anger i think she is really at a loss a she does not understand the may be in the same way that i do not know five years ago seven years ago there is something more a shared between her and her students i wont point you such defending madame prudent saying you cannot plan him for the bad economy that is because of the sanctions of the youropiniunion in reunited states imposed on russia she says on the world stage and farm policies doing a great job which the students challenge in sin of policpaistis was o is the student asking the principle yo case of what is our foreign palsy america against us rope as against us and the principle says forget we is that what is the reason and the student without thinking a says that because a crime we took it almost all the look sand the principle responding with surprise or indignation says wand was that bad because e most of russiaait seen is a patriotic thing to a taken uremia yet but the the enesitin of crimes credibly popular widely perceived to have been a good thing basically then the harem teacher jumps in and argues with the kids over crime did you says did we really take crime did they not and choose to become part of russia the kids correctly point out yes russia did take crime and the sanctions were the result soon the conversation turns to the fighting in eastern new crane russia officially denies that its soldiers are there fall kinds of evidence is come out proving that this is untrue and the principle is he sensate trying to blame the crisis in new crane on america let me read exactly which she says because because because it is because it is aggressive she says aka you have not read anything about this and you do not know a thing and gets i very superficial allege here s what started the whole conflict maybe it was cause america stuck its now in and then they struck to argue right and the student asks somewhat mockingly of the principal did you see america troops in new crane wevusily ways other icons ta an an the principal says did you see russia troops in new crane and this is this moment where the student reveals just this be sick elementary a non geological factual knowledge the sooner says yes e there are visits going round and then comes really maybe my favorite line you have no idea none ad an that to me gets to the key point of this whole dialogue which is the kids just have access to this information and just a world view tat they are got on the in and at themselves information this not on state seven and that alone seems con som destabilizing are in comfortable for the principle the is do not watch eve the way old o ruffians do the principal tells them of you do not remember how bad it was here before prudent he country was in chaosiby play to carry guns and knives n this when i was in college when he says this and when you parts talking points that you might hear on russia stay t b she seems totally sincere is america watching this it is one of the thins as actually most interesting about this video you think that these government talking points on crime you crane or whatever you wonder if authorities are just mouthing these points and the do not actually believe them when your the principal she seems totally emotional when you runs through these talking points but those talking points sir in a way emotional couch in the language of a patriotism an appeal to history russia as a great power russia as the besieged fortress surrounded by enemies who we should barman and the students jest seem less receptive to those messengers one on the kids openly laugh the country's ruling political party present pro the parties u nite in russia one post or ye dos were against night to russia the kid saying the students everybody to raise their hands who is against united russia and then you get sense this partisan in idiot gid sens it lots of hands are going out russia o this meets so lo is not anything dits interesting to me about this because i feel we read about how the russia government sort of floods the zone in their own country with all kinds of misinformation and disinformation to make people feel that prudent is doing a great job and and here it seems a gave a munch of kids who just seem utterly immune to it yen and that i think must free out aha political adviser is in political technologists as hare called here in russia in the gremlin who just seem to have lost the country so they just do not seem a to be able to come up with the kind of message is ain metric that you one for an older generation work easily and naturally an it flowed with little resistance jaseryafa of the we yorker magazine in make too o we a o o o i e a o o we a to

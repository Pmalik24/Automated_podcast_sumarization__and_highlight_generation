welcome to the hubermanladguest series where i and an expert guest s gust science n science as tools i mender superman and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day's episode marks the first in a four episode series all about mental health the expert guest for this series is doctor pal canty doctor palcanty is a medical doctor and psychiatrist who completed is medical training at stamford university school of medicine and then went on to become chief resident of psychiatry at hazard medical school he then went on to found the pacific premiere group which is a collection of psychiatric and therapists who are expert in treating all types of psychiatric disorders and life stressor across the four episodes of this series on mental health doctor canty teaches us about the structure of our own minds and how to think about our own minds as a way to enhance our mental health he explains how our subconscious mind and our conscious mind interact to drive our emotions or decision making and our behavior and while any series about mental health requires that from time to time we discuss personality disorders and psychiatric challenges the main discussion in to day's episode and in fact all four episodes in the series are about what it means to be mentally healthy and how to build one's mental health through specific practices either done alone or with a therapist to day's episode addresses several key questions as well as provides protocols for you to address questions about your own mental health for instance you will learn what constitutes the most mentally healthy version of your health you will learn to access and indeed you will learn protocols for addressing levels of anxiety levels of your confidence how to think about your beliefs and internal narratives how to think about your self talk and restructure your self talk we discuss common challenges such as overthinking we talk about the role of defense mechanisms and other aspects of the conscious and unconscious mind interactions that can lead us told or away from the heal thirst versions of our healths you will notice that during the first five minutes or of to day's discussion doctor county describes a framework of what he refers to as the structure of self and the function of selah and he describes several pillars for understanding what those are i to highlight that while that short portion of our discussion does bring up a number of terms that are likely to be novel to you they certainly were novel to me that as our conversation proceeds you will really come to appreciate just how simple and yet powerful that framework is it will help you understand for instance the relationship between your conscious mind and your subconscious mind in ways that you can really apply toward enhancing your mental health in addition to that doctor county has generously provided a few red is which illustrate that framework for you and that are available completely zero cost by going to the links in the shownote captions you have the option to downtown those pe d is and to look them over either prior to or during or perhaps after you listen to these for podcast episodes as a final note before beginning to day's discussion ant to emphasize my sentiment which ism confident will soon be your sentiment as well which is that doctor pal county shares with us immensely powerful tools for enhancing mental health that at least to my knowledge have never been shared publicly before in fact to somebody who has done more than three decades of therapy have never before been exposed to a conversation about the structure of the mind and the subconscious mind as well as tools and protocols for enhancing mental health as powerful as these for me the information was absolutely transformation in terms of reshaping my thought patterns my emotional patterns and indeed several of my behavioral patterns and ism confident that the information that you will glean from to day's episode and throughout the series will be positively transformation for you as well before we begin it'd to emphasize at this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is better help better help offers professional therapy with the license therapists carried out on line i personally have been doing weekly therapy for more than thirty years and while that weekly therapy was initiated not by my own request it was in fact a requirement for me to a remain in high school over time i really came to appreciate just how valuable doing quality therapy is in fact i look at going quality therapy much in the same way that i look at going to the him or doing cardiovascular training such as running as ways to enhance my physical health i see therapy as a vital way to enhance one's mental health the beauty of better help is that they make it very easy to fined and excellent therapist an excellent therapist can be defined to somebody who is going to be very supportive of you in an objective way with whom you have excellent report with and who can help you arrive at key insights that you would not have otherwise been able to find and because better help therapy is conducted entirely on line it is extremely convenient and easy to incorporate into the rest of your life if you are interested in better help go to better help doc calm slash supermen to get ten percent off your first month that is better help spelled h e lay doom slash superman to day's episode is also brought to us by waking up waking up is a meditation at that offers dozens of guided meditation sessions mindfulness trainings yoganedrocessions and more by now there is an abundance of data showing that even short daily meditations can greatly improve our mood reduce anxiety improve our ability to focus and can improve our memory and while there are many different forms of meditation most people find it difficult to find and stick to a meditation practice in a way that is most beneficial for them the waking up at makes it extremely easy to learn how to meditate and to carry out your daily meditation practise in a way that is going to be most effective and efficient for you it includes a variety of different types of meditations of different duration as well as things yoganedra which place the brain anybody into a sort of pseudo sleep that allows you to emerge feeling incredibly mentally refresh in fact the science around yoganedra is really impressive showing that after a yoganedro session levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain are enhanced by up to sixty per cent which places the brain embody into a state of enhanced readiness for mental work and for physical work another thing i really about the waking up a is that it provides a thirty day introduction course for those of you that have not meditated before or getting back to a meditation practise that is fantastic or if you are somebody who is already a skilled and regular meditator waking up has more advanced meditations an yoganeter sessions for you as well if you to try the waking up a you can go to waking up doc cam slash superman an acts less a free thirty day trial again that is waking up doc calm slash supermen and now for my discussion about how to understand an access your level of mental health with doctor pal canty doctor paulcanti welcome thank you ism very excited for to day's episode and for the series because i many other people out there have lot of questions about myself and themselves and not just about ourselves but how the different personality types out there the health the types the narcosis the know all the things that we hear about these days gas lighting all these sorts of things what all of that really is perhaps we can dispel some of the mists that exist during the course of the series ism sure we will for you will this and also raise certain important questions that we should all ask ourselves an terms of try to understand who we are and how we can be the best versions of ourselves how we can experience the most happiness also the the most richness in life because course life is not just all about being happy start off this question i one arias a parallel with something i think for most people as is more concrete which is physical health no a well there is not an ideal physic a self that is been defined by the medical community we know for instance that their is a range of blood pressures that are considered healthy there is a a range of body mass inject that s considered healthy he that is a little controversial because depends on how much muscle how lean people are et camera but no i think it is reasonable to say that the healthy individual is not ongoing to get exhausted walking up a flight of stairs they could bend down and lift an object without hurting themselves they might even have some additional strength or endurance et camera within the physical health domain all of that is fairly well script it and the protocols that people can follow to improve their physical health we covered many of them on the podcast before when it comes to mental health and it comes to concepts of the self things become much more abstract for people in fact i think most people including myself or on wandering around in the dark wondering whether or not we are the best versions of ourselves whether not worth thinking about ourselves in the world around us in the best ways to start things off you tell us what is the healthy version of self mean what what what shall we all be aspiring to you have worked with people who a presume we are healthy and people who have severe pathologies of different psychiatric types y bipolar a cubistic see pathic a and everything in between for me and for the listeners what is a healthy self what should we be striving for but healthy self reproaches life through the lends of agency and gratitude if you look at happy people a people who their lives right no matter what stage of life the a i no matter what their social economic status is i no race religion tithes many things that we we think matters right and and and and they matter to a lot of things do they matter to is someone happy or not why they they are not factors right the factors that tell us is this person enjoying life thing they take care of themselves they happy there here are they engage productively in the world is agency and gratitude and if we have those two things then is interesting you almost never see some one go wrong right and even if if their difficulties even if there are the things happen in life that that can make some unhappiness right it does not take away the persons engagement in life persons enthusiasm for life and think if you look at even traditions of understanding how are people happy whether it is in psychiatry or its through literature or through religious lends it is always people who approach life through the lends of agency and gratitude could we go a little bit deeper on agency and gratitude when i hear the words agency and gratitude i think agency and ability to affect the world around me in the ways that i want i think gratitude think thankful and at we did notice episode all about gratitude practices some of the normal science and nurroamaging and nor chemical changes that occur in the brain anybody when people exert a gratitude practice but have a feeling that when you talk about agency and gratitude mat be talking bout something sightlier may be even quite a bit different than the way that ism defining it ye i would say agency and gratitude are these amazing rewards right that sit on top of the highly complex brain function inside of us and the highly complex psychology in all of us if we think about self right that i identify self right ism an i right if ism going approach the world with agency and gratitude that sitting on top of a lot of healthy things right and the idea that of either ways in which we can be mentally unhealthy right but to start with what is going on inside of us right and what is it look when we are healthy there is a structure of the self right there is function of the self and if we look at the s structure and the function and the parts of components of structure and function we can come to understand et what is going on in us what might we change for the better how do we build empowerment rights empowerment is is the the the ability to navigate the world around us and to bring myself to bear in ways that are effective and from empowerment arises the sense of agency right i have agency because i am empowered and also from a healthy structure of self and function of self we end up with humility right we come through that with the sense of are our place in the world and our power in the world to to navigate as we choose but also a sense of the world around us that is far more complicated right than just we are extends beyond us to other people to the climate around us to the health of the whole planet right we we feel the sense of humility that ism here and i can do good things unfortunate to be here and on part of this bigger ego system right all the way up to the scale of the ecosystem of earth right and if we feel that humility then we approach the world through the lends of gratitude the idea that a healthy structure of self and a healthy function of self leads to empowerment and humility than upon that we are we are to imbued with agency and gratitude and that leads us forth to happy lives case it is clear to me why having agency and gratitude would be wonderful perhaps even the goal state that we should all be seeing to achieve and it also make sent to me as to why empowerment and humility are important components that feed into our ability to have agency and gratitude if because all of that at least to my mind sums to it a very clear statement about have thing agency in gratitude is the best way to approach life that all makes perfect sense to me and yet have never really thought about it that way and i think most people have an every been told this right moving what shall we be seeking agency and gratitude yes we have heard endless number of podcast including this podcast about physical health and we have been told by physicians and everybody else that you know we should seek to have a relatively low but a pressure we should seek to have a relatively low heart rate that our collesterall should be at a certain level et camera within the physical health domain couther strong clear messages about what we should all be striving toast and in a similar way to how we are discussing the self and psychology now i do not think any one seeks to have low blood pressure or low heart rate because that is what they want per we they want those things along with some capacity for endurance built or to you lift an objects of some strength et camera because of the way that those metrics of health allow them to move through the world in the best possible way in other words having some degree of endurance allows you to walk down the block may be a lot further or o walk up several flights of stairs or to have some strength allows you to pick up objects and effectively move through life you are telling us that having a sense of agency and gratitude and that agency in gratitude or undergirded by empowerment and humility and that is the best way to move through life the most effective happiest if you will way to move through life well then i think we have to ask ourselves the same thing we would ask about physical fitness which is what goes in to creating a sense of agency an gratitude empowerment and humility what are the action steps because if i want more endurance i know to get on exercise by for or a tread mill or go out for run a few times a week or more if i want to get stronger ism going to lift objects that er difficult to lift until they are easier to lift i man sell pretty straightforward in the physical domain but in the in the mental health domain in the psychological domain it does become a bit more abstract i think in part because no one's ever told us certainly no one'snever told me what you really need in is agency an gratitude in order to have the best possible life i very much appreciated your telling us thus and i love for you to tell us what are the action steps that go in to creating these things that were calling agency gratitude empowerment in humility there is actually quite a strong parallel between the physical health dimension and the mental health dimension as you are saying why you put in the time the energy the learning right to be physically healthy rights a lot of effort and and if we put much of ourselves towards it if if we decide that we value that right why do we do it right because as you said it is the best way to approach life there may be some thing that i want to do i i want a run a race right or right why i want to claim a mount and wright but ultimately we take care of ourselves physically because we do not know what is coming next in life and we want to be prepared for it good bad and otherwise right and the same thing is true of mental health i can feel grateful for something i can feel grateful that ism still breathing right now right i can exercise agency i can pick up that cup and take a drink right but that does it mean that ism living life through the lends of agency and gratitude which is consistent with every opinion if you look psychologically through the lends a literature through the lends of of sociology and psychology agency and gratitude make happiness right the ways of approaching life and just physical health is undergirded by aby cardiovascular health at heart health the muscle strength right that there is an undergirding of agency and gratitude and empowerment and humility are ways of describing oke what a rise is right from understanding ourselves taken care of ourselves that then gives us the agency and gratitude we have empowerment we have humility but where does it all come from right just we have to understand the physical body and what to do to it in order to be healthy right we also have to understand the mind right the self that wants to be healthier and that comes through understanding the structure of the self and we have enough science through the lens of neurobiology and psychiatry to understand the structure of self and then the function of self right is how we work right how we interface with the world it is actually not more complicated than physical health it is just that we do not spell it out that way right we come at it through the lens of mythology of what is wrong and who has some diagnosis and what are looking for the problematic instead of saying like what's look one were happy right and then going and digging down into the mechanics of it all right and if we are not in that state right to go and look at that and to make changes just as if you were very very physically healthy right but your heart right could not go up that much without you feeling very very fatigued we say well look you are doing a lot of the right things right but let us work more on on your heart right we would go look at the specifics of it because that is how we understand it and we just do not apply the same science logic common sense to mental health as we do to physical health but it is time for that to change because we have the knowledge and ability to do just that when we had doctor any gallant on the podcast to do a series on physical health and on fitness essentially he said something that really stuck with me which was at the number of different work outs that people can do out there bodyweight work outs work with weights with machines you can run far you can on shorter distances wore quickly you do planks you sit up many variations on exercise routines but what he very clearly stated was that there are only a few coradaptations that the body can undergo that lead to these by products that we call lord blood pressure enhanced endurance improve straight improve a nor muscular function and prove brain function for that matter it sounds to me there a lot of parallels in creating the healthy psychological self what are the core components that i another should think about in terms of understanding think you describe them as the structure of the self and the functions of the self again just to draw a parallel f we were time about physical health wet say theirs connections between nerves and muscle that allows us to move our limbs if you apply certain amount of resistance you get a certain adaptation which is the the nor muscular connection get stronger the muscle might get bigger or just stronger et camera flexibility you just push your range of motion just a little bit into discomfort you do that we it happens to be the case that you do that for just a couple of minutes each day over the course of about a week or you get a significant increase in flexibility o case it is all very clear in the physical domain in the psychological domain i hear you telling us that the action steps that we all should be taking in order to be the happiest version of ourselves by achieving agency and gratitude is to explore the structure of self and the function of self f you could tell us about what is the structure of self what goes in to drew being drew and paving pal and whoeverthe listener is into being who they are what is that and what is the function of self how how does the psychiatry think about that how should we think about that if i could start ma to set the stage for that rat by pointing out that as we go up the hierarchy right of health right everything should get simpler right not more complicated right if you think about physical health right there is much complexity on the initial levels right we think about your physical health status verse is mind right is going to be different but we can have different cardiac function and muscle function and pulmonary function and for going to be healthy we could do a lot of different things right there might be whole set of choices that would work well for you different choices that would work for me and we can gauge intensity timing frequency right its very complicated when we are on the the lower levels of the hierarchy as we get higher up let say you and i both do the right things right than what happens we both have endurance right we both have some strength were both robes right things are getting simpler because were were were approaching the unique idiosyncrasies in all of us right and we have to look at that and look at that in very specific way but what were trying to get to is is something that is common for all of us stamina for example in physical health and endurance right and agency and gratitude in mental health right the if we go and we look and we look at the structure of the self and the function of self we find that there is more complexity but that it is also understand woman this tremendous complexity in the body just as there is tremendous complexity in the mind and we can understand what is the structure of self what is the function of self and we can look at that and e cess that in the same way we would physical health parameters that we arrive at the place we want to be be it endurance or agency or gratitude structure of self right we all have an unconscious mind right and we pay little attention to this part of us that really is the biological supercomputer right millions of things are going on all the time looking every split second for example i can say these words right you can listen to the words you can say things back and i unless and right the millions an millions of things going on under the surface much of which comes from either biological predispositions right or habits over time right thought process is patterns right this unconscious mind this supercomputer er is doing all of these things that can o at the speed of light right their electrical and chemical signals and in a multiple pathways as common as as complicated as superhighway systems that then get consolidate and communicate with others right and then what comes up from all of that is the conscious mind imagine in iceberg right i it is a really really big iceberg right and and we see the part above the surface right that is the conscious mind right but there is a huge part of this iceberg may be ninety five per cent of it that is underneath the water right that there is this hulking mass that we do not see that is the unconscious mind right and it is speeding up to the conscious mind which is a much smaller part of our brainfunction right but it is the part that we are aware of right it is sitting on top of all the unconscious things which are extremely important but then we become aware that we can engage in the real world in order for us to have this conversation the millions of things per second have to be going on underneath the surface that you and i as conscious eyes right as consciousselves can ride along on top of it that is the part of the iceberg that is above the water it is the conscious self then imagine that the conscious self is girded by by a as a set of a in a long a tendrils that come out from under the water right that their defense mechanisms that are unconscious to us that but of gird the conscious mind do we rationalize automatically do we avoid automatically do we act out automatically are these things in us in ways that we can observe and change but that are there the trying protect the conscious mind from the slings and arrows of the world around us right if y imagine there is the big part of the iceberg under the water the unconscious mind the conscious mind is riding on top of it but the conscious mind that part sticking out of the water is vulnerable right imagine that there is a defensive structure than that arises from the part of the iceberg that is under water that is there to defend and protect the conscious mind when you say to defend and protect when you say that the conscious mind it is vulnerable what do you mean do you mean that it is vulnerable to physical attack or that it is vulnerable to us realizing that we are just a bunch or naans that are clicking away underneath in other words where does the vulnerability of the conscious mind really reside em not physically where does it reside but you what am i worried about in terms of my safety i in men hour and room i feel pretty safe i do not think you are going to attack me verily or physically i suppose it is possible that could happen but it seems a very distant possibility when you say that these defenses are there to protect us from some sort of awareness what a awareness are we trying to avoid that the vulnerability of the conscious mind is to fear confusion despair right there is many things that that we can fear right some people are afraid of snakes or spiders some people are afraid of death some people are afraid of healthy shoes that could come to them or to people they love we get confuse and not know what decisions to make and how to navigate the world and how to be who we want to be ourselves and to others right we can feel tremendously vulnerable and despairing if we lose others or we know we start to see things happening in the world around us that that that we do not why we start to fee what will happen to the planet we live on we they'll be war where i live well my children be safe right there is much that we need to protect ourselves again that vulnerable part of of us right the part of the iceberg sticking out above the water needs a defensive structure around it to protect it against the vulnerability of fear confusion despair right and because the conscious mind this is seeing out of the water with the defensive structure around it right it is the the draw material from which we create our character structure the character structure is all of that the part under the water the part above the water the defensive structure imagine a nest around all of that and that is the character structure that we utilize to interface with the world right the character structure is the thing that ism using rustic if you are driving somewhere in a car right the car is the thing that you are using to go the right the character structure is the thing that we are using to interface with the world for example how trusting am i verses suspicious right how readily do i come to make friends with people right how i how much do i act out if ism frustrated right how much do i you'll exclaim something negative it is supposed to holding it inside of me how much do i rationalize if something is not going well do i want of look at it and may be see that it is that i do not have to face it right how much do i avoid problems in the world around me how much do i exercise altruism right that these are all the ways in which we are engaging with the world around us and this determines the self imagine that the self then grows out of this nest from the the character structure that we used to interface with the world and the decisions that we make for character structure is is the thing through which we engage with the world then we are enacting what is inside of us what we have determined through our unconscious mind or conscious mind are defense mechanism the the certain us that that comes at the world in a certain wight and if we are more or less trusting more or less avoiding we rationalize more or less these are the factors that determine e were where do our lives go right because on top of all of this imagine that the nest of the character structure around and all of this grows from it the self right the product of the feelings inside the things that we know about ourselves and do not know about ourselves the decisions that all of it leads to i may choose to be for example more trusting and that may bring an opportunity to me that i would not have otherwise had right i may choose to be more trusting and it may bring risk to me that i would not otherwise have had we wanted be is healthy as we can as knowledgeable of ourselves in the world around us that it is safe for us to have a healthy character structure through which we can engage in the world around us with a sense of prudence right taking reasonable risks right not too little that we shut ourselves down and may be and up despairing not much that that scary things can happen to us and we and up fearful right but the idea that if we know ourselves well the character structure is healthy right because it is built upon a structure of self in a function of self that are healthy and out of it is coming empowerment right an empowerment and humility right that then lead us to agency and gratitude right the idea here is that this is the character structure that we create that can than interface with the world in a way that is good for us and good for the world around us that leads us to be able to live in much more harmony inside of ourselves and outside of ourselves if i understand correctly defense mechanisms that grow up out of this portion of the iceberg the recalling the unconscious mind they protect are consciousself in ways that can be adaptive or that can be maladaptive another word defenses can be held at your that can be unhealthy yes and a perhaps in a a few manse we can get into what a healthy verses and unhealthy defense looks but the way you describe character structure sounds to me an a ray of contextual disposition is i do not want to add unnecessarily a complex language but it sounds to me a bunch of dispositions tie if ism walk into the office where i know everybody and i see familiar faces there is no reason for me to be on guard if i trust those people but if ism walking down a a a street at night that ism not familiar with and and ism trying to get the sense that this neighborhood might not be the best it make sense for me to be on relatively high alert different dispositions depending on different conditions i cannot help but mention my a bulldog costello who had basically three dispositions was asleep but in all seriousness the second one was a cant a board the bulldog face in board or if something was given to him that he liked or if we were doing something delight he busy had three dispositions as far as i could tell i i think one of the reasons we dogs much or that many of us dog much as that there decisions are very predictable take him to the park he is happy unless he happen to be ill that day which was rare a you knopeedam he is happy there was not a lot of i do not this particular meal or aunt this particular park or this began frizzy does not smell good to me you know there is a it was simple and and yet people are very complex right i i i can look at myself and say o cat what a what is my character structure of character structure is certain things i certain things i dislike certain things really irritate me certain environments an people i just delight and o was said is the definition of a healthy character structure one in which the dispositions match the context perfectly i may not know how any of us could be that but is is that sort of the ideal much in the same way that um we could probably arrive at at an ideal degree of stamina that one could have him n some people want run ultramarithons a hundred miles or more some be want o run a marathon some yo me do not really desire to run a marathon but i want to be able to run a mile if i need to without being completely exhausted and injured when we when we ask ourselves about character structure are we asking ourselves about contact driven dispositions and your how we star to evaluate that for ourselves i think because we are more complicated i think it is not dispositions as much as its predispositions right in the example that you gave right you have a certain predisposition to be either trusting or weary right an and you are and that is healthy in you right when you come into a setting were there is not a good reason to feel mistrustful to feel anxious to feel vulnerable right than you feel at ease right a you walk into the work setting their people other people you everything is toque right you have a different prepredisposition when the context is different right if the context could bring a lack of safety than you respond accordingly with the lack of safety right but but it is possible certainly those predispositions can be in unhealthy places right for example you might have been aromatized in a certain way or you might approach the world in a certain way because a prior experience that you may not register as drama but it may be that within you is a predisposition to be mistrustful you could walk into a room of people that of people who never met you any harm and still feel on safe right now this happens most often after drama but they're other ways people can get to that where the predisposition is not healthy the converse is true too right there people who can have too much of what is called an omnipotence defense and then they do not recognize danger when danger is around them the idea the character structure that nest right that is built around the defense of structure and the conscious mind that sitting on top of the part of the iceberg the unconscious mind under water right it is that nest that is interfacing with the world through a whole set of predisposition is it'd to take a brief break and acknowledge one of our sponsors g one a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that meets all of your foundational nutrition needs i started taking a g one way back in two thousand in wealth some delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast the reason i started taking a g one and the reason i still take a g one once or generally twice per day is that it is the easiest way for me to insure that ism getting all of the vitamins minerals probiotis and fiber that i need in my diet now of course it is essential to get proper nutrition from whole foods but most people including myself find it hard to get enough servings of fruits and vegetables each day and especially to get enough prebiotics and robotics to insure got health as you may know your got contains trillions of little microbioda the called up microbyom which establishes critical connections with other organs of your body to enhance brain health as well as to support your immune system and other aspects that relate to mental and physical health one of the most common questions i get is if you were to take just one supplement which supplement would that be and my answer is always a g one because by taking a g one ism able to insure that ism getting all f the vitamins minerals and robotics that i need to enhance my mental health physical health and performance if you would to try a g one go to drink a g one dot calm slash supermen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs and they will give you a year supply of item in d three k two again that is drink a g one dot calm slash supermen to claim the special offer i think most of us are familiar with assessing and assigning names to the character structures of others and at least for most of us we do that with no professional training or authority it was that person is great they are supervise persons a jerk the heard no et camera et camera i think very few of us are familiar with assessing our own character structure and i have to presume that some of what happens when somebody comes to you as a psychaaterister to a psychologist is the t certain questions are asked and certain narratives are told that stature reveal to the cognition the character structure and perhaps from their some of the possible defense mechanisms and i structure of the persons unconscious mind and conscious mind that obviously are unaware to them but would be clear by a cognition much in the same way that if somebody goes into the doctrines as yet i do not feel well the constant probing with questions are they gain to put take a take a list another breathing right other heart right an i s t out the stethoscope and figure it an the prose ever as that the psychotics of psychologies uses words and lies to prove if what are the sorts of aspects of character structure that we can be aware of in ourselves it in other words am should we be asking what type of character do i have dependent on one circumstance or another am should we ask ourselves what sorts of defense we have and it maybe this would be a good opportunity to in address this issue of what are healthy verses unhealthy defenses am because it sounds to me if i understand correctly that the defense mechanisms are a very strong component in determining what our character structure is at because the defense mechanisms are unconscious i the character structure that nest around the defenses and the conscious mind through which we interface with the world it is very very complicated there as many character structures as there are human beings it it is very very complicated but there are factors that are consistently relevant across people and get identified as such one example would be isolation verses affiliation it tit does the person tend to group with others right or does the person tend to avoid grouping i and and go about thoughts tasks approaches to life in in a more singular manner right is just one element to making value judgment about it cause it can be good or b ad on either end of the specter right we are just saying what are the factors am i more affiliative or do i tend to isolate and be more singular that is just one example right another example could be things for example use of humor right i does a person use humor and in what way right is a person use who humor to deflect a discomfort and negative situations is a person use humor in order to be little others or to be little themselves or it is a person not use humor right the these aspects of character structure and much research has been done on this over the years to determine what is most salient right in this it is thing that we use in order to interface with the world around us up out of which grows our self i makes good sense and i it makes me want to revise a little but what i asked about before which is i said that when it comes to an examine of physical healthy measure blood pressure measure u a breathing et camera maybe even a blood task look at some bite markers but what you are describing is limit more analogous to am the physician a addressing a patient who having some physical discomfort or always an saying tell me about your day yo what d you do when you get up in the morning if the prisons as well i i drink quarter pint of vodka an he is a very different answer than i i go outside and get limelight in eyes drink a glass of water an may be have a cup of coffee right am or if somebody says i have ssixcesspresso if i understand correctly the carter structure is better revealed by exploring the action states n tat some coming realize an isolation verses engagement a as opposed to a read of one specific bile marker year is has de structure brought to life right yes i immediately in thinking about movies in books where we learn much about somebody through observing the way that they interact with people in in very a very potent ways for instance i can think of countless movies where of you learn a hun about somebody in the first scene simply because of the way they react of somebody who e cuts them off on in traffic they just explode look can well then we think of that person as reactive from that point on unless there is a significant amount of material to revise that but it is in the action of of of getting explosive and cursing et camera i supposed they just con wet laugh at off or laugh at themselves or blame some one within their own vehicle or something that is are those the sorts of things that acclimation yourself as listening for when somebody says you not feel well an you will tell me about what is going on lately and they start describing what is going on in their life and are you listening for those places where the lethe defense mechanisms can are start struck to reveal themselves the character structure starts to reveal itself through these action steps that the person seems to be taking is not you yo maybe one way of looking at at character structure is that it is it is potentialities and predispositions right that there is much that that is latent that then interfaces with events the person stuck in traffic how does that person respond if that person were not stuck in traffic there would not be a response to it i both their potentialities their predispositions and then we live through enacting them as we are moving then through life right and the attempts to understand using the physical health parallel right if you came in you said i do not feel well right when we might run a lot of tests right we might get in em or eye or cabstand or even putting the stethoscope and listening to us inside of you those weak as they are unconscious things that you are not aware of what the imaging may show or the blood tests may show or how your lungs may sound when some one put the stethoscope on that right a cognition if you trying to understand and help someone then you do want to look for those things butt you want to look for the things that are underneath the surface but that be the can be very very important right you also want a look at everything that is on the surface right if your if you're engaging with some one you are engaging with the self right the self that grows out of the character structure nest right by engaging with and and doing one's best to understand the self then you learn about what is underneath of it right i may then learn how do you responding certain situations right just i could asking questions o wo when do you not feel well or rights oyoyou are asking a person questions because the idea is to understand elements of the character structure he d you respond in certain situations what is going on inside of you right what you understand about yourself and what you not understand about yourself right how do you bring yourself to bear in the world around you there is a similar process going on but here it we are trying to understand the self and the understanding of the self can helpless understand the components underneath of the self because that is where we are going to go to make things better right the idea is there should not have to be mystery or certainly not mystery any more than there is in physical health i mean youknow rarely some one comes in and thee really not feeling well and and a whole set of everything that should be done is done right labs physical examination history imaging right and an you still just do not know right means sometimes that can happen but its very rare and the same should apply here that if we are examining a self right and we are looking for the components out of which that self comes right then we should be able to understand well enough to go back to the components of self and to make change that the self is in a better place right and and that self can then be empowered can feel humility right can then come at life through the asterism and gratitude that we see because again you show me some one who is coming at life through altruism and gratitude and is not happy with their life and you will be showing me something have never seem before something entirely knew if we want to get there we want to know how to get there and there are ways as there should be that parallel physical health that are not mysterious that we can come at to make understanding and change ism wondering about the roll of anxiety in all f this the reason i ask about anxiety is that you said that much of character structure is determined by set o predispositions and potentialities and earlier were talking about example of either being afraid ore unafraid in particular environments or feeling we can walk into a class from and learn or whether not we are overly concerned about what people think about us or both i could be amen ism whether or not we can embrace novel environments in safe and adaptive ways whether not we can grow from them i suppose to whether not we can be overtaken by them or perhaps even injured harm psychologically physically or both anxiety to me is it is a very basic function i think about interior the autonomic nervous system and degrees of excitability and et camera an ability o sleep at night in ability to wake up feeling reasonably good but not have a panic attack but anxiety to me does seem a keen note in all of this meaning yow i most people including myself i do not walk around thinking about my character structure i do not walk around thinking about how ism going to behave in a bunch of hypothetical environments think about the fact that most mornings i wake up and i feel pretty good to be quite honest not as good as i would to feel then acerlaly because anything's wrong but because i think ism wire to be a littebit more on the anxious side and to predict what is going to happen next and what needs to be done and until ism actually engaging in certain behaviors that anxiety hums a little bit high for me the gears turn a little bit faster perhaps than i would when i wake up in the morning but once i engage i feel that the speed of that year turning i matches the demands of life pretty well i feel u agency of a if you do not mind could we explore this this feeling of anxiety or lack of anxiety that i think people are pretty familiar with within themselves different times of day an an under different conditions gets to me it seems a an interesting lends to to explore this notion of character structure and defenses is anxiety a healthy defense or an unhealthy defense or does it simply depend on the circumstances well we all have some degree of anxiety in us i we we all have some awareness that we are navigating the world and not everything is is perfect right this is not nirvana there is some anxiety within us and the thought is that that anxiety can keep us vigilant about the things we should be vigilant about health and safety right but that too much anxiety then becomes counter productive and we can look at this in a very regimented way right some anxiety make sense right it keeps us being careful i keeps you because you being careful as you are pulling out of a driveway for example right get it can be it can be absolutely fine but let us say you bring something to clinical attention that is not absolutely fine right let us say i did not know you and you come in we have the example that that we that you use before where where you you walk in to work and there is the group of people that you that well and right let us say you told me when i walk in there i i feel very anxious right i do not feel things are coquet right then we would go there we said that is not good right maybes impacting a professional life things are not going well if you really want this to change was is impacting your life in a negative way we say get let us look at that from the perspective of structure of self right first unconscious right is it that just genetically are you built with just higher levels of anxiety right we could learn look i have you always been and just this is as as it is always been in your life since you were a little kid no matter what we are looking for biological nature to speak variables we might also look for things that have happened to you that are lodged in your unconscious mind right is the drama that you have notprocess right that now is underneath the surface but is spinning off more anxiety right it et let say you tell me o it it was not that long ago you start at being anxious it did something happened the did you walk into a group of people and it are you tripped and you felt bad about something right and then then you get more anxious right are there things going on underneath the surface that are impacting you let us let us look into that right because that is the biggest part of the iceberg right then your conscious mind we could start thinking about what what is going on what you actively thinking about right this were sometimes cognitive behavior techniques can can come into mind are you thinking oh no ism scared is not gingko go while relic i having thoughts of the thoughts and making you more anxious right what is going on in your conscious mind right i would also be very interested in the defenses around you for example do you tend to avoid right has this been getting worse for three months but but you just your mind would not acknowledge it right and by the time you have to acknowledge it now it is really bad right or do you not avoid and this started just started happening and you unntipit in the but right i would be interested in the defense mechanisms right that are girding your conscious self and it'd be interested in the character structure what decisions are you than making are you going anywaght right are you having trouble sometimes you avoid are you then making decisions that make you laid and that calls problems how does it impact you once you are there are you engaging differently with people doing your work differently i want to understand the character structure and ultimately you understand all o this by probing the self that is riding a long on top of it and then what is the experience of that self do you see that oka this is a problem and i want o address it but i look i know that ism good what i do and mu this is not some awful thing about me i just have to deal with it right or it is yourself impacted were you star thinking maybe i cannot do this any more ism not good enough or we want to understand what is the experience of the self right and if we do all of that how is it that we do not get to a place where we can understand that anxiety right and we can make things better just in physical health king maybe we cannot but that is a dramatic out lie if we bring ourselves to bear we would say you should not have to have this in you right because it is something negative it is making unhappiness for you it is taking away from empowerment right and it is also taking away from humility right because if some one's beating up on themselves you are beating up on yourself about it than that is not humility right than that that is being tod falsely persecutory right this it is not an honest humility to that it leads us away from health we do not want it to be this way right because that is working against agency and gratitude we can understand it and we can go after it and make it better one of the most common questions i get on the internal and i get a lot of questions is what can be done to improve confidence and have thought a lot about that question and in what is confidence in the contacts of what we are talking about now is one reasonable definition of confidence our ability to trust our predispositions and our potentialities enough that were we to encounter sonariofs through s we feel pretty good that we would respond the right way in a way that am would not threaten our conscious mind at a core level right that the we would not am i used to use the termite and choke a lot n my laboratory a with the the phrase dissolve into a puddle of our own tears in is down of the saying hyperbolic an a explanation of of what i think many people fear there can be called upon to answer a question publicly or give us score their gin beat a critical moment in in real the relationship or something in the and just everything is is going go badly wrong that hits just going to dissolve them as a person that is impossible right dissolving battle or of our own tears is impossible but i think that is a fear that a lot of people live with because we can get into the solicit later and we will ism sure i youknow that this notion of protecting one's ego is i seems really vital to t being a human being some one l we do not we do not want to dissolve into a puddle of our own tears is confidence the ability to trust ourselves in a bunch of different contacts and at the same time i i do have to raise the this notion of narcissism i think a i t this word gets thrown around a lot lately but it seems to me that any am truly psychologically healthy person would also not want to be the idiot that thinks that there better than they actually are that is i what re your thoughts on this well i agree with the things that you that you said about confidence except i would add two factors that i think are the really big big factors i i one being state dependence and the other being phenomenology right think about the state dependence first right we are talking about confidence it is it is not uniform right or it is not automatically uniform right if feu were to tell me plough i lack confidence right then i wat i want to understand is that across the board is is that a way that you feel about yourself that i i ism not good enough at anything for example right or do you lack confidence in a specific area in this is often the case right and its it is a huge difference it it says that person has the machinery of confidence to speak right they have the potentialities in the predispositions for confidence right when that character structure this self built upon it is not in engaging with the world right but they're not able to bring it to bear in certain in a certain special situation to speak for some people for example that the way we most often see this is the carryout of romance right where because it is emotionally late right and rejection can feel bad right that we can see people who are very confident in many many aspects of life but they are very diffident about romance and we will say diffident oh it never works out for me or no one will ever me right and and you a that is not how that person actually feels right about themselves is a whole human being right which which it is then we are coming at how to make that better in a way that is very robust right we might say something hey here is the good news is you have the tools in the machinery that you need right your confident in many ways right in fact may be in old ways accept this one let us go take a look at why is that special right and then and where are we were back to is it something in the unconscious mind is it if something in the in the conscious mind bow that person is engaging right we have to understand what the state is and if the lack of confidence is state dependent if the person is not confident across the board that again we go back to the same you always go back to the same places to look right but the you might more think okay it is there an impact of childhood aroma or early life aroma that that took away from that person know that there ability to to gain confidence right in if yous have no confidence across the board there is a deeper problem right because there would be h something any one can be good about t and feel confident in right the state dependence is very important as is phenomenology what is your experience of being confident if you tell me well ism let us say in a different version of this example you say you not to ism ism quite i feel quite confident when i when i walk into a room of of people say look i want understand more about that too right because if i ask questions about that and you say why feel confident because look m ism a pretty smart person i can think on my feet i can i can deal well with with people if something does not go right i can recover from it i no it is why have feel confident you knows it okay that sounds pretty good if you say well i feel confident because i know that ism better than everybody right now we have a problem right right i that is not going to go well in other you in other a aspects of life and engagement this you it is not going to lead to humility and gratitude where is that coming from and again maybe there is a deeper problem was you is narcissist right which can be a a reaction my which is a reaction to venerability right than there is was a reaction formation and now the person is actin deeply diffident to wright but presents as very very confident and with a sense of superiority and that does not a recipe for for happiness right in the in approaching it we we do want to understand all the things that you said wore are the factors and the this set of predispositions and the set of potentialities but then what is the real world experience of that a cross situations and what is the persons experience of that inside which is why i forego to understand and help people that is the understand part right it is why the convey about medico the it does not work right in situations were dealing with human beings mental health right we have to understand something about people to understand whatever their telling us means otherwise you have no context you have no knowledge another very common set of questions that i get i believe it is very directly related to this is about beliefs and internal narratives you do not people ask me all the time how can i change what i believe about myself and they also ask how can i change the script in my head how to i typically it is how do i shut down a particular narrative in my heard it seems to fit very well in thing about structure of self because as you pointed out you the the self were the structure of self includes the unconscious mind you know what is going on below the surface of the water in this iceberg model what is going on in the conscious mind that the conscious mind is protected by these defense mechanisms that grow up from the in conscious mind from that the character structure and then the thing that we call thyself right might but when it comes to beliefs and internal narratives those seem to me things that people are pretty well aware of in fact the very example that people are asking in this all the time i do not change beliefs internal narratives means they are aware of them it also suggests that for many people out there their beliefs about themselves and their internal narratives are not healthy or at least they do not feel are serving them well or that they are intrusive i do not know how open people are about their beliefs and internal narratives when they come to you in the in your clinical practice but an i you could tell as lie bit about beliefs and internal narratives and whether not they are important to rewire in and and reset this part is extremely important right imagine for example that ism saying to myself over and over again that ism a loser righter ism not good enough right may imagine trying to go through life and some one else were saying that to you all the time i meats worse one is inside your own head is what is going on inside of us our internal dialogue ore internal narratives are extremely important and here is where we run into a very big problem is that we live in an era and viniculture that is very tuned to rapid gratification right and all of this that we are talking about can change but it does not change quickly and it is amazing to me when and you you will see under insurance paradises often no matter what is going on with some one have ten sessions of cognitive behavior treatment right if there is something we are trying to change beliefs it is a guarantee of failure right because beliefs do not change that fast right imagine for example that we the you an i chose a word random word and we decided to say it five hundred times right we each be saying it to night right its not going to be out of our minds by to night but because we want took a random word and said it five hundred times right imagine hat there is something that is highly emotionally laden and we sad it thousands and thousands and thousands of times right that is not going to go away quickly right but it can go away and during the process of it atrophying right your lives can get better right this is the opposite of hopeless right it is at she very very encouraging but in a world it is rapid gratification rightly how we fix is how we fix this now that does not acknowledge this we hear all the time that the person is failed therapy right my this is said all the time that person failed it was failed the be mean right i mean i think there be failed that person right but we we label hope a person is not better right but there things going on inside of us that could take months and months or years to make better to gent that is o say if we are aware of what is going on just the very fact that we understand and we are making change right helps us feel better about ourselves and more confident right that we can change all this but we have to approach it in the right way let us say that ism telling myself over and over again ism you are not going to get there right in let us a place i want to go professionally right or no one's ever going really want you right if if it is i'mlooking for romantic partner right imagine these things are going on and they are going on over and over again you can imagine now that is it is intruded into the unconscious mind it is going on to my conscious mind my defensive structure is shifting in negative ways an b coming more avoid nothing about this is good and i wanted to change and i wanted to change to something that says you can do it right or you are lovable right you can be a good partner to some one wheres i want to change it right it imagine now when i start to make that change ism blazing a path right and and ism blazing a path where there was not a path before right and i can blaze a path and i can go through that path but that path is going to be nothing maybe the foreland highway right adjacent to me where the thing that have been telling myself for years and years and years born of drama right is is is going back and forth right it it is got a fortune highway ism cutting a path right but over time you cut that path more and more you tread that path more and more you take energy towards that path it becomes better now lit is imagine the path is well lived and it is twelve feet wide and make we can pave the path more more traffic to speak goes down it and we are taking energy away from that foreland highway and maybe it starts to be overgrown a little bit and er cracks in the row we can change all of that but we have to understand what is going on and and identify it what is going on inside of me what do i make of it how do i understand the process of change how do i increase my in powered during the process of change if we come at it the right way all of this can be change it is not hard wired in us it is just very very strongly reenforce the say why our brains are built this way what we do not forget our own names right we do not forget where we live back when we ere hunting and gathering and we do not we don't forget where where the good fruits all right and its goes on in human life now if we have to remember things tit is very very important if something is has high emotional vigilance and we have thought it a lot that we do not forget it but that mechanism gets high jack by things that are not good for us and we can take it back but not if we do not understand what are the tools or the questions that you give or ask of patience in order to help them along that pathway i because i totally agree that changing beliefs in internal narratives is very very hard just one quick example that meshes with the physical health real diva a friend and colleague he is very accomplish scientists who was very over weight for a long period of time he finally made some behavior a changes that allowed him to lose i think it was in upwards of eighty pounds a significant amount of we felt much better looked much better he just delighted in his ability to do that but then started to reveal to me that he was deathly afraid that he was going to lose control and start eating the way he was before and stop exercising in a way that would return him to his previous weight and feelings of always and i said well all the things you are doing ore in the direction of health none of what you are doing speaks to the possibility of this all crumbling this was the dissolve into a puddle of my own tears kind of narrative but at this point coming from him and he just said i know but despite doing all the right things ism still incredibly afraid that it is going to happen it was as if that the beliefs and the internal narratives had not changed despite the fact that he was engaging in the world differently and were positively i have not checked him with him recently to find out where he is at with this now several years later he has kept off most of the weight not all that e gained a li it back but he still far healthier than than he ever was holy is experience some relief but you do not what do you tell a patient who saying you have got this loop in my head that tells me ism not good enough or that even when things are going well they are going to return to that state that i fear much once again this kind of you do not lack of agent my right just lack of agency luck of agency lack of empowerment what what sorts of practical tools can can one give a themselves a that you would provide to somebody no matter what is behind what is going on in that person's mind it is addressable but you do not know what it is and how to address it into we ask the question of what is going on inside right if he is afraid that he is going gain all that was back right and he has a history that if significant negative things happen he throw self care to the wind right that then we would come at it through that pattern right because he would have a very you n w heave a good reason to be worried right because this pattern of something bad happens and i cannot tom to care myself for six months yen maybe some one ism mistaking supping maybe someone in his life is ill or he is fearing a death you known if you house something that would say that is a very legitimate fear to have like let us let us talk about that let look at where that comes from right what got that person into that pattern in the first place right by understanding the pattern and by working together right can we can we stave that off right but it could be different the person might say ism merely ism having a lot of food cravings right and we look it what is that mean where is that coming from or maybe he is depressed and when and he is getting to press and when he is depressed he cannot stop eating more right you would look or might just be plain old fear r this is good right that that ism worried it will go away right then we might want a reinforce i look i your person who is able to use circumspection and perseverance and preserve goodness right you do that you do that really well let us thus make sure we are doing that here right you lot of times a person is worried but that worry is coming through the lens of health their healthy right then we look at look a can we such that way wore can where's that coming from right we can come at it and reenforce the positive b ut if there is something negative there is a trove driven cycle there is depression in their cravings which we can understand that too i come back to this idea that there is answers to just about everything and in a very regimented scientific way it is not that hard to come to them right just in physical medicine we have the plant we have the tools that we need to bring to bear but you have to understand the person again if you come in and say ism not feeling good and someone else comes in and says ism not feeling good the doctor better not do the same things r as is how are you not feeling good but let me understand that and then that aunt me map that also too you whatever underlying state of health you may have or diagnosis you may have the same is true and mental health if we just apply that then it is remarkable the good that we do which have seem very consistently across twenty years of doing this not only in my own practice but who are the people who do really really well trying to understand and take care of people including sometimes not doing too much and realizing and this person is oke this a state of healthier but this person is worried haw we reassure them rat how to we help some one living a good life live a better life ad if we are gan to do all of this we have to approach people as individuals is just mean the science tells us that and common sense tells us that too but if we do that a person can get to the place they want to be id to address a different person as an example a hypothetical person and ism certain there are many many of these people out there these are the sorts of people that think of there is a self and a mind an a unconscious mind et camera but at some level why not just do what needs to be done in life the people that do not want to explore the self because to me it seems absolutely clear that just as its important have a certain level of endurant strength flexibility that one can extract the most joy and agency and gratitude and empowerment and humility from life that it make sense to explore the self to ask where am i internally strong where am i internally weak where might i perceive myself as stoneware as ism actually weak high they seems the seem very important if not crucial questions to ask but i know that there are certain number of people in the world think all that is just kind of a waste of time right it is all about doing stuff it's is all yo we explore the self and a i think the rest of us are looking at that person often and thinking well you are exactly the kind of person that needs to do this because of the ways that you great on other people but but not always right neck people just appear to be very effective they are all about the outward expression of what they are doing and i certainly do not know how other people feel waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night and throughout the day but to the person that feels introspection and exploring maybe even excavating for drama that they have not been in touch with or have dealt with yet for the person that feels tat all of that is kind of not really worth the effort and that is all about action what can we say to that person were those people put differently does one need to change and need to believe in the power of these sorts of approaches in order for them to work we often hear that people do not change until they want to change and u and could we also say perhaps that even for people that feel their functioning extremely well in all domains of life i know no such people and i know som very high she's as you d i know no such people the only people who seem to exist in that sphere are the nurse the clear narcosis that to them justseem they are doing great but every one else cannot stand them by the way narcosis no one else can stand you a what what we say to to those individuals cause i think it is a big swath of humanity and i think it a it accounts for a lot of suffering in the world including their own suffering i would make an ape eel to common sense right imagine you take some one o does not know anything about health they do not now they do not know how to exercise non how to eat well the just do not know an they are her really really unhealthy rigthey'r over way the they've low energy the they have sleep happened they'd no need to have you and and and why not just say to them well i just go be different i cut a fact be different now why don't you different right now right i of course we would never do that because it is a it is absurd and by the way also would be cruel right sot's absurd and it is crush we would never do that right let us say now you toilet us say we fast ford some period of months ex make it upright and we see that person and while they are much healthier they have much more energy they have lost way the they're physically fit a lot will have gone on in between those two snapshots of that person that person has to learn the lot right how is one take care of oneself right then more specific ho to i take care of myself right what healthy foods know well i wit healthy foods well i well i eat how ill i put that on the table what kind of exercises can work for me how will thy work for me how do i strength an muscle how o mi strengthen the hard how to increase long capacity right there is learning there is diligence i the stick positiveness right there is resilience that is how the person gets there right it it is no different en it is mental health right if we say well you you feel you feel diffident across the board or you feel superior across the board or whatever it is life is not going well and you do not have things you want and know the self talk is negative and we s but what just be different right now right i mean it is remarkable that people will say that at times not just in a way that is denigrating and awful for others but to themselves too rite me i hear people say this most often to themselves i why am i not just different right i i want to be different or what is wrong with me that ism not t than and ye it is everything else yin to ply understanding and work and effort the good news is you can get to whatever change you want to mean a prison can get to whatever reasonable change that person wants i can it's fifty four years old ism not on to climb out exercise of not a mountain climb right but if i want end i want on to climbs the mountains i wound get out there and do somethings i can go do that right the same thing is true with our mental health goes but not at the snap of a finger not by magic right it is through applying the same science and common sense combination of science and common sense that we apply to other things that is why we go through this procedure of unconscious mind conscious mind the structure and function of the self because that is how that is how it is done that is how the after snaps out looks different than than before fundamental health perspective as well that is very helpful and i think it is going to be very helpful to a lot of people an thinking about what to think about what sorts of questions to address maybe even whether or not to get therapy and hopefully will remap their notions of therapy i mean of course this critically realizes on the therapist being good to excellent om and thinking the previous am sit down we had iron the in the episode ontrama specifically you mapped out a number the features of quality therapy we can refer people to that a if they are thinking about it is time stamped in that episode of you what to look for an therapist wat how to assess whether not its going well or not whether not to move on or or rested put with that therapists and on you been telling us a lot about the structure a of the self in conscious mind conscious mind defense mechanisms character structure self we haven't talk much about the function of self i realize it is been woven in here or there yes a could you tell us about the function of self the functions of self verb actions i mean ow these things that o we are all doing right now that reflect our character structure are these things that o we can change more readily than trying to snap our fingers and a oka am now going to be a more altruistic person because i can decide that right now but than ultimately have to engage in some altruistic behaviors they to a men support to that again saying with the parallel that i can to snap my fingers as a lower blood pressure you now have to do some meditative practice of m cart yo mask yoga training and things o that sort what what is this function of self thing what goes into the functions of self just stepping back to the framing right there these two pillars upon which we build our lives the structure of self in the function of self and we have been talking is you said more about the structure which is more than nouns of it there is an unconscious what is in that unconscious for example thatcher are defense mechanisms how are we using them it is not all nuns but is more what a those things and then we start talking about how we put them into practice the function of self is much more the verbs rights of the structure is more none the function is more the verbs writ the actual engagement right that would start with an an awareness of my function of self has to start with an awareness there's a person there is not there is a me that is separate from others and i have responsibility for this i right it is me no one ease's guiding it it is me i know there is a me then on top of that we start seeing defense mechanisms in action rights for thinking about function right were aware that there's an eye but the first thing that starts happening to that i are unconscious things right the defense mechanisms because were not choosing them right they start doing things automatically if for example i have a de else of avoidance right then ism not thinking if it is it'd to meet a new person but i automatically am shying away right then that is not it is not good it is a factor right but it is a fact tor i not aware of until i start this process of intersecting right the defense mechanisms are then kind of determining the lay of the land right in that example am sarge interrupted yet the martin arum but in that example um the the returning away you describe is reflective your you thing about someone perhaps you would to have a romantic partner meet somebody ism have a companion and they go to the grocery store and somebody says something as there reaching for the milk and there is that moment of opportunity where they could say something back whet instead they just cone at thanks son the night they count right way and then the narrative in their had might be ill gash that that is the silirbut they do not really think about the the alternate possibility butcher there might be no narrative an then there is no head off to they out off to the produceection in then they go home and and since is of anything happened that good to mean you one the grow now right betas all unconscious right look t right now we we can can we explore that and change that yes right but it is important to understand that whatever that nest of defense mechanisms is that is what have got right now right and ism living through that right now right that that is it is performing a function right just because it is an unconscious function does not mean son a very very important function i can see in that example how it protects the conscious mind from risk because there is always the possibility of rejection there is a possibility of over interpretation of what the other person is talking to them for rightly is the person interest in them or whether not this is just young fret friendly banter um the sort that any one would have next to anybody that is not special to them could see how that the of unconscious turning away is protective against all the negative possibilities and in some sense is operational because the the probability that that one interaction could ratio up to a life of companionship and and romance with somebody is is in a exceedingly small really although you could imagine a sat a data points where you string together you five second eclipse all the time something that has happened it maybe this is a person that you intermittently people are interested in themersing hey or saying hollo or showing interests you could string all those together and the person has not noticed one of them right in then could have a very negative see nobody no one wants me no one's interested in meow whatever the person is saying but but to it is different if you see from the outside li it is objectively different but that person does not now and that is why after be an awareness there is an eye the next thing that i think of in the in the function myself is is the defense mechanisms in action what are some other examples of defense mechanisms in action because i think there is immense interest in thus an you the idea that we have unconscious processes in us that are reaching up out of the iceberg and preventing us from seeing our life and ourselves the way that it actually is occurring and perhaps preventing us from achieving these a ideals of agency and gratitude empowerment and humility no i mean you seem very powerful and important forces and and i and i know many other people out their one understand whether not what were doing in what were feeling and experiencing whether not a that is serving us well or not i think that that the place to start is to say that there is something very very complicated going on the the part of the iceberg underneath the surface rite that biological supercomputer that is running it a million thoughts and million actions and million internal process of a second it is constantly shifting our defend give structure it is complicated and you can almost imagine that one leaves and another comes in n and there shifting and there little bit of one and some of another it is a very complicated process but we can look at it and understand an example of a defense mechanism that is very common and can calls us all lot of problems is projection right give to two examples of of projection one is the experience of sitting in a car right and being stuck in traffic being a little bit last right and feeling be leagued right a in this as happened to me more times than i can count but at some point i started through my own fair be looking at likewuet what is going on in me right when when ism doing this right think that the feeling be leagued right as if what is that mean there is something called traffic that exists and has a mind and wants to tort me right is it individual cars is it the people in the cars right that is going on is out ism having a perception of hostility i feel be leaguer right but it is it is anger and frustration in side of me right ism ism the one feeling angry and frustrated there is there is there is no one and nothing but me that is feeling anything about this right but i have the sense of the world around me being hostile because ism projecting my anger outward right now think this is not good because instead of sitting in traffic and saying look maybe it totally make sense that ism stuck in traffic and that that ism not happy it maybe i should leave a little bit earlier and i would not be last or if it is gone going to work should i live closer to work i can make a whole set of decisions that ism not making right or maybe it'd know i thongs can be a fifteen minute drive and this an accident right and panthers things that i cannot control i must was to control everything right if you think about what can i control being aware of that and what can i not control right then it can make the situation much better this does not happen with this frequency and it also takes away the anger and the frustration right i think that is a good example because it it happens a lots very very common but projection then also happens with people right let us that you and i work together and wewerwwere to do something collaborative together and litmus not having a good day and something negative happened before i came to work and ism not at my best and ism a little bit ism a little bit irritable and frustrated right titis happens all the time were then the person sits down with some one and then ism being irritable and frustrated which does not feel good to you right and and you may become irritable and frustrated right and then i say all look was irritable and frustrated right but even if you do not the fact that i feel that way right that projection often would lead me ti o think that it is you who is that wig here i come wanting to do this job and you are not at your best it is me who is not at my best right but we do this all the time and then we make incorrect inaccurate attributions right projection is it is an example of a defense mechanism that can cause us a lot of trouble right a lot of trouble another can be displacement we i if ism feeling anger or frustration say in a certain realm then i the idea of feeling it at work and then kicking the dog right right taxis not good that we do that were not acknowledging was going on inside of us at work what we could change what we could make better and the dog does not want to be kicked right and the dog is often also the family regain and that could be physical or could be through words right but the idea that with that there is something negative being generated in us but but inside were were perceiving that it is coming from somewhere else right i me the thou be is all things to lead us astray right when when their negative defense is right there can be positive defenses too such as altruism right that that some one could do something negative to me r i and instead of me passing that along i could decide knowing going to do something inly something nice for the next person have an opportunity to do something nice for right that is a defense and sometimes we could think of it in decide that way but they are people who react that way the something negative that happens and they respond with something that it is different from that defense mechanisms can work against us they can work for us the complicated air combinations of them but we can look inside and say for example if ism using projection all the time right and i think everyone around me is kind always angry and frustrated right and there is always bad traffic right but then as we start to talk about it more it becomes a parent that there is a lot ism angry outright but ism not aware of it then then reflection or there be right or a good friend we are talking till it can help us see right that this is going on inside of me right and that can really help us same with use of humor if ism using humor and ism ism got a decompressing uncomfortable situations or things it make me feel uncomfortable maybe that grease is the wheels of social progress but maybe over time i come to use humor in a way that is self denigrating right w that is not good any more but i may not be aware of the shift just as i can maybe be funny in certain situations that ism now not using that for myself any more amusing it against myself and by talking to people my reflection we can be aware of the defensive structure that is going on inside of us and then there is not an autumnmaticity to it if you point out that ism using projection a lot i can start to be aware of that just if some one that's say you were with me at the grocery store right and some one says something nice and i shy way and you say you do not weren't even aware some one said hold to you and then i sun think i want to be more aware of that i want i do not want that thing to happen unconsciously maybe now i think look at any time some one i do not know says something non tot stop and think like what is going on here right is that person being friendly to me as it is my just knows just person exchanging many tho ashtrays what is going on we take what is unconscious and we make it conscious that we can change it sounds to me exploring and thinking about our reflexes is what is really key here i example displacement that you gave you kicking the dog i could not help but i smile not because i think it is a good thing to do i never once kicked my dog by the watfolks terrible thing to do also he was the size of a bolder injured any more than would have injured him but i never would do such a thing however in macadamia there is this i phenomenon it is very common that that i refer to as trickle down anxiety where the person running the laboratory is inevitably under a tremendous amount of stress grants and papers et camera and graduate students and nostocs will immediately be familiar with what ism describing but i for those of you that have not gone to graduates oh this would be a a bit foreign but you will think of other examples where when the ahead is under stress it is incredibly common for warheads to walk through the laboratory and start asking about experiments and telling people to do additional experiments and busily just a signing busy work to people or pressuring what simply cannot be moved along any faster and when i was a graduate student i worked for somebody who is the exact opposite of this plena type when i was a postdoc grand clay for reason who as a little bit of that genotype ahem although i still liked working for him very much but i used to have a response that at least for me was adaptive which was i would always say ism working as fast as i carefully can because no scientist ever wants to a somebody to cut corners no good scientists anyway but trickle down anxiety is common in every occupation i think we see this sort of displacement all the time where some one's anxious and they go start creating anxiety for other people an you can just as your describing on seeing how pathologic that is for everybody involved that the academic the trickle d out anxiety that you are just talking about is it is a related but but it is a different defense mechanism and it is projective identification right which is which is causing others to feel the way that you feel in order to get your needs man crisis a form of projection and action perhaps you could clarify the definition of projection verses displacement verses projector identification yes projection is when you do not own it it is not me who is mad it is you right i do not own that ism mad at all right i just think that it is you even though ism the one who is mad right displacement is what comes out of us or what what were or attribution can shift right it is it is not this person is making me angry it is that person cause that is a safer person right o to to be angry at right or if ism then going to take out my anger right instead of metaphorlly kicking e person who might who might respond to me in a way i do not want maybe i kick the dog that is helpless to respond back right that is displacement projective identification is there is there is an expression of an emotional state inside of a person that then becomes contagious to other people even thou the person is not trying to do that the persons as lungan make you anxious that is not a defense mechanism any more right he hearts an example i think i think is the best example of projective identification for little bit of time at work i would occasionally lose my keys right now ism trying to go and i cannot find my keys right is oh i do not know where my keys are right him it i sight expressing something right and ism anxious and ism tents right now people around me hear that right and what are they start feeling this are feeling anxious and tense the way that i do right and now there like one other want another one find my keys right they want to help me that i stop spreading anxiety intention into the whole environment around me right then they help me find my keys i say thank you my own emotional state comes down and upon reflection i think look i do not want to do that right i got my ism getting my needs men by making other people feel in a way that is not a good or comfortable way to feel it is away around that put my keys in the same place everyday right then i can avoid that because it does not feel good to me then if i get out to my car i find am a little but won't breathing a little heavy i do not does not feel good i just agitated right and i did that to other people too right it is an example of how projective identification works and his kinder simple example but it chose it is happening all the time all these things are happening all the time but we can become aware of it and i do not lose my keys i do not have to feel bad a bad not to active ate myself for no reason and then don't to activate other people for no reason thinking and reflecting change that thing for the better and it can do with much bigger things too thank you for those clarifications it'd to touch on humor for a moment obviously humor is a wonderful thing or can be a wonderful thing have also seen a lot of examples of where very smart and ore accomplished people because those are not always i a the same thing use sarcasm as a form of humor and it can be very funny but i have to imagine based on everything ism hearing from you to day that ism there is a form of sarcasm which is an unhealthy defense ism thinking of the person that ism no matter what some one else says that is positive for or no matter what some one does that could be viewed as positive they find some way to diminish it by i through sarcastic humor i might mint see this a lot and i think closely nested with sarcasm is am cynicism i in fact i have a family member i will not name who they are to protect the not innocent who used to be very cynical i and i once ask him what is the thing about cynicism in and they said well i have had a particular a jane of of schooling grow in up a formal schooling where if any one behaved ism too happy express too much happiness rather too much delight they were viewed as stupid like as if to be happy is to um to be unaware of of of the sophistication and the importance of things in life right i and i hope that this is unreliable to most people listening but ism i do think that sarcasm is is a doubleedge blade i in this sense and that cynicism is is perhaps i a doubleedgh blade as well but that it might even be worse than sarcasm because it is a way of really a reflecting back what is by definition what is not good about life what is not good about what is happening and and it does seem protective right it protects one from disappointment if you are already disappointed how could you be further disappointed it is also seems to me a bit of a power move it is youregingto be happy while omen to take that away for ever from everybody a something that is for myself it i does any of this actually hold in the inside of hunt clinical literature i because again i enjoy a good sarcastic joke yet in fact there is a collaboration around a sarcastic joke it can be truly funny to everybody but ism sarcasm in cynicism ism i relic are often used to cut down what would otherwise be ism benevolence or or or bonding experiences absolutely i grew up in central new jersey humor is a weapon i or it certainly can be and people can be very aggressive through humor acting out which is is letting our aggression flow right that is a defense right is being aggressive and pushing some one back it however that means i if i do not feel good about myself i want you to feel not good about yourself i is whey we are getting into into envy an humor can be used that way that that is a debiting sarcastic humor it is a form of acting out it is a form of aggression right it is not humor as a healthy defense or i being call the same thing but we could also call it different thing is just a enhance of our language right if if if humor can be a defense i i trip and fall i make a little joke people a laughing with me instead of at me right hey humors a god defense i made myself feel better made things float flow more easily but if ism using sarcastic humor to assume some one right then that is not it is not that thing any more right n know now it is a manifestation of aggression right and they dead that yet cynicism it is is more than wits to about a world viol right sarcasm is something that can be done now we can make a sarcastic joke funny or not than it is over right a but cynicism is is a way of coming at the world is a different kind of defense right the idea that he's that fox in the sour grapes i do not i do not think there is anything good to be had anyway right you cannot take anything away from me cannot make me feel worse right i already feel a very very bad about the world and about everybody in it and ism protecting myself that way that is then an unhealthy defense as what does that lead to at least to isolation at least to mistrust we know that people are happy if they live through altruism and gratitude and their well connected with others the cynical point of view which can to some degree being in the world builds some cynicism in us right that that is o say that is part of that is a a part of a awareness in some sense but i think what your talking about is a very pervasive cynicism that than is an unhealthy defense that is very harmful to others the the idea that i feel lousy about everything and if you do not in going to try and bring you down right too much happiness we will label that as something right label it is stupid right nous it is not oke to be happier than some sot of cynical base line right and and there is nothing about asterism in gratitude that is not happy right i mean who is happy in that situation chic the people who are overly cynical or not happy and people around them are not happy nobody's happy thanks for the clarification on new jersey a good portion of my biological families from new jersey about well armed i id adore them but it is true there was once a moment at a family gathering where somebody said a let us let us hug or something and the reaction was oh er going to hug now yes s was it's it was entirely sarcastic and cinema and light in the that the hug that resulted from that was this lo lie this theonothing you as and now ism laughing about and it is funny an and the very loving people but your right it is a it is a a different style of humor and discourse been talking by these two pillars of the self and who we are and how things play out in the world for us as the structure of self and the function of self and it try the function of self you described self awareness this notion a this realization that there is an eye there is a me and then we beetling about defense mechanisms inaction how these play out in the real world both positive and negative it seems to me that a lot of what is happening here in terms of understanding the function of self has to do with the what we pay attention to a where we place ore our efforts or choose to not place our attention and not place our efforts doit have that right right yet the salience is it is a huge concept in i ethingin in human existence mean there thousands upon thousands of things that that you or i could be paying attention to right now but but were we are not paying attention to anything except what we are doing right heres we are waiting out many other thoughts ideas narratives inside now something were to shift very quickly if we heard a loud noise right our attention would shift t right our attention is it is focus were salient to one another because this is what we have chosen were focussing our minds and we are also somewhere inside of us aware that we could shift away from it if something more important something dangerous were to happen it lets us be here and be sailing it to one another and have this conversation i but in the course of life what salient to us is complicated and determined by many factors that is absolutely worth a lot of attention to one example is many people have a negative internal dialogue that is running in them over and over again or the running through images events or they may be dramatic events or things that they are not happy with images of themselves in negative ways am that that these internal narratives or internal images can become strong that there is no room for anything else o an example would be a a person who who really really loved music i and could have just in addition to enjoying music had a good thoughts while listening to music look at i could go do this right and and and at a history of that really working out well following is interests and and tike really creating sot of goodness in his life i who now was going for long drives longer than would be needed to go somewhere get something why the extra time in the car and i had had a presumption of et persons listening to music and thinking but but it is not quite ad up and then i learn that the person is not listening to music i that they are using that time that the internal narrative i which was a very very negative repeated internal legit you are not going to get anywhere i could make anything of it of yourself i could be there in his mind si was a form of self punishment i was a form of of taking the anger and frustration inside and enacting it towards himself and that was salient that this person could not see his way to any goodness nothing could change nothing could get any better felt very sure and very resolved about that and the answer was ye that is right t bay nothing can get any better with this constant mantra running over and over again but things can get better right if that becomes less salient over time and your own thoughts and reflections become more salient at the other end of that shift that narrative that was still there but it was weakened right because it takes time to really change things who was very much weakened the person was listening to music again those thoughts had had a come back to the surface and they were being to jumbled in ways that that brought new and interesting thoughts coming from them and the person was an entirely different place and completely change their life i i mean this is it this is true right is a dramatic example but dramatic examples inform us i where the salients shifted and then the life shifted after that what your describing in terms of the specific example ism does not resinate with me in terms of my own experience although it as you point out it is very striking it is very dramatic ism but it resinates with me from a different perspective ism ism not seeking a free clinical session here but ah but to give meat to the example ism about to ask you for inside on have never allowed myself to stay in a bad professional situation for very long now when things did not feel brighter when i sens some one i was working with or for was not the right situation i got out despite if i were to really think about it that could have been pretty severe long term consequences fortunately it all worked out in fact much that i would say i i pay attention to whether or not people i work with and four are of the sort that i want to be working with and if i sense a particular type of danger it'll look at that and i ism a hundred per cent far i not on wood but a hundred per cent far on recognizing later that it was a great decision to move on and on the flip side of it have made i believe excellent decisions and terms of who to work with in terms of my podcasting in terms of my academic career et camera but have had to move away from people that just were not right for me do not think they were truly bad actors but thank goodness i moved away and thank goodness i found these other wonderful people to work with however there are circumstances that have been repetitive in my life where have just be honest repeatedly made not good decisions about who to be involved with over fairly long periods of time and there can even be an awareness i should say there has been in awareness this is not a good situation and yet ism persisting in in seeking out this in similar types of situations i consider myself a the least partially rational human being with some degree of introspection when i look at this and i think locate this is a choice to focus on placing myself in i have to assume it placing myself in to situations that are challenging from me in a way that i know is preventing me from living in certain ways that i want and from being chappy in certain ways that i want when you hear a scenario that i can do it over here but i cannot seem to do it over here in fact i see myself doing at the wrong way here it a loo it different than the example you gave a moment ago because i was driving a work not listening to music but it was not putting two and two together about what was going on but when somebody can see what is going on i think this might even be called the repetition compulsion or sometimes yet what is that about are people trying to work out something specific er are they deliberately creating some friction to accomplish something else it i mean i realize this cold be infinitely complex and again ism not trying to extract them i the clinical ins i for for my own sake i start anonclock on that thank you u but i think a lot of people do this that they do what they know they should not be doing they know they should not be doing it dah i just said that two ways and but they do it it must serve them in some way you think about when you get a dog in your doctor dog trainer they say a dogs do what works right they get reward for does on the is continued doing it u you apply that to the same sort of thing ism describing for myself and that have observed another people you must say it must work for them you ear hasn't count of pop psychology it must work for them or you must be solving something why the hew do i do this why do people do this is it real pathology or is it a roundabout way to get to something else that is actually o pretty adaptive instead of defining this pathology would not to find at is mythology i would find it as humanness if humanness is not in an of itself pathological then all your doing there is is describing something that is common widespread a cross human beings not does not mean we cannot understand it and make it healthier right i work in a discipline that wants to put a number on everything right label it as something an then do something about it that is more often than not ineffective right because we are not looking at things in a top down way of what is human experience what are the natural aspects of human experience that are less than ideal right that we can then understand and make better if we come at it that way then we see ah it's a great example because here is where structure meets function right on the structure side we say there's defense mechanisms and we imagine the branch it is right that that coming up from the unconscious mind right and here it meets function right defense mechanisms inaction on the function side then determining salience what i would imagine in yo our example my image is that you are defensive structure hand you are doing the thing that is effective right the professional decisions right looks elegant right like that that there is harmony to where those branches are the consciousness is sitting in between it you can see you can see the elegance to it right that i can just imagine shifting right when when you are not doing the thing effectively right because now your using an entirely different defensive structure which is gan function differently and create different salience and i imagine that it is convoluted and that it sort of piece me that it is not something elegant right you say what is it actually mean let us translated into what are the actual defenses would thing bout what you are not doing when you are making good decisions in the professional soul right you are not using denial or avoidance or rationalization or projection or projective identification or acting out right they are all these things that you are not doing that are the sort of unhealthy defense is beckoning to us liclewould not it be easier to kick the can down the road right would not it be easier to just know in everything everything can work out o right wouldn't it be easier instead of being angry at one person who is really intrinsic to the environment if you you knows actually somebody else or you displacing projecting t that is how people that we get ourselves into trouble right and if that is going on than that set of defense mechanisms in action right crocket creates something that obscures the ability to make good judgment right but with none of those things going on than would you doing what you are applying your intelligence you are applying your discernment right you are applying your desire to make things better you are able to look at it you are able to bring diligence perseverance right you are able to bring healthy aspects of self to the question and tiki oh i do not want this in it should be different right and there again what is going on there is a complexity under the surface but now we are coming up towards simplicity right we are coming up towards e thinsthat are healthier that are simplicity if we look then o a what is going on if you are making the same mistakes over and over again what wicked yo we would dive under the hood and really look and took a what are you doing there but it has to be an array of unhealthy defenses no other thing it could be wed a oke are you using are using avoidance maybe a little maybe lot what about denial what about rationalization and what about projection you know ye go through the unhealthy defenses and and you see what is it that you are bringing to bear that is leading you astray and then then of course the goal is to use the the roll modelling and you roll model for yourself how to be healthy right let us take that to modelling and apply it to the thing you shoot a carving out and entreating differently and and that is ta reason when people talk about repetition compulsions that is it is not a formal term because because what we are really talking about his repetition right we are interested what why do we repeat things now that is one that is one reason right because we bring an unhealthy set of defenses and then at the end of the day things come out the same because we are bringing an unhealthy set of defenses right there can be other motivations that are related to all of that and there get this complexity to it but but the compulsion part can be that we can re enter situations at did not go well with the idea that we are going wireman a fix what happened in the past we can make ourselves feel better weeping to take away the mark of tropic is from a aroma does not care about the clock or the calendar that is why you will see some one who has had say five abusive relationships that looked very much o the same right and is about to enter the sixth right and he said it is not because hopefully in most cases not as that person want to be hurt right means sometimes the different problem right but but there can be a drive inside of us to try and fix something if i can make it work this time i will not have to feel bad about the other five right an attempt to change the past through one's current actions right which is rude in the limbic system and how and how troat affects us and how again its outside the clock in the calendars to that kind of magic to speak can happen the brain can seek that magic but again their unhealthy defenses coming into play right the there has to be denial right otherwise the person would map if the same thing happened five times and this looks the same it is probably can to happen now right it any time you think a person most often it is us right it is smart enough for worldly enough to no batter which it happens all the time right than look for the answer right say win that person no better than to get into the six abusive relationship answers a yes right because it is not that horrid if you saw set a circumstances five times to map that the sixes can have the same outcome right the person would do that in other scenarios right then you say right that is true now let us look for why the person is does not recognize that and the giant we go down into the structure of self and the function of self defense mechanisms in action aliens the things that were talking about now does that ye make sense what wat comes to mind is the idea of am getting into a car that is going to get into an accident over and over and over again but being quit cognizant of safety in its important in every other domain of life yes not even j walking right but getting in if if certain users arrived with a little flashing this a this ride is going to have an accident getting getting into that vehicle and i see this an others as well yes and an it raises all sorts of o questions it i is the person actually unconsciously afraid of the vehicle riving where they want to go because then ism are people rashly afraid of things working out i this gets to something that that seitan at can i say that is way if they know the person right who is that person right why do they not one to get in that car right are they afraid they are knocking get somewharthy for thinking to get somewhere right but ultimately we are looking for unhealthy defenses and i it'd want to emphasize that that than i will often think that the aspect of my education that is most helpful in me doing my job when when ism in the job is as a practising sacchitris is ad sushi my mathematics miner right because there is a lot more math to this right people intend to think on mental health that is all its all e esoteric an you can to say anything in anything we want and there is no way a proving or dispersing it is it is not that at all right there is a mathematical aspect to it if you do the correct logical common sense a thing right in all aspects of your life except one and you are a hundred times more intelligent than you need to be to figure it all out right then then if there is a carve out we say look that is of huge interest right i mean the probability that organ to find something interesting there is a hundred percent right because we know that better we know that you do better but but why here that is interesting right that is where the ex marks the spotted let us go dig there right that when we go and dig there we are enough find something right and and a it what is that i do we find that oats in a ray of o really unhealthy defense mechanism maybe we find that do we find that there is a deep unconscious mote ovation right were might find that too right that the we might find a lot of things right but we are going to find them if we go back to what is the structure of self what is the function of self if we go and look that ex marks the spot means there is pay dirt there right and then when we fig r that out then we go through and we can make things change if it is a deep seated aroma driven unconscious motivation that is resulting in an unhealthy array of defense mechanisms will let us go look at that right let us look at the aroma let us take the thing that is unconscious and and bring it to consciousness right then we can make that better and that a ray of unhealthy defenses and were not in to change it overnight but can we change it very very significantly pretty rapidly probably yes and we can almost entirely change it across time there is a mathematical aspect of this that i think it is important to point out because bean a mental health if dos not even as a field right just met we all want to be mentally healthy there is a remand reason to it that yes it follows science and yes it also follows common sense and if we apply those things we get to answers very reassuring thank you thinking about the functions of self and again i just to remind myself and another people you starts wit self awareness boll's defense mechanisms in action than there is the salients peace but paying attention to what is inside of us as well as what is external and then you are now describing lot of your choices choice making and and behavior in action in loves have to soon that for for the person trying to improve themselves and get to agency and gratitude a that paying attention to all of these is is important but of course if a defense mechanism is unconscious we cannot simply deck look but when see the unconscious defense mechanism does that mean that we should ask ourselves about what is most salient to us or should we be focusing on our behavioral choices join the ample ages gave ism aware of my behavior or choices making certain decisions to engage with certain people and and not with others i but should i be ask king for instance what sailing warlike what or the thoughts leading up to that decision a in other words how does salients of internal and external a use and processes m relate to behavior and which of these should we be paying attention to if our goal is to eventually change our behavior think about we are starting whet were starting at the bottom right who were starting with locate there is an eye right and that is just no not just an apprehension right there is a lot to that right so for example i know someone who who is doing some mere meditation staring into the mirror right looking back itself with an with a desire to be aware there is a me we this me is in the world right this is the first have ever heard of such a practice a except when i was in elementary score maybe was the ninth grate i had a a teacher who talked about forgave us an assignment to look in the mirror and and ask ourselves questions but if i understand correctly you think there is utility to people spending a few minutes or more looking in the mirror and and thinking about oneself and the eyes a way to build up this self awareness is yo i have that right if you want to take the best care of yourself that you can right you into understand yourself the best you can you one to make your life the best it can be right then if the answers races say to answers are in five or ten different cupboard i look in all of them frighten that is that is the idea right that if if we want o know something look everywhere for it and also realize what we are building r what we are creating may be a recipe there may be things from different cupboards that overlap the way to translate that practically is to say to find the answers to what what is either ailing us why we are repeating things we do not want to repeat or even if things are going o cay but we want them to be going better because we do not quite feel the peace and contentment we want to feel then look everywhere in the the function of self in the function of self start with the eye right there ways of increasing self awareness they can range from contemplation myself to meditation to looking in the mirror right there things that we can do to more strongly emphasized to ourself that there is an eye and this eye is going through life right then we know that their defense mechanisms that their present there acting in us right we cannot just see them because they are unconscious but if we start thinking about them we can learn about them right and that is where salience comes in to play sailings cant appoints both ways right we assailing can point us towards the unconscious mind right i realize ism doing this over and over and ism saying this thing to myself over and over again where is that coming from we stor becoming curious about ourselves and we look to the unconscious mind and then we also look to the conscious mine that that is why after salience is behavior it what am i doing right an a lot of times we do not know just at examples of we do not know why we are doing things right someone who wants to lose want but always goes to the grocesrand comes home and is has some sense of surprise that there things there that they do not want to eat right why m i behaving in a certain way what is certain things bother me when other things do not right my mi really touchy about one thing and not another why might there be things that bother others and not me or vice verse rat we are looking at what is going on inside of us and then how we respond right because how what may be upsetting me or what is going on inside of me both conscious and unconscious right is then determining how ism acting how behaving in the world around me if i want a better job but i never take an interview for another job ism not going to get another job if i want a romantic partner but i automatically turn away from anyone who smiles at me ism not in to have a romantic partner right if i want life to be better and there is a certain thing i repeat and i do not want to repeat that i want to understand myself better i can change the behavior and that is why the the the function of self and with strivings right e strivings are into the future i know there isn't eye i know there is a net work and web of defense mechanisms in action i know that there is sailing going on inside of me and a mulligan to pay attention to a few things from the thousands i could pay attention to i want to be aware of that and have more control over that then ism enacting behaviors ism engaging in the world around me and ultimately i want things right i want life to be better i want to have that feeling that you can get to i want to be in the state of of agency ingratitude again these two pillars structure of self function of self that is where all the answers are they are all the cupboards right there there these five cupboards in the structure of self and five in the function of self and i know tell be a you will have it out there in a pedicel right because you can go back there and that is where the vast majority of answers are to both understanding and routes to change what you just described is incredibly helpful ait is absolutely apparent to me why looking in all the cupboards its key it is also apparent that a many different aspects of psychology and psychiatry am at least as i understand them my probe a french is just at the level of behavior you know thing this is the that does not do it moi well just do the right thing it if y you are not finding a romantic partner you will sexual three dinners with friends and asked them to invite over people are looking for part of sounds really simple right but am much as with the example of my friend who lost all this way through behavioral change the the fear still lives within em very very strongly and clearly there is some some stuff happening underneath there not fortunately he did lose the waiting kept most of it off but it is clear to me that until he addressed to some of these other issues of salience and a defense mechanism self aware in a et camera that a the fear he still experiencing makes total said because the foundation of that change is not nearly as strong as it could be am maybe the m maybe it is not a to have the fear but he is not in to learn either one without the exploration you will not if there is risk he will not be able to avert the risk and if there is not risk these then to to laboring through life which is difficult enough without being worried about something you do not have to be worried about a to the process of inquiry will always make that better it is clear to me that his fear of regaining wait is absolutely sapping his enjoyment and his productivity another domains of flirt warrants a mention rite is because we are deciding i that a mathematical way it does not have to be that way does it mean it can change overnight but it can be understood and it can be changed what is for that reason an many other reasons that ism very grateful that you explain these two pillars structure of self and function of self and how the flow up to empowerment and humility and how those flow up to agency and gratitude you have given us a in a set of ideals in i n and a road map of of how to get there and one that we are going to continue with in a moment here ism i did want to reiterate what you said which is that there is a periapt version of this the structure this road map of ideals and how to get there i that is been provided as a lincoln the shown out captions ism people can refer to them they are an visual form if they if you are interested in understanding yourself and in having goodness in your life as much as you possibly can then you are interested in the structure of the mind and this means that you are interested in the unconscious mind in all the things that go on a million things a second that we do not no or understand one by one but that we can explore and understand better in total we are also interested in the conscious mind in being sell ware we are interested in the array of defense mechanisms and whether or not they there elegant and light passes clearly through them or whether the distorting light in creating misperception if you are interested in the structure of the mind then you are also interested in the character structure lie what is your character structure what is the last around all of it how e interface with the world and then you are interested in the self that you grow from that phenomenologically meaning what is your experience myself how does it feel to you these are all important parts of this pillar of health and happiness the other pillar is the function of the mind and of course there is overlap there different cupboard but the cupboards all contain different ingredients that together make the recipe if we are interested in the function of the mind then we want to pay attention that there is an eye we want to be self aware and we want a cultivate self awareness we are also interested in how those defense mechanisms work when they are in action it what salient insight of us and outside of us what we paying attention to how we behaving what are our strivings do we feel hopeful about ourselves in the world around us and if we are interested in all of these things we cannot help but be respectful it of just how complicated this is life is difficult and understanding ourselves is is difficult in wonderful joy can come of living life but it is hard and its hard day by day and trying to understand ourselves going to these places these pillars that hold the answers they they cannot but make in us a respect for all of it and the respect for ourselves for others brings with it humility when we come to this point of looking at ourselves and exploring than yes we become empowered because we have gained a lot of knowledge we are digging where the pay dirt is were figuring things out and along with that empowerment comes humility a respectfulness for how difficult all this is how complicated we are how we can make happiness in our lives but how it certainly is an easy and we take with us the empowerment and the humility and we express them and if we are expressing empowerment and humility we come to living through o agency and gratitude here both are active words agency its it is easier to see it it is an active word where ism aware of my ability to to project myself into the world around me i know that i cannot control everything but ism really trying to understand what can i control right how can i control it what to my decisions now lea dude in the future agency is very very active gratitude is active too right as we are bringing an active sense of gratitude sense of the amazingness that were here and and pride in ourselves and others for being here and and trying to move forward as best we can and then we bring that to our interactions were much more likely to have a kind gesture towards others instead of being angry were much more likely to have something compassionate to say including to ourselves than we are to have something angry to say that gratitude accompanies agency their their active words and their active together and if we are living life through agency and gratitude and there is a lot of wisdom about this is a lot has been written and research about this and if you look at what is it telling us right member things are getting simpler right as we are getting higher up the the levels here right the unconscious mind is most complicated now were at i can we live our lives with agency and gratitude at the forefront and what does it bring for us and i think it brings what we are seeking that we might look we were seeking happiness and that can mean a lot of things it a lot of different things that can be a very active thing my happy in the moment and we can use happiness sometimes to distract ourselves happiness is important but words what when people really think what is it that they want or what is it that they have right if the the the overjoy to be alive their finding a sense of peace their finding contentment their finding delight the ability to be delighted this is what people want or or our human history it are our searching tell us this in our own experiences tell us this and and now it could lead a person to think where an what is going on in is is this some one who's in a levitating at the top of a mountain is this just a state is a a state the people are in and and the answers no be sometimes we could be in that state where we can feel peace there is no tension inside of us with i can feel to have times when i do not feel tension inside of me there is contentment there is peace an oft to drive towards anything but it is not the passive experience of it because we are living life it is that that feeling goes hand in hand with a drive within us that we are when we are in this healthy place we are living life the decisions that we are making what is putting the rubber to the road it is a generative drive within us there is a drive to make things better to under stand to explore and it is that drive that we access and cultivate and synonymous with happiness is it is not just the state when people want to be happy in that very very general way yes contentment peace delight but but there happening as we are living life rig as we are enacting a generative drive were we are looking at ourselves in the world around us and we are interested in understanding we are interested in making things better and that is the place that we are trying to get to i believe that with all my with all my heart and my and my brain by my education training experience and also experience living living life and and for twenty years doing this work with people tells me this is what we are seeking and it is an active way of of experiencing ourselves and our place in life i love that because it merges both the sounds and the adjectives and the verbs now an and this notion of a generative drive to me is compelling because i i have the sense and i hope ism right that we all have some sort of generative drive within us starting at an early stage ism maybe even starts as visual foraging er touching things with our hands as an infant and it you exploration of the world right it is what brings about the changes in the nail circuitry that allow us to engage even more and in an i progressively on the one hand narrower ways but also with more richness and more detail i could you tell us more about generative drive and and how this shows up in different types of people ism is it always positive can there be too much of it am i certainly know a number of people who are addicted to work for those we listening ism raising my hand i but i would say nowadays ism not as addicted to work as i once was in the sense that i derive far more satisfaction from less work now provided that the work is really in depth i think that there were years an in graduate school where i wanted to publish a bunch of ampersand then quickly realized ism through the a not gentle persuasion of my momentous that let just do the best possible work we can do and there much more richness and an experience and things to be gained from that ism familiar with generative drive as as i understand it but maybe if you would if you could flush out a bit of what generative drive is and and does it arrive i in parallel with or before we are able to access peace contentment and delight am can it even be separated out from that ism on wat what is the generative drive yo drives are built into that the the synonymous with our existence if we exist then then we have the drive and that that is how the drive is to fined i and we understand going far back to to psychodynamics and psychoanalytic roots and and when people really thinking hard about human beings and what is going on inside of us that we have to identified and n validated over the the period of time since that we have aggressive drives within us and we have drives towards pleasure now this often gets misunderstood that aggression it can be it can be active violent aggression for example but aggression can also be a so a sense of agency right i the inaction of agency i i want to do things an want change things at want it i want to make the world a different place right that that all of that comes under this drive aggressive and aggressive drive is not a bad thing if we had no aggressive drives the thought as would just lie down and nothing else would happen and t we would all be gone right there is a way in which this drive within us moves us forward right and of course extremely complicated the ways we can manifest too much of it or too little of it or how our defense mechanisms can intertwine with the drive but the drive is there its its fuel with in us that comes with our existence and then how that fuel moves us fulgor how much of it there is no that it is determined by the mashing of the drive with how we are living life it and the same would be true of pleasure no the pleasure drive does not just mean that we all want to be hidden i inside it means that we want things that are gratifying right we want to feel good right this is not just the drive towards physical pleasure a sex drive or or eating food or having comfort all of that can be part of it but it is a drive for relief right the idea that we do not want to be white knuckling life right searching for pleasure sos having aggression within us as we white knuckle life and we search for some pleasure and and relief right these drives within us can be healthy they can be unhealthy they can be anything right there there there wellsprings within us that then fuel us forward and there is controversy to the idea is there degenerative drive and there certainly tat parts of the field that do not think but there have been strong thinkers in the field that have thought we do have a generative drive that it is within us to look around us to be curious to be amazed right to think like how how can i engage with this and make this better or happy or to think outside of ourselves right to think if i have if i feel good and sure in pain can i make you feel better right we having nothing to do with me right the idea of altruism coming to the fore in having industriousness with us within u right and and the idea that there is generative drive it its strengthen when you look at how humans behave when it we are not struggling right that that people are interested in learning and we think about how how much of people give of themselves to learning right or deserving other there is much of this goodness in the world around us now if we shut people away right have no imagine you know god forbid someone is in a solitary confinement from when the the moments are born then that there is not an opportunity for the generative drive to thrive right and we see many many situations where it does not thrive enough right yo know to violence in people's surroundings lack of opportunities thatthat we can squelch a generative drive any one's generative drive but if we give ourselves opportunities if if we are healthy that we are not weight down by aroma and illness and misperception ourselves when we can live life in a way that brings us to agency and gratitude now we are a lying with the generative drive that i absolutely believe is within us i think just look at life look at human beings we observe that we have this drive with us and if that drive is at the forefront and that drive then naturally of course lies with agency and gratitude than i think were at the place that is the place we we ultimately seek i and that we can find it for brief periods of time by really pursuing this and and really strongly in my own therapy in reflection and attempts to understand i can have periods of time where i can feel that way i i can feel outward growth and interest in the world and and i feel good ism not trying to answer some question why my live or ism doing things that i feel good about and i feel good about doing those things in about being in the world and and i think this is not uncommon it may be far more common in societies that are allegedly less advanced right that is have less distractions or maybe less a knowledge of all all he awful things in the world that can happen to us that are constantly fed to us this the whole much of other questions and topics about it but but this this you a this absolute belief that there is this generative driving us that wants to ale with agency and gratitude and that we all have it within us to bring those to the forefront and to find that thing that we seek whether some one's person says its n nirvana the other person says it is joy or happiness or peace or numbing we know whatever it is there is there is something to it were we are not feeling the tension within us were not feeling the anxiety the pressures that were feeling a sense of goodness the way you are describing it am makes perfect sense why peace contentment and delight be closely linked to this generative drive not the the word peace as s you alluded to s often am brings to mind the idea o passivity but generative drive and the inclusion of things aggression and a drive for pleasure are anything but passive to thing that is important for me and for everyone to understand that a peace contentment and delight can really be action terms again to moving them from a from the more typical conception of them to divert states peace contentment and delight are not passage states there can be periods of time where we can be just very peaceful and very much at rest but but those words are not synonymous with inaction in fact the synonymous with action a lot of the time if we are suffused with peace contentment the ability to delight than what we are doing is were raising up the generative drive we are making conditions that are permissive for the generative drive to come to the forefront right to be paramount over the aggressive and the pleasure drives an remember we are not trying to get rid of those drives t we just want the generative drive in us to be at the forefront then will be able to harness the aggressive drive through for example a strong sense of agency fueling the sense of agency forward as opposed to destructive aggression right the search for pleasure which sure can include physical pleasures and in ways that are good and reasonable and healthy for us but also the pleasure of learning t the pleasure that altruism brings that we can take the aggressive drive that we know is in us and the pleasure drive that we know is in us and we can die them to the right places this gets very complicated and it is easy to did that too far up and it is easy to digit too far down but if both are serving the generative drive because we lift up the generative drive and we bring it to primacy that being able to handle our lives to understand ourselves to go back to those pillars and to build upon it the agency and the gratitude that then leads us to peace contentment and delight we can put all of this together and we are really and truly living in an active way in the world that is good for us good for the world around us and does not leave us with the sense of yearning or sense of mention within us you think it is also thecae that generative drive has kind of a am self amplification feature to it what comes to mind as your describing generative drive in its relationship to piece contentment and delight is that approximately a half hour after i wake up i start to feel i more physically energized ism not somebody who just pops out of it as rate t go exercise or due mental work a but about thirty minutes or after waking my my mind starts to wake up and have notice that if i read a scientific paper or if i read a chapter in a book or if i do something that feels a little bit difficult cognitively difficult in particular that am the sense of satisfaction that i get from that is immense and it it is not never the case that i have to learn something that ism going to use that day but for me learning and m and often learning and sharing what i learn with the world whether another when i hear it or not am it is part of my a pleasure loop and and have learned that if i do not capture some new knowledge in a way that is challenging am in the morning time i i feel the years are still turning but but i starts it and lose energy whereas if i find something interesting an particular and and i write it down and and i feel i own it that is what i enjoy much about learning it is in there maybe it will be useful at some point maybe it will not that is a it is a animal finding a tool that it can may be used to forage for more effectively later in life i i get such a sense of satisfaction hat than i find that i have immense energy to do whatever next whether not that is exercise or learn more or i prepare podcast or write a grants or i ran work on a paper and this feature of my mental life has is prominent that i almost so to force myself to do it each day and there are many distractions in the world nowadays that have come to a placewhere i almost have to force myself to do what i know works for me but when i do it feels a almost i chemical rocket fuel it does not make me manic or crazy i do not need to pick up the phone and call somebody or tell everybody about or post on social media it is more of a deep sense of satisfaction and and i get energy from it is that the generative drum was great that that works for you what what you are saying is that for you you can prime your generative drive that way right and then you primate as you prime the pomp a gets reed up rightly then and then you know it is s really manifesting itself inside of you mean there is many different manifestations of the generative drive as there are people right somethings in work for some person other things can work for different person right but but but you are saying that hey i know this thing works for me and even though sometimes is not easy to do i do it and then look what it gets for me right and that that is that is really healthy right as knowing that this thing works for you and then you become committed to it because your generative drive as is is really strongly supported by it right and then you have the sense of good feeling right then you have that you have the peace and you have they have just over all sense of goodness right thee yo piece and contentment and delight youyou are getting that in learning and in teaching to you your figuring out hey this works for me right and gan you do not have to figure it out through this land as if we find parts at are not working then we go back and we figure them out right maybe a good example maybe is a say you take some one who relic enjoys gardening and get something out of gardening right they are as many generative drives and how they are measured out as there are humans but there can be common outcomes of that right the enjoyment of of fostering plants growing a garden is that that is not uncommon in humans right imagine some one who has not been doing that right they really want to they have a drive to do it there is the plot of land in the back that they used to cultivate right if they are not doing it there any number of reasons maybe maybe they were depressed and they need a mental health treatment maybe they just got away from the path that they were on maybe their defense is shifted a little bit whatever the case may be they go back to the pillars and they figure it out right and now they are in accord with themselves right and they are living through agency and gratitude and they feel right i can go back out there and i can till that land i can i can get the hoe out i can o i can make the bloom an to put the seeds in ism goon a nurture i can go do that and i can do it even what even though i was depressed even though somebody assaulted me five months ago even though i lost my job even though even though even though right they overcome the even those right and the sense of agency tells them right i can g do that right and the sense of gratitude no one who is miserable and and hey and and now is i is in such an awful position about life because they were attacked or lost her job or something bad happen whatever it may be or they are lost in cynicism there is no gratitude there right it is the gratitude for being in life for having the capability of going back and and and planting seeds in that garden that is the alliance between agency and gratitude then the person goes and does that right think of what is going on there they do this thing they feel good about this thing they can have they can look out at the garden feel some peace right feel some contentment o them be the l lighted by what they did remember how much they loved it before how much it means to them yes that goodness comes that goodness suffuses us and it raises up the generative drive that is as right as as good we breathe some life into it right enough to get that garden done now the generative drive is further fostered forward by the goodness the person feels the example at the difference between the person whose wants a garden feels terrible about themselves and they're not doing it an they feels lousy every time they look out the window and there they are looking out the window right the difference between that and having made a garden and looking out the window added is a night and day difference and the the the person whose looking out the window at the garden that they build overcoming whatever was inside of them because they they went and addressed it and and proved to themselves that they could that is all we are after in life righted we all know that it does not look somebody levitating at the top of a mountain wright that is what it looks the person looking out the window at the garden and thinking about what they overcome it overcame to create the garden and seeing the goodness of it all i glad you said the wore creating because it seems it is about creating things it real tangible things but that the process to get there is every bit of important wee's nail mat's created when you create knowledge that that is tangible right you you you crate knowledge maybe that that person looks down the row of beautiful flowers and has the same sense of goodness inside of them that you do when you are relic had i just i just went and learn something as you describe that i in thinking i i certainly hope cause for me it is it is an incredible sense of satisfaction an an one that i enjoy much that i almost toft want to look at it too much cause to me it it sits in this ism a rare domain of perfect it is just it just feels good and that am and that i can get back there is er is very comforting to me and that is all of this that it feels good that is what all this is it is the generative drive i it is the it is the gratitude it is the contentment all that coming together and it is interesting we could contrast that to do when you talked about a repeated cycle that is negative right then you are not feeling that right thing by the learning that can come from it right that you can you can achieve this and feel this and be in the state in one aspect of your life what can you learn from that to bring to the other place it and more yes that is important it is more it it is often starting with what is going on in the place that is not doing well right is at why the repetition right this is how we we can have what we are seeking in parts of our lives even if we do not in others but if we can have it imparts of our lives we can have it in others too and we can become role models for ourselves we can learn from ourselves we can learn from what brings the good out to raise up the things about us and in our lives an our there yet i often get the question from the general public how can i stop overthinking you right i have to imagine based on the fact i get that question often that there are a great number of people who i sense their own generative drive what are your thoughts on that thinkingkcan be wonderful if we are using thinking to learn right to figure things out when thinking is doing that thinking is great but a lot of thinking is just in the service of something else i and a lot of thinking works against us imagine the person making the garden i could the person has to think about it everything about what seems to make they have to think about where they the tools are they to think about what they are doing when they are planting when they are watering there is a lot to do but the beauty of it is not in the thinking right the thinking is in the service of what is generative is that is a different kind it is it is just thinking in the service of something but a lot o f our thinking is that it is it is planning it is projecting we tend to glorify the planning in the projecting and and it can be great when we are learning when we are figuring things out but a lot of that is is there that we can do the things that are good for us to do right the planning in the projecting round making the garden where the point of it is the garden it is not the thinking part right we can also use thinking against us much thinking is repetitive and not just it not just unproductive but harmful it that person who is looking out the window at the garden maybe thinking i mean sometimes are just pauses in our thinking but in a lot of times a person must be thinking and and what often goes on there is just repetitive negative thinking it is no gash i used to have a garden remember when that was beautiful or not remember before summons such a person passed away and then we stop making the garden or it'll never go to make e garden again or gash it is too much is just something that is negative and unproductive mean what else is there to think if the persons i sh looking to the window at the garden right and they are in this auto stock state here gotten a generative state and the thinking becomes becomes repetitive and it furthers all the negative right u aid the more we further the negative the mere we take its is a foreland highway that we want to atrophy lets i make it into a sicxlane highway but but we do that when when we have this repetitive thinking which then can evolve into the narratives of thingsthat we say to ourselves right if thinking is wonderful it is wonderful but it can so just observe something else and it can also be used against us what we are talking batter does not glorify thinking i mean it does if it is in the service at a generative drive but it does not in it tough itself i think many people i set a time say yo nine thirty m or ten i m when they are going to begin doing something the they want to do or know they should do that is little bit challenging could be exercise could be cognitively demanding work and then ten o'clock rolls around they sad a ten fifteen and they are distracted by often social media tasting these days i think those ore the main culprits really i i do not know too many people to get distracted by exercise and reading books some do m an doing complex puzzles or math but i thou social media is a little bit mental chewing gum except that would add to that that is the kind of chewing gum that really does i sate the appetite in a way that prevent you from eating nutritious food it unless used correctly i and then people feel bad about themselves because the whole morning went by announce noon then they require some food any a person been they might feel nap for the preprandial dip and energy and then the afternoon and and then it goes on and on may i i hear this all the time have experienced this before som ism not i mine to this myself that is why i trying capture that early wave of energy whatever it might be a drank in nor ran an a some commination the way you describe thinking and it is potential relationship to generative drive it seems to me it is important that we capture those moments of i but potential creation how however small the action might be to remind ourselves that we are capable of moving things from pointy to point be because in the description i just gave of the person that let us the morning escape there is there is really no external barrier except these distractions put differently all the tools exist within most all of us to be able to create what we wants great or at least to create something frankly the and yet many many people just do not fulfill that that right that they were and that we have all been given right let us think think about what is going on there the person dung an exercise at ten o'clock right now i push it back the ten fifteen and y do something on social mere they push it back to ten thirty it will be ora it'll get it all in what they are doing is there there engaging i is unhealthy defense mechanisms right if we go back to the the pillars right the the structure of self the function of self there may be other reasons for it delicious identify the unhealthy defenses of avoidance and rationalization right and then there is no thinking going on about that right joust unconscious processes and you kick it down you nay you kick get down the clock fifteen minutes right there not thinking about it thinking then is subserving something different right thinking is subserving the avoidance if ism gong to go look on something of read a couple things reply ism thinking on planning right i got to get the make got to get the phone out i got a tat my coating to it i got t go to a certain bets looking we are doing something that we are thinking about it i think about what ism going to wrist that but the thinking is all in the service of the unhealthy defenses right then by understanding ourselves better we can we can bring that right to a healthier place how by abacchon using thinking for what helps us right let us think of what looking what is going let us say if you are doing that look what is going on when you are doing that right do you you really want to exercise right but is not easy to exercise and something is might just problem moving are you doing a think you maybe something you more there's lower barrier et camera but let us say we are just working within the psychological right then you can come at that a couple of ways i do not want to do that thing that things hard right i mean i think that about things in my life sometimes and it always makes me hap and makes me weighty and unhappy right i may as well put twenty pound weights on either side of me right a man i can look at it that way right or there he different way of looking at it that actually fit is much better which is ism not daunted by doing difficult things and i can get out there and and apply myself and ant i feel good about that when i do difficult things is part of my identity right as part of how i see myself right i going to go do this thing and i goal to feel good about t and and is not it amazing that i get to do it right i ill carry am alive healthy right i can go do the thing i but my health is is good but i want to make it better right by working out or ism at least alive and if it lose a little bit of wight it'll feel healthier a come on this is good right and then it'll feel different about that right and and the truth is not or the others both can be true know what will be true is what you choose right and if you choose the negative then yes you t unhealthy defense is perpetuating even if you get yourself to do it today it is harder to do it tomorrow that is why sometimes it'll say to a person like just take a look at it and decide if you want to do it or not if you do not want exercise just decide you do not right and and then no gay there is a trade all for everything may be rocky with the trade off right but what am i trying to do there right is is bring to consciousness the that person is making a choice right do you want to do it if you want to do it if you want to do it it is great to just do it right and if you do not it is is great to not do it and least you are being honest and clear with yourself and you are not wasting all that time when you keep kicking it fifteen minutes down the you know down the clock until it is too late does does that make senses i think how the structure here really does it works because it is it is pulling together what we know from the biology to the psychology i how to understand ourselves and how to understand when things are not the way we want them to be that we can make them the way we want them to be is not magic it is it is following the sort of mathematical aspects of you do not going to the factors assessing them making changes and and then of course we see the outcome we want to say the way you describe it does make sense and appreciate it because think ultimately it seems to active act actions to verbs to bring us to these feeling states that you i think hard what people are seeking piece contentment delight through agency gratitude as active terms right letters yes now i think the are universal desires and i can leave providing this i wonderful road map for people to arrive there think you i do have a question about some of the under winnings of generative drive in particular this i notion of aggressive drive i have known people that seem to have a lot of this t us have a lot to get up and go or a lot of drive to create in the world are to figure things out i they often do create great lives for themselves and in work in relationship et camera have also observed that these people often do not have the best relationship to themselves or that they run up against i bearers are frankly sometimes straight in to brick walls ism in certain domains of their life perhaps as a consequence of having too much of this generative or aggressive drive and at the same time i know that there are people in the world many that have of a what seems to be a low generative drive i i do not now if that is the case or not but i that they i they seem t have a hard time engaging in doing things and and often you get the impression the they some wat er completely given up theta just life is just too hard or am sometimes it is even more subtle i know some one who that they their job but they give come to the place that i it is just work it is a payback and and that might be enough but they are always talking about it i have to assume that it is not enough they are not able to slot their work into one domain and an just focus on the other aspects of their life that are going well it does not compensate for them to think about the other aspects of the life that is m is there continuum of generative drives that exist in us are these intrinsic i i realize there are near infinite number of conditions that ism could give rise to one or the e other be hard wired could be nature could be nurture but what is the relationship between an on i will not to say arousal or on a potential for arousal and aggressive drive and o and these things that were seeking e to the too care i a i like to start the first principles of the drives right that the theory of drives came about when when people were observing very closely human beings and human behavior individuals society's cultures it and and identifying that that that you can boil a lot of things down to to a drive that we call aggressive right is something to i impose myself out there on the world around me right explains a lot of what people do right and then the other identified drive was pleasure rig ho was always enjoyment even relief of unpleasantness right that that the hillside you can describe a lot of human behavior and and that to understand what is going on inside of us that means that were here right you see that through the lens of aggressive and pleasure drives and that is the answer to it to how we survive but i think that is not the answer to it that if it were just aggressive drives and pleasure drives there is not a value system around that a no somebody who is very industrious can build or destroy right and we see this in historical figures being very intelligent and very industriousness has nothing to do with whether your building or destroying right if it were just an aggressive drive and a pleasure drive the we wouldn't be having this conversation right because the species would have would not have survive it if you believe that and i believe that then you look for something else yusesean maybe we looked and we found two things when their more things right and then we start thinking about learning for learning sake auchruism things that are not explained right unless there is a self referential we feel good doing something for some one else or therefore it selfish those a lot of gyrations around that if you really observe humans you you see author the ouchrusm you see learning for learning say you see people being benin when everything about a situation would say that they could would or should under society's rules not be benign right and then we start to see that there is another drive that how do you explain that we are here yet aggression pleasure and generativeness regenerative drive the drive to make things better that is whit we build more than we destroy we destroy a lot right but we build more than we destroy otherwise we would not have close on our backs let alone have the the technology to sit here and to be able to do these it is the generative drive that that is most realized in the healthy person right and the healthy person has the strong generative drive now as you said there are other factors and histoid what you were asking about their probably the natural levels of aggression or pleasure seeking ore generativeness that differ across people right as we are product of nor the complexity of are genetics and all the complexities of nature and nurture we are going to get to a place where where some of us have more some of us have less right tithe the the conclusion that as for all of us the generative drive being at the helm is what what leads us to be t to live good lives right to live to the thingsthat we aspire to the peace and contentment right we want the generative drive to rule the day right whether a person is studying narrow science or growing gardens rightly the importance is about being generative then then aggression and pleasure can subserve the generative drive right and then the question our ask in i i think which is what if there is too much aggression too little aggression right were too much pleasure seeking too little pleasure seeking that is when we we can see problems right and the problems and lead us back to the pillars to figure out the problems too much aggression ultimately becomes envy right too much aggression means i i want i ism on impose myself on on the world around me more than i can more than is reasonable more than can do without impinging upon others right that what you end up doing is taking from others right too much aggression becomes destructive right maybe a person destroys tear something down right takes from others i says that the the nasty comment when it was not necessary and everyone feels bad right the there is that too much aggression star it becomes envy right and envy is destructive it the same thing with too much pleasure seeking if i say ka i wat i want my fair share of pleasure relief of distress nalltat but if i stay if i rely on that too much right rent masthead of aggression eclipsing the generative drive bounce pleasure eclipsing the generate dry then an want more pleasure and more pleasure and more pleasure and how long before i want your pleasure right that it is not healthy right what i becomes is envious right it becomes destructive because now then i become covetous of your pleasure ore if i cannot get it but i could bring you down than all feel better about myself that is envy right too much aggression eclipsing the generative drive too much of the of pleasure seeking to pleasure drive eclipsing the generative drive and we end up in places of envy and envy is destructive and now were in trouble have never thought before about the relationship be tween aggression pleasure and envy but as your describing it i comes to mine de move america psycho were christian bad place this e basically a ad easy yuppy in the the working in finance in new york and em and for any one that seen it it is a can only be described as a violent parody of of eighty's yuppy culture and it is its part dehomedy is this going to begets as dark a coming es it convent and do not let your young children watch hit because he is very gruesome and ha n very sexual and but the the the aggressive features within the character that bail plays am are immediately apparent in the move you o violent aggression sexual aggression am seeking money seeking wealth all the time at a anarchism to an obsession with everything from his skincare routing to a his eight pack abs and it is it is ridiculous but but also an interesting window into some milder forms of those features that still exist in many people to day right a but the end component starts to reveal itself obit later into the move where the scene i recalls one around where so one handsome of business card and then you hear the narrative in his own mind about how much nice her that guys business card that than his and how he hates him much hands o n a guy yes it in very violent artistic fashion that is an resin o gear sri right and and the whole move is about a this one a aspect of culture at that times ability to impose their will on every every one at at their whim easily bell just does whatever the hell e wants at any point goes return videotapes in between and and and there is much woven into it and a that is relevant ad much that woven into it that is just purely for peoples the contisican entertainment a a but that believe his brethren eastern els that wrote that a you is tapping into the the aggression component the pleasure component but the envy component is really what resonates as as you come to the end of the move is there is no satisfying this guy he could kill er or sleep with as many people as he wants in the move am and he can have as much wealth as he wants he can have entire buildings if out to think he is living in an entire building at some point he takes over people's apartments after he kills them it is it is it is wild and disgusting am but it really speaks to the extent to which envy is woven in to absolute aggression in pleasure seeking and it is not something that had really sunk in for me until you describe it now am because i think for most people imagineoket when somebody has ex number of millions or billions of dollars that they will reach this place of peace contentment and delight right they will have enough a and in the move wall street there is that one seen where one says you now what is your number at what point is enough the i says more that is says all sorts of things about the dopomanergic system of ward systems in the brain et camera but think it says a lot more about envy island just what and what a pit of despair envy is for everybody involved right right the envy may not be the root of all evil but envy plus natural disasters maybe much evil and destruction arises from envy and it may be that it is at the root of all of it and we underappreciate that we unterpiciate why people are destructive which is why the roots are not always in drama but but a significant i aspect of of ware envy arises from can often aroma creating a sense of guilt and shame and venerability but but wherever a person may come by it and it is a larger discussion of who envy and where may come from is it drives destruction and if the aggressive drive is greater than the generative drive or if the pleasure drive is greater than the generative drive or if both are greater than the generative drive it will drive destruction and that destruction the vast majority of times if you look deep enough you fin and at its roots envy that envy may arise from guilt and shame within the person but as soon as it becomes about another right i feel guilt and shame an in adequacy inside of me but then i feel envy of those around me they drives the vast majority of destruction do you think that is what is happening when we see these a sadly a ever more frequent examples of a active shooters and school shootings things that sort yes there are there other people who have life and that person does not feel that they do they want to go and take it away from them that is why's as long as we have human tribulation and a lot of guns ti is sing t happen its it is it is a logical conclusion of enough people being in places of despair and how envy can cultivated within us and then ultimately how it blinds people it creates such a desire for destruction the then people will take life away from others and often if people sometimes take their own life which which i think really brings to the forefront the that that prisoners it feel that they have a life certainly not a life worth preserving there then going to take the lives of others and i think wear seeing that is as start a portrait of where envy can lead i think as we can find a the one person basis wewecan g we can look at wars in their destruction on a social basis but i think that is that is the ultimate in understanding where envy can drive a person what about the other end of the spectrum when aggression and o pleasure seeking a too low the other side of the spectrum is demoralization is i imagine very very low aggression low self assertion and low agency i that there there comes a place where that the person is not then imposing themselves or believing that they can in in in much of any way on the outside world and that creates a sense of isolation understandably right a sense of powerlessness and vulnerability and isolation and that then becomes demoralizing which is not the same as depression minding a enow depression is a is there is a negro chemical and balance right whether that and balance came purely biologically or or came psychologically or because of external events there is a near chemical and balance no here we are not talking bout an illness state as identified by modern psychiatry there's not a number in the in the book of diagnoses that goes along with with being demoralized but why because it is a state that humans can be in and too low of an aggressive drive i and all the things that come of that its isolating in its demoralizing the same with too low of a of pleasure drive example that may be relatable it is i to some people is knowing some one whoso has ad a couple of really bad break ups and and these as ism not what ism done with that it's no more romance o can be single rag and and know that person has a driving them there an interconnected person they they want romance they these re things there important to them it they they make a decision ism not ant have that in my in my life what what would be called in some psychodynamics senses inviting death into life a little bit of death by by swearing off something that that the person as a drive towards right the pleasure drive of companionship and of romance that that then becomes demoralizing as well sure those things demoralization can predispose to depression but demoralization is a thing in and of itself where then there is a sense of hopeless nesses a sense of o i the goodness than is in accessible any more in that is the other side of envy can low levels of aggression and the resulting demoralization be coupled with high levels of plea sure seeking ism thinking about the person that is very over weight clearly u headed for health issues if they do not already have them and o perhaps would to remove that weight would to feel more vigorous does not want tight to diabetes and an early death but at some level they're given up but because the the pleasure of eating is something they really enjoy that they really love it and yet it has a component to it in their life where they eitherselve soothed with it or they are just trying to hit baseline levels of satisfaction with it and and i they allow themselves to is a effectively be sedentary and and then the other sorts of trouble start to show up sleep apeneough from carrying excessive weight and then they are feeling tired during the day and then who can exercise when they retro tired when you gat to work and maintain another life demands and you've cone to see where this could rise and an makes perfect sense sham can also see where if there were just a little bit more aggression it could all be turned round but they do not have it is the scenario described something that you have seem clinically i certainly observe it an my nonclinical stands out there in the world a lot well i think the the most important thing you are pointing out is that aggression and pleasure on the high and right we we know can trump the generative drive right but that this can also happen on the low end right you are describing a situations as is a great example it it is not uncommon in the world around us the aggression me the fuel to put oneself out there in the world right to utilize the sense of agency right this in toy person of low agency right the aggressive drive it has as little fuel than to give the sense of agency its further squelch by neat by you negative sense itself and negative self talk now you find where they the aggressive drive is is too low and too low can also trump the generative drive right because in that person cannot take care of themselves a generative drive would say there's a lot of life to live in there can be great things in life and take better care of yourself and by the mayor people that you love and people that love you or or if not here is an animal regarding you love i the generate drives is is saying that right but it is not winning the day because the aggression or know egression is one word we and put to that drive you could call it an assertion drive it we call it an agency dry but that is we know er using agency in a different way but that thing is too low it wins out over the generative drive and then in the example you gave it is not surprising i that the pleasure drive goes the other way maybe there is a predisposition to that genetically maybe it is just reenforced because a person in that place could say well think of wat what this the the self conception would be right ism in this terrible place i it you me them a terrible person i cannot make myself batter or ism not good enough to get better no one cares about me i cannot make anything right therefore i do not i do not matter a is no reason to take care of myself why would i not do if i eat that one thing that i enjoy and it gives me pleasure even it gas a pleasure for two minutes than it'll eat another one in sense what wokause ism i do not feel it on worth preserving or that i can preserve myself right there is a nihil listen to it that then run in makes it make sense to over indulge the pleasure drive whether it is a whether it is biologically predispose o one is just a riving there but the the reason all that is bad it is because the aggressive drive is too low and effactit is low enough that it is outwitting the generative drive ten the pleasure drives get to come into we know one place or another if it is also really low the person does not much of anything and wastes a way which tragically happens a lot in our society right or if the pleasure drive is high maybe that person over indulges in things to provide shorter gratification and then that causes a different set of problems but but what is deterministic there is whether whether aggression or assertion again a different words to that drive but what we have been calling the aggressive drive and the pleasure drive are they is one or the other or both high enough to trump the generative drive or low enough to trump the generative drive and and i think all problems that we see everything fits into this model because it honors what we know right in honors what we know about human behavior and insights in to human behavior over hundreds of years ray over thousands of years the wisdom that we brings forward and it it honors the science and that is why it fits together because i think it honors who we are as what ore species is what we are i and you know what it is what life is as as we try and engage with it have seem cases of demoralized people where i they simply disappear that they hide they icily they slow down they take terrible care of their health and i now sadly i have known several people this in my lifetime i one of whom killed himself the the other who's just as an immense number of health problems related to overeating and ism inactivity and and knows it and talks about it and and but nothing seems to change to spite multiple interventions from a carrying standpoint from friends et camera have also seen examples of people who are demoralized to i seem to band with other demoralized people sort of mum try to recalibrate the standard that they feel i oppresses them that they and this is not necessarily just in the realm of a physical fitness is is also in the realm of school demands i went to a very demanding high school as have talked about before in couple podcast i barely finished high school i was not an attentive student i was my am aggressive and pleasure drives went into a non academic endeavors and i regret that i i had much making up of a of learning to do by time i you unfortunately got to college i eventually caught up but mummy experience a high school was that there were these anal kits scoring perfectly on the essay tea in he early admission hazard in early admission a male in all these places and then there was a distribution in the middle and then there was a collection of kids who were not doing well knew they were not doing well and count of banded together around the idea of not doing well i i did not a consider myself part of that group because i i frankly was not there that often and an i was focussed on other things as i mentioned but but what came of that group was actually quite tragic not just for them but for a lot of other people they i eventually engaged that it was not a school shooting types in aria but they eventually set off explosives and on the school campus this was after they graduated i doftko where they are nowadays but things did not go well for them and they exerted a lot of a destruction to other people around them but before they did that there was this and of banding together around the the fact that they did not fit in that they and they were not bullied as i recall i could be wrong about this but have seen this another forms too if if you cannot meet the standard band up with other people and change the standard and then you do not feel as demoralized perhaps i can understand i can rationalize why this would be a reasonable approach but mi's seeing this more and more am ism also seeing by the way the other end of the spectrum people are overly aggressive and pleasure see kami in an things that sort but for the for the moment it'd liked your thoughts on how demoralization can split off into different expressions depending on how am people feel and who else they real aim to ye ye w think the place i would start it is to say our society rushes headlong forward in a way that causes our society to trample people who are vulnerable and vulnerable people are demoralized people demoralized people are vulnerable people and our society often tramples them and then they are not here with a sending longer and that is tragic but at times they do not get trample they get cast aside right they they there injured right and cast these and from that place tragic things happen right people then stay isolated now i think it is a tragedy that we do not all band together and go door to door right to seek people who who are not coming out of doors right in the sense of we let people be isolated and and often times that is that is the tragic end of some one's story right but sometimes people do engage right either demoralized but they can engage in in ways that involve an in affiliative defenses sometimes people who demoralized can affiliate they can band together in in ways as i think you are alluding to that can that can make things better if people are demoralized because say there i a group in society that that is chronically very mistreated right then it can be very powerful to band together both because there is what is called in affiliative defense that if i feel bad about myself about something and am alone it is highly likely continue feeling bad about myself about that thing right but if you feel bad about yourself about the same thing and then work together right we help each other feel better we do not feel lonely we do alone we don't feel isolated we do not feel ashamed right and if affiliative defense can help people to to say wittisich and i am not is nothing wrong with me and ism not in a take this lying down as other right and and and to make assertions that create better rights in the world around us split very good things can happen from from affiliation in the contacts of demoralization but very bad things can happen too right because people can also affiliate around things that are very destructive and if i am hateful of society and i would to be destructive and ism alone of i could do destructive things alone but if i band together with a couple other people who feel that way and now ism empower to feel that way right instead it maybe i feel that way and or o there's races and or prejudice n i do not feel at i i can say that right but then when it is permissive right because other people are i in the same place then people can accentuate that the hatred within within them e filiation is very very powerful and part of society rushing headlong forward an either trampling or marginalizing people is that we then do not pay attention not enough attention to what happens with the affiliative groups right how do you guide people towards towards being else affiliate in ways that are productive how do you give them routs of being productive right how do you try and protect against the ways that affiliation can lead to destructive behavior i think that you a lot miss these are the natural things that happen with in us but a lot of what we are talking about now gets impacted a lot by society and societal standards which we of course altogether determined right and arise from us but they are the start to to to transcend because it is now people interacting with a whole social system going back to the other end of the spectrum excess aggression in particular i was in a conversation with somebody recently very successful beyond most people's comprehension of successful financially successful and a seems to just a you checked off the their goals one one box at a time from from go a but who describe his a underlying psychology and emotional state as i one in which much of what he does on a dato day basis is driven by aggression in fact he i volunteered in anecdote about the fact that of he hates early morning meetings on fume but he chows up to them as sort of a alike an nephew toward somebody that might not even be on the meeting and o and there is a friction point for him that allows him to engage in a way that he would not otherwise be able to engage any he channels that towards productivity and clearly it is worked for him a i do not know if he is done the sort of introspective a deep dive i imagine no through the structure of self and function of self but what are we to make of of that sort of example i mean not i i the idea that if some one has a strong aggressive drive that they would channel it toward good i mean i no redo think this person is doing anything but good in the world for themselves an others certainly not harming any one at least not to mot to my knowledge but that seems a rough place to live for me it seems a rough place to live and at the same time it'll offer a very brief anecdote that at one point in my career namely when i was a postdoc i was in a position by virtue of having left a laboratory and the nature of the field at the time where the work i wanted to do was directly pitted against the work of another very powerful laboratory except that i was alone rootstock working in a laboratory e sensual my own on this probe and i remember going to my stock adviser the late ben barrios and saying i think it might just move to a different problem because i do not really want to go up against this foliate and he said a this is the best said you don't i can capture bends voice he said there absolutely not there is nowhere you love the stuff you have to do it because you love it and he kept telling me how much i love it and he reminded me that indeed i did love the questions and once i was able to tap back in to the love for in the curiosity around the questions i was able to push aside the the concerns enough that we did well am in publishing certain papers they did well but those five years frankly were a lot less pleasureful than they could have been i think because much of the script in my head was that i was in friction with this at least in my mind this oppressive force it was it was purely competitive and i truly believe that we cannot be at in our most creative state when we are competing was some one else by definition because then you are your our creating against a standard as supposed to draw creation i i in both cases a lot of aggressive drive frankly i i i have some of that and i had that i but a desire for revenge a a component of friction mixed in yo ignored were degraded with this unaggressive drive this picture even as i describe it is you now causing the release of a little ell but of a drank and it is it is not a comfortable state it is not it it cannot be a state of happiness right was yet people can do good in the world they can do not good in welly when i make a value judgment about what the person is doing because that is not what the question is about right wit cowardly feeling how are they doing right what is going on inside of them and that cannot be happy right that cannot be happy because if if if you are built to be pretty good at competition right you you can size up what are the factors you can stratagize way a prison is build to be really good at competition than it sounds pretty good to make everything a competition right because you have the highest winning percentage right and but that is that is good to achieve some end right that does not have any feeling intrinsically associated with it right and if all your doing is a series of competitions and what you are doing then is winning right an winning is something a winning is i want i beat you what it whatever that is i that that can be part of happiness but does not have to be right that that is not happiness right yes that kind of ism i'mreally built to compete well and ism going to just see a series of competitions in front of me that is it for for expedient forward progress right that is very effective but again expedient for progress is not it's nothing to do with pes contentment delay is it is it is not it is not anything to do with that nor dis anything to do with doing good or bad right and i think the example you gave in your own in your careers i it is such a good example right because now if you think about it when the way that you are a framing it inside is there is a question ism asking there is a question they are asking right and there is a competition right they are not has to be too too to compete right there is almost an aromaticity right that it the studying the same thing maybe they feel competitive or certain people there too they were we are in are definitely competitive they know who they are rather extremely o but and very successful look it then then you look come into competition now again but you never decided to be in a competition right but but automatically right it is interesting right to understand youyou'r acting s if yourein a competitions i do not want this competition right because the bigger than mes can be unpleasant is going to take you away from really thinking about what you want to do right is going to make it harder to do a good to do the job you want to do right is neither embroiled and something that is that has a egression behind it right you choose now i do not it i choose not to do that right and then then barrios frames it to the truth and says what this this in this is not a competition cause you are not choosing a compete right bet has been pointed out what was important to you was the questions right it is almost as if ben reminded it's not through the aggressive drive look at it through the genera t give drive that is what wins out in you right and then you go and apply yourself to it now and bless him for doing it because out from that point forward i have made it my ism firm mission to always do things from a place of what i was think about as delight curiosity delight that the things that give me energy and that give me more energy from doing them ism it was not e coincidence i believe that in those five years when i was operating from a mix of generative drive and the the competition would then resurface and at i i could not hold hold it constant that ism i was absolutely exhausted by the end of that phase i just in a way that ism sucked a lot of the pleasure out of it i still drive some pleasure but then as i mention fortunately i was able to i pivot back to doing things out of love and and and getting back to a piece contentment and especially delight right now right and i absolutely make a value judgment about that right that what you did is better right what if you did what if you were different thing but if we talk about it through this accurate lends what if you were different at that time and the aggressive driven you was greater than the generative driving you right we should be an unhealthy state to be and but let us say you were in that unhealthy state then you probably would have still done what you did but you would have done it through the lends of aggression aging to get that right are competitive with them there is there is anger in you there is there there is a egression right that you are you are enacting in fantasy as you are you are thinking about them and ow you are going to win all sorts of things go on insidelass and i would say there is no way on earth you could have done the science as well as you did right it could not be because all that stuff is distracting right it see ow that kind of negative e affect pools for energy in time from you and also what seeds would you have planted in the the microcosm that you operate and it more more competition right more competitions more badness right lis took t what you did do right because your healthy or this particular question about this particular thing we know for sure because your generative drive eclipses the aggressive drive then you set yourself to the work in a way that is can t be more effective right your brain is not landed you are not wasting energy we know plotting some revenge or plotting what you are going to do if they come o take something from your laving whatever it is you only you are not living in any of that is you can do a better job at what your what important to you to do and what seeds are you sewing then right youyour sewing seeds of collaboration right and even then if some one could say well what is even that matter rights it to does not matter because what you are doing then we just fallow for the math of it right is is contributing to understanding that is contributing to human health right and the better understanding we have of human health the more people say alive and the more people say healthy which could mean any one of us just any one of us could be the vulnerable person that society tramples or cast aside we all have it in us to be that or have been that at stages of our lives right we also all have it in us to be the opposite of that right we have it in us to be generative we have it in us to make good we have it in us to contribute to health to survival and that i place o value judgment upon it is why doing good is better than doing bat why creating is better than destroying and why ultimately is the generative drive that has to trump the other drives and when it does were happy we are healthy we make the world a better place we lie with and are suffused with the gratitude and agency in us are fully active and were suffused with peace content meant to delight as you said that is the place to be from that place we get this thing that we want and we help to make the world a better place which helps us to keep the thing we want it is sounds simple because as you pointed out the manifestations of looking at the right things and doing the right things are simple yes right it is it is list really and again we have a it f that includes this list and and the the structure of of the pillars and how they flow up to this list but ultimately it is peace contentment and delight undergirded by agency and gratitude as active terms something very simple at some level and yet for many people inched myself at certain times in life the the excess or were a lack of aggressive drive were excess or lack of pleasure drive can interfere with people's ability to access these these simple but incredibly powerful inbeing states use it is nature and nurture right you might be built with a greater or lesser natural amount of one drive than i am right with the we have had life experience that creates a delta around them right we say ora were built with different amounts of all these drives yes yes we are right but we also have control right through our decisions to how we handle our lives to modulate them right that make sense cause the thought be will the drive is with the drive is and it varies across people no there is arrange the drive is in and that range can be very broad on people can do all sorts of things to cultivate cultivate the better we all can right if we look at it as an unlimited upside right than what we what we sees i want to know where they at in me now right what is going on inside of me what are all those other factors right because i want to cultivate the good when t cultivate that generative drives and i want to make sure the aggression and the pleasure are and out balance one way or another light we can actively look at that and manage it and i think that is looks what we are striving for because there is nothing here that we do not have some control over right and the higher we get up we the simpler it gets the more we have control over and for people who feel the the ideals that were providing a road map toward are not accessible for whatever reason may be h feeling a little bit or a lot demoralized a overly aggressive and not ending up where they want to go or ending up where they want to go and not experiencing deep satisfaction piece contentment and delight where should they look in this frame work that includes these pillars that the deep levels of structure of self function of self that y am give rise to empowerment humility agents see gratitude peace contentment to you if some one should find themselves unmotivated or for stock a metaphorically speaking staring out the window into the garden that could be and that they want very much but thatched are not creating again that should translate to whatever domain of life it your you are seeking are not even in touch with what you really want youinfinitely confused about what to do and relationships school work life and and thinking about all the oppressive forces in the world the political chasm and pandemics and lock downs and and all the stuff and all the things that are waiting down on us a what should that person another is what should we all do at that moment you no stop and what each pillar has five cupboards look in all five and follow the clues that you find there that is the answer go back to structure of self function of self ask questions about and engage in practices that bring about more self awareness practices that i draw our attention to what salient for us ask ourselves you knowwhat am i thinking about internally what is my internal script what it what am my focussing on externally you no m am i spending all day on twitter looking at accounts that i know i hate because it activate something in me et center et camera i might have revealed something about myself ism just getting that is not my my beeverybut i see a lot of other people doing it ow what are my behavioral choices on what could bring about more hopefulness and strivings not have that righting this tennis much of this as say one could do on one's own right we can think about ourselves hen we can learn things if we say i do notrealy know that much about defense mechanisms call we call read about it rightly we can do a lot of this on our own and we can get much from talking other people people in our lives who are close to us who love us right we can talk with them about what is going on inside of us and that is such an amazing mechanism of learning and they are also professional resources i mean the good therapyshould encompass that this should be what it is doing right it might come out through one lands or another lands and you know cause everyeverybody's different if we can ring different modalities but ultimately that is what good there is doing right it is looking in all ten of those cupboards and its seeing where is the issue let us follow the clues likest is a spirited inquiry right whether we are doing it on our own or we are doing it with other people in our personal lives o we are doing it with some one professionally it is a spirited inquiry to follow the clues because if we follow the clues there are answers right and if we have the answers then we can bring things into better linemen and then we are in a better place that pillows or more stable and we can build on top of them what we want to build on top of them and the drives come better into line that that we can do that and the can be in iterative process of if if we we tain some better state of mind and life is better and we are happy this happens to people is a lot of contentment an peace and if things are going well and now something is not as much go back and look again right it is it is a process we can use over and over because it works because it fits with the truths an the reality is as we have understood learn them in or education the the the just learning about humans thatacross hundreds of years tells us this it makes very good sense to me in the way that you have mapped it out for us much sense in fact that am just struck by how divergent it is from what i think most people think of when they think of therapy or the some of the risks of going to a psychiatrist m which i think it is only fair to consider in particular the way that am least from my outside non clinical understanding a these sorts of situations of high levels of demoralization or excessive aggression or just people not being in the place or being able to exert their they were am the actions in the world the way they want or not get the results they want is they will start asking questions a maybe have a chemical and balance or maybe they will go to a finish and maybe a corny of behavioral therapist or am or psychiatrist and more often than not it seems they will get in all prescription for next number of milligrams of som pseratonergic agonist or a dopominergic agonist and of course as an radiologists i i know i applaud the exploration of underlying brain mechanisms and the evolvement of narmodulators dooming and say atonal but what you are describing today is is very different i i think then am what most people a can expect if they go to the typical psychiatrist or typical a psychologist which is par the reason were having this conversation but a i love your thoughts on that am and i do not want to make this about me i only offer this anecdote as am away to round out a little bit of their earlier discussion it'll never shared this publicly but when i was a pooch in going through that very hard phase of comcompetition that i did not want and having a hard times staying in touch with that and there were some other developmental things trying to resurface just by virtue of moving back to the town i grew p bin et camera there i recall getting to the stairway of the building i was working and the time which is the same one where my laboratory exists now actually and realizing i i couldn't go up the stairway i have always been reasonably fit and just being exhausted and then driving home that day on two eighty in thinking non as matters what a mi doing think none of it matters i could have been exhausted i do not know what it was but what that ultimately result and was me talking to a psychiatric who gave me a loose of a of a of a seratonergic ant i depressing i took that loose of seratonerga anta depress i don't recall which one it was maybe was the telegram with that my sense and spent that evening staring at my plate of tie noodles for about two hours it hit me really hard and and i hated that feeling and that just stop taking the drug u now ism not this is no knock on setalepram or the use of seratonurgigagions in the proper contacts they have saved lives o the the problematic too but i just that was not the route that eventually got me out of it it was it was mainly talk therapy and and self care but i i just off fer that because i i even as an exobiologist i perhaps especially as aneurobile just i thought get here is the solution i it is going to shift some internal modulatory system and ism an feel we about the situation ism in and thank goodness it did not work even for a short while because the while i did not do all the things that you are describing here of exploring the function of self because nods ever laid this out for me i i took the route of a talk therapy which i fined immensely a beneficial takes time but immensely beneficial what are your thoughts on the current stages for diagnosis a where those succeed where they fall short and in the role of medication in navigating this simple and yet can plea landscape we are dramatically over reductionist it is almost to the point of unbelievable right think about getting a medicine getting some say telegram because of what happened right it cannot possibly work right now maybe a judiciously chosen medicine could provide a little more distress tolerance and you could to think about it more and you could find your way through it but clearly it was an issue myself right your in a situation that was hi stradicineywhere you can have to have this competition or not as it can be good for you and youyou do not want that but can you avoid it there is something going on that makes you not be able to walk up those stairs right that you am not criticizing futon with the person what kind of conversations you had about it with is but the idea that a pilbile fix that is that is insane right now medicines can help smooth the way let us say you you initially wen in the first time you see some one n they look it with to talk about this refer was going on in your life and you know as normally you can walk upstairs and go to work right why cannot you now we we need to think about that when you talk about that let us say start doing that n your having lot of trouble with it a where just having really high levels of anxiety we might see look an medicine can can't take the temperature down a little bit give you little more distress tolerance and then we can you can think about it better inside of you and we can talk about it better but it is medicine in the service of understanding now sometimes medicines are doing things medicines that can not but prevent by dollar episodes rightly that the their doing something that is purely biological but we you many medicines for things that are not biological their psychological but we we are over reductionists that we could actually over reduce the problem that you sat right a clear while that is fascinating right how many times have you gone up those stairs and now you cannot it is interesting t idea a missive you pill i mean it really makes no sense but if we are over reduction is enough you could see how that is the logical endpoint of an illogical process right i me bet another example and is really a true story of a a woman who young woman comes into the emergency room and says she cannot sleep and ow she looks anxious and she feels very very anxious a your by her description that is why she cannot sleep and and she gets a sleeping medicine an she goes home and then she comes back back couple o days later and she is very very anxious and she cannot sleep and she looks she did before or nothing seems to be different and she has not gotten any sleep it also the doctor in charge gives her a hiredose of the sleeping medicine then she goes home and then she comes back yet again and nothing is any different she is still not sleeping she is still anxious and then the doctor concludes that she is drug seeking because she wants more and more of the sleeping medicine my was actually going on was she is getting hurt at home she is terrified to go home of course she could not sleep rightly bad thinks we are happening right but no one asked the question right they thought she cannot sleep well give sleeping medicine it instead of asking why right and then she gets home job send home and when the medicine does not work well now there is something wrong with her right and if you put that label on her now she is drug seeking right than she is not going to get any help right ism not against medicines i mean i i use psycho form a collogues part of my practise and i think from a from a biologically base perspective about many things but lowlife to know what something is the answer for and what is o think is not they answer for and in in the overly reductions world of through put and in healthcare systems people are evening trained these days that do not know any different right i am try to be overly critical of practitioners was often practitioners are working in impose bible situations where the goal is throw through put and that is more efficient in the short term right is more efficient today but it is of course not good in anything but the to day term and it is interesting u it is never good for the person even today it is never good for the people in it right but but often these decisions are being made it base upon business and money and i understand business an money a an ism a capitalist's interested in these things but the way that we have let things get the business and money with a short sighted the short term perspective than bonds with the over reductionists ways that we approach medicine and then we have these bizarre things happen and these kind of bizarre things and lives right change the courses of lives fortunately you you know you got you would got what you needed and you figured things out but if you had not would you have the career you have looking we do not know right or if if some one else had not realized let us talk to that woman and see what is going on they which would she have survive and we do not we do not know but h the point of that is lots of bad things happen right is we are rolling the dice too many times with too many people and it does not have to be that way and the way that we are doing it now is not only inefficient you financially write the thing the we seem to be carrying about most it leads to bad outcomes and it also makes no sense i were looking at it through the sort of bizarre lends then we may find within us the strength to change that and to change it in way that actually fits the science and fits the common sense i have to imagine that both for people who require medication in order to cope am in order to manage their way through these questions about function myself and how they are in the world what their paying attention to et camera and for people who do not require medication to do this exploration that this very same exploration is the road map to feeling yes agency gratitude peace can sentiment than delight medicines may have a role if for example we got look at the pillars and thinks here not going well and an you see that whenever that person has a bipolar manic episode while things get really really damaged and et it is very very hard that they cannot recover from that in the ways they want to the we sit let us kudus medicine to help this right now of course their other things too use behavior of changes for example right but there is but there is a clear by a logical role just were medicine to stop seizures right be people also have to make sure the not superslep deprive there is another part to it too we can use medicine to prevent by dollar episodes but there is another part of self care involve too but it is it is a role of medicine right just as if anxiety levels are not coming down too much safe for the person to get at the drama right they know there is a drama they have talked around it for twenty years they know it is been impacting them they are not sure how it is hard to go there there with a trusted therapist but it is still and to put words to it and now the may be have in a panic attack right in the locates we can use medicines to take the temperature down to to suit of e you ease that persons awful word that they can understand something right that then provides o resolution in that part of the pillar and then the ow things are set in a better place the biological aspect specifically where were talking about medicines has its place but the idea that medicines are a substitute for understanding makes a sense well you have provided us an incredible framework thank you this framework really speaks to all of us it you known that the components that make us who we are yon the does you what it the structure of the self everything from the unconscious mind conscious my defense mechanism's character structureerself and the functions of self you on these components of self awareness defense mechanism's reaching up from that iceberg under the water what we pay attention to our behavior rs and hole are strivings and sense of hope and how those two pillars flow up into empowerment humility agency and gratitude again as action terms as active terms and eventually to peace contentment and delight in this notion of generative drive as well as some of the pitfalls and and a challenges that can pull down on generative drive a a clue generative drive and you very clearly pointed us to where we should all look in terms of understanding ourselves better and where we could do better and be better in the world because this is a series we have the wonderful opportunity to i have you tell us even more about how this structure plays out both in terms of its healthy expression and in terms of its unhealthy expression know indifferent a pathologic conditions that most of us are familiar with at least in name and and i am sure you are going to tell us more about no what the what the real i both under winnings and expressions of things narcissism and in no extreme and mild form am anxiety in its extreme and mild forms and an also some of the a the names and diagnoses that were more familiar with hearing about such as by pol or disorder obsessive compulsive things of that sort a but that all relate back to and and really are nested in this structure and function of self and where it can all go am first wall i want to say and thank you really an immense thank you for for welcome for defining the structure and making it clear to to me into everybody else and and as you said it it has its complexity there is in fact immense complex down there at the bottom but that flows up from complex to to very simple ideals and an a rode map to get there and again the pediopis available to people as as a link in the shown captions should they want to see this in visual form i also want to thank you for assembling the structure not just as a tutorial but beau s at least to my knowledge no such structure were summary of these structures it exists anywhere in the world and certainly not in any form that the the inclination and not highly trained psychiatric i could ever act as or

plan that is why is it that on campus there is such a thing as queers for palestine where is that coming from they hate america and they hate the west that is the common thread uniting radical college students with terrorist members of comose it is why we see marches by queers for palestine despite the fact that queers would be summarily murdered in any palestine their difference is do not matter they are in the words of radical revolutionary author fhronsfinon the wretched of the earth rising up to smite the hierarchies of power in nineteen sixty one fronzsfant on a black radical member of the aljeurian national abrasion front put forth a shockingly violent treats calling for the revolution of the colonized pointing out the evils of colonial ad ministration phanotron merely called for an end two colonialism la goody instead he called for violent which he sized purifying in all of its varied forms his book the wretched of the earth posited that revolutionary violence would usher in the new man free of the evils of the west decolonization he wrote is always a violent mend de colonization he wrote which sets out to change the order of the world is clearly in agenda for total disorder in its reality fenonwrote de colonization reeks of red hot cannonballs and bloody knives violence disorder bloody knife that is the essence a lion's decolonization the colonize must take everything from the colonizers in the name of restoring himself as a human being final rights quote the gaze that the colonized subject casts at the colonists sector is a look of lust a look of envy dreams of possession every type of possession of sitting at the colonist's table and sleeping in his bed preferably with his wife the colonized man is an envious man colonialism he says justified any response in fact it requires any response the west must be destroyed for the west has colonize quote when the colonized your speech on western culture they draw the michettis or at lease checked to see they are close at hand fanon says sachater of colonial power was at least somewhat understand and algeria but felon was not making the case for revolutionary violence merely in algeria he is action making the case for revolutionary violence pretty much everywhere the person who made that clear was existentialist and market john pulsar the wrenching electoral star's introductions o finds wretched of the earth makes the case not only that the colonize have an ultimate rights violence but that the entire west must be collapsed from within for its great sins violence says sorta quote is man reconstructing himself killing a european is killing two birds with one stone eliminating in one go oppressed and oppress leaving one man dead and the other man free the only honorable thing for the west to do is drown in on its cultural suicide quote you who are liberal human who take the love of culture to the point of affectation you pretend to forget that you have colonies where massacres are committed in your name sorta wrights fanon reveals to his comrades especially to those who remain a little too westernized the solidarity of the metropolitan with there colonial actions sorta says that he has carried canons quote dialectic through to its conclusion we too peoples of rope we are being decolonized meaning the colonist inside every one of us is surgically extracted in a bloody operation we must all recognize that we are complicit in quote a one thousand year old oppression our beloved values are losing their features if you take a closer look there's not one that is in tainted with blood how do we recover by joining in on the violence against our own civilization violence says sorta a killer's spear can heal the wounds it has inflicted who can we tell who are enemies are well we simply attack the powerful the colonizers are the powerful the colonize are the powerless therefore the powerful must be colonizers and the powerless their victims this is mantra's logic this is for example how israel the ultimate case of decolonization a cross human history after the turn of a native population to its homeland and it is battle to throw off the shackles of the brutish mandate be came today's hottest quote decolonization cause mantra's radical call has been taken up operatically both at home and abroad as critical theorists home baba points out in his forward to final's book the black panthers found inspiration in felon did the arronian revolutionaries who ended with the rise of the mullahs those revolutionaries transmuted finds distinction between oppressed and oppress into a distinction between the arrogant and the weaken translating finance marksist tinged radicalism into radical islamism but the coalition of finds wretched of the earth could not materialize until the generation of sorta came to full maturity until the institutions of the west poisoned themselves slowly with the imbecilic toicidality of weakness the west remain strong enough to fend off the radical lines when it face down t movie union but then it could not send up for itself and i began to fall fast ford sixty years from sorta and tartar's radicalism has now become a mass movement a movement uniting commas and campus radicals the far left and the terrorist coral west the black marks radical calls finoncualt the greatest revolutionary intellectual of the mid twentieth century according to west he compels us to acknowledge colonialism is a sustained barbaric war waged against colonized people sanctioned by western values what is more colonialism us

armanarm toward the destruction of the west and in particular the united states after all the united states even according to final i nineteen sixty one had become the chief colonizer thanks to its power quote two centuries ago a former european colony decided to catch up with rope it succeeded well that the united states become a monster in which the trains the sickness inhumanity of rope have grown to hauling dimensions in quote the alliance to destroy the west spans the globe and its right carat home to threatening everything we stand for fifty colonization is merely a codeword for attacking we powerful and the systems that supposedly sustain them then queers for palestine begins to make a lot of cents that is why the same people caterwauling over the use of the wrong pronoun

students to cooper union stuck in the lib bray as procomas protestors pounded on the door and i the people outside or chancing free palestine but then trying to bang it open the doors to to apparently get at the jaws again antizianism at rearing snugly head as antisemitism over at the universe of washington shall they held themselves a procomas rally where they extolled the virtues of people who merge us i we noon h rot to o saw we o team we a we e in there they are just a here just saying the thing right we do not want is true toexxsist we do not want these people to exist while i mean saying the qua hart out loud i is is par for the corse around here over at princedom people were shouting long live the intifada the invade is a violent uprising thiswhut an in to fade is they are not just calling for a two state solution that is a lie anybody who says long live the ins fad what they mean is violent attar one's villains that what the intifada is here are protestors an princton doing this again these are america stop universities over at gorge washington university students the other night de coded they would project pro comaslogans on to the walls of various buildings one said free palestine from the river to the see which of course is they call for genocide it is one of the slogans of compass palsingan islamac gehadan palsinan authority the river o the see would be the golden river and the mediterranean see that means the extermination every new in that region this was projected on the all over gorge at washington an just in case they worn clear enough they also projected these slogan glory to our martyrs the martyrs would be know members of compass who are raping children hard tat they broke their palaces that is from medical reports on the ground over there an thee these are these are the genius students who either our onstage vena which means the should expel them if you have a studenviza and your in the united states that is not give you the rights two b a terror supporter we have no obligation to extend our hand open to you as america if you support terrogroups none at all you should leave and should leave forthwith he should go hang out with your terrors bodies elsewhere hit is it is absolutely insane they universities have have become this the a the gorge the gorge washington university administration i they put out a statements in the after math of this student for justice in palestine and group that has now been band in the state of flora for supporting terrorism soon for just in palatine claimed credit for all of this they also put to a statement saying quote these events have only reaffirmed what every passing yon knows deeply we will see a liberate palestine within our lifetime the settler colony will fall our land will be liberated we will return to our homes again palestine will be free from the river toe see again there you see that language of fanon the settler colony the settler colony then again everybody sort of understands why radical is lamas one destroy is real in kill the gets the questing has always been why queers for palestine why the why thy fellow travellers in the answer is when you build a coalition that is explicitly design tor tear away at the west and israel is an element of that coalition the alliance rides again that is why the demonstration by the way also attack the university administration and then none the university put out a pretty weak statements suggesting that they they were unhappy with all of this but the statements have quote on tuesday evening universally became aware of several unauthorized projections on a caps building the projections on the university's library violate university policy leadership in terpene to ensure these projections were moved the statements made by the individuals and noway reflect the views of the university reviewing this incident and will take any appropriate steps we recognized the distress certain pain this has caused from many members of our committed welt than thank for your vague statement lava of support really really much appreciated but again nobody's hiding the ball o her barely protestors openly say they support comose here is one of them on ooutefedy going rest gay everything is going prubblut by by thewy its not just the student body it is many many members of faculty an america top universities

see ethnic studies faculty council were a letter to all of the university of californium board of regions first of all professionally useless people ethnic studies to apartments a garbage full careful stop their garbage but they were a letter and em they am say in the strongest possible terms the you see ethnic studies faculty council as he receive californium and averse state we body representing over three hundred faculty system wide rejects recent u see administrate of communications that distort and is represent the unfolding genocide of palisinians and gaze and hereby contributed to the racists and dehumanizing e retire of palistinian daily reality in light of the history an statements by the us regions demonizing the boycott vestment and sanctions movement and other forms of palistinian solidarity we have no confident the we administration comprehends or respects it is obligations it is deeply distressing the u see and other higher institutions ad ministrative statements in last week an a half that irresponsibly weed charges of terrorism and unprovoked aggression have contributed to a climate the is made palicinans dents and community members on safe get the this the the big lie ism not merely enjoying the big live that the people who really feel on safe on campion these days are obviously the procomas protestors are marching on mass through campuses and threatening people by t way how pathetic are our university students there pathetic the tobrandized university which was founded by the america jewfish community etbrandi's university student leaders voted ten to six not to condemn comose not to condemcomoss yo only con a senior at the university said that he stands with palisinians but this is still about condemning extremist organization but he was that in the minority amazing stuffed there from brands again this is a group of young highly educated usually upper class students who are fully in lee with the ideology of terrorism because commossageus part of the violent coalition to tear down i civilizations they have to stand by the buddies and and what that means is that also there is a sense of tremendous entitlement from these folks they are entitled to a job from you there entitled to your tax pared outs they are entitled to your support proudest example this that have seen over the past few years is a personated hint workmen china workmen is a a member of the and why you student council in fact a china workman is the m student the the and why you playschools student bar association presidents she is caught on camera to facing posters of cannabis rallies i this is this something that has become unbelievably comment and and pretty shocking because these are just posters of people who are literally being held hostage by terrorist group and pro compass people you cannot call these pro palcinian people because this has nothing to do with with being propalistinian people i mean if it does then i think you are getting the issuewrong they are literally tearing down posters of of kidnap children or to face them here is china workmen doing just that a tie that at it of i the a ma are e re e the i it to to i the ate doing to i prion very i what a sciatic si ho a ut to everything er single the whet r the doing to the over is hoses it is t o does i and tum and of course she had nothing to say shes just standing the of worst he is not giving her name while she had her her job at a law form reminded because it turns out the law from do not to employ terror sympathizers it is not is note their biggest thing what is that mean one means it is time for the media to jump in and finally talk about freespeech on college camps as won that is amazing when speakers me get band from made to pal university that is not national news it is definitely national news when you do not get a job being a terror sympathizer that is really the issue here is a b c news covering china workmen i mean the the sense of absolute entitlement from these privileged patty pathetic left wingers who again are in league with the condo quit wretched of the earthborn find it is it is really it is quite disgusting and people should realize how revolutionary the implications are here is china workmen declaring that not only is she entitle to tear down posters of canna children she is entitle to a job from you and you do not give it to her it is because your discriminatory if you were to real to the latter avidly with the benefit of hind sight anything you would've done differently i think i ill continue to speak up for parson in human rites and use whatever platform i have available to me to call for it's fire and in this occupation that is harming the palesinians i ma just try one more time won't you change anything even the timing of it because some people thought it was too soon because your letter came the for israel even launch any kind of retaliation i think it is important to note that the genocide happening right now did not start on october seven its started over seventy five years ago and that was what my message was intended to get across was that we are seeing violence happening that is part of a much larger a structural violence a system that is happening and palestine right now do you condamnstructural violence on that is is that say haves a settler lo know ma at what i use my platform for and who i condemn was pretty clear by my message and i think that i will continue to condemnapartide and military occupation and that in this moment ism for know that is not calling for an intigenicide and calling for an immediately fire do you think in the space that were in right now there is room to have empathy for the israilies who lost their lives who were brutalized were raped and also empathy for the palestinians who are similarly losing their lives yet i think right now if you turn on any mainstream channel you will see the stories of this relies on every screen you look to and i think for me i will continue t use my platform to uplift the voices of palestinians and the struggles there going through because but now we have me a thesis is the whole thing in one you lost the nothing the china workmen mean pass of their ring workmen uses the them pronouns china workmen considers herself obviously woman considers herself to be a member of queers for a liberated palestine and that is what this is that is hat this is she put out a statement be for is real actually did anything condemning israel for the dead jaws that is what she did why begun again it is part of the broader rubric of marginalized of the earth unite and tear down at the corneal colonizes but colonizers they just mean anybody who has power the the power is is gotten usefully or not whether the powerful a moral or other night does not matter it dis not matter as long as you are a member of quoin that marginalized community it is the coalition to destroy the systems the really matters a mad should scare everybody because that is a lot of your kids that is a lot of people that your your kids are going to school with a college compasses that is a rising movement on the left and it is very strong it is not a tiny minority on college compasses there is a reason why you can barely get fifty per cent of young people in the united states to say the compose derris group there is reason for that and that is not that that is on israel issue that is a west issue west as a serious serious proton means the get's o more of this momentarily first the october fifteenth tax deadline has just

literally defending re hiring a free lands writer who praise title not kitting you according to wish new service palsinian fill maker sully on hes who has posted on social media of being in a state of harmony as hitter was during the holiest and wrote how great you are hitter has been re hired by the we york times he free lands further your times from twenty eighteen until twenty twenty one and since october twelfth he is had nine bylines he is he writing forth your times again amazing the new york times they said we receive we roof you problematic social mediapost by hes when they first cans late twenty twenty two and to a variety of actions to ensure he understood our concerns and could not here to our standards oh you mean the standards of not being a hitter supporter or the standards of being a hitter supporter or islands on genocide in your times was the first time around and there is blood up in the media and then the way that the media do this in a soft or fashion is they just set up this this full scale moral equivalents they pretend that you do not sexually have a moral obligation to take sides in a battle between genicitle terrorist and legitimate states the your times put on entire opinion video pies saying you do not have to take sides there is nothing there is nothing that suggest yet to take sides against terror groups that that burn babies alive there is nothing that suggest that there is then your times putting out o full scale opinion video it quoting he's really advocates with commons advocates to making stuff your human you on a it win no quite an your silent damn you got i de e are you can sit her a i do support beer side what is your opinion on the worn title east ism afraid ism can act insist on an answer there are work rating all across our small planet but to day there only required to take a stand on on compassion for humanity is a good thing what about the for than three hundred thousand people o died i yearuptly sixty thousand who disappeared in n t the rock think about the ran what has just been beware doing to tall the crises in a rely to tat stand on the or by the way there there there bunch of these conflicts that people do have opinions about by a lot of them the that that the sutler grows there grow suddenly suddenlyeven your time to send your next have a moral opinion on the stuff in your times spends its days asking every single republican if a publican makes a bad comment anywhere ever republican must now have an opinion on that thing they apparently only one issue where you do not have to have an opinion according to the car times and that happens to be where museums are murdering chows on massing calling for their extermination when that happens suddenly than your times goes full on well there are other things happening in the world again many of the conflicts of they mention right there you should have an opinion on you should have an opinion on the chines government keeping museums in concentration camps in crinum must have express that opinion many many time by the way t the dead in your time seen to you have to have an opinion on you train horses russia in saying than your times been pushing that for years of this point but again the moral equivocation is just cover for terrorism that is all it is it is its pair cover for terrorism give you latest on the ground right now in israel right now the is valley's last night perform their largest ground assault since the beginning of this particular round a conflict since comber seventh they sent him thanks in to areas in the northern gssisstrip they m it was a limited raid ahead of any sort of potential ground offensive there are lot of rumors the bison has been trying to convince these release to delay the ground offensive israel for its own part is still kind of deciding when it wishes to go what it wishes to do and all the rest the the suggestion was that bison wanted a delays that the united states could get more defensive weapon rein place to protect our troops abroad which by the way we should have had originally except the jobidon was too busy playing nice and playing footy with the molas to actually defend our troops that happens to be the case even now but here is join yesterday saying that he did not call for i delay on a ground invasion have you sought assurances from him that he will hold off on the ground radiation in the cause a instill the safe relief release of the hostages can be assured of course there is included a ten on alit for america no but i have to e citing is i that is possible to get the forks ha safely that tradition though is this decision but i did not demand i e out i if it is reel it should you done now to his credit bison was asked about the the numbers from the gossip tripping said you not weregettim all those numbers from commons i take therewith the grand assault which you don't good for him for a rally saying this since the administration has far not really done that if i may very quickly in the eighteen days in mama gamma killed fourteen hundred it is daily the hammy controlled god tat health ministry says his daily forms have killed over six thousand palpitant ins including twenty seven hundred chill children you previously ask nantinahodin mini sivilliing casual teens do you these number sati you that he is ignoring that message e e say me that no notion of u cubit homenei'm sure in cenmencu and is reason basin war i thin we so e been cur i in not we our o see cur to be sure e to i o going a her o sea u properer or a sister and e and is against her the man mat but i have no colon mean shows to a get imbedded in that is is robin's usual garbage bat how is real has to be careful about villincashels you really have to warn the asrailays what we talk to ut yesterday on the so meanwhile biding is trying to figure u exactly what to do wit the fact that a on is getting very very spicy with regard to america in the region according to the washington pose president bison fix s mounting pressure to strike iron in proxies that have re heatedly an intact and injured you just troops in a rock and syria this month but he is saying any decision for ataxia against has brought concern that the warn music could be on the precipice of erupting into a region why tempest what if the truth is the thing the will keep it from erupting into a region by tempest is if the united states makes clear that if you injure our troops we will stump on you a fly i that that historically has been the america way of doing business in these places and that has in fact worked when when america troops are attack the only way to push people off of doing that is to make it very car to them that if they do that that in their body die hardhat there is a reason that dona trump to this exactly right when he was the president of the united states if there wareatacks on america troops on from responded in kind and he did with alacrity it was was down tremble pull the trigger on cossemsolly in and who is totally correct to do that concerning the telling money help plan the death of thousands of america troops in a rock bydintown wednesday that he wasn't i tola alicamany the on supreme leader that if heron continues to move against you us force in the mat least we will respond but far there really has been note response yet and it is that sort of lack of clarity that is leading to an escalation obviously now it it makes some sense that if there is going to be a base of attack iron in inserted group that it is using a a a basefattac merger attack america droning them to death pul would probably be a proper solution for all of that meanwhile by thewy the by administration just let in the uranium foreign minister to the

wire dot cold slashed subscribed right now says streaming the next generation of kids entertainment of him meanwhile finally some good news for re publicans apparently re publicans last night they decided you stop kicking himself directly in the lads and instead they decided to actually vote in favor of make johns to make johns somebody that i would take most of america had not heard of ever he was only elected to congress fairly recently hes a mean in congress all that long he is a a congressman from louisiana according to politico his e unanimity in washington was the driving force in his election as speaker because he had not made any enemies yet he became the unlikely leader of an unruly group of house re publicans will now rely on him to run their side o the capital he was next to no ones first pick but again everybody else had a high profile and that men that he was the guy who can a sneaking under the radar now johns must figure how to cheese ut my earthy could not compromise that does not prompt mutiny now he is ganhaven easier time with that the reason's can even ease your time with that than my earthy did is because he is not name cove my earthy seriously that it is that simple mandates and a few of his crew decided they hate hi my earthy and that went is that any compromised the c earthy count was going to be seen as treason by gates an company and used as an excuse to get rid of my earthy well now johns is gin a coming he is going to do kind of exactly what my earthy did because the incentive structure is precisely the same to taken example my earthy just cut a continuing resolution he out it with some democrats the reason he had to do that is because beget a better continuing resolution deal there was scuttle by gates in company ten after my earthy actually did the continuing resolution to fun the government that is when he was lasted by gates in company well now ma johnsons going t codein an you he is proposing continuing resolutions the same sort of stuff now he can pass a bunch of single issue bills supposedly passed the appropriations bills do the process an all that but democratsigon a rejected an is given come back to doing contusing resolution now the thing is that because gates outside my earthy and because johns is the new speaker he has an incentive gates does in making johns appeared to be better than my earthy which means tithe is not going to yelling scream about any deal that johns cuts inherently johns has more lee way to cut deals and make deals than my earthy did mainly because all the people who would be incentivize to get rid of somebody for the publicity already did that as they cannot do it again they have to play this as though they they chiefdom for mass of win by substituting johns for my earthy andnagain the policy is in a come out almost exactly the same it is can be very very very similar now the fact is that johns has a topless experience the my earthy in the space t again is not a rip on johns johnson's great ism to go through his opening speech in a second when he when he won thespeakership an it is excellent is really really really good i i happen ta resonate to an enormous amount of what johns says as a speaker i think he is way more appealing then then cam my earthy was however the speaker the house is job he is not just to be a a a person who speaks well and a person who communicates while the speaker o the house essentially has several jobs one is to ya speak well and and maintain policy positions but the can a bigger aspects are vote counting vote whipping rewarding allies and punishing animes getting together our polish an actually do things and you cures a lot of back scratching requires a lot of maneuvering requires the can a mock clean stuff that my earthy was actual pretty good at i do not now if johns has a lot of experience that maybes great at it we do not know he is never done it before the speaker also suppose to fund rays for pretty much all the re publicans across the board my earthy over the course of his time in house leadership raised almost half a billion dollars for various house re publican candidates including many of the same people who then ousted him mike johns in last election cycle yuan expect him rays tens millions dollars he is brought one guy running in an uncontested districts in liana mike johns in his last election cycle raised one point three million dollars can he trains late that over in's raising hundreds of millions of dollars for fellow candidates my earthy when recruited a bunch of candidates in purple districts johns has not really done that yet again he is enough to prove that he can do all of the hard nosed things the my earthy could do and there is a lot of parliamentary procedure being speaker o the house is telling anybody can just walk in the front door and suddenly transform the place if you do not file a bifid to proper time the my cats could sneak in the could flip the billion it they are really are a lot of procedural complexes don johns made very well beagle to handle it we just do not know hit the the notion that that things are gin ta radically change in the house now that its johns as opposed to my earthy is really silly nit again none of that is a rip on johns it is a rip on gatesontim the idea that the caissons he achieves some sort of massive material victory by throwing the house to full on chaos for three weeks in demonstrating the fractiousness an idiocy of of part their publican caucus i do not buy it i do not see it and tat that is without reference to what happens going ford with with johns in here are a few things about mike johns that are a kind of aurum mike johns very very socially conservative his a ninety per cent lifetime rating from heritage action ninety two per cent from the america conservative union he is very much in favor of cutting spending which is something by the way lot of magnate are not really big in favor of the count dispensing depending on who they are his very strong on abortion extremely proline has an plus rating from the sudan b anchovy proline america group he is to work as the senior legal council for the alliance defense fund and a he is anti same sex marriage for example he has been historically which by the way is he historically correct his inion of the re publican party and a man and a woman our marriage and that any other form of human relationship is not the same u morally or sociologically he he was involved in the attempts to to stall fortification of the election post twenty twenty and this is being used as a club by democrats already he devised in argument does actually the only good argument that's made in the aftermath of nonmember seventh which is a century the lot of states pennsylvania had unilaterally shifted their voting laws as to benefit democrats in ways that were legal that was the only good legal argument that was made during that entire spectacle johns was one making those arguments and he send some stuff during that time that frankly is ridiculous are he he called in to question the voting systems inside even is waylaid old of sing well kind of stuff but he is now moving away from that i assume the he is going to ignore all of that that mean democrats arcane jump on which willet to a moment but johns gave a really quite beautiful speech last night on becoming speaker of the house he open by thanking kep my artsy i want i want to a express my great thanks for our speaker emeritus cave my cart heaven has dedicated over two damage of his life to splice public service sixteen of those years in this house and you would be hard pressed to fired anybody who loves this institution more or is contributed more to it he is the reason we are in this majority to day he started off with that he then moved on to the fact that it is time to get back to work which of course is true is is not been a good moment for the republican party they look clowns restoring some sort of semblance of dignity to the republican calk's would certainly be applause i want to say to the america people on behalf of all of us here we hear you we know the challenges your face in we we know that to that there is a lot going on in our country domestically and abroad and we are ready to get to work again to solve those props and we will our mission here is to serve you well to restore the people's faith in this house in this great and essential institution an he continued along these lines he said the deprive the institution is in jeopardizes time to restored that pride that of course is true as well and and i think all of our parents are proud of what we are called to do here i think all the america people at one time a great pride in this institution but right now a that is in jeopardy and we have a challenge before us right now to rebuild and restore that trust his of course right about that as well now on principle he is a very strong traditional conservative he is pretty hawkish on form policy he voted against some of the crane appropriations bile that probably the biggest distinction between him and my earthy is the my earthy was pro funding for you crane and in the initial responds might johns was pro funding of you crane and then after we gave them a hundrbillian dollars then he started to get kiddish about it and he suggest that he is not in favor of that but that is also where the republican carcass the possibility of passing large sale you crane funding on a standalone basis was an on starter inside the canvas anyway that is obviously direction at the re publican party has moved will get to more from mike johns in just at one second the new speaker of the house first we do things very differently here at dailywire we host

smartest way to hire tell me johns again his his speech basin was excellent when he got to his principles the particularly good mike johns ticked off a lot of left last night when before he assumed his speakership position actually next in prayer with bunch o the members the republican canvas and this of course is very bad not'spos to this is superoffensive to pay tribute to god after you achieve something if the magnitude becoming speaker of the house in the united states to america that of course is is deeply fens if deeply problematic clearly main being recreated to leave in being natural terra supporter o a according to democrats knowing for prayer on the floor of the house that of course the huge problem you are latanneel in cents cloth for gorge flood you are just not allowed to do it for god i without the contain clothes is me johns he said last night that it is time to reject eightheism and maxim nineteen sixty two an nineteen sixty two that that a national math thin god we trust was it the adorned above this rostrum and if you look at the little a guy that they give the tourist and constituent wo common in an visit the house if you turn in there to about page fourteen in the middle get guide it tells you the history of this nit says very simply these words were place here above us this math was placed here as a rebuke of the cold war prof philosophy of the soviet union that philosophy was maxim and communist obviously his slapping at some members of t e left then he listed what he called to seven for principles of conservatism i these a pretritional i thin it is really queen essentially the for principles of our nation i bull them down the individual freedom limited government the rule of law piece their strength this irresponsibility free markets and human dignity those those are the foundations that made us the extraordinary show that we are and you and i to day or the stewards of those principle a that him's pretritionally conservative to me man it in there i heard you know piece through strength which is something a lot people are not big hands of these days i heard fiscal responsibility something a lot o people on the right r not big fans of these days again the idea tat besom service wild departure from traditional conservatism is ridiculous it is ridiculous he is a traditional conservative which is good a traditionally conservative speaker the house would be a very good thing i hope that he pulls the levers in a more conservative direction than house leadership has been able to do i also understand as i said the intensive structure and the intensive structure means he has a democrat senate is a democrat president of the united states and he has an extremely thin majority in the house and all takes a few grand standers to make it that he has to con to deal with democrats again in the initial run i expected his going get the support of many peoplewho housed in my earthy those aren'kon o by people who buck him but as time progresses he will have the exact same invent of structure as everyone also was this a big giant wind for therepublican party again really my getlicget in a ton of ways love my johns we on for policy lava data lie again a crossword excellent excellent choice for speaker of the house can he pull the levers in a sophisticate away we have yet to see that was this overall in a making move for republicans a much needed ye what let us let us hold our fire on that one was packages a strategic genius for throwing the house in a complete course for month to do this at no no he was not in any attempts to get con that yet are are a pretty ridiculous we godless what the democrats are saying johnson's first move was a good move he announced last night that the very first move that he was going to make as speaker of the house was to push a resolution to support israel than a bill to support israel in his war against compass here is what he had to say the first bill that ism going to bring to this floor and just a little while we will be exist proof er i dear grin to israel and we are over do and giving a we are going to show not only israel but the entire world that the barbarism of hummus that we have all seen cloy out on artily is in create screams is wretched and wrong and we are going to stand for the good in that conflict a good for johns he is very strong on that particular issue that resolution did pass last night four hundred and twelve to ten the nay votes were except for homes massy who basely does not governments panting on anything which oka the other nine favors were exactly who youwould think they were female bomancory bush on reason a green summer lee to we el can oar dell a remoras respected to leave and there r six present votes as well again more radicals i on expressly grab case are of taxes walking castor chew area promilajyapol needy of valaskas exactly who you would assume it to be again i think that don it is good to get the house back in working order a good for good for my johns and a it is time for the house to get back to or meanwhile the democrats a raving it up as they would with pretty much any conservative who ha is it up as house speaker when they're they arguing to try and now demonize milk johns as a radical said they can fund rase off tit is what they are going to do according to politico hell mi johns might have been an obscure fort from congress member before wednesday but if democrats have their way he will soon be well known by every america as an election in ire and antiabortion extremest o slasher of social security an medical democrats are determined to find johns in the public eye before he has a chance to find himself democrats set on wednesdate they were hurriedly digging into johnson's record there ire sixty nine episodes of his podcast on notify which son cohost with his wife many of which touch on hot button political topics one democratic operative was quick to spotlight one such episode as indicative of the gold mine they believes about to be discovered a tune fifth showing which to the johnsons spot lighted in initiative to turn pride monthinto fidelity month micchot owns can of grate chelate please go after him on that one the d c c c sentiment to housdemocratsing house re publicans may be breathing a short sighted si of relief now they have elected new speaker but there decision to elevate in antiabortion extremest to as pushed to got social security an medical and who's one of the main architect of the legal attempt to overture the twenty twenty lection we will lose them the majority and twenty twenty for he can see them already activating the strategy here is a meme jeffreys yesterday he is the house minority leader bashing johns right off to that to start with on a conman johns giving the fact that there appears at least pace on that sound that there is no went tom behind him is this somebody you believe democrats can work with ha cross the isle the morning ray to be with you i do not know i might johns well make on the track record he place hes to be an extreme right win i dialog i mi johns once the implies to woman car and impose the mason we man i mi johns was one of the chief arch tests to fine to will the turn the results of the twenty twenty rest an also lesson might johns also once that in security an media car as we know it those are extreme views and hows demo cats will push back the ressesibly against than we yet they regretting ready to a run against johns again this is what they think there gin to be able to debit i thins to be a hard sell lobe because johns does not a pure offensive johns is very conservative and you can here him s peaking and he seems reasonable he h c an even ja taper on signal last night who is no friend of the republicans even he was had johns is is a very articulate got jeffreys also is trying to ramp up the bedrock round canary six again i think it is tired on thinkiton a work i think it was for for lot of america they want to put in the rear fun mirror and heir tired of us here is jeoffreys introducing johns by comparing canary six to world wore two they are are many throughout this country to underhandedly along at the turbulence of the moment at the cars to this function and the extreme item that has been on let in the chamber from the very beginning of this congress but this two ha we faith adversity as a member eleven two thousand in one when the towers and the pent the on wat unexpectedly struck killing thousands alive in instant we faith adversity right here in the house of representatives we on janyeree si two thousand in twenty one a violent mob of instereciives in sited by som in ti timber over man the you or a at of an a er the had the ti o tan a of power again and this is gong to be the line of attack again sees in keep going back to this were over and over and over again again all publicans have to do show some baseline competent here and that that at hack line goes away these nobody's folding on gentry sex they are facing in on the things happening right now by the way some those things happening right now to the u s g t p grid four point nine per cent annual clip in the third quarter that was better than expected but in some ways really really problematic because the entire purpose of jacking up the interest rats which you get people two stop spending as much money because that is inflating the currency and it is also t it is the price inflation we north wage price final people are not saving their money there spending their money according to c and b c the sharp increase came from contributions from consumer spending increase in men toward s export to residential investment and government spending the air it is the summer spending increase four per cent for the quarter after rising just zero point eight per cent ink u to one f the reasons people a spending much as because they believe thither dollar s going to be worth less tomorrow than it is two days show may as well buy that product they ware going to put off for six months you might as well buy right now before it doubles in price government spending an investment jumped four point six per cent as well the stock market did not jump on this news which means that everybody's still understands that there is another she o drop the other hue to drop is going to be the inflation staffs which continue to come in hot and a the federal reserve is going to have to raise those interest rates again they are gong to have to do it they do not really have a huge a huge debate over this really according to the paltry journal to combat high elation the fend is lifted it is punch mark federal fun rate to a range between five going two five per cent in five point five presenting twenty two year high but the m the possibility of the the economy running t this hot is going to probably spur out imagine some talk about the need to raise those interest rates again the the notion again that we are out of the economic woods here i think that that we are wag to early for anything that we are way to early for anything

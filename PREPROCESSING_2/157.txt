a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped intodays episode of the show if you are fer a beat version you can find that at our weight this america life dot o work here is just first time working for his big brother the brother need somebody last minute there go bed on him eff also hat somebody bell on him he be bi come for the summer that is girding and it became really a pear right away that that was not get work out he has some time on his hands as brother was doing a research study on black bears is mother's a wild up biology and offered in this job is a feel neck and summer working with black bears was a dream that would not be a dream for everybody where's at a dream for you i just think bears the is a cools animals the cool black bears are cool how fast they can blind of tree their years i love hi bears ears i just love everything about bears eff let bears his brother west studies bears eff is the younger brother west is the older brother was is research with a track where bears were an price can national part and you talk here he is there was a bear that had broken into a tent stated a woman while she was sleeping really scared and the idea was to caller some bears track them see where they are going how they spending their time if they could find ore that out par cut relocate campsites away from the there is post signs as an eff spend summer putting collars with two pstrovises on to a bunch of wild bears and then in the winter they to go back and check on the bears to a quick exam make sure the collars ware not too tight once the bears fatten up for winter swap out any old collars and need new batteries i turns out the easiest way to do that is to visit the bears with ere hibernation in the days the most bear days the job is not actually too difficult o scared he ends are small a cavity in some rock or under a tree we says and there generally shallow enough that i can just i have a pole that has a syringe on the end of it i can just extend that pole and a day the bear from outside of the get i do not general even have to go inside generally but then you can a couple dens where it is you are the only thing between the bear and the exit and that is when it gets kind of skin and that is what happen in this says oh this one's on another lev this angles crazy this one tapping on a wintery day he you of them headed out a see bear number ninth five the udo i saw us ignolegy ps i maybe a thousand feet up a steep hillside get to i in the snow is hard and cold then they struggle to find any opening at all in the rock that could be a don there it just a blanket of snow everywhere hes start may be half an hour and then west is standing on this tiny little opening and then i see these branches right by his feet and a lot of times bears will bring branches into the den som we i think you standing on top of the did he is just no way they clear away the snow it is an opening the size of a manhole cover going into the side of a sandstone cliff and then we crouch down and looked and i mean you could only see twenty feed in and it is just black honestly this den a it would be terrifying to go in it if you did not know anything was isn't it and that there is a bear there that just ansiffies it much more is this even if there was not a bear it'd be this is exist was not eff discuss whether they're going to go into this hole by bears are not grizzly they mas never attack people but going into this very unused r dam where the bear might feel trapped it threatened and am no way out except through them as choice eff does talk back to as way more than the normal feel teakwood cause his a brother but we is the boss and he is we can as far and we really do need to change that bears collar and i start crawling in looking for the back to the den looking for the bear and it is just not there and this hell just plunges into darkness my head lamp only goes far and i just keep going and immediately i realize shit this is a really really long den this is much longer than anything have ever seen or even heard of how on this thing extends eighty feet back and at the end of it it is just pitch black you kind of you really do have to suppress a lot of a lot of primal stuff that is telling you this is a place where you are not supposed to be this is not a place for humans we is in front big brother scientist just behind little brother a sister and the army crawling cause the tunnel was too low to stand up and its pretty crammed and you not feeling we bring your belly and a tunnel hanging towards ha bear no of course not you do notknow that feeling who has done that but you have been in the situation a moving towards something scary or dreadful ahead and now you have got yourself in it you cannot turn back you have to keep moving you just have to deal and that is what to day show us about we have this story than we have another one in the second half of the show and yes it is this america lie from be easy chico ire glass anyway they're edging towards this bear right the tunnel was mentally slipping downward and the smell you may be wondering wat the smell like wet earth musty the bear brings in a nest of pine tree boughs and other sticks and stuffs does kin of smell celery and nice too that gits musty but it is honestly nowt as bad is what you would think because when a bear goes in to higher nation we will give yo a lot my scientific name on this but they create a but plug of poop that they will not poop theentire time then their den there is no feeseasar you are in in there it honesty is not terrible they may be fifteen twenty twenty five feet into the tunnel and was his head lamp points in the far end and i just see these two green eyes at the very end of his tunnel staring back at me and the thing about these highbrnatin bears is they bears do not hibernate very deeply if a bear hears you approaching its den it can come out of that pronation and generally within five to ten minutes they can be noble and this bar was awake and they have they have the tupeetam luster which is the thing you see in cat's eyes or dear eyes are whatever that reflects light back at you and and they reflect a really fund of green glow and it is just again the stuff of nightmares your crawling down a deep dark goal in the mountains and there two green eyes shining back at you the light starch to catch these two eyeballs at the very end was a get s that day just groaning back at us that play ism her find and a i start kind of feeling you i sit saying the less is is crazy this is crazy i do not know about this and cuff just started saying we should not be here we should not be here we should not be here as a mother that he was repeating and i keep saying that and it was starting to really free from me out i i was trying to summon all this courage and drawing all my experience and then i have him behind me telling me tat with should not be in there and i turned around and then west viscous eff shut up so's then my immediate respond s you are brave and then he just started repeating you are the bravest person have ever met you are the bravest person i ever pit and that helped actually that made me million better it is funny how he needs to keep saying something to to have some place to put his fear yet yet i think for him he needed to vocalize that and for me i was really going inward and just trying to focus on the bear and is looking for any cues that bear was going to be aggressive and at that point you will leave i what are you watching for they make a really distinctive sound when they are really a really upset and then they also can they make this really interesting jaw popping noise to it lethally clacks its jaws at pops its jaws it is kind o sound and then from there it proceeds to swatting the ground with its paws and then if it is still upset it will bluff charge you and a bluff charges just where the bear comes at you and then stop short are you terrified oh ye oh ma's absolutely terrified i have a video that i took when i got close to the bear i took a quick ideal for my down and i at the very end of it you to sear me say this is scary heath o this i sos not i scare scare is i really pests its terrifying i cash all of my body wat of my psyche was saying you absolutely need to get out of this den tit is this feeling of being a soft pink human being in a place where we do not belong course a west being in the tunnel with is bear he is a bear expert and he is thoughts som about what this experience must have been for the bear where these blackboard live there there top dog there is nothing bigger or more dangerous than them and they do not have stuff that crawls into their dens and gets closer and closer to them it must be a very unique experience for them as well ism obviously a bear like what the hell is this thing doing in here win when the bear sees you it knows it can kick your out i you could just look at you and it does not even without even thinking of doing any math in its head or something it just sees your size and it just knows you are not a threat but then is it scared yet i think the thing that you that we have to realize with wild animals is that for them a fight means much more than can i win or or will i lose it is ism am i going to be injured in this because for any animal tears included if they sustain a big injury in any kind of you will scuffle or fight or whatever that could be a dead sentence for them because then they no longer have the ability of feed or escape or even move and they tend to be very risk o verse its lessen eff keep army drawing forward with the sringeful of see it i on the end of a seven foot to finally wist gets close enough to jab it into the bear mission accomplish right but we jab it the bear does not react at all does not french an must important that is not fall able par be cause it to into big since they lasting it three hundred fifty pounds which it require way more set it than is of it s to s it them head back out of the cave there another dosubseditit which they heavily are going to need that jot goes to jab to brother and it's something is fully capable of doing i think i was still just died up all the law to living with all i like emotion my thoughts aren't clear sits lie doing a terrible job your hands are not totally steady ye just making a mass i fumbling around and eventually the bear makes it lay all way through the eighty feet a den and starts coming out this is not the plan it would be very bad for a trying trout bear to weave it stand at all it could easily wander off and get lost in the snow in the middle of winter and west gaff remember their bear guise hey do anything they can think of the bears in this research you do not get hurt by it and experience the minimum amount of discomforted dress they have another feel neck with them who is been waiting outside the tunnel and when orders that i now keep the bear in the den in the i start swatting at the bear with a plastic shovel to keep it from emerging and it just doesn't care it is not even registering that hes there and just keeps walking past him were yet at that point i ran and the thing that i really did not want to have happen was the drug take hold while this bar was trying to get away and have it tumble down the hill side or down a cliff side or something that i just was not willing to what that happen i ran and actually grab the bear by its back legs and pulled them out from under it and then i straddled the bear and pushed its head down into the snow in the meantime had slyly away what an y what are you talking about you are able to do that cause the bear is kind of we is the bear walking a sort of carton drunk bear kind of thing its staggering along yet that is honestly exactly how it was walking that is a perfect reps ion he is on top of this bear straddling it holding its collar and head down in the snow he's actually tin a second dose of setitinto him by them but the bear is still away an rest then looks over it gaff who's panic that he is dropped the entire case of drugs eff is must preparing a third dose and i just yell it off i say gaff comgrab this bear it'll do the drugs kind of an unusual said of sentences to say anybody this which places gaff is now the once straddling the bear hands on its collar and the bear gets up and starts to move again as almost that move the re placement where yonder reaves is a quarter back we any the football movies where the big had to line in catches the ball n and thin there just slowly moving towards the son and the whole defense jumps on hem and there just kind of falling off ofay track and i still going towards the goa in yow is not going in a straight lying with all these people hanging on him an isn't end that we are just hanging on this black bear and it is just slowly going in a straight line just holding it by the collar getting dragged along floating down a little bit but that is all hi can do and this thing with his bear where none of the normal worlds apply totally off the map is this is what i have to do but i cannot believe ism doing it was serial i just is is in a tree it starts making wait it is wash did more of it downward slope you o now it is a really hard for me to stop it and ism just kind on the back of it and it walks straight into a pine tree and likeligerly like could not figure out what was going on and just tried to keep walking forwards in to a tree west remembers it wore could junipropush but any case the does job the bear stops finally passes out on the ground they do the business change the collar examine the bear and then her does not it lost in fused in the snow when it wakes up the grab its lies and drag it fifteen yards or back up the slope to the opening f the tunnel which is exactly as completely exhausting as you would imagine it tikes may be half an hour temperature's dropper we worried that the bear mike a could through lives a blanket on top be i before they go in bat but went e both talk about is the terror that they fell in that tunnel we says it was a whole new level of fear he did not know existed the kind of primal fer a long ago humans must had all the time facing off with animals at wanted to kill them an eat them and it is something that that we have forgotten but i think it something that still sits deep inside of us that when you do have these experiences with large animals that it git bubbles to the surface and in a way it was really it intoxicating it'll tell you that night i did not sleep a wink because my dranelon was just coursing through my body om they just made me feel i honestly made me feel very alive and ah even when i think back on that i can still remember the feelings i had that night as i went back to my the cabin and everything just how bright the star seemed and how pros the air fell and it really just reminded me how good it is to be alive in the bear the bear is fine the dugsagater probably does not remember the details of what happened west said never year later was went back to that tunnel when the bearer was not in it found the blanket inside the bear must a liked a little it smelled bear sure all over it was took back kept i is a souvenir he says it still smells penny bear a n the bray we have another story of people thrown into ay dangerous and utterly for stable situation and how they handle it in this episode the we calling the bear at the end of the tunnel was not eff by the ay of a pod casts were they tell stories of animal attacks is called tooth and caw if i you enjoyed the string that you send you should know that by their standards this story was not special the ones wen their show way or eventful morinamen ut mccagobobegradio when a program continues is mar con like from our glass to takes program again the bear at the end of the tunnel stories people who find themselves trapped in some dangerous situation and now they just have to deal we have arrived tat at two of our she act two the devils in the details and there are many details few month ago we brought you the story from one of our producers meeting me about an of g wan in rural to it was deciding whether not to leave the state after reverses wage was overturned and abortion was outlaw there i don't not to leave here an we i don't wont to leave it i do not if i can say the sob g want media huntsburger was facing a nitro a set of portion laws that kicked in after row was overturned that are some of the most restrictive in the country and con just say i think when most of us think of these laws we think of their effect on abortion clinics and abortion carprofiders that was in this story a media was a general of g wan at hospital and other was doing papers bird controlled giving babies and our hospital did not terminate pregnancies unless it was a medical complication which by the way is most hospitals in t e interstates but when rob overturned and these new laws and i tho took effect they defined abortion in the broadest possible terms it was effectually a complete ban even pregnancies that were not count be viable could not be terminated and any doctor who performed an abortion breaking those rules face severe consequences they goods a medical license that go to prison for two to five years and they could get sued i we members could so if a raper is ordered in a pregnancy and the victim decided to get in abortion the rapist's family could sue the doctor for performing the abortion n the probe for media the b g wan si ran in to all kinds of situations where in the course of ad ministering normal health care for her patience she could run a foul the law for instance if patient showed up at her hospital miss carrying and bleeding on controllably the past media could terminate the pregnancy to stop the bleeding but now she be charge with a felony if she did that if she did anything determine into pregnancy if it still had a quote needle heartbeat that is frame in the law thought the early stages it is not a heart beat it just electrical activity in some tissue that could eventually become a heart now when media faced pregnancies was serious complications situations were the longer she waited to act the more danger the patient was in she could no longer just think about what was best for the patient who was in front of her en when you do surgery that where somebody is having ongoing active leading that is already high stress and dots or high stress a trained for that i know what to do with the i can handle that then you at in this other heard layer o is her brother can an not understand that this was a not viable pregnancy in that her life was at risk and what about her mom what about her partner what about her sister they a do these people understand how serious this condition is or do they only understand that i removed the pregnancy that had a heart be i do not know how mass to to know she where y becoming sued she were to bet getting prosecuted this came up all that and the end of her story back in march ameba was still hanging on idol still decided since than much as happened just a few weeks after we are in that story ameba decided she was going it way dos bid has a bushonons she is one o the first good be she wins in the state to about she was going about we after that something that she feared might happen some day haven about quicker than she imagine the hospital were she practice on a general health announce that was shutting down its entire labor in delivery department the hospital sited the new was as one reason the shad recruiting her doctor is would be quote extremely difficult finance was the other reason since then all three of the other be u i answer share o practice with media have left the state what ameba dreaded most a living way was what was going to happen to her patience how would all this affect everyone an isotope trying have a baby we thought about that for to day so because what would happen to them this was in a since the bear in the tunnel the difficulties and possible danger that all those patient's face cause of the new laws and what is unfolded since as been pretty dramatic i producing making me went back to talk to patience and to the law makers who put them into the situations therein in the state here s kinky i talk to half a dozen pregnant women who would ben planning to deliver up on er general and suddenly found themselves contorting their lives around the mystical problems they had never imagined facing for something as every day is trying to have a baby in the state of dah bookman cumber is twenty five years old and was days away from giving birth when i reached her media had ben her doctor and brook's plan had been to do her prenatal appointments tat on er general and deliver there too but now the closes dah hospital with a labor in delivery department was almost two hours away in a small city called qardelane she'd ad take her three little kids with her in the car on a four hour round them for every prenatal appointment blood presser needle heartbeat four hours for a fifteen minute chicken the days that we would have tat go to quarreling it was from nine thirty to six o'clock at i i would have my sister who she lis and spoken she is about thirty five minutes from quarreling that she would hang out the k ids i can go to my ointment and then we would have to go out for lunch or do a big meg and then go to a park because like they cannot just et the car forgoer hours back to back the distance to the hospital also worried her she was freaked out about not getting to the hospital in time and giving birth on the side of the road her labors have always been pretty fast which she have time to make it to the hospital when brook got three weeks away from her delay she could not take being on heeler all the time she moved in with her ma'am who lived two hours away close to brooks new hospital brook took the kids with her her husband could not join them because of work and her mama was working every day brook was carrying for three little kids basically on her own at eight months pregnant it was hard leave her husband the splitting up their family temporarily was the only solution they could come up with me mi has ben have never really ben a part before and being in a bet alone hasten strange and then a to boys they have had some trouble sleeping they will wake up in the middle o the night then both the boys will call into bed with me and then i wind up an the coach e mi giving to try tables get one ore hour of rest boner general had been the only labor and delivery unit in its region of northern i too when it shut down it became a statistic and a whole super at longstanding prices the closure of labor and delivery surfaces in rural hospitals all over the country nearly half of rural community hospitals no longer offer obstetrics care the chaos created by boner general's closer for the women i spoke with involved the most basic important stuff child care money some women told me they would lose a days worth of pay every time they had to drive to an appointment they talked about having to budge at hundreds or even thousands of extra dollars for travel or housing in a place closer to a labor and delivery department for switching to midwife not covered by insurance for they went to another state to get care insurance might not cover a that either i talk to one woman who told me she bought helicopter insurance for a medical evacuation flight in case she started haversine or had some other kind of emergency complication turns out its cheaper than you think seventy five dollars and she was not the only one hellacoppder insurance for normal pregnancies this woman's name is messy horsemen she is thirty two years old and this was her first kid and in dah she worried the abortion laws tied doctor's hands in too many cases i desk did i an i be an wits that if we you have to chance her tot e hospital i might be taken at washington i i can be last worry about i the airy any ow man present to mi telling about might o what in force e say o habits and mat i i have t this es her hell copter getting you l t get ais but years entire at might just be like and i get a i as mig bee at a i li beer no guarantees for anyone pregnant person doctor any one who might want a look at the maternal mortality statistics and do since the new lass past the state use to have a committed that traced maternal deaths in their houses but it does not any more the legislature decided not to renew it in its last passion dah is now the only state in the country without a committee this that is the situation for these women who just needed general of j way care during their pregnancies but then there are the high risk nations which includes by the way any of who is expecting twine any one with high blood pressure or diabetes anyone over thirty five and any one whose pregnancies include rare complications these people are in a much more dire situation in itch now because they may need whats called a maternal feudal medic n doctor these her highly skilled u be johannes specialists at keeping both the feds and the patient alive and healthy through these pregnancies and these doctor had been leaving the stye caulis smith had a maternal feudal medicine doctor her first pregnancy had complications but things were going smoothly with this one it was a boy she ad her husband had picked out a name brooks and then when she was nineteen weeks she went in for her anatomy scan and i i juseremember this honographli i know they cannot say any thing but she just kept going over his heart quite a be and of course ism talking myself down it is sine it is just different this time each person has a different of doing things and then it was just really quiet and then she left and em doctor cooper her walked into the room doctor kill cooper her maternal feudal medicine specialist i just remember she had a diagram an am she i just remember her being have number stem her defect this sever before i they could not really see the babies i or er at all his i guys say were to arch was it really formed the only thing call wanted to know was could brook survive pass birth she and her husband had already decided that could care for a child with special needs doctor cooper referred her to a pediatric cardiologist but he told her no brook's chances of survival were very unlikely he called some of the best pediatric hospitals in the country and none of them could offer her a surgical option to fix is heart she remember sitting in an ultrasound room with her doctor she is if you divide to continue this pregnancy i were for you and we will figure out what that means and where we need to go for me she is but if you do divide that you did not want to coins pregnant she shes just really sorry ti ti i personally can o you understood at that point this is because of the laws ye yet i mean her hands were tied i knew i knew she was protecting herself but also i would never ask her to be in that position yet we just all cant give looked at each other wit the we do now most patients calla whose pregnancies have what are called lethal and life limit's feudal anomalies choose termination because continuing their pregnancies will result in miscarriage still birth her death shortly after delivery but calls doctor could not offer her termination just a week or before this terminating the pregnancy brooks would not have been considered an i legal abortion an itch but now under idea hose new laws it was calistarted asking her doctor about what if she did continuer pregnancy and delivered brooks what would it be for him would he fill any pain during the birth would he suffer from air hunger feel breathlessness as he gasped for air but of course her doctor could not guarantee that he would not feel anything even with palliative care and morphine that it just also felt there is only one option and it wasn't one that we wanted are but bike i do not want my sunditsuffar i do not ism nocking upon myself through that and it'll go risk my own life be doctor cooper decorator bating shoe she is you have afore to present em to getting pregnancy again preaclancia is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality et usually involves the surgeon blood pressure that can seriously harm or kill a pregnant nation it is in predictable and hard to know when it will happen and how severe it will be which brings us to the man thing doctors find frustrating about idea hose new abortion laws there is language in the law that says they cannot terminate a pregnant y unless it is quote to prevent the death of the pregnant woman doctor cooper said she does not know what that means is it mean she would have to wait for call to be near death's door from preaclampcia before she could intervene her whole training all doctor's training is the stop problems before death after becomes imminent the only other situation where doctor cooper could terminate a pregnancy is if the fetal heart beat stopped i the feels was dead can described her options and itch as a quote chest buffet do i risk going to her knowing that ism not even in a half a son to take home and risk my life and not be there for my daughter i mean i want to make it very clear that i was at that point twenty weeks pregnant i could feel is very active i and what that us is one's mental hale i just a thistating because i feel i to suit grab there is him really dark thought that i never thought i would have thought ah thinks is there chance at his horrible stop because i knew were where i currently and itch that would be a reason fur them to help me i heard this from other pregnant women and itch with needful fetal anomalies they found themselves wishing for the heartbeats to stop hearing that brooks could sofferth he made it to term call decided to leave this state in order to end her pregnancy she found appointment at a hospital in settle because she was far along twenty one weeks second brewmaster because it was not clear of her insurance was going to cover it head to pay almost fifteen thousand dollars updraft she and her husband took out alone and then drove seven and a half hours with their two year old daughter call had a choice of how to enter pregnancy with a surgical procedure or by inducing labor early call knew she wanted to induce she delivered brooks after twelve hours of labor he was still born she says there was this weird early silence in the delivery room and then every one laughed she and her husband could hold brooks there were things that came up after that were kind o a some one just people saying congratulations just walking in the real met od because i did not know rat right brooks was cremated two weeks later call made the seven and a half hour drive back to settle to pick up his ashes my pareve would have without a doctor even up to see able to get him if i needed them to and you do brought him to us when they were able to come over here but i just remember talking of my husband at i i it does not made me feel good i feel i just me to go and he was that you jest see to go and i to i drove over to theta with my daughter it was one of those things that i i just need to me in charge of this ism si know what is happening call was the first case this that her doctor doctor cooper handled after it hos abortion laws changed her first case where she could not do anything to help then there were more patients calls she could not help and an aril of this year she was the first maternal feudal medicine doctor to leave itahoe because of its abortion laws there was already assure toe of these specialists an itch before the laws went to effect only nine in the entire state now there were just five and one of those will retire before the end of the year that fear bat every pregnant woman i talk to an it who had that they be left totally on their own in a medical emergency it happened to back the last patient doctor cooper hat to tell ism sorry i cannot help you before she moved out of itch mecca is thirty one she lives in the noisy aria and used to oversee a fitness club she went to college on a poll vaulting scholarship when she was about sixteen weeks program she learned that her feels had a genetic anomaly multiple organs were developing abnormally including its heart in kidneys if she continued the pregnancy she likely miss care and was at risk for prelacy out r severe emerging you known you see an movies and people get postal diagnosis an they just cumin to not and all you here is a blabbering doctor in the background and i do not actually rememberaful lot of that conversation i just remember sitting there and trying to to ball ma eyes out thecae wed won at the wanly wanted to got our family we tried fore almost a who year for the one and we told people were you how ere prone she be say o i we think it is get to the little girl or something she decided to make the same choice calamari leave the state mecca drove to portend organ to terminate her pregnancy at a cleaned but that is not what she an her husband told their family in fronds we we are not comfortable beg outright in telling them exactly why we are going portend we told family an friends that we are going for dramatic cutting yejuscause it is controversial right now an our state and we did not want to rest losing god relationships o tit cane down to it mecca story is different from calls because she was not able to get the full procedure the night before her appointment for a surgical termination she started miss caring it was around midnight she as at a hotel with her husband and two your old daughter who were sleeping and was just laying in did and i started counting and counting in a contractions where happening every thirty seconds ins the only thing that i kept thinking to myself was oh now this is it is happening and teethe only thing i could think o was to lay on my side to gree through it and relax in to think to myself i has to keep this thing it it got less than eight hours got t keep it in got to keep it in the clinicdon' open until the morning beta woke her husband who phoned the clinics on call doctor beta says the doctor told them she would be fine she was just cramping her contractions continued to get more intense surging and then backing off her husband kept going out to the hotel halfway to call the doctor again the thought about getting an ambulance but neither insurance went cover it mecca says she forced herself to not make a sounds no crying or groaning her daughter was sleeping in a pack and play near her she did not want a wake her up and scare her and what happens next get's graphic and then i right around four o'clock is went a all of a sudden it was just a consistent in once just curling you want a screaming we your teeth contraction and at last id what seemed forever and then the pressure was completely gone and all san i started king amniotic fluid everywhere i ran to the toilet and all of a send own my body whats again has one another one of those contractions since is squeezing your gain a squeeze all your organs out of you and out came the baby and i i look down the tillable there was an and on it is no sat then stared at it back got into the hotel shower and again says she did not make a sounds even when her husband was trying to get her uterus to contract she would stopped bleeding which meant needing his fist into her lower abdomen the way the doctor instructed him over the home she says it was incredibly painful and saying in the sour it is s streams of blood going into the drain in the whole time were just wise this rampant this should not be happening if baccy had been able to get a termination and dah it probably would not have her doctor kindly cooper couldhave done the procedure as soon as she decided mecca would have been in and out in a day not in a hotel room far from home in the morning when the clinic opened up a couple them please showed up to collect the feeds back then hobbled over to the clinic for an exam it was next to her hotel and she had to walk past the line of anti abortion protestors her husband had to stay behind to watch their daughter when she came back they drove home to dah seven hours they sat silently almost the whole way before talking to clan baccy one part of the positron experience it'd never heard about wheat people who had to travel out of state to terminate safely had all these complications figuring out what to do with the remains because of rules about traveling across state lines with human remains back had wanted to donate the body for medical research to give her pregnancy lost more meaning but for legions sisal reasons of the clinic she did not get that option bacon her husband decided to creaming but they had no idea when the clinic would send the remains a couple weeks later were home and a post worker comes up to our door and was i cam here you need aside for a packet and slip o e there is this white box that says remains walled on every single side of the box for some reason the box was a rest to baby and not the parents and the poster worker does not actually realize it until i as singing for it she saw the name on the top in her face just this is o good bi and leathelyjus we n o such as grab the box and shut the door of the set as a terrible coda to a terrible experience backhoe baccaworried that people who would help them go out of state might getting trouble if she talked about it it was not clear who prosecutor my grafter in the earliest hardesdays she had a secret instead of just a lot i don't see li count get openly talk about it and is a lot of the graven process i wast for me as being able to talk about it right about it like got even just as sympathize or empathized with other people who got through somewhat s situation we it people be just it made it and muted and quiet very lonely grieving process baccy and calm at recently the part of a group of people with other patience and doctors when trying to sooth a state hoping to expand the exceptions in the abortion laws include lustful feudal anomalies the ones they had in their pregnancies and most important they want the law toll loud doctors to provide abortions to preserve a person's health not just to prevent their death which is the language in the alright now their case was filed by the center for reproductive its who failed similar legal actions and other states with restrictive laws they re presented the abortion clinic in the supreme court case that overturned row aconcac to the two idawho lawmakers in the house in senate who sponsor the law that criminalizes abortion i wanted to find out how they think its working were they hearing about the kinds of experiences i was did they know about the doctors leaving the state did they think they need to make any changes one of the law sponsors declined an interview and the other did not respond tumultuous request i reached out to republican lawmakers who voted for the law back in twenty twenty before reafhal ate senator him got three represents the district and southern itch and identifies as pro life i was surprise he walked into the interview with a note book would stats about the number of doctors who loft the sate and started siting them to far it is at least nineteen doctors because that worried him am pro life but i think there is got to be some consideration for the do is they practise if they are not in find i session an in sort the second is a help of them a has hen you talk about pro life the life of a mother is if you are trying to protect that that is pro life to to me when you first voted for the abortionlaws did you think that roe would actually fall or did it feel more a symbolic act at that time it is a good question i i think to answer that honestly a probably did not think it would happen bebecaus tat what i done on for what fifty years something that he is the chair of a committee in ta seen that abortion bills go through before they go to the rest of the legislature for those says the language in the abortion man was always more aggressive than his own personal beliefs at that time when you voted for them were you looking that closely at the language of the laws may maybe there was some things overlooked as far as what the consequence is would be because they were not truly consequences yet and your shut conscious you are thinking it is not going to be a return sill this is one way you can make a statement you kind o get into that deal where if you are pro life even thou the bill has some things her problematic you were going to come down on the side of of carrying on the side of protecting the unborn the other law makers i talk to he says he believe the intend of the laws when he voted for them was a shut down abortions happening in clinics in the state not to help shut down a rural labor and delivery unit are force patience to travel out of state because of severe feel abnormalities those were consequences he did not forsake now seeing how things of played out do you regret voting for those laws or wouldyouhave done something different if you could go back in time in the contact of being pro life and recognizing the importance of the unborn i feel that not at that time with what was in place as far as trying to push back against an embed at law i i think that was in appropriate not at the time even not once to rover way shall returned as when the reality i think sunken for all of us i talk to three republican legislators and they were all in the same situation trying to grapple with the consequences of what had just been theoretical policy when they first loved for them but now was real law a acting real situations in people's lives we republican law makers used to be pretty much on the same side now they have different ideas about hot up lie pro life to those new laws the next law maker i take to was representative brent crane for nearly twenty years he is represented a district outside of daisy and makes his living running a fire alarm and security business he believes in life tat conception and says he is proudly sponsordor cosponsor more than a dozen pieces of anti abortion legislation he in senator got three are on the same page as far as seeing the need to broaden exceptions in the abortion laws but they also hop to work alongside law makers who think there should not be any exceptions for instance for rain incessvictoms sober resonator crane describes him is still stuck in what he calls a are r o mine side for everything is still black and wite me he says he used to we abortion that we too until row finally fall a i remember sit by the fireplace my wife that usually where we sit down in the evening or early morning and i said am have got a get my head around this issue because we are not prepared to deal with this is estate did you o a a post roe environment is totally different in in a are to all legislatures crafted descries it questions up before the court well now you are in a poster environment were you have to govern that means you have to have legislation that that is going to work and for a pro life lawmaker most pro life law makers will take a very conservative and very rigid stance on the issue of life am no ism not ism not going to give any ground at all for any more exemptions that is it whatever for me personally i think that there are some instances where the families need to make those decisions again this is ha place were lawmakers who used to all be on the same side of a portion are now in conflict and there was e draft of the bill in the last legislative passion that got to the main problem with the current law the way of be due bi aecia the bill would have a lowed abortions for some serious health complications before they became life i me in other words letting doctors made decisions based on the health of the pregnant person not just their potential death representative crane chairs the house committee that abortion legislation goes through and he scene the hearing for the bill that he would a cancel of the last meet because he did not have the votes to get out of committee for some of his members considering the health of the pregnant person open to canopworms behind close door i was partner tore and then if for opening health of the mother where to that stop is at mental health is it just tied to physical health is a financial health what what is hale how you defining health the mother representative sultan young is republican from south eastern the she is vice chair of that committee and oppose that new language about health complications what i do not want to do is put language in that vague that it has the effect of open the door to abortion in situations where you could protect both lives and for talking about his blood pressure if for talking about conditions that are common to pregnancy than we do not want that lumped into anything that could be a life threatening condition for the mother because the reality is that as women we put our lives on the line by choosing to have children there are always risks with every pregnancy and you can never eliminate every risk what is your ye at which her medical knowledge of pregnancy ell well ism not in a claim to be an be die that have learned lot for the years and a it i guess i speak to the issue not as a medical professional but as a mother that is really fermi ex premises she has ten children shes switches off bringing her youngest to to the capital with her and the sit on on committee meetings and hearings also random fact turns out my uncle was her orthodontist when she was ahead representative young is weary of letting doctors consider the health of the pregnant person of giving doctors and i tho hospitals the kind of control they had before fell for representative young the sweep of the new laws is not som overreach it is the point the concern i think with the health exception is that we have some in the medical community who practised in an environment for a lot of years where the life of the child was not valued equally i about in it a hospital specifically that around the country because that was the way it was hat it was a fetus that was a clump of sells and there was not the protection in the courts for the l if of the child unlike senator got three who is worried about doctors leaving it how representative young thinks that some to ho o b g fans are exaggerating their fears about prosecution under the law she says others a scaring themselves i overthinking the phrase to prevent death she points to language in the law that says they can use their quote good faith me dial judgment representative crane who talked about the are to and post to mind that of republicans also agrees with her on thus on this topic he does not see is much crazy if you are not performing elective abortions you have nothing to worry about just if you are not going over the speedlemit you don't have toe worry about a cop polling you over for speedy elective abortions is a phrase ante abortion law makers and active abuse but it is not a medical distinction in medicine any termination of a pregnancy for any reason is an abortion whether it is to prevent death or to help rap an incesvictums ore just not wanting to be fragment they are all just call abortions just connects this in terminology are another frustration doctors and to have about the new laws o b g ans who have left an once that are trying to figure up they can stay but aren't sure if they can say is are the law is still vague to me i what's tho they what is the was the bigness for them there is an exception the for life of the pregnant patient but what does that need to be what dis that defined is that fifteen present close today fifty per cent fortyfive and also there are these things that come up we know this person has proclancy it is got it devil i cannot say hen a just i cannot operate an that area because there is not that health language i d jo me honestly do you thinks it if a doctor i says he look ism going to have to take your child that goes to down ism going to either haft if i do not take the child the mobs goal to die what you wanting to do take the child he does that and you get a a wildly aggressive prosecutor this says ism going to take you to court for violating the triggerlaw on the sate of out you think a reasonable court of people the are made up of just honest citizens you and i argantisay verge t throwing a jail for that i prosecute for that the they are not going to how long si the lawmen an effect right been in effect y over your have any doctors been prosecuted have any cases come forward o i think dot doctors are saying is i know lawmakers are telling us that but there is no guarantee that a prosecutor is not get to come after me there is no guarantee that a family member is not et assume me and i do not want to have to go to court and i have also got kids endive got a livelihood we have an any that is really aggressive that the lawmakers assurance of no ones get to come after you they're not at a lose an court is not assurance for me i understand i mean to i i spent more than almost ninety days listening to these exact same arguments and i me look life of the mother is life of the mother it is it is not this highly technical highly new wants argument that i think that some of these folks are scared about i do not know i me your reporter ism ism a alarm guy i for he's party simple life of the motherly the mother's life can then i know i i have the ability to operate in the space mi think that is when of go man's get tat we have legislators who are not doctors that is true ah but but on the lipide you have doctors that are trying to tell legislators how to do their job and a we have constituents that a asking us a this just what we want you do not act and that is that is where the mention exists i ran by him and representative songs some of the specific experiences it'd heard from pregnant women in of g fans the actual people who been stock smoldering the emotional and logistical burdens of the new abortion laws and how disconnected they said they thought from this new era and to how that suppose to be pro life and pro family here is how representative young sees this moment what i hear you describing a lot seems adjusting to a nest action and undoubtedly there is a little pain with every change an there is we just do not live in a world where everything works out perfectly all the time and that just because there is some in convenient associated with making the policy change to protect life does not mean that it is not the right thing to do because there is always two sides to the story and there a lot of babies who were going to live in this state that might not have lived and that is valuable that is worth protecting that is worth paying a price for even if it means that there has to be some growing paints associated with that of j what ends in the state have been telling me that access to good maternal health cure and idea has saturated rapidly over the last year that the state is now in crisis is that full accurate to you as crisis the word that you would yous yet i guess i have not seen that yet but what what i keep coming back to as a legislator if you are a physician that does not want to adhere to at a standard of protecting both the life of the mother and the life of the child then that may be frustrating for you i think there is going to be some sorting out maybe as the standard of practise a jests to what the statute is concern is is people an adjustment is yet yell loan them saying make is i do not think that we have to desert this this value of protecting life in order to have a thriving of community we should be able to make these two things work together and it might take a minute to have the conversation and figure out but i do believe that it is possible in the year after i a hose new laws wen to a fact representative young and other law makers did end of making a few changes to the law some of the most notable abortions are now legal for certain kinds of pregnancies that are never going to be viable ectopic pregnancies and abortions are now legal for japan incesvectums ifs those victims do it in the first thirteen weeks and fioleplece report since most sexual salt victims never report this is still a steep barrier but the thing o b j one's wanted most new wording that would allow them to consider the health of their pregnant patients lejustlaters did not give them that the law maker say there still working on it but after that legislative session ended that is when most of the o b j bennes who left the state ore decided to retire early got out we are living in this moment or there is a political and ideological sorting happening in many parts the country there people who are picking out and specifically living to red or blue states to scape the laws their state legislatures have passed it just seems easier than trying to change the politics of the place where you live but the big question for the patients i talk to an to ho is how many o b j bennes will still be left standing to care for them after the sorting out period represent long brought up it is finally done in a recent survey fifteen per sent of of j bennes in the state said they were definitely leaving ore still considering leaving fifty per sens making men

welcome to the supermen science science tax to i m indrhubermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing creativity creativity is a topic that to many people is very abstract that is we know when something seems creative some of us know people who are creative or perhaps or creative and yet the ability to be creative resides in everybody and we know that because the neural circuits that underlie creativity have been somewhat define and the steps and processes within the brain embody that lead to creativity are well known that said most people do not know how to access creativity and if they do know how to access creativity they are only able to access creativity in a fairly limited number of domains of life for since in the visual arts or in music or within science or engineering or any number of different domains ranging from the kitchen to sport to childhood interactions that is childhood game in other words some adults are able to access their creative spirit when engaging in child play with children or for that matter with adults but as it turns out all of creativity stems from just a small subset of neural structures in the brain that need to be activated in a particular sequence or order to day we will talk about what those neural structures are what particular order they need to be activated in in order to come up with for instance new ideas that are creative and then how to implement those creative strategies we will also talk about different ways to access creativity that include narrative and story telling as well as applying new run sets or even entirely new world views and we will do this in a structured way that will allow anyone whether not you consider yourself creative or not to be able to apply these tools in different domains of life work family play and on and on by the ending is episode you will have a better understanding of what creativity is and how to access it and if you to bring others into your creative endeavors which as you will soon learn can massively expand the extent to which you yourself can express your creative talents as is the case with all episodes of the supermen podcast to day we will discuss both scientific mechanisms and nomen cloture and i promise to make all f that clear to you even if you do not have a background in biology or psychology but we will also of course discuss tools that is specific steps that you can take in order to be more creative one particular tool that ism excited to share with you involves a meditation but this is a very unusual meditation this is not sitting with eyes closed focussing on your breath or focussing on a chime or some other feature in your sensory environment or even in your body later we will talk about open monitoring meditations open monitoring meditations are very distinct from other forms of meditation and involve learning how to sit back and simply observe your thoughts while intentionally varying where your thoughts go for those of you that find it a struggle to focus or to refocus in more traditional forms of meditation or maybe even in your work and even for those of you that may suffer from things eighty h t or similar open monitoring meditation can be an extremely valuable tool for accessing your creative abilities because of the ways that allows you to tap into specific circuits within the frontal networks of your brains o these are networks of the brain that include the areas just behind your forehead and that allow you to evaluate new and novel run sets in a very unconstrained way because if you think about it creativity is really the ability to take existing elements from the physical world or from the thought world if you will or from any domain of life mood thinking and information and to reorder those into novel combinations that are useful for something and as will also find out later creativity has its incredible aspect to it which is that when we see or create or experience something that is truly creative it reveals to u something fundamental about the way that the natural world and indeed the way that a brains work if that sounds very mysterious and abstract to you now i promise that by the end of to day's episode you will not only understand with that means but you will also understand how to use open monitoring meditations as well as other forms of tools in order to access your creative ability before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to brings zeros to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens in the reason i still take athletic greens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which are vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body with out lentic greens that get the vitamins i need the minerals i need end the phobics to support my microfilm if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer the will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of data ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even i

electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar of talk many times we fore in this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have soda magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you would to try element

element elements dot calm slash supermen let us talk about creativity on the face of it the word creativity and creative acts might seem somewhat abstract to us that is we know when we see something that we consider creative and we know when we see something that is not creative things that are not creative or things that we see every day car with for tires for instant ay bicycle with two tires not creative however we also see things that are novel that are different and that we do not really think of as creative in fact they can be downright trivial for instance if i were to take a fish tank and put wings on it that is a novel combination of things which is one of the key criteria for and act or and object or a piece of music that is creative and yet neither of us i believe would find it very creative or very interesting that a fish tank has wings on it why or why not i should say well it turns out that for something to be creative it actually has to reveal to us something fundamental about the world or about how we work and i must say that often times the most creative in the most interesting and the most beloved creative acts reveal to us something fundamental about the world or the way that we work in a way that delights and thrills and surprises us but that we are not even aware what that fundamental run is it'll return to this in a few minutes but the time being let us just build up from first principles what constitute something creative and what does not constitute something creative creativity is a way of interacting with the world or combining or recombining things in the world in a way that appears novel to us and to other people my example of a fish t and with wings on it is novel but frankly it is not very creative and it is not very interesting it does not reveal anything new to us sure there flying fish although younothey just cone of jump far they do not really fly and as a consequence putting wings on a fish tank could be used as a metaphor for the fact that fish do not fly but you already knew and i already knew that fish do not fly and there is nothing novel r reveal to us about the world except something we already knew now creative acts on the other hand of course involve novel combinations of existing rule sets that could be different comminations of music or colors or shapes or technology et camera but it does in a way that tells us something fundamental and different let me give an example of a few truly creative artistic acts and it'll do that in the domain of visual arts but of course there are many examples that could come from music or for mother domain sport et camera examples it'll give rather than a fish tank with wings are for instance the comparison between a drawing or a very accurate painting of a face and either painting and a bandy o came you do not knowhow those are it'll explain first of all let us talk about an accurate representation of a face if i were to sit you down or if you were to send me a photograph and then i were to paint or draw a picture of your face in a way that faithfully represented the position in shape of your nose relative to the eyes may be a you know curl of the lip may be a few a hairs of your eyebrows in a particular way that really captured you accurately i think most people would say oka it is accurate it looks a lot the photograph for the person and on the one hand why that could be interesting it is not particularly creative because it faithfully represents what is already there in contrast a painting are a picture an esherand for those who that are not familiar with pushers involves a lot of repeating patterns o for instance a bird image that is repeated over and over and over and over again sometimes in partially overlapping manner and perhaps a building that is repeated over and over and over again or stones repeated over ad over again or staircases over and over again pushers capture elements from the outside world and faithfully represent them but faithfully represent them over and over and over again which is not typically seen in the natural world in fact most of what our visual system does is to eliminate repetitive patterns when we see them in fact most of what our visual system does is trying make us a blind to repetitive patterns in our visual environment and only allow us to see things that are unusual in that visual environment now this is e specially true at visual scales what i mean by that as if you were to go to the beach and lie on your toward look down at the sand you would start to notice that the sand is a very very repetitive pattern at very small scales and in particular at molecular scales when you get down to level of atoms and forth everything is repetitive it is the same things just reproduced in different comminations over and over again but as we move through our world typically where not looking down at pebbles on the ground or little grains of sand or the pattern of leaves in a particular clover something of that sort most the time we are looking out on landscapes are at people's faces et camera and very seldom do we see highly receive patterns of that scale what ushers do is they essentially reveal to us a fundamental feature about the way that our visual system works which is that repetitive patterns tend to be come noise in our visual system that is are brain in codes repetition as things not to be interested in and the things that stand out against that repetition as the things to be interested in called signal to noise what pushers do is they invert the relationship between signal noise and they make the repetitive patterns the signal and the unusual patterns the noise in fact in every usher there are unusual patterns and those completely disappear to us now when you look at an usher what you probably see in what i see are just a bunch of birds repeated over and over again or buildings or staircases repeated over and over again and you may ushers and you may not that is not the point to day were not talking about taste in particular creative acts o were trying to identify here are the rules and mechanisms of what constitute something creative and whats creative and the key element here is that what is revealed by an either through these re repetition patterns is an inversion of the way that are brain normally in codes f visual images and therefore the rule that repetition is suppressed in our visual system and that unusual visual features are revealed to us that rule is what pops out to us when we look at an usher now when i say pops out i do not mean that you look at an usher and go oh normally i do not see repetition normally i see the unusual stuff et center et camera but there seems to be something about truly creative acts that capture the attention and sometimes the delight of many many people it is that they reveal a fundamental rule about how the brain or the world work let me give you a different example also from the visual art world let me give you the example of banks banks is an artist that many of you are probably familiar with and probably some of you are not familiar with for those who you that are not familiar with banks banks is an artist that most often does two dimensional art work these would be utensils or paintings or drawings many artists and does them in an urban landscape an actual city or suburban landscape that is he draws are utensils or graphemes in a very critic way i should say no one really knows who banks he is or when he does his art he just reveals his art by putting it up but he does this in the contact of cities and on three dimensional objects a good example would be he will stencil next to a phone booth a police officer or he will graphed next to an actual fire hydrant a dog lifting its leg to urinate on that fire hydrant now what is interesting about bankers is not simply the fact that he puts two dimensional art on to three dimensional surfaces in the urban an suburban landscape because if you think about it that is been done many many times before all grapheeti is that all sit art and murals is that what is unique about banks whits unique about banks or i should say bank sees the actual art is that he combines two dimensional art with a three dimensional landscape in a way that the concept pops out at you what do i mean by that well in the case of the dog lifting its leg to urinate on the fire hydra that is a see that most people and in fact most children are familiar with from cartoons ore from our basic understanding of the sterotep of dogs and must tell you having owned a male dog a bulldog costellofor many years hydrants were a particular target for hostelled of course everything was a particular treat for hostelled urinating outdoors none the less he to pe on fire hydrants that itself is not interesting seeing a photograph of a dog raising its leg to pion a fire hydra is not interesting seeing a painting of that is not interesting seeing an actual dog urinating on a fiehydran isn't interesting in fact seeing a painting in two dimensions of a dog raising its leg to of course it cannot ash urinate but give you the impression that it would urinate on that fire hydra is not particularly interesting except for the fact that it reveals to us something fundamental which is that we tend to pair visual relationships between different objects that share a common theme and then the theme tends to pop out us for instance the dog raising its leg next to a fire hydra even if the dog is drawn in two dimensions in the fire hydra is in three dimensions allows the concept of dog and fire hydra to emerge or pop out at us which reveals to us something fundamental about hour brain work which is that our brain incomes concepts and entire stories as symbols of interaction between different objects me give you a different example just to make sure that this hits home one of banker's more famous paintings is a rather politically charged one which is of a girl holding a bouquet of balloons and this two dimensional drawing was put on to the west wall dividing territories in the middle east a very controversial issue the controversies of that is sure not what i want to get into but i do not think anyone wo doubt that is a controversial issue the two dimensional drawing of the girl with the balloons on the actual wall turns out to be quite interesting as an art piece because what it reveals to us is the entire controversy around the presence of that wall and the desire for certain people to breach that wall and the desire for other people to insists that that while not be breached for whatever reason again this is not about the particular controversy the point is that a two dimensional image combined with a three dimensional structure allows the purpose of that three dimensional structure and the controversy around that three dimensional structure to pop out at us in a way that if for instance we had just seen a photograph of somebody next to that wall or with the latter or if we just seen a drawing of a girl holding a bouquet of balloons on a drawing of that wall to not emerge in other words it captures two fundamental features of the visual system our ability to into things in two dimensions and understand symbols and our ability to understand things in three dimensions and particular the wall is ha three dimensional object is really interesting because it is actual physical barrier showing it as the actual physical barrier that it is in real space in three dimensions turns out to allow the interaction between those two things the concept the controversy to pop out at us and make us think about that particular controversy an perhaps where we each individually stand on that controversy now there are many examples of what i just gave in the visual domain for instance a rothgoes which are just color on canvas are particularly interesting source of information about the way that the brain and cots color later all filling what exactly with that information is you may growth goes you may not but it'll tell you one thing when you look at a both go you are seen colors in a very different way than you would ever see colors in any other contact the fact that they do not have a frame typically and the fact that there is no white canvas allows the colors that you see to be novel hues of those colors that you will not see in any other context and in doing reveals to you what your brain does in order to understand and extract color now in the contacts of music for instance you will sometimes hear a street musician play a saw may be abobdillan song or let zeppelin song or pink flood song pretty closely pretty accurately to the way that song is played but of course that is not creative that is just the photograph or the accurate portrait of somebody is face or you may hear in a acoustic version of what is normally an electricatar song or electrical song or viceversa somewhat creative sometimes sounds even better than the original but not particularly creative however each in every one of us has a particular taste of music may be its classical may be its rock may be its pink may be its hippo within each of tho cobras i think all of us are familiar with hearing something for the first time and maybeven every time and there is something about the commination of the words and the music or sometimes just the music or just the words that allows some feature of it to pop out at us as particularly exciting and when we feel that excitement and we feel that it is really novel it is different thin what we have hard before i assure you what it is revealing to you is the way that your auditory system and often your auditory and your emotional system in codes information that you hear and again the rule that it is revealing is not splayed out for you for instance it is not told to you oh this is the way you normally hear and now you are hearing things differently sometimes it is the change in for instance in the way that words are accented of the way that sentences are constructed this often you will hear an hippo the way that sentences are constructed can be divided up not as normal declarative sentences the way that there typically written but the way that sentences are chopped up in and fractured reveals to us new meaning and in fact enhanced meaning about particular words that we would not see if it was written out as a paragraph and then sung is a script that would be the same as the one we would read again the point is that what is exciting and novel to you is just the way that you hear it but it is exciting and novel to you because there are circuits within the brain that when we hear or see or feel or experiments known elements in new ways that are truly creative the way that those neral circuits function is changed and when nerd circuits change the way that they function simply by way of what comes into our eyes our ears and the way that we experience our feelings there is the release of chemicals including the release of the chemical dooming and other neromodulators as well that make us feel both surprised delighted and this is very key excited in anticipation that we might see it again with the understanding in mine that true creativity involves the novel combination of some elements could be notes of music could be numbers could be visual elements lines or colors could be physical movements et camera but novel combinations of some things that reveal to us something fundamental about the way that or brain and or the world work and of course as i mention before that fundamental thing may or may not be consciously accessible to us we may not know what exactly it is that is novel to us but it feels novel end it feels true well with that understanding in mine we therefore can ask what are the underline principles and neral circuits that underlie the creative process another word process here is especially important in fact if there is one thing it'd really to impress on everybody is that when thinking about biology it is almost always better to think about verbs as opposed to nouns rather than think of creativity as a noun or somebody being creative as an adjective think about the verb creativity that is what are the steps required and therefore what are the cells and circuits and thoughts et camera required in order to be creative this element of thinking about verbs then allows us to say okay what are the various steps in coming up with a creative idea in testing a creative idea and then implementing that creative idea and in doing we find based on the scientific literature that they are basically three major networks within the brain each of which is responsible for each of the three steps to arrive at something truly creative the first nerd circuit involved in creativity is the called executive network this kind of a goofy name because the neural circuits that am about to describe do a bunch of other things as well but they certainly control what are called executive functions executive functions are functions that you and i to have which is our ability to govern our thinking in our behavior in very deliberate ways and that is largely accomplished through the use of the nerd circuitry that sits right behind the forebrain the called prefrontal quarter now the prefrontal quarter involves many different subregion it has a bunch of different parts just any country has different states et camera and provinces executive function involves the prefrontal quarter and some other nerd structures but forsake of this discussion elative function and the prefrontal quarter are mainly responsible for suppressing action that is for eliminating choices among the infinite number of choices that exist for instance of what colors to combine on a painting or what lines to draw or what notes to play or what movements to make in a sports endeavor what numbers to include in mathematics endeavor or what words and letters and syllables and sentences to include in writing a creative passage the second network is the called default mode network there is a lot of discussion now days about the default mode network as it relates to consciousness and meditation et camera the default mode network does many different things but in the contacts of our discussion about creativity the default mode network is really the network that starts being engaged when you close your eyes and start paying attention to what is going on in terms of your thinking as opposed to this sensory outside world and the default mode network is especially important for what is called spontaneous imagination now spontaneous imagination is something that you can try at any moment if you were to close your eyes and to trying not pay attention to the sounds around you but even if you do to just pay attention to whatever thoughts or feelings emerge when your eyes are close get by closing your eyes and shutting yourself off to the outside sensory world you start to engage much more of your brain machinery dedicated towards what is going on inside you called in terreception but also what your thinking about your thinking whether not your thoughts are complete or incomplete whether or not they are fragmentary in away that goes from one thought to another distantly in the past or present to future et camera depending on time of day how well rested you are how stressed you are how happy you are the default mode network will take you through a journey of different types of thoughts different types of feelings et camera the specific types of thoughts and feelings are not as interesting as the fact that when you close your eyes your essential engaging this default mode network which is essentially the network associate with imagination and imagination based on elements that exist only within your head that is within your brain and therefore must rely on memory of previous experiences as soon as you close your eyes you are shutting yourself off from the sensory world by definition you can no longer be bringing in novel experiences in that moment your relying on your library of existing experiences in your memory of those in order to imagine new things and you're doing this in the very and a are associative way you are not trying to imagine things is just whatever guitars to the surface o cases we have got the executive network which is involved in suppressing particular thoughts or actions we have the default mode network which is involved in imagination and the default mode network i should mention also involves us subregion of the prefrontal quartextical the medial prefrontal quarters but other brain regions as well and then the final element within the circuits underlying creativity is the called salients network the salient's network is a network of brain regions that involves areas such as the insula which acshlly has a complete map of your body surface as well as some information mapped there about what is going on in the outside world and how those combine with what is going on in your internal landscape that is within your body also brain region called the a c c or hinting souse me anterior lingulate quarters and the mig doll lot of information is mapped within the salients network about how we feel and how we feel in relation to things that are happening around us and within us and the saint's network has one main job which is to pay attention to what is most interesting either in the world or inside us in terms of feelings or experiences cases we have got three networks executive network which is there to suppress choices in terms of actions we could take but decide not to or things we could think about but choose not to or try not to the default mode network which is easily the catalogue or library of previous experiences that we have available to us that would act a sort of the pints on a pale or the possible o ingredients that could go into a recipe all of that has to again arise from previous experience d we cannot close our eyes and suddenly be able to access all the melodies that we have never heard before or all the our ideas and concepts and knowledge about music if we do not have musical understanding or visual understanding we really drawing up the library and that library tends to be rather disorganize a find of swirls around its not very structured unless we are actively trying to think about something and then we have the salients network which is the networks within the brain that decide or make choices about what is most interesting to pay attention to inagiven moment yes to those three networks work together to create things and when i say create things we gain have to really under score or definition of creativity creativity is a rearrangement of existing elements into novel combinations that reveals something fundamental about how we or the world works and this is very important it tends to be things that are useful now they can merely be useful because there entertaining or thrilling that can also have a particular utility or use in the world a piece of technology that is actually useful a a or a smart phone or computer actually has utility or a vehicle no there are creative acts that led to the formation of vehicles and computers et camera but the point is that just merely coming up with novel combinations of things wings on a fish tank that is not creative or it is not or creative in any kind of meaningful way because it simply not useful it does not reveal anything fundamental new or purposeful it does not allow us to think about or interact with the world or ourselves in novel ways whereas things people actions an ideas that are truly creative really change the way that we are able to access the world they act as portals to the world and to ourselves now you have some idea about the brain areas and networks involved in creativity but i want to be very clear that any time we talk about mechanisms and brain areas what is far more important than the names of those brain areas is an understanding of what they do if you could not remember the interior singular quarters or the fact that the prefrontal quarter is involved in executive function et camera that is fine it is less important that the names of things than you understand the action steps that those things take that is the verb actions that those particular brain areas engage in order to arrive at a particular end point in the in point were talk about today is creativity i want to discuss creativity in terms to what actually goes in to being creative and it turns out there just two elements and those two elements are now well understood from the perspective of psychology and fortunately the nor science well supports what the psychology says an vice verse and those two elements the go into coming up with a creative idea and then implementing or developing that creative idea into something real that you and the rest of the world can experience or divergent thinking and convergent thinking and divergent thinking and convergent thinking are very straightforward to understand divergent thinking is taking some now object or event in the world or sport or concept it could be running it could be a musical note it could be jumping it could be a particular collar on a piece of paper and asking yourself how many different things could that thing actually be you might say hell running is running but let us use divergent thinking as a way to illustrate what divergent thinking is if i show you a picture of somebody running say what you see and you say i see somebody running and then i might give you a divergent thinking task in these tastes are the same ones used in various experiments and i how many different things can you think about based on this picture that you see of somebody running now if you are able to engage divergent thinking you could say running to the start running away from a lion running towards somebody i love or may bayou have a more elaborate imagination and you could say running in front of a bus to grab a kid the kid does not get hip by the bus or running toward a concert because ism excited about the particular concert and than it starts to school into a story in other words divergent thinking involves taking one simple what we would call i negro science or psychology stimulus one image or sound et camera and c trying to radiate out from that as many different divergent situations properties characteristics events things from that one specific element any divergent think king task would involve exactly that it'd show you pictures or play you sounds er words were notes or describe to you events in history and trying see how many things can radiate out from that into diverse diverse even distant types of concepts and pictures whit case o that is divergent think divergent thinking is really the process that underlies idea generation end the basis of i divergent thinking is that more than one idea is correct in fact the more ideas that you have about one thing the better you are divergent thinking if i were to give you three minutes to list off all the things you can think about related to this pen that ism holding up for those youliieum us holding up a pen in front of me you are just rite them out or say them out over the next three minutes that would be an example of divergent thinking however if you just said black pen red pen white pen green pen et camera that is not very divergent thing it is only divergent in the contacts of color space and i say space that is just a can aboard speak for one particular domain of thinking whereas if you said red pen white pen essay pen in a door to hold the door open that some one can return to a building and you tarted spooling off a story related to that and why that was important while there you go divergent thinking is simply taking one element and coming up with many many answers and in the contacts of divergent thinking any answer goes but as we will soon learn not every answer is interesting and relevant that is not every answer help solve something or reveal something fundamental therefor not every divergent answer is truly creative the other aspect of divergent thinking that is really important understand is that the selection criteria are extremely vague and vast that is there are no constraints on what you come up with if i hold up this pen and you say arrange tan that is a perfectly valid divergent idea from this pen because you thought of it and it is distantly related however we have to remember are earlier rule if black pen and arrange tan are not linked up in our brain and the observers brain in any kind of meaningful way it is only interesting to you because you are the only one that understands the rule that underlies the link between this pen and arangto ten whereas if you come up with something different that somehow tells me and everybody else something interesting about pens or orangutans now that is a truly creative idea i do not have such an example in mind but later it'll give you some examples of how you can actually march down the path of divergent thinking and use that executive network to suppress certain options to cross off certain answers is again any answers valid but not all valid answers are interesting or useful and you can cross those off and arrive at the most interesting and truly creative answer couplemore things about divergent thinking divergent thinking largely taps into the net works of the brain they are involved in mental flexibility this is a different aspect of our prefrontal quarters which is not based on executive function and our ability to reduce options but rather areas of the prefrontal quarters that are available to generate multiple option and actually suppress context right to forget that pens are just for writing for instance and that pends can do other things hold the door open it is really a kind of an unusual use of a pen again none of these examples that ism giving are particularly interesting they are just design to get you to understand the underlying concept of divergent thinking and then the lasting that you know about divergent thinking s that divergent thinking involves a sort of exploration it is a wandering through of ideas that you already had in your library in your memory banks about pens and what pens could be related to and what pens ought not to be related to again what is really important about creativity is that there has to be the basic building blocks already existing within us this is why it important t understand that if you are somebody who really seeks to be creative you really do need to be somebody who forages for information and structured information in particular if you are to be creative the architect simply cannot come up with incredible drawings are plans for buildings without understanding how buildings are put together in the various rules that govern buildings in other words you cannot break rules that you do not understand i think in a in movies especially we have this idea in mind that of this limitless concept that or that we have these hidden geniuses that somehow have access to all the math knowledge without ever having done any formal mathectully a as flying back to from texts recently in goodwill hunting was on somebody is screen i do not ten to watch movies on the plain very often sometimes but not often and i was remembering n that moving of got this math genius a who is a janitor dam mite et camera and apparently just has access to all this knowledge it is a wonderful concept a a very vary i would say even exceedingly rare thing to occur in the world sure there people who seem have a natural talent for mathematics or for something else but this idea that there are a incredible geniuses among us that just spontaneously have much knowledge that is by far the exception rather than the rule of course and may not even actually exists ism sure some one put in the comments examples or this active exists more often than not what you find is that people who have extreme virtuosity in a given area put many many years into developing the basic substrates the basic building blocks of whatever it is their craft happens to be where they demonstrate virtuosity this is very important understand none the less divergent thinking is the critical element for initiating the creative process again thinking about creativity as a verb and divergent thinking involves taking some starting point in this case of pen and then radiating out from that in a fairly unconstrained what biology call a random walk just kind of wandering through your thought space and memory space about what could be related to this pen now on the lipide of creativity is the implementation of specific comminations of things and testing those to see whether not they are interesting relevant or delight us or other people or scare us or other people or thrill us or other people in other words a testing of whether not the some fundamental rule to emerge again i ism an repeat this many many times throat this episode and ism not going to apologized for that because i think it important understand that creativity is not just novel combinations there novel combinations of things that reveal something fundamental and that often pop out to us if not every time certainly most of the time that we see that thing it almost never seems to be the case of something truly creative dulls in its expression and that is because what it is repeating to us over and over again is this fundamental rule that normally we cannot see or hear or experience in the absence of this creative act the second part of creativity where things are tested and where truly creative elements are discovered is in convergent thinking and converge thinking is as the names suggests just the opposite of divergent thinking converge thinking would be for example if i give you an image or i tell you the fallowing things i say wing water an engine the concept that i happen have in mind is that of a plain that can land on water most plains do not land on water or not intended to land on water one would hope that their plain does not land on water unless it is a plain desire to land on water but in this case a plan that can land on water is one of the very few answers that can combine wing water an engine ism sure there are other answers their other convergent thinking modes that can take you to an answer that would be valid but there are not many and here what is really most important is that ism not asking you to spool out or to radiate out from these three things rather ism asking you to combine them in some way that make sense in the real world than indeed there are plans that can land on water and wing water an even combine within those things they are fundamental features they are in fact necessary but not sufficient for having a plan that can land on water a was that's just one example of convergent thinking and a converge thinking task would involve you being given a list of two or three or may been five different things and then for each of those two or three or five different things as quickly as you can to come up with a single answer that binds all of those in a real world concept that obey the laws of nature or physics in some way for instance you can just come up with some i you answer that said a a bird that on swallowed an engine and that happens to be a sea bird yet you could come up with that but that actually is not something that happens or is at h very typical at all and it seems kind of a a mishmash of things that are really just design for you to try an accomplish an answer rather than something real such as a plain that lands on water oke the point here is that divergent thinking is one aspect of our cognition of or thinking and convergent thinking is a very distinct aspect of our cognition in fact one of the critical requirements for convergent thinking is also to access our memory banks and are understanding about the outside world just as it were with divergent thinking but it requires more focus and more persistence in fact if we were to come up with a key rule for divergent thinking it would be you almost want to have just enough focus to remember what the initial object or thing that was mentioned was to keep that in mind that your answers do not become completely random but the more distant and everywhere in between that you can generate answers that is the things that are very close opens blacken reopen verses pen and doorstop pen acting as a doorstop to her one is very close reopen is very close to blacken doorstop is pretty far from blacken that is the ideas that you want to explore and undergo a range of exploration of different ideas whereas with convergent thinking you are really trying to bind these things together and the key element for convergent thinking is the aspect of persistence and focus and that is why convergent thinking in many ways feels harder than divergent thinking it feels there is an answer and i what o get the answer right and i cannot solve it is a puzzle and it is a puzzle that relies on very distinct brain circuits from divergent thinking which brain circuits well that is what we are going to describe next and again this is not just going to be a list of different brain circuits with different names doing different things that would not be useful to you or to me rather what you are about to learn is truly incredible what it is is we are going to talk about one single molecule dopamine which is a molecule most typically associated with motivation and desire and drive in feelings of pleasure in some cases but that actually resides within for different networks in the brain to day foregoing to talk about two of those networks and dopamine acting in one network directly underlies divergent thinking whereas dopamine in another brain network underlies convergent thinking and if at this point in this episode you think of get when am i get get the tools to understand creativity and how to be creative what i can assure you is that if you understand divergent thinking which hopefully now you do and you can understand what convergent thinking is and you can understand that dopamine is responsible for both divergent thinking and convergent thinking but through separate pathways well t en if you can understand how those two separate pathways work and how to engage them differentially therein lie the tools that you can use both to explore ideas in other words find what it is that could be creative and then systematically test each of those ideas for what is truly creative that is what meets the criteria for something that is novel untruly useful and informs us about something that we have never seen heard or felt before let's just take a moment to talk about the incredible molecule that is dopamine many people are familiar with dopamine from the concept of quoting q dopamine hits which is popular language describing the feeling of pleasure that we get from pretty much anything that we liker that we continue to engage in repeatedly some people talk about the dopamine hit that they get from somebody attractive that they taxing them back or the dopamine hit that they get from social made the dopamine hit that they get from sugar or the dopamine that they get from this or from that to be ones the concept of dopamine hits is not one that i favor because in general whenever people talk about dopamine hits typically their talking about activities such as social media which dopamine may be involved at some level but often it is the case that the behavior associate with that thing in this case social media is more of the compulsive nature rather than an active seeking of something with positive anticipation and that is really what dopamine is about at least in the context of one of its major functions in the brain dopamine is really about motivation and desire and movement and it make sense why motivation desire and movement would be linked up through a common in this case neuromodulator chemical dopamine because throughout evolution if we were excited for or motivated to pursue something we had to move in order to get it to obtain it and in general we can frame dopamine under the umbrella of dopamine tends to be involved in nerd circuits in the brain that are involved in processes that are taking us beyond the confines of our skin that is that motivate us to go do something in terms of action in the world now that statement might seem distantly placed from a discussion about creativity but is will learn a obit later one of the most useful tools for engaging creativity and becoming more creative is to think about action elements within a narrative that is things that we and others can do in order to discover new rules through actual movement that is a logic cryptic a forgive me but i promise it'll return to it later and i will make it crystal clear therefore for major circuits in the brain that use dopamine although i should mention there are additional circuits as well in fact your i even contain anurans that release dopamine that control the sensitivity of your eye different times of day delight et camera the for major circuits in the brain that you lies dopamine however are used for for major purposes and it'll describe what those are first of all is a neral circuit that uses do someone among other things but certainly realize on dopamine in a critical way to engage movement including give movements and we will return to give movements why they're important for understanding creativity may be even for generating creativity a little bit later the name of the circuit again is less important than what it does but the name of the circuit for those that want to know is the called negro trial pathway cave the substantial night is a brain area that is very dark that projects to an area called the dorsal stratum tat contains a munch of subregion again for those for you that really geek out on the stuff great you can learn these names and retain them in your memory if you do not care about names do not worry about it just discard the names but areas of the brain the body and peutanum in the dorsal stride and receive in put from the substantianigra in nuranatomy when we name something we say the origin of that thing and were it connects through negro trial tells you that there is a connection between the substantial night cause it came first nigrostridle and then striates where it ends up nigrostrital pathway is involved in generating bodily movements it is involved in e movements and it is actually a brain area that is engaged when you think about movement even just have a story in your mind about walking or a storing your mind about running ere storing your mind about driving this area is engaged very interesting brain area i that is the first circuit very important understand and allyl you right now that is the brain circuit that is engaged when you undergo divergent thinking no that itself should be interesting right even if you do not remember any of the names of the things i just told you that you have a brain circuit that even if you just think about walking it becomes more active and the dopamine is involved in that brain activity and if you recall divergent thinking involves taking a concept as boring as a pen and thinking about other concepts that could link up with that pen in some sort of way logical or illogical right the bridge could be completely abstracting and really fantastical with a bunch of different ideas in between a pen acting as the door stop because of some situation we you need o run down stairs in a fire and get back upstairs quickly to rescue somebody very divergent or is divergent as blacken to red pen but what is amazing is that that same circuit is the one that is involved in physical movement in generating and thinking about physical movement that turns out to be vitally important for tapping into the creativity process o really frame that up in your mind or commit end to memory now the second dopamine circuit associate with creativity is the one associate with convergent thinking which again is the kind of thinking where there is a specific correct answer it requires focus and it requires persistence and the name of that circuit again the name is notes important as what it does but the name of that circuit is the mess cortical pathway the mesicortical pathway is involved in motivation and it has an emotional component to now it we come clear in a few minutes why that emotional component is it l but this is a circuit that originates in a brain structure called the lateral eventual segmental area again bunch of words you can remembered if you want latter of even ventral segmental area or you can not worry about the name and it connects to the prefrontal quarters that area just behind the forehead and this mesocortical area is involved motivation and emotion and is critical for focus and persistence it is distinct from a very nearbiarea just sitting right next door the called mess limbic area which is involved in desire and feelings of reward and this is the area that is associate more typically with a fictive behaviors or compulsive behaviors we are on to leave out the discussion about the mesolymbic pathway for now because it is not critical to divergent or converge thinking and it is not critical to the process of creativity at least as far as we know but i mention it because it is the third in the for dopamanurgic circuits and then the fourth circuit certainly one have never talked abut before in this podcast which is does not mean anything except that we have not gottinto it yet is the tuboreau infrondibular pathway and that is the pathway associate with dopamine and your pituitary gland and the release of hormones in particular that travel to the very if you have ovaries or to your testes if you have testes and trigger the release of things estrogen and testosterone et camera dopamine is intimately involved in that circuitry again not the topic of today's discussion for to day's discussion we want to remember that there is a dopamine circuit called the nigrisstratal circuit which is involved in movement and divergent thinking and that alone should set a flag up for you wow just thinking about new ideas has something to do with movement with physical movement and the dopamine circuit that is the mesocortical pathway which is the one that is associated with motivation and emotion and that is the one required for persistence in focus for convergent thinking why am i telling you all of this about dopamine well it turns out that dopamine creates a certain number of responses in the brain and body when it is active in one or the other of these circuits and just forsake of simplicity i do not have to keep saying nigrosareatal and mess cortical here going forward ism going to talk about the dopamine circuit that is associated with divergent thinking or the dopamine circuit associate with convergent thinking and again divergent thinking in converge think are the two processes that have to occur usually first divergent then give converge thinking them back and forth and back and forth in order to arrive at something creative divergent thinking is about exploration converge thinking is about testing things in coming up with things that are the right answer that feel right and we will better to find what right means a little bit later but you already sort of no right in this context is when you have some combination of elements or some idea or some written passage or some music or some physical action that you just now this is r really novel and really cool or people see it or hear it or taste it and say this is really novel and really cool and they do not necessarily know why it is just different in a way that feels true now i realize that for some of you listening to this episode we are probably at the point along the pathway of concept in definition in mechanism that leaves you in a place of real wanting a tool and i promise that i am going to get into more tools but to satisfy you and to make sure that you do indeed understand that there are tools that can emerge from the information that you already now have in mind i do one a share with you one particular tool from their literature that has been demonstrated over and over again to support and build and enhance divergent thinking and i also one a share with you a tool that has been shown from the scientific literature to enhance convergent thinking because both convergent and divergent thinking are critical for the creative process now i should emphasize that some people out there either by training ore by genetics or by both will be naturally better at divergent are convergent thinking and in fact we now know in a kind of almost poetic kind of way that naturally occurring variations in genes which underlie naturally occurring variations in the percentage of dopamine in one set of brain circuits verses another do seem to relate to whether r not people are naturally good at divergent thinking or convergent thinking now that is a very nature based explanation for why some people are better divergent thinking another people are better convergent thinking nature and nurture is something that can never really be teased apart exactly because of course if some one has a natural proclivity for something based on their genes you cannot often separate that from their parents because we inherit our genes from our parents although even in cases where people are raised away from their parents through adoption et camera it is very hard to separate nature in nurture because somebody with a natural proclivity for things might engage in those things more et camera et camera the point is that for those of you that are very very good at divergent thinking or very very good at convergent thinking some of that might have been inherited but more than likely some of that depended on the kinds of activities that you engaged in in your early years in particular in the years between age five and twenty five and for those you that are aged between five and twenty five all i can say is please learn to engage both divergent can convergent thinking as much as possible because you will enhance your ability for both for those of you twenty five and older you can still enhance your ability to engage divergent in convergent thinking and the fortunate news the equalizer i should say is that regardless of whether not you are naturally better divergent o converge thinking or you required it through activities you need both in order to be creative what we know is that in order to engage divergent thinking we need access to our memory banks we need to come up with possibilities and those possibilities can only come from what is contain within our memory systems of our brain series the hippocampus et camera but the names again do not matter we just know that if we are going to come up with novel comminations of things are novel uses of things or totally new ideas about how objects or notes of music are foods or tastes or whatever can be combined we have to do that with are existing knowledge and yet what we need to do in order to engage divergent thinking is suppress what is called autobiographical narratives and in particular autobiographical narratives we need to discard with judgments about how certain comminations of things impacted us in the pass this it i think is what people mean when they encourage the exploration of creativity by called boundary exploration here about this allot and con of the self help and psychology literature and ism not at all disparaging of the literature although rarely does it define exactly how and why to go about being more creative in the or in this case to be a more divergent in our thinking they will say you have to take risks or you have to a suppress judgment how do you actually do that or there is a wonderful paper that talks about one way to do it one way to do it is what is called open monitoring meditation or even just open monitoring thinking and just to make what could otherwise be a some a somewhat complex section here very simple what it'll also tell you is that if you want to enchants converge thinking you can do that a number of ways but you can do that in particular but doing a different type of meditation or thought process which is called focus attention meditation let us talk about open monitoring meditation why it is useful for enhancing divergent thinking this critical element of the creative process first of all open monitoring meditation and focus attention meditation can be performed the exact same way physically it can sit there eyes close i do not care your in a disposition it does normally matter your lying down you are standing up you could in theory do open mongering meditation with eyes open and that would be an interesting variant on it but for sake of a the discussion right now let just focus on the study that talks about the specific tools and the way that they were used in the study the title of the paper that ism essentially summarizing is called open monitoring meditation reduces the involvement of brain regions related to memory function now right off the bat that should cure you to something interesting something about divergent thinking in open monitoring is related to suppressing memory bat as you recall just a few moments ago i said that in order to engage in divergent thinking you need to and o kill off the narratives of what has to be related to what and come up with new narratives you still need to understand possibilities but you need to forget prior understanding of what those possibilities have to be and start thing about what those possibilities could be and that it turns out in l suppression a certain brain areas open meeting meditation is typical done for about ten to thirty minutes although it could be longer and unlike other forms of meditation where you sit and concentrate on your breathing and trying to redirect your thinking back to your breathing or to your posture or to a a chant or a mantra open mongering meditation is simply a matter of having you sit there or lie down close your eye and to allow whatever surfaces in your mind to surface and what you practice is the practice of non judgment now non judgement itself is a obit of an distract theme because of course the women you say do not judge you and others start to judge is just the way that the brain works you say do not think about an elephant you thin about an elephant that is a perfectly natural you go to can edge of a a bridge or a cliff and you think about jumping off in though you do not please do not jump off and that is because it is part of the circuitry that is keeping you from jumping off as the thought about what would happen if you did open mongering meditation involves dedicating a certain amount of time where you close your eyes and whatever thoughts arise whatever emotions a eyes whatever ideas arise to watch those and take an inventory of them to just merely watch them show up and pass or may be become fixated on them for some period of time or may been just one for a long permit of time all of that is fine in other words whatever surfaces surfaces that is open mongering meditation and that we know from brain imaging studies and we know from measurements of dopamine and particular brain circuits and we know from people who train with open mongering meditation on a regular basis improves divergent thinking capability in terms of tools practicing open mongering meditation or what i would just call open mongering thinking is going to be immensely useful and this is actin opportunity new up something that i mention in our episode on meditation which goes deep into the different kinds of meditation involving focus inward and outward et camera you are welcome to check out that episode its a superman albedo come but the point is that rather than think about the word meditation which carries a bunch of ideas about what it is and what it is not and how to do it meditation is really just a perceptional exercise for instance you could do a meditation where you look at a single point on a wall for five minutes and redirect your focus to that single point on a wall over and over again every time your mind drifts as it no doubt would or to a tone in the room you and attend to that and redirect to that rather thing about as a meditation's really just a perceptional exercise that is all that meditation is open monitoring meditation is really just a form of perception where your paying attention your perceiving your thoughts without lying judgement to those thoughts or trying not to lay judgment to those thoughts and what people find is that they very quickly within a few days get better at doing open mongering meditation and fortunately within it just a few days and certainly within about a week or more of practice and it does not even have to be daily practice o although of course daily practice will ex elevate the process further people become significantly better at divergent thinking and that is because of the dopamine circuits and in particular along the nigressoratol pack pathway becoming more active and the wonderful thing is that when you repeat a practise and a particular hurry circuit is engage over and over again deliberately that marry circuit becomes easier to engage called burro plasticity i would encourage any of you that want to explore the creative process for whatever reason or get better the creative process dedicate some amount of time maybeven just five minutes every other day to doing this open monitoring meditation have tried this meditation its actually quite fun to you because at least to me it feels a lot easier than the meditation associated with converge thinking now the converge thinking meditation is he called focus attention meditation and that is also described in the same study and other studies of explored which particular brain net works it involves and i can just tell you that focus attention meditation which you can think of or it'd prefer that you think of just as a perceptible exercise involves sitting or lying down closing your eyes focussing either on your breath or some element of your body could be a the on the tops of your knees or the clasp of your hands it could be focusing on an auditory tone you could even do it eyes open and stere it of a point on a wall or a flame of light what it whatever it happens to be that allows you to redirect your focus to a particular location or idea or sound that is known to improve your ability to engage convergent thinking to quickly parse through or analyze a bunch of different choices and to persist in choice selection and therefore more rapidly arrive at the correct answer this is well established in in fact in the episode the i did with a wonderful guess doctor when sezuki from new york university she talked about how a daily meditation of about ten to thirteen minutes performed for about a weeks that what he explored that study greatly increases people's ability to focus and in fact their memory and that is exactly the point which is that convergent thinking as i mention before it requires persistence focus an access to specific memories if you are somebody who wants to get better focussing that is the meditation for you however because to day were talking bout creativity if you are somebody wants to get better divergent thinking any converge thinking the two elements of creativity that is i would encourage you to you a duel meditation that is a meditation that starts with open monitoring for maybe five to ten minutes and then transitions to focus attention for maybe five to ten minutes because the positioning of divergent thinking and then converge thinking close together more closely resembles what the creative process really is and what it typically involves most of us would love to have a situation where we can spend a morning or a day or a week brains forming just kind of brain throringwhatever we think about is fine that is divergent thinking whatever elements just throw them up on the white board we sometimes see people and companies doing this at retreats you friction people into a novel environment splits just forget all the rules unless just come up with new ideas about some thing new new uses of something new strategies in you and nothing is too crazy nothing's off limits and sure that is a a useful mention i called brain storming but at some point there is the requirement to cross off things and typically that is done later in the retreat or later in the meeting or later in the weekend and that is a wonderful way to approach creativity into try and be creative but not a lot of people train for that on a regular basis o what i just describe to you are research tested tools for training for divergent thinking in converge thinking and i would encourage people who are interested in being more creative to try and do these on a somewhat regular basis if not every day than certainly a few times a week or more certainly the more you do it the better you are going to get it that is well demonstrated in the literature and if you are somebody is very consistent doing may be five minutes of open mongering meditation and five minutes immediately after of focus attention meditation daily you can expect the you'll get very very good at these processes oh very very quickly now ism not going to go into a lengthy description of the different a lines of evidence that tat the corresponding areas of the brain are active in each of these different kinds of meditation but what i can tell you is that there been some beautiful what are called loss of function studies where particular brain areas are either depleted of dopamine or where dopamine in some cases i guess what we call gain of function studies although not the kind again of function studies associate with virology different gain of function studies where you enhance the level of dopamine in the brain what you find is that both divergent and converge thinking are enhanced when levels of dopamine are elevated now we are not necessarily talking about pharmacology here it turns out that there are other ways to elevate dopamine that make us better at divergent and converge thinking in particular by using mood and now it'd to talk about how what mood you are in when you happen to start a creative process or try in do a sort of training such as open mongering meditation or focus meditation how your mood relates to your level of dopamine at base line whet we call your isotonic as it is called meaning consistent or on going level of dopamine how that dictates whether r not you are going to be better at one particular aspect of the creative process or another and how you can enhance your creativity in the very short term very quickly using tools that are known to trigger additional release of dopamine which in some cases is good and in some ass is bad i should mention and in other words determine how you feel in one moment should dictate what sort of tool you should use in order to become more creative the relationship between mood and creativity is a fascinating one that is bridged by one main feature which is the amount of dopamine present in this nigrostrad of pathway and there's a really wonderful collect or measure of the amount of roaming that is active in that pathway that can be addressed non invasive in the laboratory as i mention the nigrosretol pathways involve in movement and in i blinking which of course is a movement it is not a movement of the sort that we typically think of when we think of movements but none the less it relies on dopamine levels in this pathway and in fact we can state very confidently that when dopamine levels are elevated the blinking reflex is more active people just blink more when dopamine levels are lower or less active in this pathway people tend to blink less blink frequency is a common measure in studies of dopamine within this pathway that relate to creativity the work thin em about to describe is largely the work of two authors who have done wonderful work and across several papers unfortunately for me their names are difficult to pronounce o i apologize to them in their relatives for am what is sure to be in correct pronunciation but that last names of these authors are their maven and home therein the netherlands chairmahenian home done a number of different papers or studies rather of the relationship between blinking mood and creativity in particular divergent thinking what they found is that if people are blinking fairly often and they measure their mood through subjective tests and if they were to do brain imaging which other studies have done they find is that those people can engage in divergent thinking very easily in other words being in a good mood facilitates divergent thinking ow some of you might immediately say well a if you are in a good mood you can con be more playful about the exploration about what could happen with these notes of music or these foods et camera but it is not obvious because it turns out that if your dopamine levels are very very high and this can be measured none evasively through the frequency of blank sort can be measured more invasive through brain imaging even through blood draws or other methods to measured opening if dopamine levels are very very high when you observe is that divergent thinking is actually very very poor now a naturally occurring truly pathological example this would be something manic by polar disorder where somebody is in the manic phase or somebody who has taken methamphetamine or cocaine what tends to happen is that they have lots and lots of ideas all of those ideas seem really exciting to them but if you were to talk to them for any given moment they would be very fixated on one particular tunnel of ideas and by being fixated on one particular tunnel of ideas the idea that there can a run for president to morrow this is a unfortunately typical of o people who have by dollar which is not to say that everybody runs for president is by dollar rather people who are by polar often have these delusions of grandeur that there somehow can be present simply because they decided to and that they were selected to do this et camera et camera ideas about themselves another people that are very constrained in the words not very divergent divergent thinking is favored by having elevated levels of dopamine but not too high that of course creates a conundrum how do how much dopamine you need and how to achieve those elevate levels of dopamine where leaving aside people who are suffering from a manic episode what chermahenian homely have discovered is that if people are in sort of a low mood they are not feeling grate may be their depressed but there does not feeling that grate they feel you know on a scale of one to ten around a two were a three may be for the probability that they will be able to engage effectively in divergent thinking is quite low however the good news is they are typically very susceptible to elevations in mood through observing or hearing positive stories listening to music that they any kind of called inspirational stimuli now this is good news what this means is that if your somebody is not feeling very motivated to engage in divergent think you are to feeling very creative feeling a low the thing to do in that case is actually to take external stimuli things that that you and start interacting with those stimuli to get your mood elevated and then to engage in divergent thinking however what chermheni and homely have also shown is that if people are already in a very good mood elevating dopamine further is not conducive and in fact is detrimental to divergent thinking and in that case they would be better off for example not engaging in any activities or taking any thing in the way of pharmacology that would further increase their dopamine and probably limiting the amount of external stimuli that are coming in through music and visual stimuli and really focussing on divergent thinking in the creative process immediately now this is important in an earlier episode both on by polar and on other forms of depression i talked about how rates of by polar manic episodes and dopamine levels and creativity tend to be correlated now unfortunately rates of suicide are twenty to thirty times higher and people who have by polar disorder as well and there is a whole dark side to but the by polar disorder that makes it a very very dangerous and important disorder to treat but for sake of the discussion of creativity what this means is that we all mean to develop some sort of intuitive sense as to whether or not our mood is suppose we could bin this into three categories is kind of yes happy excited positive mood and of course their on be levels to that lo anlikmon or in o much can of ben the middle if you are in a low mood or can am mood by all means engage in something probably for about you five to thirty minutes that elevates your mood before trying to engage in divergent thinking however if you happen to be in a pretty positive mood even if you aren't ten out of ten on mood then bringing in n additional stimuli to increase your levels of dopamine will not help you and in fact can hurt the divergent thinking process in that case i would also encourage you to think about something that was discussed on a previous episode which is the particular effects of affine it'll get into affine a little bit later but just very briefly affine increases levels of dopamine receptors it is not the affine is bad in fact faffing can be near ow protective it can enhance focus and forth but divergent thinking is sort of anti focus it requires just enough focus to be able to come up with new ideas but you ache do not want to be overly focus focus is more conducive to converge thinking in fact that is exactly what the literature shows is that affine because its effects on apineferon and related systems in the brain a decisive but mainly because of its effects on persistence and focus is very conducive to convergent thinking if you're somebody who wants to explore creativity and want to get better creativity you now know that you need to engage in divergent thinking and then afterwards convergent thinking i would recommend not using stimulants such as affine prior to divergent thinking but rather use stimulants if you do want u stimulants such as affine prior to converge thinking and in fact in formulating the architecture of to day's episode which took me many hours across many different days i confess i actually decide to try this in trying to imagine the different configurations and ways that this information can be organized i deliberately abstain from coffin during those bouts of work and when structuring everything according to the decisions i had already made i purposely in just affine prior to that now of course constructing a podcast episode is not a really the ultimate example of a creative act because of course it is taking existing information it is arranging it a novel ways but it does not necessarily allow key concepts to pop out in the way that for instance a banks or a rothgo or an usher a would pop out oke i ism certainly not naive in thinking that it does but the principle of is what is important here you need divergent thinking u need convergent thinking you need some level of elevated dopamine in order to engage in divergent thinking but not high that it starts to in him it that process now if you were to come into the laboratory this could be measured by your frequency of blinking for better for worse we cannot actually count the number of times that we blink unless we are actively ping attention to i i do not recommend he you pay attention to your blinking is that will take you off course from all the other importanthings of your life a and how many times you are blinking is rarely an important thing for you to pay attention you can however learn to calibrate your mood that is to access your mood whether not you are in low medium or his mood no problem using the that broad binning right you could scale it on one to ten and then decide whether not you are going to use some dopamine elevating stimulus from the outside again could be music could be exercise is an excellent way to elevate dopamine it'll talk about another well established one from the from the research ligature that is now to elevate dopamine by sixty five per cent in the particular pathway that is relevant for divergent thinking and to do that without any pharmacology it'll share that with you in a moment but you need to decide for you in given moment or in a given work attempt at creativity what you need and apply accordingly because as cherameni and home have shown whether not you are in a low mood medium mood or high mood really can determine whether not you will be able to access divergent thinking or not now if your somebody who already has an idea in mind you are very excited about a creative idea and you want to hon it you want a shape it you want a pressure test it will talk a la bit more about what that means in a threestep process an just a little bit i would strongly encourage you to look at that process is a very linear process in which there are right and wrong answers and there the use of affine at appropriate dosages and dosages for affine that are safe and in fact performance enhancing recovered in the episode on coffin turns out it is one to three milligrams for kilogram of bodysuit by the way and if you want to leverage affine or make even other forms of healthy legal stimulants those are covered in the affine episode it'll talk about a few more elicit later to sunrise this segment and also just to make a more general point i think it is very useful for people to start to pay attention to what there tonic level that is their baseline level of dopamine ought to be in this nigrostrit will circuit any another circuits and to do that by learning to assess one's mood and pay attention to what kind of mood they happen to be in and then to leverage tools behavior tools may be pharmacologic tools provided their safe in their legal in order to either increased dopamine or to elect not to increase dopamine in order to access the creative process now give mention pharmacology a few times it'd to talk about that just a little bit more in the context of dopamine first of all there is no supplement or drug that you or any one else can take that will selectively elevate dopamine in only one of the fore circuits that i described before and this is just the state of the technology nowadays if you take a pill or even if you were to inject some substance again i the be legal om it and safe et camera whatever motive delivery there is no technology that exists at this time that would allow you to selectively amplified dopamine for instance just in the nigrostriat of pathway or just in the mesicuortical pathway again the nigrostratal pathway associate with divergent thinking the musicortical pathway associated with connive persistence in converge thinking if you were to amplify dopamine levels for instance by taking the monoacid precursor to dopamine el tyrosine something that i occasionally do to enhance dopamine levels for sake of work or energy five hundred milligrams or a thousand milligrams even of el tyrosine sometimes it'll combine that with other things along p c it is going to enhance dopamine transmission in the nigrostraatal pathway ay them us a cortical pathway but also in the musolymbic pathway and also for that matter in the tubers infer fibular pathway associate with the pituitary there is no way to direct dopamine activation to just one of those pathways that is just a reflection of the existing histology now this is also true if you rely on a elicit drugs to increase dopamines of its cocaine or methamphetamine those will greatly increase dopamine but nonselective across all those different pathways and likewise with any drugs that inhibit or block or antagonizes its called dopamine this is why people who for instance have schizophrenia and take drugs to suppress auditory hallucinations some of those drugs work because they block the local get receptor of the dopamine pathway get receptors are present in all four of the dopomenurgic pathways in the brain and oftentimes those drugs will in fact suppress psychotic symptoms auditory hallucinations et camera because they reduce dopamine but those people oftentimes will have problems with movement they will express whats called in the clinical literature arrive discinesia kind of writhing of the face the body from suppression of dopamine within the nigrostrital pathway which is associate with movement they will sometimes have deposits in i blinking people with parkinsins who actually have selective deposits of dopamine within the substantial night nigrostrido remember substantial night show deposits in what in movement in the governess of movement oftentimes they will not blink at all through have kind of a blank stare and they have other issues as well if you are somebody who is interested in increasing dopamine through the use of legal safe pharmacology i would hope it would be the case there always to do that reasonably safely for most people again people with by polar disorder or issues with the dopomenurgic pathway should not do this i know nowadays there is a lot of use of drugs that increase dopamine such as riding overall modaphanel armodaphnel often prescribed for things attention deposit hyperactivity disorder we did entire episode on amity and pharmacologic prescription supplement and behavioral nutritional tools radio can find that episode a hubrmen lavhdok calm i know a number of people take those compounds in order to increase dopamine and focus forsake of studying or other activities staying up long hours et camera and the fact that they increase focus they are effective although they do have their side effects sometimes severe sometimes habit forming sometimes even addicting as well but the fact that they increase focus should automatically tell you something that those drugs particular increase dopamine in the called mesocortical and mesolymbic pathways why can i say that how can i say that with any degree of confidence well there these four pathways ones involved in movement but these other ones are involved in motivation and desire and reward and i told you that these things can be habit forming an addicting in some cases and they are can greatly in ease focus and focus is supported by enhance levels of dopamine within this mesa limbic and mesocortical pathway yes those drugs increased dopamine across the board but there does seem to be some waiting of dopamine toward the systems involved in motivation and reward in sometimes even leading to habit formation and addiction that is why those drugs should only be takin with the close supervision of a very skilled psychiatrist or somebody else whose board certified who can really govern that there are however ways to increased dopamine more evenly across the board using non prescription approaches and one i already mention which is altyirasine taken typically in dosages of five hundred to a thousand milligrams eltyracine is not as potent in increasing dopamine as are the prescriptions drugs that i referred to before tends to be milder for some people it can have a very amplified effect they feel it right away its very intense in elevating focus and motivation and the desire to move for other people its less potent it really depends on a number of things i should mention that regular consumption of affine of one to three milligrams per kilogram bodywat per day also will increase dopamine receptor efficacy and density which will make any existing dopamine more effective whether not that dopamine is triggered by things they altrasine or if you are not taking anything to elevate dopamine the dopamine that you do make will be more effective in elevating your move motivation and desire to move and by extension divergent thinking if you are consuming affine but again affine should be taken prior to convergent thinking type task probably more than it should be taken prior to divergent thinking tasks and of course there other legal supplements that can elevate dopamine as well in particular final methylamine is very effective in doing that six hundred milligrams it that has a brief effect lasting only about thirty to forty five minutes but it is one that many people find beneficial for sake of studying or for creative thinking and on and forth now that is formacology and in fact there is an extensive landscape of prescription and supplembase pharmacology and indeed nutrition for instance the consumption of foods that are high and altyrasine such as aged paragon cheese for instance of all things very very high and altyrasine the precursor to dopamine certain foods you can look up on line which foods contain high levels of altyrasine in which ones are compatible with you are nutrition but leaving pharmacology aside there is a very exciting non pharmacologic tool a purely behavioral tool that the research literature has told us can selectively increase dopamine within the negro strata pathway the pathway that is involved in divergent thinking and can dust very dramatically as much as sixty five per cent above base line and this is a behavioral tool that is useful for a number of things but that i find particularly interesting in leveraging towards the exploration and enhancement of creativity because first vaults purely behavioral its zero cost and it involves nomen population of brain nermogulators or chemistry through pharmacology it something that you can explore very safely and certainly not having to purchase anything and what is really remarkable is the selectivity or i thin it is fair to say the immense selectivity that this particular behavior intervention seems to exert on opening within this pathway associated with divergent thinking the study that ism about to describe is e study the dates back twenty years now that should not concern you in fact the early arrival of this study or what now seems to be early arrival was not that long ago is really exciting because the first line of this study really illustrates how important or how much of a landmark study this really is and sal just read you the first line of the study then it'll ell you the title then it'll tell you what they discovered in fairly top contour and we will providing to the study if you want to peruse it in more detail the first line of the study is this is the first invite just meaning in the organism and this was this was a study on humans this is the first invite demonstration of an association between an indigenous nor transmitter release indigent means within us and conscious experience what the sentence essential says is this is the first study exploring how a chemical that is naturally released in our body relates to a particular quality of conscious experience this study was performed in scananavia in one of the hospitals in denmark again will provide a length the first author is are i think ism pronouncing it correctly although probably not k j a e a at all and the title of the study is increased dopamine tone during meditation induce change of consciousness and i want to just highlight that the meditation used in the study is not really a meditation at all i do not know why they selected that for the title the behavioroprotocal used in the study was more akin to what is normally called yoga near or nest are non sleep deep rest now yoganedra and amnesty are have been discussed many times before on this podcast yoganedra for instances it practice that is been around for hundreds if not thousands of years in which people deliberately lies still there forcing themselves to be mostly motionless small movements are fine and their directing their attention to the surface of their body either doing long avail breathing sometimes some intentions sometimes some visualization but it is really self directed relaxation and the key component is that people stay awake and engage in very little movement and the keycard there is movement now non sleep deep rest it is a acronym a term that i coined it is not a term that i coined in order to trying to wipe away or discard with yoganedrama person who has great respect for yoganedra and its traditions it is a term that a i coined in order to encompass a number of practices that do not include any mystical type language or scientific language for that matter and that does not involve intentions involves deep relaxation yet remaining wide awake unconscious sometimes people fall asleep and that soke but this is really an a typical brain state of being deeply relaxed yet in general awake and motionless again motionless being the key very few brain states involve us being motile if not completely motionless and yet awake and it turns out that brain state whether not you call it yoganedra you call it antiar whether not you call it meditation induced shift in consciousness as they did this study although they do refer to yeoganedra all refer to the same thing which is being motionless and yet aware and relaxed i should mention in this study what they did what they brought subjects into the laboratory they had them either undergo this self directed deep relaxation while they are motionless are mostly motionless or they had them listen to an audioscript while also just lying there with eyes closed and then they used a number of a chemical tricks and no one to get too deep into those now cause they can below distracting for those of you their interested you can look at in the study this is a a binding of a chemical in the brain that then they can image with brain imaging which is what they did in the study to a valuate how much dopamine changed in the brain and were specifically in the brain dopamine changed its levels before during and after this particular behavioral practise in one or the other group and what they discovered is that people who did this deep relaxation that is self directed deep relaxation lying their eyes closed relatively motionless although small movements of the body or a movements of the head are absolutely fine what they observed was a sixty five per cent increase in dopamine release now here its key dopamine release and they observed and increase in called that activity theta activity is a pattern of brainwave activity that is commonly associated with creative states in divergent thinking in particular that is important and they observe that across subjects specifically in the nigrostrate or pathway this pathway associated with divergent thinking this is very exciting this is a study that really points to a behavioral tool that can be used to selectively elevate dopamine in the very pathway that one would want to if they wanted to engage divergent thinking forsake of creative exploration there are also a number of key observations within the study first of all the reduction bodily movement was essential in fact when people rated grand when the amount of readiness for action in their system their body was evaluated what people found was that immediately after this practice they felt very still in other words they felt as if remaining still was natural now it is not the case that they could not move in fact the elevation an dopamine that occurred during this practise this yoganedra non sleep or ancestor practice actually prepared them to be able to move in a much m or a dedicated and robust way afterwards but during the practise their readiness for action when waylay down not surprising they were pretty much motionless but interestingly as the level of readiness for movement went down down down down down there degree of visual imagery that is there internal landscape and their ability to imagine new things increased and in fact areas of the brain that are associate with visual imagery such as the visual or called occipital quartan in the bridal quarter has been shown another studies to ramp up when people are motionless there seems to be this inverse relationship between movement and visual imagery which make sense when we are moving we can pay attention to things in the outside world we tend to be aware of our sensory environment to varying degrees but we do not tend to be very focused on visual imagery within our head whereas when we lie down or sit down and close our eyes and we are motionless the degree of visual imagery really increases hence the increase in divergent thinking because what essential is happening is the library of options the library of possible interactions with whatever it is that you are thinking about i give the example which is a trivial one on purpose of a pen but the bank of options that becomes available when we are motionless and when we are limiting are visualization of the external world increases exponentially this is important in what it points to is the fact that this very simple completely non cortical logic behavioral practice of lying down motionless for some period of time and i confess the amount of time that they use in the study was quite long it was longer than sixty minutes but all the data that i am aware of in terms of enesdiar and yoganedra ad there is a growing body of literature on the these practices i should mention show that even ten minutes or even better would be twenty or thirty minutes of lying motionless with eyes closed and allowing the mind to drift wherever it happens to go but focusing on replacing by doing long exam breathing perhaps doing a body scan of focusing your tension on particular body parts but not keeping it focused on any one particular body part for that long that general practice of deep relaxation while awake and being relatively motionless really favors the brain states associate with diverging thinking and actually represents an accessing of the various components that you would use during divergent thinking and perhaps most excitingly it is associate with this massive increase sixty five per cent increase in dopamine release within the very pathway that under lies divergent thinking my recommendation would be for those of you that are trying to enhance divergent thinking in creative ability that you would do this practice at a minimum once per week and i should say if you were going to do at once per week it'd recommend doing it for about twenty to thirty minutes some of you might be able to do it for as long as sixty minutes i myself do such a practice on a daily basis anywhere from ten minutes to twenty minutes sometimes thirty minutes there is an example of an eyes dear script completely a zero out i confess it does happen to be my voice a forgive me a in advance there are other options of nest arguing go to tub put n s d r and my name again completely zero cost you can get it sample of what a ten minute a antiar script looks that a through virtual put that out there i think you virtus an for putting that out there t zero cost there are examples of twenty and thirty minute a antiar scripts and yeoganedr scripts some that i particularly we will also provide a link to some of those again those are completely zero cost for you to explore but more important than you follow any one particular yoganedra and sit a script is that you learn to take your body and brain into these states of limited motion elevated dopamine within this particular pathway and fairly deep relaxation again if you happen to fall asleep that is not necessarily a bad thing although the ideas that you stay in a shallow plane of consciousness or sleep a hence the term non sleep deep best not in any event i think this is a very useful practice that many people could benefit from in the fact that at zero cost in purely behavioral i think adds a additional benefit because it certainly one that people could explore depending on what a amount of time you refilling to commit and the research state on this a now extend beyond this one individual paper and i think is really exciting because what it says is as the title and first line of the paper suggests is the we can increase dopamine using specific types of meditation induced consciousness and those increases in dopamine can be used to increase our ability to be more creative before moving forward i want to make absolutely clear how it is that you would use an it r a k a yeoganedra or similar the name does not really matter after all the practice is what matters in order to enhance dopamine in this nigrostrato pathway and enhance divergent thinking the key thing to understand here is that the period of motionlessness and deep relaxation will awake increases dopamine in the nigrostrital pathway it increases mental imagery that is it increases access to the bank or the library if you will of possible solutions or elements to engage in the divergent thinking process but divergent thinking itself does not occur during an s t r a k a yoganedra the enestiar and yeoganedra deep relaxation meditation whatever it is you want to call it sets a dopaminergic tone and that is actually the appropriate use of the word dopamanergic tone it raises the baseline of dopamine transmission in that circuitry that then positions you to engage in divergent thinking more effectively the idea would be to do anywhere from ten to twenty maybe thirty minutes maybeven as much as an hour depending on how much time you had to dedicate of such a meditation an sit a practise and then not angrily immediately but within the five to fifteen minutes following then to go into a practice of divergent thinking and start doing creative exploration that is to start thinking about different ways to combine existing elements in whatever domain it is that you want to achieve creativity the point is that the divergent thinking itself is not occurring during the amnesty are or yoganedra practise the enistearn yoganedr o practice prepares you for divergent thinking that you do in the hour or hours that follows and just ta contrast that with pharmacology i am not aware of any specific doomed related pharmacology that would allow us to selectively increase dopamine in the very pathway associate with divergent thinking in creativity now there are forms of pharmacology that kin shift brain narrow transmitters an demodulators in ways that favor creativity and this is certainly atomic that we will go in to in more depth than a future episode but there is an exciting study that was performed just was last year looking at the roll of serotonin another demodulator in divergent and converge thinking and it turns out that serotonin underlies a lot of the brain activity that is responsible for both divergent in for converge thinking and there is one particular forgot pharmacology which can enhance activation of the sertenergic pathways associate with the called five h t that serotonin five h t that is the abbreviation five t to a receptor serotonin to a receptor in particular brainareas in ways that favor both divergent and converge thinking and the pharmacologic agent in that case turns out to be very loose or a some of you may have heard of it referred to as microdosing of sylicibon now i do one to say because it'll be entirely inappropriate for me to not say this that in most areas of the world and particular in the united states scylicibon is still illegal it is not legal in some are it has been decriminalize and there are a number of different clinical trials occurring now at john's hoping at stampford at universal calfornia samrasis go and elsewhere exploring sylicibon for the treatment of depression for drama for eating disorders most of those studies focus on macrocosms of sylicibon not microdosing there r far fewer studies of microdosing of sylicibon and i do have to point out that sylicibon use on and possession and of course sal is still illegal i would be emissive i did not state that however i will provide a link to the study that shows that microdosing f sylicibon for a series of weeks on a daily basis these are dosages of sylisibon that do not induce hallucination and do not massively shift mood or internal states in any way that has people feeling the are acting or feeling that much different although some people do report a subjective shift does seem to increase divergent thinking ability but i do want to put a big astray highlight and an underline pen beneath the statement ism about to make which is that pharmacology of the serotonin system just as pharmacology of the dopamine system is very broad band it is a shotgun approach are going to hit all the circuits of the brain that involve ceremonial with microdosing sly lesion although has some selectivity for the five ah t to a receptor it can attached to other receptors is well an act there is the same reason why excess rise selective ceremony rep taken visitors can indeed shift mood and appetite but connalsor shift libido and other things it is because their ceremony receptors everywhere er i should say many places not just in the carries of the brain their associate with mood for instance and as i mention before agents whether or not they are recreational or elicit drugs or prescription drugs or supplements that increased pagan will also be broad abandon hit a number of different circuits in parallel this is why i always say behavioral tools really should come first i do not say that because i dislike pharmacology said that because in many cases behavioral tools are not only safer and easier to titrate to adjust the duration et camera then is pharmacology but also because they can sometimes as in the case the study the is described afford you more specificity not less then pharmacology pharmacology has its place can be wonderful provided safe and legal et camera but it can cause a lot of called off target effects for those who the interesting increasing creativity through pharmacology i would say stay tuned for the data on sylicibron and microdosing sylicibon if you are absolutely obsessed with the idea of microdosing sylicibon for enhancing creativity and you to go straight to the study i will tell you what that study is and therefore you can access some of the specifics and terms a dosaginan protocols et camera since it cannot help my selfloges very briefly summarized that microdosing psychedelic study the title is study which was publishing two thousand eighteen is exploring the effect of microdosing psychedelics on creativity in an open label natural septic a interesting title this was a microdosing even to organized by the dutch psychedelic society they examine the effects of psychedelic truffle where they knew what sorts of psychedelic compounds were contain there on two creativity related problem solving task the picture concepts which i do not expect you to recognize or no but it assess is convergent thinking and the alternative uses task which i also do not expect you to know but is a standartass for accessing divergent thinking they tested once before taking a microcosm and while the effects were expected to be manifested they say interesting they use the word manifested in a study of psychedelics science is changing indeed in any case what they found was an enhancement of creative that is divergent and converge thinking not surprising giving the fact that the five ah t to a receptor activity is increased by microdosing a sylicibon and five ah t to a receptors are present both on the naval car its the underweight divergent and convergent thinking again this is not a plug for microdosing syliciban this is really in response to what i know will be a number of siren questions about what sorts of fharmoclogic agents can be used to increase creativity more on that later and again will provide a link if you want to read that study in more depth i can imagine that a number of you are probably also wondering about the effects of alcohol in the effects of canabuts on creativity we did a long depth the episode all about alcohol in its effects on health the bottom line on alcohol is that in excess of two drinks per week you are starting to run into the cancer promoting and toxic effects of alcohol i did not choose for the answer to be that but that is what the data tell us not telling i you cannot drink more than two drinks per week come just saying that you're going to do that you should really consider offsetting that with some other behavior measures all discussed in the episode and aldol and despite what people think there is absolutely zero zero evidence that alcohol increases creativity however by way of reducing activation of the prefrontal quarter there is some evidence that alcohol and other substances that reduce what called autobiographical scripting that is a narrative about ourselves s or self awareness that it can enhance divergent thinking at very low doses this makes sense divergent thinking involves remembering certain things that we can use as elements in the creative process but suppressing narratives about what the use of those would mean will people it will they not it will t lead to the alcove we want will it will not all of that autobiographical scripting involves the forebrain being very very active and specific regions the fore brain in particular and that all needs to be suppressed which alcohol in very looses can accomplish but again that is not a plug for alcohol hi think of behavioral tools would be much better rout but it therefore should be surprising why some people have used logos aldol in order to engage in the creative process because involves less inanition or sense of self that and be detrimental to the divergent thinking process now with respect to cannabis i went in depth into the biology and the various uses misuses dangers end in some cases benefits of cannabis use in certain keewhere there is certain populations and i also dove into weather not canabusts can be used to increase divergent in convergent thinking that is time stamped in that episode all were free to that episode but the long and short of it is that many of the ideas that people come up with when under the influence of cannabis in particular hit containing minibus does lead to enhance divergent thinking but enhanced it turns out that oftentimes those ideas cannot be constrained by the converged thinking process an motherworts they e lots of ideas that make sense while under the influence of cannabis but that later cannot be simple rented into a coherent frame work that leads to any actual creative endeavor or creative product or as is often the case with minibus they simply cannot remember what they were thinking about any time there is a discussion about dopamine there seems to be a discussion about motivation desire and driven f course that make sense given the rolls of dopamine we did not entire episode on opening motivation and drive its one of our most popular episodes again you can accuse that with timestamps in all formats at suberin labedout come an any time there is a discussion about dopamine and motivation we also seem to have a lot of questions about attention and focus and eighty eight or attention dephisat hyperactivity disorder in particular just as a brief mention there is a literature although not terribly extensive a small but strong literature on the relationship between eighty eight and creativity and the long and short of that literature is that people who have eighty eight regardless of age do seem to have an ability to focus have mention that in the episode on eighty high s provided that they are interested in the thing that they are focusing on that runs counter to this idea that people with eight eight sh simply cannot focus they can but it tends to be a focus that selective for things that they are very excited about or interested in as supposed to a general ability to focus what is also highly under appreciated is that people who have eighty t often times are very effective at divergent thinking but are less effective at convergent thinking what this tells us is that people with eighty can often have excellent novel and indeed creative ideas but that the implementation of those creative ideas is sometimes challenge and that is one reason to explore rational pharmacology nutrition supplementation et camera those or all things to explore in concert with or i should say in working closely with a board certified physician or ideally pcychitros expert in eighty eight can also check out the episode that we did on eighty eh we their lot of tools there not of science mention there to support those tools again you con find that humdrum labor come but i did think it was important to point out even if briefly that having it t is not a barrier to creativity in fact may actually be an enhanced portal to creativity but that it does not allow people to access the convergent thinking that allows creative ideas to be implemented into specific strategies pressure tested and eventually delivered in the form of a final product of music art et camera that is not to say that people with eight eight s cannot accomplish that but that it is going to require some additional steps and protocols in order g to enhance convergent thinking and that episode an the episode that we did on focus and in particular tools to enhance focus is very much directed at ways to enhance convergent thinking if you have ad for know somebody who does in interest in the creative process or focusing generally please check out the episodes that i mention there is also a small but none the less very exciting literature on the relationship between physical movement and divergent thinking this should come is no surprise to us as mention many times now in this episode the nigrostrito pathway involved in divergent thinking that involves opening is also responsible for blinks and for movements of the limbs of the body in very deliberate ways this tells us that there is some direct or may be indirect relationship between movement of the body and divergent thinking and despite the fact that it is only a few studies there have been some studies of whether not people are able to engage in divergent thinking more effectively when they are doing things pacing or walking and this count be on a tread mill or back and forth across the room and in fact that is absolutely the case if you are somebody myself who tends to have their best ideas not saying that my yeas are always terrific but that among the ideas i have some of the better ones arrived to me while on my long sundae run iron to long rune or hike on sundaes sometimes with e light weight vest or something of that sort but when ism in a state of essentially not directing my attention to any one thing in my external environment this is extremely key for reasons that now should be obvious any time we are directing our attention to a visual target ere in auditory target we are not as able to engage in divergent thinking this is why i will sometimes listen to pod casts or to audio books while i go on these runs but for portions of these runs or highs intend to turn those off and just focus on the movement and focus on not focussing on anything in particular and oftentimes i will stop and wright down ideas that suddenly or seemingly suddenly a appear to me or or guise to the surface it'll have an idea sometimes those a good ideas sometimes less good ideas the fact that that happens for me in that fact that many people are pacers or runners are come up with their best ideas while in the shower or while engaging in activities that do not require a lot of sensory attention to one specific location either visual or auditory et camera that is because it engages these nigrostradol pathways through movement which then opens up this library of ideas and allows the intersection of different ideas that normally would be constrained to separate categories one way to think about this by analogy would be an was kid you would go the library and now days to so on line but the different pages of different books on different topics are kept distinct from one another that is bound by different book covers and book ends different shelves in the library it is as if different pages and elements from those books are now being combined in a pseudo random not random but in a pseudo random way and in that commination new possibilities about ways that information could be combined an implemented start to arise the tool that emerges from this is very simple and it will not necessarily apply to everybody but if you are somebody who finds that just sitting in a chair and trying to be creative is very challenging some of you might benefit from for instance if you are engaging in writing or you want to writ to talk into the voice recorder of your phone while walking or simply walking and not attending to any one specific thing visually or through phones and then as ideas surface seemingly out of nowhere which is how it happens that you could either put them into your phone by voice dictation or you could type them out if you the anything is to not be distracted by other things in your phone not to start going on to social meteor doing phone calls or looking at texmesages because that by definition is going to take you out of this o what the biologist call a pseudo random walk and this pseudorandom element is extremely important we know for instance that many circuits within the brain have whats called dedicated point to point wiring fer insane the brain circuits that govern your breathing the brain circuits that govern your heart beat the brain circuits that govern your specific movements once you are and adult and allow for smooth directed movement are very precise very little slop if any in the wiring however there are aspects of your brain circuitry yours and everybody ease's i should say that are maintained into adulthood that include a lot of extra wiring and this these are fine wires of not the major highways between different areas if you will the sore gugomaps has highways and streets and little little passages and alleys but it is as if there is a little web of additional possible pathways cast over that entire thing the human brain maintains such webs of possible passage and it is only during activities such as walking running cycling swimming hitching pacing et camera that the activation of those pseudo random pathways starts to ramp up this is a purely behavioral approach to engaging different elements within neural networks that normally would not communicate with one another when we are completely still again the practices i talk about earlier of being completely still to raise dopamine and enhance divergent thinking those i just want o re emphasize are desire to position you to ready you to engage in the kinds of activities walking and pacing et camera that best facilitate divergent thinking if you are somebody who wants to enhance divergent thinking i would encourage you to explore how different patterns of movement and particular patterns of movement that do not require any conscious attention to any one specific thing allow you to access new ideas and new ways of combining existing elements in whatever domain it is you want to be creative now this is also an opportunity to underscore something i said back at the beginning which is you are not going to come up with great works of music if you do not understand cords and melodies and notes and music those basic elements have to be built up through some sort of formal or at least rigorous or regular training the same way that you are nothing to take a walk and then suddenly be able to paint an incredible picture if you have no painting ability that is not going to happen what ism talking i here are ways to enhance your capacity for divergent thinking such as amnesty are and ways to engage in divergent thinking such as through certain forms of movement that do not require a lot of conscious attention to your surroundings or any one specific century target and in doing enhancing arability to be more creative in a domain for which you already have some degree of skill or even mastery now in keeping with the theme of how to enhance our creativity there is a very exciting and yet parallel literature to the literature that have been describing thus far now i promise you that ism nock in o open up an entire library of new information relate to curl circuits and forth but i would be remiss if i did not mention this parallel literature because it speaks very specifically to some important practices that we can all use in order to enhance creativity and to do the first time and every time and this is really because certain scientists out there have really gone through the trouble i would even say the painstaking trouble of really trying to direct what the creative process is both for individuals and in groups or even in pairs and what ism about to tell you is beautifully encapsulated in an article in title a new method for training creativity narrative as an alternative to divergent thinking again we bent tie about divergent thinking that is one pathway into the creative process but there are others as well and as it turns out there not distinct in terms of the underlying brain mechanisms none the less lame describe briefly how narrative can be used to train creativity and to become more creative and in order to do that i to is briefly paraphrase or read from the first paragraph of this paper what ism about to read are the authors words not mine quote here is a paradox according to current research young children are more imaginatively creative than adults and indeed that is true by the way yet also according to current research creativity's mainnural engine is divergent thinking which relies on memory and logical association two tasks which young children under perform adults that is children are not as good at divergent thinking as adults are how could it be the authors are asking that children are more imaginative and thus more creative than adults this can only mean that there are alternate pathways to creativity and indeed that is the case and what this paper really explores is other ways to access creativity in what they describe is what is called narrative theory and there is a number of different aspects to this narrative theory but they agree that the standard definition of creativity is the same one that we were talking about before ere not sang about a different form of creativity here which i about a different way to access creativity they describe the standard definition of creativity as quote the ability to generate novel ideas that are useful the commonly except one and what they site as the basis for narrative theory is this break through finding in the nineteen fifties is is the work of guilford some people out there might be familiar with it i was not at the outset of researching this episode what this theory is from guilford essentially states is that there different intellectual capacities that are not captured by standard acutes i think that is we neurally accepted nowadays we know there is emotional intelligence we knows the standard i cue et camera but the important element to understand is that these authors we are able to trace back the idea of narrative training as a way to enhance creativity long before guilford in the nineteen fifties all the way back to aristate this this is incredible narrative theory was actually birth in three thirty five b c e in his writing called poetics which i think is incredible at least to me that people long before us were thinking about creativity and what goes into creativity and what aristate said what guilford then elaborated on in what the authors of this paper further elaborate on and actually have developed training photo calls for is the idea that there are three elements that we can use in order to enhance creativity in those three elements are what is called world building it'll explain whit these are in a moment perspective shifting and action generating and right off the bat the word action should raise a flag for you and by that i mean a positive fly because once again we are back into the world and therefore the nor circuits of movement and motion o case o three elements of world building perspective shifting and active entering or what make up this narrative approach to creativity and i should mention that these authors and others are using such approach with companies with groups with individuals this is use in a bunch of different contacts to approach and enhance different forms of creativity let us talk first about world building techniques this is going to be immediately familiar to you when you hear it but one of the key elements of creativity is to at the outset come up with some idea that make sense or as attractive to you about how the world is different inside of your creative endeavor for those that write science fiction or think about science fiction there some obvious aspects to this but for those of you that do not maybe you come up with a narrative for instance in the contacts of story telling that in your world a we are the house cats and the cats are actually the ones that are the curators of the earth o case a right there there is a conceptual shift that the world in which whatever creative idea is going to emerge is entirely different than the one that we actually living that sets a certain number of important constraints it means certain things are now possible other things are not possible that every different from the world that we live in you can see the parallels here to kind of childhood imagination where essential anything can happen in the child's mind because they are in constrain the second element is this perspective shifting techniques and the idea here is that not only are we posed to have the reader or the listener or the observer or us explore for creativity and develop a creative idea by thinking differently right which is kind of a generic turn how to we actually think differently but rather than just say take the perspective of somebody else in terms of what they would see or do or say or think rather we are supposed to think about their underlying motivation we could do the world shift that is the world structure shift from step one and then in step too you would ask yourself o k rather than right about or think about or move from the perspective of my self let say your feeling particularly happy that day you would say ism actually going to take the perspective of somebody who is angry but rather than just act angry ism going to think about what their motivation for being angels may be they had a break up maybe they were jealous may be somebody had wronged them in some way may be there just generally angry at the world for whatever reason and then operate from that motivational stance and this is a her interesting and powerful step because what it really captures at least as viewed by me the narrow scientists is it captures a whole set of neural circuits about what that motivational state means because motivational states dictate a huge number of possible different outcomes but they really constrained the number of different actions in outcomes than any of us would engage in rather than saying ism going to view the world the way that some one else or view the world by stating that we are going to be motivated by their set of motivations and not our own it includes a lot more possibilities and yet not an infinite number of possibly they are constrained in a logical way which is one of the key elements of creativity and then the third element which is action generating techniques is a really cool one that you will immediately notice implications for the work place which is forced collaboration inside i this thing that were building here o this kind of story you create a novel rule for the world that their stories going to exist in or your music is going to exist in or your sport will exist in then you create this perspective shift where you take on the motivation of some one else different than you and then you force collaboration between that person who has this all alternate motivation different from you and some one else who has an entirely different motivation and in doing you create these kind of what are called creative collisions now there collisions because they are crossing one another in something new has to emerge from them they could be antagonistic re arguments fighting physical or verbal or otherwise they could be synergistic they could take on any number of different forms depending on the motivations and the individuals that are involve but even though i just describe this unfairly top contour what i just described is actually the corps elements of any story or any creative endeavors just that many stories are from the perspective of what we already know and believe and think the world to be and our own perspective and the actions that we would take given that world than that perspective whereas if we want to be creative we want to think outside of our usual frame work and yet using elements that exist within us right no one has to tell us the creative narrative were trying to come up with it on our own we want to essentially think in a childlike way how do children think well they have new different or in entirely novel concepts about how the world works but they are bounded and this is a key word those are bounded they are not infinite not that anything can happen right some kids will ay we can fly and you can shoot layers at our icing can do all sorts of thing unicorns a candy falling from the sky at some point if you do not bound the change in the world it just becomes pure chaos and even children do not do that s we need to bound the change and yet create some alternate universe if you will in which the story takes place or the creation of any kind does not to be a story takes place then there has to be a perspective shift and this is very useful this is a actually a tool that we can all use of trying to take the perspective of others but not just asking what they would feel or think or do but ask what is their motivation in life generally or what kind of mood stands or goalstance are they taking are they trying to extract from others are they trying to give to others are the very altruistic et camera et camera and then you take that individual you do that also for another individual or group of individuals and you start thinking about how those different individuals because of their different motivational states would engage at the level of action what they would do what they would say out they mate would they fight would they et scenery et camera you think of any story the story of star waters of the the green myths you think of any story that has been created which we consider great and novel works and you start to find these three elements world building perspective shifting and action generating techniques and while this is again just a broad contour of what this narrative approach involves thinks a very important and very exciting one because it gives us a formula right we already know that diverge thinking and converge thinking are both elements to the creative process this is suggesting that whether not involves divergent thinking or not these authors seem to think this is distinct from divergent thinking that capturing some of the elements of creativity that our present in childhood but that then tend to dis appear as we start to assume identity build identity and understand rules about they actual world we live in all of those basic elements of early childhood creativity can be reawaken and in fact they have dated to support the fact that they can be reawakened insults in meaningful ways that can lead to new product design new workplace interactions and on and on that i find very exciting and as a consequence i do intend to do an entire episode at some point on narrative and story telling and the role of narrative in story telling not just forsake of creativity but also for accessing curl plasticity and for enhancing memory and on there an entire landscape of literature and exciting tools and things to understand there but in the mean time we will provide a link to this paper and for those of you that choose not to access the paper simply understanding these three aspects of narrative as an alternative to access in creativity that is a dedicated and well understood or established world shift that you choose perspective shifting and taking on the motivation of others and creating some sort of landscape of exploration for what sorts of interactions would occur between that individual or groups of individuals and other individuals that have other motivations and yet are still living in this alternate world those three elements we now know can be combined into what you or i or anyone would consider important creative works to day we discussed creativity this absolutely fascinating aspect to human brain function that has allowed us as a species to develop everything from great works of art and music to technological innovations that allow us to fly and allow us to access people all over the world through little screen devices that we carry round in our pockets and on and on as i mentioned the beginning of to day's episode i find creativity to be one of the most fascinating aspects of brain function and in particular because we do not actually know what the upper limits of creativity are and yet we understand that there are certain bounds there are certain requirements and the key requirement for creativity is this aspect of utility now that does not necessarily mean that for something to be considered creative it has to be useful in the practical sens but it does seem that for something to be considered truly creative or especially creative in some cases that it reveal to us something fundamental about the way that we or the world works we discuss some of the nail circuits that underlie the different aspects of creativity in particular divergent an conversion thinking as well as narrative building and some of the tools and steps that can allow us to better access divergent thinking and converge thinking and those tools include behavioral tools as well as farmocology and we talked about narrative building as a way to reawaken or i should say rearrests the childhood creativity that did indeed exist in all of us at some point in time if you are learning from under enjoying this podcast please subscribe to our tube channel that is a terrific zero costume

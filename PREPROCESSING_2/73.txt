pro israel rally in thousandnotes californium was killed that fer being allegedly hit in the head with a megaphone wielded by a procomas protestor that attack represents only the latest and most damaging antiseptic attack in the west in kidney australia journalists sherry martin reports that a jewfish man was nearly beaten to death by a procomasmob and ended up in the hospital for four days the concussion and fores final fracture in france a jewishwoman was stab twice in the stomach and a swastika talked on her dor in indaba a prochomos woman tried to drive a car into what she thought was a jewfish school normally such events might spur nation wide conversations about anti schematism and the coss of radical metric after all according to the whorehouse a national conversation regarding is lamaphobia has ben made necessary by the murder of a six year old palmitin arab child and michian butt no there is been no such conversation about any climate of hate that is for one reason and one reason alone the people doing the hating and the people hated those doing the hating are fans of compass both radical muscles and fellow travellers on the west those being hated are news and as every one of sophisticated moral ben knows museums being disproportionately brown and disproportionately poor and the majority in dozens of materially under performing countries lovely are victims and news being highly educated and high earning and the majority and precisely on materially successful state are victimizer that is always the math brown or poor equals oppress white or successful equals oppressor being a member of the oppressed means you are a victim the matter how evil you are that is precisely why congress woman reset tolled a raging juwhator is now being treated as victim by many in the legacy media to lee is a sitting congress woman which means that by any standard she is successful but she is also brown and also hates the lest which means that she is a member of the oppressed class and this means she can spout bloodlines she still maintains that israel boy to hospital and gaze despite all evidence to the country it means she can call for the utter destruction of the state of israel pushing the slogan from the river to the sea and the genocide that inevitably entails it means she can blame israel for cosses attack on is rally civilians while claiming moral equivalents which tween a group that burns babies alive and a group that tempts to avoid civilian casualties it means she can spend her career hob nosing with open terror supported and it means she can claim falsely that israel is engaged in genocide and threatened present an bison over that false claim and then when called on her lies and her jewhatred she can shed crocodile tears that is precisely what happened yesterday when a resolution spencer by represent of richmacormic of georgia called for her census mckormic's resolution censured to lee before quote promoting false narratives regarding the october seventh twenty twenty three commasitac on israel and for calling for the destruction of the state of israel the resolution passed two thirty forts one eighty eight with twenty two democrats voting in favor this resolution according to tole in her allies is oppression brachia to lee is the victim to lee is a bribery to be more specific she is a crycomasnic she supports the most egregious atrocities known to man but hives behind her religion to claim amenity and then reeves about her supposed victimhood here she was yesterday claiming that she was being silenced and then of course crying about it i will not be silence and i will not let you distort my words folks forget ism from the city of detail the most beautiful blackest city in the country where i learn to speak truth to power even if my voice shake trying to believe or censor me will not work because this movement for a seas fire is much bigger than one person mister her do what it is to fear rising hate crimes to know how aslamophobia and antisemitism makes us all less safe and worry that your own child might suffer the horrors that six year old what dead did in a looks i cannot believe i have to say this but palistemian people are not disposable there the dears a and she is comforted by illhanomark fellocomossnic ah ah to crashed it is okay your look your strong nowgyuman bean it is o can you just any one else no one said that palistinians are not human beings just anyone else that just said that commas is evil and should be destroyed and she disagrees with that and believes that israel is evil and ought to be destroyed the take that she is a victim is weird given the pretty much every major member of the democratic party rushed to her defense a came jeffreys the democratic minority leader blames extreme maltha bushbuck for blowback against the terrorist supporting to leap i e to eeereofooo e eye a eseoea one is is leal it is extreme maddagenda to say that from the river to the sea is back represent of deb dingle of mischingan tried to claim that from the river to the sea is actually just open to interpretation a piece of abstract poetry a piece of

small come o start of this conflict y murdering fourteen hundred jewels including babies children women and men they still have two hundred forty people kept in bondage and gaze as their hostages they openly bragged about hiding rockets and terrorist beneath civilian centers they are open about it they even mean at anchors take tapper notice there was take last night famous which is the government of gaze based on their own words they they think the loss of passion and civilian lives is just the cost of liberation be they think that even though therefore the government of gait is not their responsibility to protect passion and civilians the tunnels a for themselves profiting not procivilians and then there determined to continue i tracking israel the thing way they did on octoberseven over and over and over fasted on what they say for these reasons israel was we cannot have a ting fire an when even jam tapper as noticing that means that its pretty obvious by the way commotra says this stuff out loud there is an article in the we york times to day quoting a top member of comossand quote commons got is not to run gaze and to bring it water an electricity and such come ass the possum and the resistance woke the world up from its deep sleep and showed that this issue must remain on the table this battle was not because we wanted fuel or laborers it did not seek to improve the situation goa this battle is to completely overthrow the situation comes commits a terror atrocity not caring bat stone civilians and then horizons villains in pervrac it is bought when israel inevitably has to kills civilians in the process of targeting terrorist commons then sheds the falsest of tears they put out tape showing people mourning they are dad cause bycommoss and the world largely falls for it that is because the oppressor oppressed narrative is all consuming it is all powerful this narrative outweighs decency it outlays truth for those who believe the narrative truth is of no consequence whatsoever it is not even a tertiary value there will be no conversations about tone or hate speech or the obvious jewhatred evidence on the streets of america major cities at least not with regard to to lead there will be serious minded conversations the how the evil ago movement is reading is lamiphobia for criticizing to led and stepping out of line will not be tolerated that presumably is why after senator elizabeth warrant issue to treat decrying antisemitism shews then force to rush out another tweet decrying is lomifobia that is why the media studiously avoiding any language the might blame the killing of that jewfish man in lasandulas on comemossnics welegeraly slammed elderly men in the head with a bullhorn here is the outline from the new york times quote jewfish man dies after all traction at jelling protest in californium were i actually do not know how he died or why here is the outline from make we news elderly jewfish man dies after confrontation with propalstanian protestors in lest lie village that is were because old people are confronting each other but nobody's dying what happen here is be s news is headline jewfish man dies after dispute at feeling israel plastic in protest these are all the same outlets they claim the canary sixth rioters had killed a police officer by slamming him in the head with fire extinguisher the narrative must be protected at all costs the victimizer are the victims the oppressors are the oppressed and as we all know the victims in the oppress must be excused for all of their myriad evils in just one

o gat the biding administration is on the one hand saying many of the right things with regard to come of sir john curly the spokes person for the national security adviser he says that dome a sees fire at the time is not appropriate which of course is true her said they no sees fire less there is return ti chatter reasonable i in that hes year tho talk to the priming her again when i can i characterizer arm chair cuoreber everything hes saying we still believe that i general seas fire is not appropriated this time by general sense fire war talking about e by laying down er arms e for in indefinite period o time in the anticipation of peace talk since some sort of negotiated gentleman we ti do delete ted that sorry time for that right now we do think it is the time to continue to pursue pauses in the fighting of a temporary nature for specific purposes he is right about that although when he says temporary pauses for humanizer israel is already doing that they have open humanitarian quarters that come moss than attempts to clothes by shooting people for guarding the humanitarian corridors john curly also is having none of the israel is genocide nonsense yesterday and this is good stuff f om the by administration a rarity to hear from people me here is john curly yesterday i heard this word genocide trash gala a moss actually does have genocide of intentions against to people of this real they would to see at whited off them at they said on purpose that is what that is what tat stake here and were going to keep making sure that is real haze that ability to do that as for the voices of course we respect all different voices an perspectives on this and we know that there is a lot of and that there there is a lot of high motion here when it comes to what is going on we have never sided away from criticizing our friends and partners when we believe it is worsted and will continue to do that we also believe the at a that de that the the best de pomade the the best progress and diplomatic pursuits is to do it that privately and outside the public eye and will continue to do that as well and meanwhile and all aria reporter when after john curly and could be shut them downs again is a lot of positive stuff here from john curly and nisi is o wen acting in in on to o i iron on in tan mini in an ten a e at the your cannon e some tin the e

some in wrong a a the the tana en went when no the the i the the cation are supposes that we made some determination as love on conflict has been violated end a they were were not of that point were let o i i would just tell you that we are wen can a the rest in her real time to every event israel has a right and responsibility defend it and organ to make sure they have the tools an capabilities to do that again when one month after this and and we ought not forget what happen one month ago four teen hundred people slaughtered in their homes at a music nestable and when how mass decided to conduct operations it was with the intent of killing people ours right about all f that now the problem is the decide administration then it goes completely unrealistic on what comes next and they are unrealistic about again what is happening in the streets of the united states yesterday care john pier was the as from that same podium about people ribbing down posters of kidnap victims the hostages than are curling helligaza apparently shed nothing to say about it she is just awful better job as always lot bios a individuals who have been tearing down sines many of these thinking place an or time o is rails presently being held hostage in gosh er fence intense o correlations of taken place there is the white houses view the these actions should be can down the pulling of the pulling down of them for of the bats of form of peaceful protest we guy a i give e sort of kind of revenge reporting here and there they got for last week a thirty million to o no die i hear ism just not going to noon am not g there is the us per oo do not is not going to going to a specifics on that particular thing what i can fay there a real violent protestantret terhappening right now and tiger mniticionapicials a were the report water deeply concerning and that is something that were focuston that is weak the that is week tea at best from core can permit again no shock there now the problem is that if you do it the bydaministration seems to want to do which is pretend that comas is a tiny little group that no one likes in the gozistrip or injured into marry the wetback when you pretend that you end up at the wrong solution again your pretending away the central problem here the central problem here at rout is not just the commas is a genicitle terror croup it is that a huge swath of palcinians agree with commons by palling data bile total data that is the reality that does not mean they should be treated as military targets israel and treating him is military targets anywhere during this conflict it's members of comas are being treated as military targets and is many civilians who agree with comas who israel attempting to now usher down to the south of the basis trip the problem is if you failed to recognize that there is a broader ideological problem within the palsinian population the minute that this is over the next re constituted government in goo will look exactly the last re constituted government in goa which will look exactly the current palsnian authority was by the way is unpopular beat the palcinian authority literally pays people to kill dues they have a stipend that they pay to the families of terrorist who kill just the commas terrace who killed use their families will get money from the palcinian authority those o the people the by deministratio ants to put in charge of the gasistrip but the palcnian authority is too moderate for a huge number of people living in both judantomaria and the gasistript which presumably is why there is an assassination attempt onmachmud abas according to the express dado there is horrifying footage capturing what a puts to befits attempt at assassination against the palcinian president machmudbas his convoy him under a hail of gun fire after he dire garden an medicine ultimatum from reanimate palcinian security forces urging him to declare war on israel again the biggest problem is that the palcinian authority which is already extreme and hates israel and abs is a genii a mean he he actively says the holicostin happen a was is too moderate for a huge percentage of the palstinian population that is the abiding problem and until the west i knowledge is that there is not can be anything remotely looking even security in the mddleleastel get to that momentarily first if you can

bottom line is that what happens next in the gosistrip which is become in area of contention between the s relies and the and the america that relies on what you think the gosistrip is meaning who do you think is going to pick up the pieces over there now israel is tried to hand it to egypt egypt does wanting piece of it by why did not egypt does want control of the godship neither is is re why you think that is is it because they all hate that six miles of beach front territory on the mediterranean that she privatized territory right the mediterraneanslic a coastlines him coast linisteleveve why exactly does noon want us the answers i two million people living there who are radicalize that egypt is deeply afraid that if it takes in that group of people that they are going to have a terror threat on their northern border since sis is already occupying large proportions of the sinidezert which is egyptian territory it istle same reason why israel has tried to hands over control of palsinian arab territories of palsinian arab populated areas in judge and maria to jordan and yours no no layman we have no interest in three million palsinian grabs living in this area because their afraid that is going to overthrow the kashmir dynasty that is the irony of watching creenroind queen ranee of jordan who is palsinian arab by extraction talking about how much solid arty she has with palistinians om if you did you would resin your position and the hash dynasty would be overthrown but you are enjoying your five star hotels and your extremely luxurious life style while people in your country are living on forty one hundred dollars a year and the reason you're not leaving is because your population in jordan is a pretty extreme population an the will get more extreme if you were to take in even including territory three million palstinian grabs who hate news with a with a burning passion by pollinate that is what the poles suggest the the there's no evidence ism ism waiting the evidence that palsinian grabs in judge and maria palsinian grabs in the gosistrip overwhelmingly in the absence of their current leadership our new loving piece loving people what that don't mean again that the legitimate military target's no be talking about that or talking bout is who gets to govern in these areas one the assumptions in cousin five when isrepulled out the gosistrip is that the are then be elections the elections were overseen and greenlet by the united states consists a rights said that the show then the secretary state that the the election that was held in the gossistrip was legitimate who got elected come ass come ass then proceeded to kill everybody in the alsinian authority but if their an election held today the reason make kudos is not held an election in mud antomarea is that he is afraid he as now election since two thousand et by the way he is afraid that if election were held to day the palsnan authority would lot they do not actually have all that much power that is how extreme the population is in these areas which is why the problem is supremely intractable with that said this is why israel is saying that they are going have a continuing security roll in gaze after comas is lasted a corning t the lostrjurnal israel send an intense fountain security control of goa for an indefinite period once the worth's end prompting yous officials to stress their opposition to a re occupation of the conclave now again israel did not want to reoccupy at all israel literally pulled out everyone they took eight thousand news out of that area and gushcatif and they move them they physically had news remove other news and take them away from the area they have never seen by the way anyone in palistonian government do anything remotely that take grabs out of one area and move them two another area purposefully in order town had a concession to the news this has never happened ever israel took eight thousand news and move them out of the north of the goselstrip the musket varia they hands it over their houses their green houses all of the inform structure the palsinians promptly burned it an electric comas and created the greatest terror state it is that at massaged a giant terror territory over the course last twenty year when israel says we have to maintain a security presence in the got hell a a it is the equivalent of yo of the highest crime area in a city and then you say fun the police he you fund the police and the moderate goes up and then the murders spread outside that area and the police hey will now we got o go back in is that because the police are desperate to be in that area or it because the crime needs to go away and the only way that the crime goes away is if you put law in foremen in the area that is what israel is talking about here is a benjamin its now who talking about an indefinite period of control of a fossa again if if there is any thought that is really are desperate to spend blood and treasure to maintain security control over the gossip strip you are on your mind remember in israel everyone is eligible for the draft every eighteen year old kid they turn eighteen they got go the military think moms and dads an israel are desperate to send their kids into the gossip strip they were desperate not to send their cinsinto the gossip they handed the damn place over to over to come as is that's now won the now who saying but the by administrations well maybe itsolandgrab a land grab of what to million palisinian grabs the bassmatority whom despise the news and which to see israel destroyed buy the data in any case here is am here is nothing now who talking about whatscan have t come next president by has said that it would be a mistake for israel to occupied gosh who should govern gaze when this is over those who do not wan to law contain the way of how most the certain is non then i then israel will for then the define greed well have the all roll oh security responsibility because we have seen what happens when we do not have when we do not have that security responsibility what we have is the eruption of hamascar on the skill that we could not imagine to have a warning to iron to impala i think things o understood the i the analog the warn a ego way the response will be very very potful n i hope the do not may the sit gay again the fact that the united states is taking that as we have to warn the news off of reoccupying gossip again no one it is a very very select few people actually want to have complete civilian control of the gossistrip including pretty much everybody who is in is rally government at this point in time why we again the gosistrip angerdan to many are honeycombed with people who hate news by the way half a work for the men you an refuge g agency which was set up solely for the palsonians it is the only agency of the united nations that is been set up for one group of people in one group of people alone it is the bazar reason why cities that been built in the gossistrpen havebeen there for seventy five years are still being called refuge g camps despite the fact regalia that they are come plate and full cities some of the you and our w a employees by the way these genies are people who literally work for the united nations many of the people support terror these be will work for the en celebrated the commons massacre for example you and our w a teacher soma radio fuel he celebrated the commas attack with exclamation marks in a heart memory you and our way employe managed it'll shake all in october teethe posted quit any one who tries to fleet to the south should be treated the way we ought to treat traitors and the only acceptable direction to move its east or north which would be by the we into israel that is a commoscenvationof israel or ho about the you and our d gossip school administrator come o the acumen an october seventh he postoqhat we welcome the great october another e called for epthnect cleansing of all news in israel the a people work for the again they do the israel going to give up control of the gossistrip an security terms to the united nations is absolutely absurd what exactly is going to come next again i think in the end what is going to come is in is rail military control of the gossistrip while the search for some local leader who will do the work of actually attempting to administer the gosisstrip finding that person is not going to be easy again ire not for the pain an authority wants it they can barely control day and maria the egyptians do not want it the jordanians do not want it the a do not want it the sauries do not want it the europeans do not want it the america do not want it nobody wants it why do not they want it again it comes down u there is going to have to be he decades long shift in the opinion structures and intensive structures of people living in the gossistrip staid they recognize that if they were to build their lives around say material prosperity and some level of religious tolerance that their wives might be better than if they direct their lives an their children lives toward the murder of every new in the region that is the only way that anything better as can happen is why when people talk about a two state solution the current context it is absolutely nonsensical it is absolute ridiculous with whom with whom you not that two states solution yer can need a peace partner who exactly would that be no one can answer that question because the question does not have an answer unfortunately israel wishes it did considering ta dey have now offered very generous piecteals in nineteen ninety three two thousand two thousand one and two thousand eight and gave the entire gossip over to the palcinanes in two thousand five oke coming up we are going to get to a series of disastrous elections for republicans in oho in kentucky in virgin what the hell is going on joins

get your mayflower cigars to day yet to be twenty one years old or older two purchase some exclusions may apply meanwhile last night series of disastrous elections for re publicans across the country democrats have one control of the virgin legislature this was seen in large parts refrain on glen young kin who is the virgin governor there for some od reason seem to be a lot of notion that youngling was gin throw his hat into the presidential race for something if the virgin state legislature have been taken by re publicans i think that was always a to old errand there is really no ground swell for glen young kin to get into the presidential race it doesn't really matter because virgin democrats did really really well last night they did really really well because they one based on running on abortion that was the issue that they ran on now here is the thing about political issues and messaging there is no such thing is a winning issue there is only such a thing as a winning message this is something that republicans and democrats should keep in mind as they run for office in the future when it comes to running it is not that in issue just defaults to you of there is a poll that says jobidon really in popular on the economy that is not a republican issue you have to then craft that into a message that wins this is true for virtually ever issue any issue could theoretically be a winning issue long as it is message properly for exampling glen young can became governor of virginity upset terry calif the former governor of virgin when that happened one of the reasons he on is because there is a parents rights movement the really sprang up around a case that as reported by our own mookgruesiac here at daily wire in louden county we are schools a winning issue in virgin or was it a winning message that parents ought to have control over their own kids and their education and their safety and those it should not be put in danger by foolish school ad administrators and then terry mccalliff pick the wrong message which is you should not be in control of your kids but the administrator should being control of yourkids you have have a winning message and youropponent has to have a loosing message that is the way that you actually win elections republicans since twenty sixteen have not had any wining messages let us ut be real about this dona rani my dance should not be the head of the errancy i do not knowhow you can lose this many times in a row and still retain your job it is truly amazing the only person was failed up as much as ronoromni my dance just pen his comely arris republicans have no low selections in twenty eighteen twenty twenty twenty twenty one twenty twenty two and twenty twenty three the last selection they one was twenty sixteen they have under performed every single election since then and yet people retain their jobs and continue to draw packets and that is unacceptable what exactly happened in virgin where one of the things that happened in virgin is again there is a lot of talk about abortion by democrats according to the washington post democrats flipped control of the virgin house of delegates securing victories in at least fifty one seats giving them majority in both chambers of the general assembly republicans wore defending a slim fifty two to forty right majority but democrats saw an opportunity to make gains under newly drawn maps following a court ordered redistricting process or democrats definitely got a hand from the local courts in drawing districts that benefited then surely after eleven plan before any independent news organizations called the race virgin house minority leader delegate don l scout declare democrats would some control of the house and the senate following tuesdays election s again this was a race that was largely run on the basis of abortion glen young can was running round the state attempting to drum up support for his own side the problem is that right now again things are not going younker is personally very popular in virgin that does not necessarily frankly over into republican control if republicans have a bad image o across the country and wright now republican to a bad damage across the country there seem as largely in competent again partially or harshly earn there seem as extreme by bran and that is largely ties euganuary six and doll trump in particular as we'll see in in discussington these other sections and when it comes to the abortion is you republicans have not yet gotten their heads around in actual winning message on the issue now the truth is that winning message on abortion is not the same across the country politics of pragmatic business and the full pro life message in virgin is not going to go the same way as the full pro life message in a georgia or florid in forty can pass the six week abortion band because republicans are very popular here in georgia you can do the same you cannot do that in virgin glen younker was not running on that he was running on a fifteen week abortion ban the problem was the democrats were saying that is the first step toward republicans going for the full abortion band in virgin and local ladies got very upset and they all came out and they voted in favor of the democrats and the same thing happened in oho as well in the wake of rover's waive republican have not come up with a state by state strategy or a messaging strategy and here is what the actual strategy needs to be on a state by state basis where there is consensus you pass a thing where there is not consensus you do not pass the thing now there is no one in america as for life time have spoken the marshal life ism fully pro life i do not even in my own personal idea of of what good legislation look i would not tolerate abortion even in cases that are very controversial grapes invest ism as proline as it is possible to be a been extremely clear about this however if you wish to see fewer abortions in the united states if you wish to see durable law in the united states you have to win an if you want to win that is going to mean they are going o have to come face to face with some tough realities and the reality is that running on my platform running on what i would like to see is not going to win you office in virgin it is not and h more threatening you appear in virgin the worse its going to go for you the same thing happened in oho in oho the democrats in in pretty wide fashion one a referendum on abortion what they call abortion rights what it really was was in shrinking reverse's waded in law in the state of oho in oho there is an attempt to i in shrine the right to abortion in the state constitution it is a ballet initiative it establishes quit an individual right to one to own reproductive medical treatment including but not limited to abortion and creates legal protections for any one who assists a portion with receiving reproductive medical treatment according to the washington post the amendment grants the treating physician the authority to determine on a case by case basis whether an unborn child is viable and grant's exceptions for abortions at any stage of pregnancy to protect the health or life of the mother why did this happen while the reason has happened is because there is another election that was held in august that was a referendum they would've made a more difficult to amend the state constitution through future ballet initiatives the reason for that is because there was a snapback law in place in oho that that effectively band abortion almost across the word in oho in the aftermath of rover's weight being overturned they tried to pass a law of the republicans the basically in shrine in the constitution what that law was it is can be very difficult free to overturn that and that was rejected and then a rate to abortion was in shrine in the state constitution now let us say that the republicans instead of allowing that snapback low to gone to place let us say that they tilisen we know than in oho that the the law before this was twenty two weeks twenty to weexsis weigh too late but we end to incrementally introduce the people of oho to what good abortion law looks there not on to go to six weeks an stay there and you are not preserve lives in long term you have to thisencrementligs that is hap politics often works the message is lives must be preserve but we also have to go a little slower than even we would want for sure than we would want because people have to get use to ideas they've to be indoctrinated about what life is and what abortion is and organ go to a fifteen week in oho hard to see how that would failed for example this very red state down from one that state by eight ten points in last couplelection cycles they can do that and instead get the snapback in oho which now has been shine basically reverse's weighed again that is the same thing that happen in virgin republicans is it a letter publicans sting abortion is not a winning issues norm not being a winning issuetsabout do you have a winning message and can you wrong for your opponents the nice thing about arguing from incremental approach is that democrats are then forced to argue in favor of twenty we abortions and twenty two week abortions and that is not something that they arguing over they arguing over rape incest exceptions because those are the most out lying and and least common forms of abortion both sides arguing at the extremes of this particular argument the right is very comfortable argue parts of partial bort the portion previous reasons left is very art comfortable arguing rape an incest the question is where is that line where the meeting voter tips over from one side to the motherland again winning elections is the precondition to changing the law republican should keep that in mine meanwhile over in untuck abut by the we the pulling in oho was pretty clear about this every single demographic supported the enshrinement of rover's weighed in to law who split fifty fifty with white men but what women support the initiative fifty seven to forty three black men support the initiative eighty seven thirteen black women supported the initiative eight one to nineteen in fact the only demographic that bored against this initiative to in shrine rover's wage were people where sixty five or older literally the only one is that means the republicans message tat wrong an me that is clearly they message it does not mean y out a run away from the abortionitine you can are very strong an excellent abortion argument but what is happening right now is that all this is getting hashed out at the state level which is why rover's weight by the way thesis what should have happen overstay being turn kick it back to the take level states now get to the s idea on their own legally speaking how to approach the issue abortion republicans in each state have to take stock of exactly how they wish to run on those particular issues and in toll republican start to realize that i nationalized strategy across all issues is not going to work they're get continue lose state elections over in kentucky meanwhile anna fisher one his reelect effort which is amazing becoming in that state when twenty two points in favor of dona trump now he did out spend his opponent dance cameroon by e very large martian mashurnis democratic lies apparently swamp republican spending forty seven million dollars on adds after the mad primary republicans were only able to spend twenty nine million dollars miser's campaign spent around twenty four million dollars on ads that is more than five times what cameras campaign actually spent on all this and again kentucky was run on abortion measures campaign feature young woman who step father raped tor one sue was twelve and suggested that she needed to real to have an abortion get democrats can a run on abortion on the state level a cross the country republicans are can have figure out a state by state level how to address this issue because that is the realm of practical politics overturning reverses wade toucan are a full proline case for over turning reverse's wade it it certainly making easy legal case the rover's wash overturn but to pretend this is to a thorny issue fore publicans is to ignore the realities of the facts on the ground on the take level to pretend that the same message works in e organ as works in oho as working ken lucky as works anywhere else is a mistake and republicans had better get their heads around that or they are we n continue loosing it also does not help when again you are running candidates who add to the told things canary six or or can be labeled condo man up the people on the right are annoy that the left keeps saying mama over and over obviously left fines this fruitful otherwise they wen do it as able total strategy it is born fruit for them which means they'll continued to it until republicans come up with a better counter then nanny nanny booboo in just one second will talk about the ruler abilities of jobidon because there is big republican debate tonight get to that momentarily first the benshopiro so is supported by gran canyon university in a portable private christian universe with vibrio camps in beautiful fix arizona ragtop twenty in the

that messaging matters that this no such thing as winning issue the is just a winning message this is the reason why jobidon's ruler abilities are not in of themselves going to defy jobidon somebody has it if he jobidon has to be a winning message as much we talk in twenty twenty but jobidon hiding the basement and that is true the winning message for jobidon was trump is crazy he should not be president that was the wing message for him and it did win that is why the basemen stratetue works now dona trump hoodwink an election against your bide being that goes awful at t is job he is awful and terrible at this job but that means yest run on that the election cannot be about anything else well the good news is that is pretty fertile ground democrats are busily attempting to convince people that everybody is doing great in america pal frogmen has an entire piece titled why does the right to hate america in the bedtime iodate what wise he saying it the right has america because the right is pointing out that crime has spiked in the last couple of years democrat an there in their pro crime policies the republicans are sort of upset about the state of the economy even though he says that the economy is just glowing and doing amazing really try to convince the america people that their feelings are wrong on these issues really go for it even many democratic and popular hollywood entertainers are starting to figure out that jobidony is a very very bad candidate now again republicans could take that for grants an that possum is gan close that be a huge widespread mistake but here is there a silvern last night this is pretty biting stuff against hoiden rings up wit the reason most of the people the side an can no sleep wile last night an new poll show joining getting pros by dona trump an almost every tango swing stay a i fix today to say bide an to definitlylis he could actsalinly din his sleep instead in thing is barely scary alltimprals that i mean actually scaring not they too camel tan o tiny plus scary well yes democrats are in a state of full skopanic over hoiden an again they should be because there can be more that drops about him and hunter there is no me more that drops in terms the economy before the election now to night is a big republican debate now an i a big any cannabis there is an as at cannabis is because dona trump is running away in the pulling attar right now just running away the national jet per pulling data has dona trump up near sixty per cent that is hies he has been this entire election cycle he is up in the real clerpolitic average at fifty eight per cent on to mantis is at fourteen nigehale is at nine the vacromastruamy is at four christen is at three and everybody else is an also ran i do love than the real clepolitic polling average timscott is running below my ensures no longer in the race dug burghal for some reason i still the race do not understands why but ski in any case trump has this extremely largely now in i the lead is not quite as large b still very large the current pulling suggests than he is up on the field by somewhere in the beer of twenty five to twenty seven points that is where it which is the glad it is a billy but he is not have it majority of voters clearly moving his direction yesterday him runnable to the governor of what very popular governor of i in worse urontosantis heres with that sounded we need to make sure that we choose wisely that we make the right division that we a lot somebody who can actually win and beat jo bison and we need a president who has the solve and the resolve to reverse the madness that we see on a daily bases we need a president that is focus on the future and not the past and we t out prethinat who put a median an a mere first an iraaraa nay there she is not or think now she is issue wildly popular and i skin flake even in i the late semmerson college pole show her approval rating it thirty to per cent approve thirty nine per cents is prove twenty nine per cent trumps hooligan about camronalds in i but she does have a very large political organization in i and this effectively is going to four close the possibility that nickel valley comes from behind and overtakes at this point on to cantus he's pagans to causes states what that means is that the mantis in i is the truest threats to trump now that is also the state here the poles r the closest if nobody beats trump in i it is clearly and overtly over it may be over even of somebody does beat trump in i obviously he lost i the first time around against tat crud and then he proceeded s win the nomination if you look at the other states that are coming up in the republican nominating process trump is well ahead in all of those states you samphire he has forty nine per cent to valley's fifteen per cent to de wants is eleven per cent to charity's nine per cent now gain those numbers are not fifty five per cent sixty per cent in the early states but that is before he get down out once o get down to south caroling trumps can clean up there needs to be a major showing of some level of momentum by another republican candidate the thing that is prohibiting that is in fact shobidon's weak polling data republicans are gin to have to think a little b their heads instead of just looking at the poling get nowt that is heard from yo say i thin polling davit is can only data we have what other evidence we have with that said the poles are also showing there is a lot o mall ability between trump and bison got to take that into account will trump be able to deliver the knock out blow to bison will he be able to deliver the message at its going to get jobidon booted from office that is the question hovering in the background of to night's republican teases what needs to happen in to night's republican debate well clearly at some point here to cantus and halal tanto go at each other hale hast knock to cantus out just not only knock to cantus out just to somehow can validate the rest of the fields support that is a very uphill road has that said before on to cantus if he bows out of the race right now half his support will go to the non trump candidate and half his supportwill go to the trump candidate meaning trump that means that if he is got twenty per cent in these poles ten per cent the goes to trump that puts trumpet sixty or seventy per cent s that is over valley turns hire support base is outside chetrum camp no one who loves trump is supporting daily this jury not the crossover right now if sure to drop out presumably that support that split among christy and romasuamy cried not reason christy the cantus and then is the field consolidated it mi turn into two manage with that said what is to nights race good for it is got a clear the field there has to be some drop outs after this race terms gotneans to go away for whatever his three per cent are worth cries crispy has no shout of the nomination he knows it it is a spite campaign that is the only thing that drives the the the round mounderemound over here is just pure spite that is the only reason he solnerace he needs to gown e he he is doing nothing that mike pence did not already try this is a this a two person race for the second place finish and until that part of the field consolidates there is certainly no shot at defending dona trump even if they consolidate dona trump has just by the numbers a wild advantage and republicans are gingko have to decide before the election cycle if they believe that dona trump is the best person to take on jobidon just assuming that biding himself as the winning issue and there does not need a be winning message are dogies the rest of the who continues right now in noconortimis it will

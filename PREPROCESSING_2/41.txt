ledges begin today show by pointing out the last night the first of the jeffrey easting papers dropped that's be the copper surrounding jeffrey easting notorious under age sex trafficker who is connected with just about every famous person in the west everybody's been very curious as to who exactly went to eastern rape island most far the papers canada most not we saw yesterday has already been seen bolt canton being mentioned in the contact of coming p liking young girls prince drew grabbing an under age breast allegations fat ellendershuits all the rest of this kennistuff more is going to drop over the coming days and we will cover at not at dos because not much is dropped far oke now onto the actual news the twenty twenty four election is coming and right now it is advantage donate trump trump is leading by two point two per cent in the real claim politics pulling average it does not sound a lot until you realized that trump trailed hoiden in that same average onelectionday point twenty by seven point two per cent he only lost the popular vote by four point five per cent a difference of two point seven per cent ore that killed canton was leading in that same average by three point two per cent on elections eight twenty sixteen and only when the popular vote by two point one per cent a miss about one point one per cent another wards donate trump almost always out draws his real clear politics polling average number he is up two point two that means is actually up more what is more jobidon is totally stuff as political scientist root to sherif was not a right winger wright's to day in the washington post quote in his twenty twenty campaign for the nomination the long time former senator had a better sends than other democratic candidates of the normal sit that voters were looking for after more than six months a pandemic accompanied by lock downs an economic crash but there was a catch after jobidon clinched the nomination says to sheriff he felt it was necessary to incorporate the views of the party's left into his campaign's policy stances and outlook now with the next campaign about begin bison and his party are struggling in other words jobidon we to his voters he campaign is moderate the primaries he capitalized on that moderate image in the general and then he push steadily to he left and then he governed from the left now says to sher bison is pulling behind from nationally and in every swing state withe possible exception of wisconsin trump is preferred to bison by wide margins on voters most important issue the economy and in elation as well as their second most important issue emigration and voters security and on crime and public safety bind's approval rating at this point this residence he says to share is the lowest of any precedent going back to the nineteen forties when the era of modern pulling began what could jobidon do to turn that around will biding things that fashion trump is gan a save him that is presumably why he is going to go on a trump bashing tour beginning this week labelling dona trump a racist and a fascist according to the associate a press quote president jobidon is starting the campaign year by joking the revolutionary war to mark the third anniversary of the deadly insurrection at t us capital and visiting the south caroling church where white gunman massacre black parishioners seeking to per cent in the starkest possible terms in election he argues could determine the fate of america democracy is easily on o turn canary sixth into a national holiday that everybody tantrum m amber how horrible canary six day after day after because that is what america must fight an trump cannot be present because of canary sex than eh son sturdy join is going to travel n their valley forge pennsylvania who gorge washington and the continental army spent bleak winter nearly two hundred fifty years ago presumably to talk about spending a bleak winter this year but it will swing in to a wondrous summer under a second join term there he is apparently going to to cry donate trump for the riot by a mob of his supporters who overran the capital says the associated press an attempt to overturn the twenty twenty presidential election valley forge speech to talk about canary sees i hear what gorge waserington the going going a on a trumpinsre ai two days later the president is going to visit mother a manual my church in charleston ore nine people ore shot an killing an tune twenty fifteen white who premises attacknam ma note the can on that tune twenty fifteen berokamomal is still president of the united stakes and the idea he is going to suggest here is that donate trumps followers are the kinds of people who murder black people going to church that is what he is going to do is can to be disgusting and it is not con to be anything quite shocking from join given the facts that is the same goy who on suggested at it round was a vicious raucous to one end to reinstate black people jobidon's kicking off twenty twenty four says the associate pressed by welding into some of the countries darkest moment rather than an up beat affirmation of his record is meant to clarify for voters what his teen sees us the stakes of nonmember selection during both events he will characterize his predecessor as a serious threats to the nation's founding principles arguing that trump who is built a commanding early lead in the republican presidential primary will seek to undermine you us democracy should he win a second term this is not going to work at all it is not con to work because here is the thing everybody knows true everything is baked into that cake everything the egg shells how sirs baby put everything is in the cake already everyone knows what they think of the cake some people one the cake some people hate the cake nobody has no opinion on the cake everyone notes that trumps twenty twenty post election activities even if they despise them and think they are really bad did not actually change the outcome of the action jobidon after all is they present and has been the president since jaguar of twenty twenty one what is more the pitch that trump is more racist than by than he some fomscripto white so premises that pitch does not work just does not jobidon is the de e i president he talks about equity infusing all f his policies he talks about it all the the this idea that trump is more racially polarizing than bison e that is o the polls are showing the pitch that trump is a racist is not on work either because has even gorge will a trump opponent of his order points out quit jo bison is trump an authoritarian recidivist mostly swim had by cards that is from a person who really really really dislikes oral trump gorge will says quit instances of trumps any constitutional behavior have been amply reported in plowed bisons less although they for example the eviction more thorium the scene mandate the consolation of student debt judicial reprimands of them have been free in and then verge well points out that hoiden has been attempting to overrun the federal vacancies reform act by basically a tempting to point tomboy that person being rejected by the centime wand then i waiting for some sort of break in the action to reappoint that same exact person most of all jobiden's hope that hatred for trump will sun how save him that is predicated on another false idea and that idea is that donate trump will jog republican turn out but he will really really really jog at democratic turn out and that is no an arguable proposition the truth is that in every election since twenty sixteen democratic turn out has been up because of trump but here is the problem trump was not on the ballet in any of those except for twenty twenty what if the normal presidential election politics look more like twenty sixteen and twenty twenty what if the actual for is that trump does not t actually drive turn out in a presidential year in the way the jobidin hopes in twenty sixteen after all turn out was well within historical mormsstwen trump ran against tiller when it comes to turn out as a per centare eligible voters here are the numbers by elections this is the per centare turn out of eligible voters seen two thousand i fifty four point three per cent very very low two thousand four sixty point one per cent two thousand eight sixty two point five per cent two thousand twelve fifty eight per cent twenty sixteen fifty nine point two per cent it is a since two thousand four somewhere in the ball park of between fifty eight and sixty two per cent twenty twenty sixty six point nine per cent that is a massive increase and also a massive outlier and join one incredibly narrowly based on that massive outlaying increase in voter turn out twenty twenty saw a voter turn out increase of twenty three million voters to a hundred and sixty million total sea total voters that is a posed to one hundredand thirty seven million in twenty sixteen and a hundred and twenty nine million in twenty twelve do we really think t at that numbers can replicates we think begin a hundred sixty million total voters again in twenty twenty four is i can look more a hundredand forty million voters and if there is a twenty million vote gap between say twenty twenty and twenty twenty four in the negative direction twenty million fur people vote in twenty twenty four than twenty twenty who do we think that is going to hurt if those voters disappear those marginal voters we think those marginal voters were true voters or bison voters the answer and twenty twenty was almost certainly bison voters because the democratic turn out machine was extremely heavy because jobidon relied heavily on an on the ground operation meets in advance of the election to get people vote absent ballet the changing rules because of bovid went that jobiden's entire turn out operation was predicated on not voting n election day that is why you saw that blue shift happen over the course of electionnite because all of the unperson votes got counted and don a trumped really well the in person votes and then all the land ballast are to be count it and then jobidon overtook trump and all f these vary es states but what happens when the number of mainland ballast is way way way lower because people ain't staying home because o covet or voting from home because of covet what happens if the republican party does not shoot itself directly in the leg by suggesting the people should not vote from home what happens when the math changes in other words none of these frees are good for jobidon which means the bison if you wants to when re election is going to actually has o you know do a good job the only thing that could save him would be good things happening in america but here is the problem the biggest prom for mobile his policies prevent exactly that he has not made the country a better place very few people feel tat the country is better run now the it was in two thousand nineteen and that's an easy pitch for true to make if he can stand pitch if from just says over and over and over is your life better now or was a better in twenty nineteen virtually every one things that life was better less chaotic less insane in twenty nineteen is even including the tweets and just one second we will talk about jobidons being held hostage by his own left and why this is absolutely crushing his reelect chance is first never hard of data brokers that the middle men collecting and selling all those signal

e ss v in dot come slashed express v in dot come slash men to learn moral was a speaking of robin's policy failures the most obvious policy failure of this ad ministration aside from inflationwhich will get to in just one second is emigration the emigration issue is front page it is it is hot button news and it should be hot butters because illegal immigration is at all time highs and me all time hides three hundred thousand border en counters in remember alone that is the highest monthly total ever that is a huge total and by thewy tat does not include get always meanwhile the d o was who mention yesterday is suing texts to stop texts from enforcing emigration law and meanwhile the united states is about to reopen four legal u us medical jordan cross crossings to day according to riders as highlevels of illegal immigration have receded and freed up personalbut how of they how they received exactly apparently the sign resume operation and an international bridge noble pasttexas two crossings in arizona another near sandy ego californium that is according to customs and border protection you just border authority struggled in remember to process migrant is apprehensions reach nearly levin thousand in a single day which several currents and former official said was near or ad a record his air member when they say that these border apprehensions are happening that does not necessarily mean that these are people who are crossing between crossings and then see piece picking them up very often in apprehension is somebody who actuary shows up at a boarder crossing and the its coin what apprehended a waiting further review for a asylum or refuge status but we know that the vast majority people whore claiming that states are not actually eligible for that status and then the administration basically catches thin releases those people they say can here is a date holdout is form come back in six months and will get in sort and then some people shop and some people don't in the spastically the end of the story and that is how you and up a twenty million leglemigrants in the middle of the country new whorehouse knows the a political looser democrats on the border are fighting mad is not to re publican issue democrats and texts fighting mad in earizona fighting mad and now hilariously in chico in new york fighting rabbits it turns out the when the chickens come home to roost when you back really bad bore policy and call your self a sanctuary city and then all the sudden oh know it is the consequences of my own actions people start arriving on mass in new york and chico straining your social services and sleeping on the streets you get tic to the my boiling issue for the white house what is the whorehouse doing about it are the trying to fix it of course not of course not cording to politico the bide administration is a tempting to flip the blame for the migrant crisis at the southern border not republicans good luck with that one seriously good luck with that the public's are let us build a wall let us report every one let us be as harsh on the legal emigration is humanly possible and then democrats are let us leave an open border and then when the borders open and people arrivlic this is this is republican's fault this the who killed cannibal me their for those who are not familiar with this mean from the internet is they mean in which one character shoot another character in the charts and then turns to camera is says who could have done this that is the democratic party when it comes to illegal immigration according to political an anticipation of speaker my chocs and headings you as southern border wednesday the white house issue to statement accusing house who peers of ducking the chance to dress the issue they ben attacking actions speak louder than words said whorehouse bones person drew bates house re publicans antiborder security record antiborer security record be f is to fined by a tempting to cut customs and border protection personal no what republicans did not want to do was increase the amount of processing power they wanted to increasethe amounts of enforcement power meaning turn people away at the border they did not simply want to increase these size and scope of the processing apparatus in order two alow in more people legally which is what your bide wants to do but your bide wants basically what you have here is you have a hose it with the piglet the s piglet right now is very narrow and it is happening is that the huge backlog of he legal emigrants who have not yet been process there two wastes solve his problem one is to turn off the hose s that you actually do not have a giant pipe line of people trying get across the border legally the other way is to open up the spigot which is to say alow we leglumbrans to porn o the country is whit is lately alahandro mayor's the department of homeland security had which is such an or welling notion that he is the had of department homeland security what homeland security has alpha duro maracas been providing at all cry was yesterday explaining the have a backlog of three million cases van backlog is a powerful example of how broken or immigration system is and for how long it has been broken because that backlog existed when i was in the department of homeland security to thousand nine it preceded me then and it priced me now win my tenure as ta secretary of homeland security that three million case backlog has been building three years in bearskin years it got much much worse when you as citizen ship in immigration system us a if services the agenceded in the department of homeland security that ad ministers our legal immigration system was find the actually gutted during the prior administration again what he wants to do is increase the profiting power he does not actual one to cut off the floe if you want legal migration could stop in a to cut off the floe but that's exactly what they by an ministration is unwilling to do according o politico pendant negotiators are trying to land by partizan agreement on policy to help stem the flow of migration and house republicans are now considering in teaching amorous as they should because he is not doing his job in you do not have to be guilty of any sort of crime to be cornute impeach we found that outworn democrat's impeachedonal true twice while alleging no actual criminal activity dereliction of duty would be a big one for slander orcas who has not secured the border in any way shape or form it is hilarious that mayor's was asked why exactly d you think that there is been this massive outbreak of ilegaamigrationally way higher than it was during trump washier than was during a bomb whose that happening he blames climate change in poverty which ore systemic problems in the northern triangle and satin america generally he he blames that which is heard since climate change according to lefts has been taking place for decades and poverty has been in dead to this region for again decades why now the answer by the way is that legal migrant will telly themselves jobidnous president the is lots of idiot of people chancing jobidon's nae as they had for the border here is alpha her maracas trying to blame this on systemic factors by let when politicians tend to blancornuotes stomach factors thus usually that is a way of them avoiding accountability in responsibility because how exactly is anyone supposed to solve climate change or poverty to blaming the moon a man the moon keeps making this happen how to we stop it we cannot he gamble up the moon when positions do tat preteen what their really saying is we are not going to do the thing we we know we should do instedrages cannot blame these endemic factors here wagon we are seeing the greatest number of misplace people not only at our suthenborder not only in the western hemisphere but a cross the globe you know i involved in bi lateral and musty lateral meetings with my counterparts from foreign countries in rope i in aria the indepacific all old the world in my ration the challenge of displaced people is the subject that comes up in every single conversation we have the effects of climate change poverty increasing level of theritarianism the very many challenges that are at the rule cause of the displacement of people around the world question why does the charged for legal migration look this ka why is its spike when hoiden becomes president no one the by administrations didn't answer that question in the answers perfectly obvious it is because jobidon is soft on i legal migration and his party is soft on i legal migration and again there in hot left wing ecus there is no reason for this democrats on the border understand that weaving the for wide open is totally insane its settles this was to be an ideological thing truly because the reality is that even lever first democrats people her for unions for example it used to be there are very much opposed to legal migration signal labor generally because they believe you was undercutting the wage base in the united states but now the democratic party has been captured by college educated white liberals that they seem to believe that leaving the border openest some sort of moral requirement be no follow that all the way in to jo bison losing the presidency as what is going to happen here and just one second will test the continuing democratic attempt to blame republicans for what is in fact a democratic problem first as we know twenty twenty four its can be a wild ride thou already seeing the impacts of inflation the gazump at the grocery store economic stagnation is will discuss momentarily is going to come next it is the next shoot to drop well it might be a

project the hon republicans this is not going to work if this is their strategy good good luck seriously good luck here is lemon her marches again he is the head of the department of home an security refusing to enforce border law and here he is blaming taxes is governor gragabbot for actually attempting to enforce border law we have taken action on the border and we have taken action with respect to the challenges that cities across the country are facing lame lime identify one as now there is anmicial problem here and that is the fact that we have one governor in the state of texts who is refusing to to operate with over other governors and other local officials and courttat efforts to address o challenge that our country which this country should stand united to address that our country facing and it is a remarkable failure of governments to refuse to to operate with one's fellow local an state officials what in the world again it is the federal government current we ruling gregabot to stop him from informing federal emigration law meanwhile careen john pierce worlds worth are secretary over the with out she says that jobidon still has confidence in his each a secretary they are gong to run this play book right into the ground it is it is political malpractice we must happening here to from any objective point of view you are an alien from out or space and you arrived in the united states and you saw i crisis at the southern border a president in the low forty's high thorites approval rating in a reelect fight where the border is going to be major issue shouting that his opponents our responsible and going to basically leave things in place you get what in the world is even happening here but that is with e my administration is doing mes mile e e e teeth ere her e re e e i e leone a was the a i e is the pet o one ace a on on the secretary i think an give said this moments ago i seized at the top as well we believe that top what there doing the house republicans are doing wit thisn'n impeachment incurious basement i we believe that i to political stone and we believe there is not there is no time for that anyhow there things that the america people wanted to get done is it what why aren't you doing any of them then join for his party says is all about republicans refusing him money to do emigration now we all know what is actually happening here that the money he wants for emigration is not to actually reject e legal emigrants at the border he does not want or remain in medical policy he tried to walk that back he does not want to simply change emigration law to make it harder for people to falsely clemasile his not wanted to any of that the money he wants is to open the spigot that is why republican's oppose it here is join claiming this about a lack of money mean died made you spend seven really dollars a year have a feeling can fined some money somewhere if what you actually want to do i stop the flovililimigration merely how much money do these people will not is totally crazy an the the federal government has only a couple of actual original purposes than has a bunch of crap that it does that literally has nothing to do with its constitutional duties the size and scope o the federal government is insanely beyond anything the founding fathers ever would've comprehend that it is absolutely maddening the founding father's legitimately fought a revolution be stop the size and scope of government and lack of representation with in that government if if they could see the federal governments a currently stands what do you think they would think of this me i got you bin walking around him spending seven sthrillyan dollars a year and he is like it's no re knew more money where's the money here we go then i in anyone for i the moral do anthingabout it e not is thing not to given the money in to protect the boarder how to give me the money i need to protect the border we're right we were not spending enough money our national that is thirty former shrilly in dollars they t shrill in dollars he is spending more money than any president has ever spent ever but the problem is short falls of cash apparently according to jobiton nailed it but except that we know that that is tantrum because right now join is requesting another giant supplemental bill that gin supplemental bill includes sixty billion dollars in aids you crane fourteen billion dollars in aid to israel some billions dollars in aid to titan and re publican steal can work gan to atsombor security here because he know what as long as we are hoping to securer foreign allies perhaps you should secure a southern border a all bit and joins nope and chucshumeris nope her is chukshumer the senate minor the senate majority leader yesterday talking about they'd and saying well if republicans want eh or tone will discuss what each or two is in a second attach to the spill the answer is no when the house a or as the only solution which eve we gear one a we o you send see certainly every senator o every gar send then every a an sos would note to ay he says by the way that there is agreement among democrats an republicans about need to fix the boarder but they will not actually propose anything that systemically changes the problem on the border they refuse to do it sewer christmurphy of connecticut is the lea democrat in the border talks he says i think of the sent get something done in o by partisan way it's put enormous pressure on the house to get something done as well well far they have not one a very good job of it we will get to h or two what the republicans have proposed in the house in just t one second first balance of nature fruits an venues it is a great way to make are the you are getting essential nutritional ingredients every single day balance of nature uses an advance call back in process that in capsulate fruits in venues into wholefood supplements that sacrificing their natural antioxidants the capsids are completely void of those additives fillers s extract synthetics pesticides or added sugar the only thing they have in them is the fruits and the edges right now not only will ministers get thirty five per cent off your first order it will now get a free libra and spice supplement as well through balance of natures fiber and spites supplement ts to revolutionary fibradrink with unique blend of twelve spices and whole foods people down here at the studio have intranet producer's act makes it appoint to bring his balance of nature fruit and vet capsules when we are on the road because the road is very stressful time formal is require to do many things in very short periods of time also yestoli chug those things nobody's business there is never been an easier way to make sure that your get your daily doses of fries and values experience balance of nature for yourself to day go to balance of natured to come use prom idea tho per get thirty i percent of your first order as a preferred customer plus et a free bottle of fiber and spices that is bounds of natured a compromo cochuperol for thirty i percent off your first preferred order plus a free bottle of fiber and spices case what exactly is it the chuctumer its rejecting here what exactly is it that that is terrible is some in all the secure the border act of twenty twenty three these secure the border act which is h a too is som a fairly conservator bill it proposes the following things the according to emigration forum dot or which is actually a rather pro emigration outlet and here is what they say it would reestablish trump recorder policy including restarting construction on the border wall you rein force the definition of operational control as the profession of all unlawful entries into the united states including entries by terra other unlawful aliens instruments of terrors an a cots and other contraband all lawful entries that would be now the goal of operational control it would require that the a cipraterry to en corporate physical barriers in for structures and technologies to achieve situational awareness an operational control of the us medical border it old increase the number of full time border patrol agents to at least twenty two thousand blast that gives the lie to the idea that the republicans do not want to increase word patrol agents they do they just do not want to increase the number of people whore going to be involved in processing illegal immigration forms as opposed to the number of people who are on the border catching the roadways it would prohibit the use of you us customs and border protection ran marine operations resources to transport non citizens who ill not be detains into the country's interior in others wo should be spending federal dollars to bust people all around the country the c b p it would require the us bore patrol to put together a strategic plan bay send in formation provided by border community state holders hospitals farmers ranchers property owners victims of crimes and other negatively impacted by legal immigration in all the sounds absolutely reasonable it would also restrict access for asylum i would raise the initial screening standard non citizen would have to prove they were more likely than not ultimately qualify for asylum to continued pursuing their protection clam and not be just kicked out which again why is that wild should you be able to come to the border and jursatlessan i need asylum and the why is iron i just do i well maybe musical one present chaos this personeeds asylum polish hour release them into the interior of the united states or should by what we call it preponderance of the evidence fifty one percent shot larrigan get as mum now we say o kafir you don't come in make or asylum claim will let can because the chance are petty good are gin to receive asylum that is a smart policy the democrats oppose it would ban the vast majority of asylum seekers from requesting protection at suborder if they travel trough a third country on rout to the united states and had not already been denied asylum there by the ay the is the same raisin mexico holds to the basic idea here would be that if you come up to the suborder and you did not request asylum in mexico first you need to go back to mexico and request asylum there and then if they deny that then you can come to the united states in request asylum but e should not be able to pickanchos of the best country just because it is the best country if you are truly requesting asylum meaning you are trying to avoid the worst possible cesarean that does not give you automatic access to the united states it would restrict asylum claims generally to miring to a rive in the u us and official port of entry see tantric go between the border crossings cross the fairground run in to the united states an inclemasylum yes at should go to a border crossing in order us to process you normally i none of this seems wildly crazy it would also explicitly and the existing presumption against attaining a non citizen child the company by family making it easier for families with minor children to be held in detention because right now they big rob one big problems is that you are not allowed to hold the e e child intention facilities with family which leads to separations at the borer between children and parents which has then been used is a lever to release the parents to now it saying ocewell you know howbatleys keep the families together which age makes some sends it required the each just to actually reestablish family detention requiring parents and kid to enter together without authorization to be held together inemogration detention and then say that thisatisfies the flora settlement agreement that flora settlement was an agreement come to by the clean administration and the and the federal judiciary with regard to son separation of children from families again all of this is perfectly normal and act a visit the stuff the your lion opposing this stuff chuck summer opposing much opposing by the way that they would rather kill you cranky than passim the bill would criminalize overstaying a legal vests if you stave for you overstate o visa that makes their criminal penalty then not want you that they will not yo be able to just an it'll pay fine or something it one to read a fine what it means for parole to be granted on a case by case basis see cannot categorically just declare the people are parole data and all of this and it would add e verifies to employers build actually have to check the emigration status of the people the employ why is any of this remotely controversial if you polls each one of those propositions i guarantor those are seventy percent propositions seventy present of america probably agree with every single thing that i just said who disagrees mean it is it is an but but democrats our ideologically committed to this for example represent roconam by the way i colonies ben on the show anything us an honest person even if we disagree on a lot of policy issues democrat from aliform he says ism not rid ism not in favor of changing parol and asylum in favor of you crane aid me first ply should be in favor of it just with value grenade but the fact that democrats are willing to take what they says the topnational security priority not allowing you grain to be eaten by russia in subject yet an subjugate that subsume that get rid of that sublimate that to the open border policy's totally crazy here is room a how crucial is that ad for you can right now it is absolutely gushalin we should have a stand along upward down long on the a to you gran and i strongly support the ad to you grad but what i do not support his getting had of the america commitment to asylum or for all just to give ad to you grand hen when were not con a compromised than tire values is a nation over that n values a nation didn't realize the value is tarnation was allowing people to make spurious claims of refuge he status mel all this place directly inanotrum's hands i say the radical left capturing been it has been the downfall of his administration u dona trump has a has a peace in the to one register bad of the iococasis talking about jo lion's border is taster and he says o course he heder write this but this will be the policy he implements we this this is the thing betray this the thing that conservatives me understand done trumps says lotocrap when he is sweeting his actual policy gets made by the people round him the people when can since dona true of their policy and up getting their policy actually passed made law implemented this is why you have three conservative supreme cortjustices and not random the dona true picked out of final socks dona trump has deep engagement with the issue of supreme torturous prudence it is this leopard we is telling him were is a list of justices who will probably be good in this is just how trump works and everybody who is can vote for true basically understands this true has some very good political instincts and he has some very bad habits on twitter and then if he surrounds himself of three people he tenstinplents some pretty good policy which is why again he is leading in the pulsewill get to dona trumps propose worker policy again he is skunking by drones issue it is amazing me the bytomale compromise of the publicans and attempt to at least neutralize the issue it is totally wild gets that in a second first a now

policy join is blowing it and it is playing rites down frog's hands his good piece of a demon register obviously not written bifocal trump does not matter it is the policy trump will implement he says under the trumpadministration we have the most secure border in yous history we ended catching release and removed over one million legal aliens my virus term i negotiated on unprecedented agreements of central america nations and broker remain in mexico to stop the lot of migrant to our border i got the medical governments to play tens of thousands of soldiers to the border free of charge every step o the way we fought obstructions left long judges and radical democrats to try to stop us and we won and he says now you are witness witnessing the disastrous results of jobidon bison came in cancel the border while end remain a mexico ripped up my asylum bands ended title forty two and began resettling millions of migrants into america communities at tax pair expense and now your witnessing the disastrous results we have the highest number of i legal border crossings in history by far on my first say back in office i will terminate every open borders policy of the bide administration and immediately restored the full set of strong trump border policies then we will be in a record setting a deportation operation jobidon is given us no choice the millions of the legal alien have invaded underbid require a record number of removals this is just common sense to achieve the skull it'll make clear to every department into state an local governments we must use all rest sources and authorities available we will shift massive portions of federal lawn foremen to emigration in foremen including parts of the d e a eight f f b i and d oh us i will use the alien enemy's act re move known or suspected gang members drugdeulers or cartel members from the united states and we will use title forty two to end the child traffic crisis at last again this is trumskon went on the issue its issue matters to america and jobidon is walking sleep walking directly into his own defeat it is not just with the rid am gets remember jobidon needs good news before the election he is not going to win this race on the basis of people him better than trump as a person it is not going to work this time it is simply not the reception of jobidon is too bad it is been stagnant and terrible since the f ganniston with do all people wo not perceive him as the kindly elderly gentlemen any more that is what he ran was in twenty twenty and no one thinks him that way they think of him as somewhat venal somewhat corrupt crochudy somewhat see nice and fairly radical on policy that is the actual perception of jobidon says gin and eat a significant economic recovery is that going to happen this your we the fedscan do its bast the federal reserve obviously as historically been i the business of trying to jog the economy just before presidential elections as cops always back the nixing administration well according s the ballsy journal federal reserve officials thought there were done raising in trestrateswhen they decided last month told them study the minutes o the meetings didn't reveal a meaning full debate about when to start lowering rates hell nearly all officials anticipated policy rates toreventually beloved before the end of this year the written account of their remember twelfth tan thirteenth meeting released on wednesday under sword heightened in certainty over how to navigate the next interval of monetary policy after the most rapid increase in interest rates in four decades is there really not sure how much they're going to reduce the rates a guarani you the got try to reduce the rates this year because if they do not the economy is going to start to stagnate in fact we are already seeing that according to axis steady job postings cool er hiring and less quitting after a record shattering stretch amebic as once remarkable labor market has settled into a more normal groove the result is sufficiently cool demand in will not stop in elation but a still bust enough for workers who want a job to find one other tines point to a continued cool down as the year came to a close hiring eased slightly to five point five million that is three used sixty three thousand sure hires than in october the number of quits which is hemming people are quitting their job to find another job is down three point felt down to three point fivemillion the sound a hundred fifty seven thousand this is back down to below de member twenty nineteen this this is just the beginning because again what goes up must come down at the very vestry to get a slow recovery from here on it as can a look bomb numbers this is why then your times reports that auto sales are expected to slow after twenty twenty three demons expects the industry to sell fifteen point seven at million vehicles this year that amount to only a modest increase from the fifteen point five at millions sold last year that is when sales jumped twelve per cent the credit situation is not grate for people because all of the intrestrateser up and that means that people are going to be buying less for years people to advantage it zero percent ones to buy vehicles even as the prices clime but such deals offered by automaceersto move inventory have nearly disappeared in the wake of the feds rate heights and the fourth quarter of twenty twenty three new vehicle sales with zero per cent financing account if for just two point three per cent of all sales according to demon's monthly payments are now at near record hives and again you have a national debt that is completely out of control are we likely to get a booming economy this year you might avoid a technical recession what you are going to have s an imbedded inflation that continues to be wayhigher than when join took office again even if inflation stopped to day pretty much everything you buy about twenty per cent more expensive than it was when join took office a dollar in canary of twenty twenty one now what you buy for dollar now cost you one eighteen according to government statistic that is a bad number for joined and as the economy cools joins en fill the brunt of that a again he is been defying economic gravity but not really inflation was the economic gravity when the interstates go up the economy cools down everyone expecting it its normal what you expect is that become power before the election probably drops the antrestrates to try to job the economy a little bit is that con be too little to late probably given the effect that given the fact that again all the stuff is imbedded tit is not as though when we sate in elation goes down the actual amount of money that you are paying goes down deflation has not yet set in deflation would be things are less expensive to day than they were yesterday even best case in armor talking about it continued in elation rate of two per cent which wit the fiddlers are aims for that is on top of the area e embedded seventeen to twenty per cent increase that you seen over the course of the bide administration meanwhile the possibility of more shocks to the global economic system are very very real shipping in the red sea continues to be a complete disaster area and what the point is having a mufti mufti tens billions of dollar military if you are not going to be able to stop hoo the pirates from stopping shipping through the red sea jobidons international policies can have some dramatic impacts on the america economy one o the big factors in price inflation over the course of last several years has been supply chanbottle next left over from cove that has been a very real phenomenon in the economic world what that was driven by global pandemic and shut down son particular countries labor shorties anal the rest what happens when you have again a bunch of ragtag pirates or shutting down in entire shipping methodology that lowers cast for the entire globe on products ranging from oil to clothing an enormous amount of shipping goes through the red sea and yet here we are to day with the u s and its lies having give the soothes warnings say that could not prevented by the united states taking a very anti iron position from the get under mobile donate trump had basically ostracized iron from the international community the soothes were listed as a you s a you us labeled terrain group jobidon demisted them cordon decided to go hard on the sorties hard on the israilies easy on the agrarians and the result is this the results is case in the mideleast to the turns out the case actor in the mdeleast is iron it has always been iron it is not say arabia it is not israel sir's very bazar t the misadministration is now having to back fill all of that and the problem is that when you make those sorts of mistakes it is very hard to contain the problem on the other end when you open that can the cans now open is only one way to clothes that can and that is you have to blow up some crap among the soothes at the very least we now that the cans ben open against israel by ran with or got to commas ancisbala there is the possibility tat the only way t to close that can is softer cusballaw which is another major issue for the bi administration robin's reelect that fort requires there to be some level of calm in the middle east re establish what they are hoping it is to contain the israel commas issue two israel and commas that ballad does not come in the only way that is going to happen as if the united states makes very very clear docusballaw that if us ball gets involve the united states finishes cuba that is actually what would be in jobitons political interest because if that war opens up that is very bavragobiton politically speaking is bad for the world by the way you do not want this broadening into a large war israel does not want that probably iron does not want that because it starts ta broader into a larger war then the irony an most probably not in leadership at the end of that day but with that see a little but a strength right now would go a long way according to the walstreturnal the us braining keyallies issue but officials described as a final farthing to the soothe remind rebel group lend states to ceases its attacks on international shipping in the red senor bear the consequences the shipments issue by more than does nations quit in going the attacks in the red we are you legal unacceptable and profoundly destabilizing the soothes were better the responsibility of the cons sequences should they continue to threaten lives the global economy and the free all of comers in the regions critical waterways the us military has prepared options to strike the hoo these going to us officials should the us written and other nations use force potential targets could include the launchers for antoship missiles and drones targeting inform structure such as coastal raise our insulation and store facilities four munitions one o the challenges that a lot of weapon systems are mobile thetrelse very cheap the bine administration's been cautious about using force seeking to protect tho prospects for diplomatic resolution of the emit conflict get yet good luck wat that one soothe fighters overthrew the meiny government in twenty fourteen there is been on going very bloody war between the soothes and the south government and other ruinations attempting to use the hoo these who again are narration back terror group with a slogan talking about death to america death to israel glory tala and all the rest john curly was the president has made clear the united states is not seek conflict of any nation or actor in the midlife but neither will we shrink from thetas of defending ourselves are interests are corners or the free flow of international commerce as of tuesday the worthies of arty carried out twenty four attacks on commercial ships since mid nonmember and of course is not just the soothes the everanian back terror proxies in a rock that are striking at america forces the have yes bell which began is warming up on israel northern front what is going to push iron off the ball is going to be the west actually doing something warnings are not going do it out gan to have to kills soothes mean its just that simple he ring that to kills some hotly terra if you want to free the shipping in this in this area meanwhile in ran it seems things are heating up two boys exploded and kill the least eighty four people at a commemoration for cussemsolemani solemn of course was the terror general who's killed in arch at the beast of the trump administration none immediately claimed responsibility for this blast that kill the eighty four people at the funeral irons leaders vowed to punish those responsible for the blasts which wounded at least two hundred and eighty four people the service to the the death to at this point they ad been over a hundred nouns down in the eighties the gathering mark you fort the anniversary of the killing of sulymani the explosions occurred near his graveside as long lines people gathered four the event now of course the agrarians are blaming the united states an israel this does not meet with any of the sort of preticettes that suggest that twas in is rail or america action it does not make any sense it does not achieve any get political goal it dinactually kill any one important that there is nothing there that suggest that this was some sort of america is daily operation either together or alone it is it is question much more likely in in fact that it was some the some form of uranium rebel group attempting to generate i at the rani ad ministration iron supreme leader tell alecamani s to the attacks will face a harsh response he did not name any possible suspect probably because the agrarians know that if they tried to turn this into an america is daily thing that it actually increase o the chance of or again iron once wars using its proxies it does not want ware directly iron does not want what bethel united states does not either israel does not either no one one is that as the mean not happen fury of world wars but gay here is a quick theory of world wars world wards begin when you have a series of popping popcorn colonels and no one actually turns down the heat when those series of popping popcorn colonels start to increase when the heat increases like a pop her in a pop hern a pop hern than all of the sudden everything's hoping all at once at that's wore our staring a s the a least it start off at this commons attack those one popcorn colonel then he say to see kisballah attack that was another popcorn colonel hes a the toothy attacks that is another popcorn colonel he saw attacks in serial attacks in a rock here a more popcorn colonels an eventually eventually if this continues some one in the uranium government is going to authorize a strike against an america target and sink in america ship or something and then america is going to pummel them there is one way to stop that which is stop the popcorn colonels from popping an you cannot stop them from popping simply by appealing to them to stop you are going to have to actually quash them where they are you t let his really finish off confuse you have to threaten kibble the f it gets involves than a america will finish off ks ball directly that is the reason we have aircraft carrier station the mediterranean it is not because i or any one else want america at war with on it is because i want africa not at war with iron that threats are useful credible threat of force is a very significant torrent it always has been it is why the united states can have to blow away the soothes because if they continue two a chief quornqote victories against international shipping in the red sea do you think that incentivize more talks or is a distant sentivise more attacks again sooner are probably responsible for what just happened in er on according to the a p son extremest groups including the iris group have conducted large skallattaks in the pass that killed civilians shape majority iron that is probably what is happening here one just one second we will get to the latest on hazard we are clouding gay now how is a piece out talking bout how hard it is to be

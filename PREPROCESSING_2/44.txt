the men sir so responser by express v in protect your online privacy today an express we piano come slashed it is our less broadcast of the year i wanted to do some summing up of twenty twenty three and some lessons moving forward for twenty twenty four over all twenty twenty three was pretty me year ma in the sense that are politics has only got more ugly in the sense that the economy has continued to plod along at messed in the sense that foreign policy is now a complete dumpster fire ad predicted the beginning of the year a ninety percent bad year i cam in a little low is ninety six per cent time predicting for twenty twenty four ninety nine per cent bad just to be safe none the less there is some lessons for all of us to learn and remember from twenty twenty three lesson number one when people say they are coming for your kids you should lessen in jury twenty twenty one the san francisco game's choir saying uniquely honest song in an attempt to slap at social conservatives the choir created and posted a song in which they said they were quote coming for your children here is what this creepy song sounded your cogsomewat g tax a the e well that was true of course radical progressives believe the only way to created better world it is trip children a way from their parents ideologically to indoctrinate them in the ways of left wing social change to turn them into little activist then on exploding their parents values that is how you create a better world those progressives they are not new they spent generations taking over the schools the media the entertainment industry it is the reason why as we discuss earlier this week a new hazard hers pushes seventy nine per cent of people aged eighteen to twenty four in the united states believe they quote white people are oppressors and none what people and people of certain groups have beenoppressed and as result should be favored to day universities and for employment it is why sixty seven per cent of those same young people be live that quit news as a class are oppressors and should be treated as oppressors if you are wondering just why hundreds of thousands of young people western leftist are in the streets chancing for commons that would be the reason why it is we are also wondering just while twenty per cent of all young people now considered themselves l g b t u plus minstovidaby sign that is also why generations of children have been hi jacked into a need marksist binary of oppressor verses oppressed and it is always better to identify as the oppressed then the oppressor makes you feel copier and gives you unending power to do anything you want after all ifs you are the oppressed you can do what ever you wants the oppressor to free ourself and liberate yourself recruiters for this perverse ideology start really young really really young that is why this week coco melon lane on ethics featured two gate ads seething their son to put on a skirt and it tiara in the name of self fulfilment here is what that looked years g the how valley grab out those who for tor t created tend we o you notbuts h to all thin i just beyustitrintiti i a othethinto tit just be us for context cool means you two channel has a hundred seventy million subscribers and a hundred seventy three billion views yes the producers o most watch children content in human history are coming for your kids too teach teaching them gender fluidity and exploding the idea of the traditional family structure there it is the educational system whether it is the media whether it is entertainment re lot of people who want to change how your children thinks that is less a number one they are coming for your kids and you should do something about it one of the reasons why we here at daily wire built an entire trimming out were called bunker s and put your kids in front of children programming that does not wreck their lives that actually reflects your values by that makes a great christian gift where ism pitching it hat on over to bent see dot come right now okay lessen number two from twenty twenty three they are a lot of people who do not think you this something westerns have a really tough time with a lot of enlighten philosophy is based on the idea that everybody is basically the same all the same now obviously we are all equal in the eyes of god we all have innate human valley but we certainly do not think the same and the enlightenment idea that every single person wants the same things at route that every single person regardless of culture regardless of education regardless as how they are brought up thinks bored of the same things that is a live and it is a stupid lie and it is a really dangerous live in twenty twenty three come ass slaughtered children in their crews burn them alive raped women in front of their husbands and then killed them or drag them off to goes after showing their husbands in the head and entire cobra of westerners thought well it is probably because they were victimized in some way something must have happened to drive them to that because after all who would do that this is who in this corn concocting israel and compass when comedos takestone children and uses them as human shields the west at least left is west besides that must be israel fault somehow because apteral the people of common they must think the same way that western left is to they must be driven to this sort of thing well there is another possibility and that is because commas does not think you there have your priorities that she do not care about their children in the same way that you do or least in the way that you think that they should they have different priorities then you which is why they are fine with burning babies alive in their crews and here is the thing pretending that people are all thinking you will get you kill people do not all want the same thing they do not all want freedom freedom does not beat in the best of every human being as gorge all be bush once foolishly said that is not reality they're lot of people who prizes for example religious fealty over freedom they're a lot of people who prize government benefits over they're lot of people who drives a lot of different things in ways that that you do not prize than that is wat you have to understand who they are in order to deal with them realistically this means though we must be realistic about our enemies on the foreign front obviously jobs are not console the problems that you have with commons or hesballa a peahens is not going to solve the problems you have with the chines government being realistic about your enemies reading what they teach their kids reading what they themselves think that is the best way to understand them rather than simply projecting your own thoughts on to them and ten assuming that if some thing makes them angry it must be you but is not just being realistic about our enemies on the foreign front it also means we have to be realistic about many of the people who live with us fellow america fellow westerners many of whom also do not want the same things that you do and what that really means is that we are going to have to have some really serious discussions in this country about what holds us all together as the country feels its rang as i feels its coming apart for enough to figure out what do we hold in common because if it turns out that people do not think you in the country that you live in you have a serious problem a very serious problem get's a more on that in just one second first e tell you about being healthy this year that be one of you not coodabout u my fruits and veges but what i am much better about is taking my balance of nature of fruits and veges

plus a free bottle of fiber and spice right now kit when you take a look at the problem people in the country who do not think you or enough start thinking pretty seriously about what holds us together now the very notion of free speech is not it because it turns out that free speech it is a it is an important principle but it also does not speak to what kind of speech is good a room in which any opinion is held is not get a room that theoretically has a common value namely that any opinion should be allowed be held but that is not enough to build a society upon you have to have a common vision of the good what exactly get hold together is that the constitution and rule of law hell feels that is falling apart pretty quickly right now when you have the colorado states supreme court that is basically overthrowing the constitution and the rule of law in order cardinal trumphon ballad is i n be the rule of law from the white house well not loll there promoting the violation of law with illegal executive orders and the dona being militarizes against political opponents pandas well discuss in a minute there scan get back lash that that s can be just as ugly what else holds us together about property rights a lot of the prom lot of the the country rest not does not believe in property rights by the way back to freespeach a huge per centare o the country does not actually believe in freeze principles at all they believe the people who disagree with them main line political opines forget about fringy people mainline political opponents should be slants we live in a country in which college compasses we will kick you off the campus fore saying that men are men and women are women and then the college presidents will lo testify in front of congress simultaneously about how it requires contact to truly understand in a serious way whether or not calling for menticide of news is bad about freedom of religion the to be something that held us together hell now the states there actively targeting religious practice and as our institutions wine which was the glue that held us together galleys to go to church or synagog together we it have common events common culture what can hold us together then less in number three weakness reeds a egression whey found this one out good and hard this year if america in the west go to sleep on our enemies our enemies take advantage theresthis pour notion that'come quite prevalent on the left and on the right that america just goes to sleep and retreats into itself the rest of the world stays exactly the way that it was one moment to go and that is really really stupid it is not true if america abandons the world the world becomes significantly worse and that has real spill over for the united states not chest in terms of bad things happening all over the world because you can always close your eyes and pretend it does not effect you it is happening very far away but also in terms of how you live your life the economy which you do rely upon gets a lot worse your safety becomes a lot for tenias when i turns out their lot for people around your borders who the your got if you go to sleep on your enemies they take advantage has been clear since mobile decided to ignominiously and cowardly fashion run away from afghanistan in hand over the country to seventh century barbarians it is also to by the way in you crane the reality is that thanks to brock mama and prior presidents and goofing gorge shall you bush basically doing very little when russia invaded georgia when russia invaded crime and the don was it turns out that that encourage russia to invade you can its ben a lot o talk about how western militant created cassia's invasion of you crane now western weakness created cassia's invasion of you crane because of russia actually felt they were going to get clocked in severe fashion and lose the war that would not have entered the war this is what the torrents is based on as always there are basically two strategies when it comes to preemptively preventing a war one is appeasement and the other is to turn some are the only two strategies available that really is no third now when it comes to intransigent enemies who do not the way that you live and have fundamental disagreements about how the world order should be structured when it comes to those con tries only to options appeasement returns there is no third isolation is generally a form of appeasement deturints is where nobody walks across that border becausethey are afraid that they can no get clock ins next money well when you run away from the world the world becomes worse is true in the gosistrip both israel and the united states we are weak with palistonian terrorism both israel and the united states decided the compass could basically be contained and dealt with both israel in the united states were easy wat the palistonian authority they re lit on technology they are light on the idea that forcing israel into concessions to its terrorist enemies would somehow by peace appeasement would be the preemptive anti war strategy rather then determine and it turns out that broke down and it failed and that bred massive aggression and it is breeding more aggression right now for example a much more aggressive on the midleleast the about administration spent years appeasing the agrarians the trump administration push back the bid administration went back to appeasing the agrarians and the first thing they did was get militant o literally every border they have the et every single proxy group that they have from compass to cusballa in the north of israel to the soothes here in fact is avidin that the who the just release championing there own militant in taking over ships from the red sea here is with that it you looks as you can see these are ships soothe flags and palestinian flags and tit is the old palestine we have come with steadfastness and bravery the strength of god is within us after raja and his family all palestine we have come remember the country to seven hundred dollars we helper capital very poor country they fell all these resources specifically to kill people and take overshippin ens the axis of all woods is coming o misguided masses the fulfilment of the promise of the hereafter and triumph of the message and they do not think you the axis of all woods is coming all woods is om a reference torn omit guided masses the fulfillment of the promise of the hereafter and the triumph of the message and against to bunch rag tag pirates they can a crapy boats with some machine guns and it is a very well pretusvidio i will say they a good job wit the drop footage here is the problem if the less doesn't blow them out of the water here gin to get even more aggression we get to that in just at one second we need o ramp up our efforts to save the lives of innocent babies i cannot trust this enough because of our partnership with freeborn and organization dedicated to saving the lives of the unborn we can actually do with just that every day reborn network of clinics rescues two hundred babies as they compete had to had with the abortion chines freeborn offers free alter sounds to moms for considering abortion once these mouse their babiesing here the heartbeat they're twice as likely too choose life and nowthro mash your tax deductible gift is doubled too because freeborn supports both moms and babies with divers careers council and more you are offering double blessings now is the time to put your errand right off to work please double down soak you'd it can do anything more important this year were hitting the end of the knows in a maze sing time to do some good write at the end of the urgestile pound to fifty onorphone say keycard baby that is pounds two fives zero baby or do not ate securely a reborn dot come slash ben again at is freeborn dot come slashed go check him out my now start saving lives to day overtime ataman sees for baba ultrasound it is going to radically increase the chance hat that baby sees life justice pound to fifty idiophone say keycard baby of again when it comes to weakness it breeds aggression weakness in the reset is going to breed aggression from china china already making noises about the possibility of taking than i would say that if things keep going the way that they are i would say the is better than a fifty fifty shot the china attempts to make a more aggressive move against titan for example attempting to blockade titan and daring the west to break that blockade at the risk of getting into a direct war with china and at the risk of china shutting down the titan straight or crating such trouble in the south china see that the world economy absolutelytanks in advance of an election you could certainly see china doing that while jobidon is president because they see that he is weak they see just as well as everyone else does that san francisco is literally a cesspool filled with human feces until the chines president shows up at which point the dictator gets to see clean street and they clean up the streets for him a newsmen two china is going to breed more aggression this also the by the way with regard to immigration weakness on our southern border means lots and lots of people are taking advantage which is we the bin administration has been seen by illegal immigrants the world over as a patsy it is why you see people chancing jobidon's name as they approach the southern border it is why your sing hundreds of thousands of people arriving at the southern border every month unprecedented levels waves of illegal immigrants other forms of weakness include mufti culturalism mufti cultural is in being the idea that there is no advance for senor advanced culture there is no better or worst culture that all cultures exist in a sort of like warm miasma of mediocrity you cannot distinguish between them you should not discriminate between cultures but if you do not stand up for your own culture you end up importing extraordinary numbers of people actually hate you culture and underminer culture it breeds aggression conversely strength means facing actual hard realities it means not backing down nor principles even when that cost is insanely high this is why it is important that for example the west not cave just because war is ugly of course war is ugly sinew example of what bravery actually looks is the we just an astonishing story last week we covered what has been the worst story of the war for the israilies after october seventh which was there are three hostages whore taken by commas and its civilian alias into the gossipstrip and these three hostages somehow gotloos and they put up a sign and here that said we are hostages they apparently wore were free for three days or another they try to surrender to these daily troops their bar crusted and they r carrying white flags and these really troops thought that they were probably terrorists because thesis a trap this was not an area where hostages are supposed to be roaming free is r have been dull dealing with booby traps and bombs on bodies for a very long time in this war and these really troops the idea shot these three hostages by ace killed them terrific story i want to read this larks this the canbravery it takes actually win wars against and transient evil enemies there is a woman i iridium she is the mother of one of the hostages who's killed by the idea youtomheim and a she sent this message to these daily soldiers from that tragic instant am ma translate it just hello this is it is cilium your tom's mother i want to tell you that i love you very much and that ism sending you my hugs from afar i know that everything that happen is not your fault at all it is no one's fault except for comas know that you are doing the greatest thing but in the world that could happen that could help us the people of israel and all of us need you believe stay healthy do not hesitate even for a moment if you see a terrors do not thing to yourself that you killed him a hostage deliberately we need to protect yourself because that is the only way you can protect of at the first opportunity you are invited to come to our home any one who can comity our home we want to see you with our own eyes to hug you and tell you that you did everything you could as much as it hurts to say it was the right thing not one us judges you not one of us are angry at you that is astonishing strength and that is the actual kind of strength it takes two defeat people who fundamentally wish to make the world in incredibly horrible place in just one second when going to get to the fourth lesson of twenty twenty three first are you struggling with bad taxes or unfired returns the tires is escalating collections by adding twenty thousand new agents in these challenging times your best defense is to use tax network you essay with over fourteen years of experience tax that work you essay has save their clients over a billion dollars in back taxes they specialized negotiating wit the press they introduce your at significantly tax that work you essay does not just negotiate that protect our assets from era seizures and manage your yearly returns for ongoing compliance importantly there license tell with all state tax issues regardless of where you live in the united states if you upon the aphonia taxes it can absolutely reckon life do not let that happen instead seize control of your financial future right now do not let those tax issues overpower you and reckon contact tax network you say for immediate relief and expert guidance call one eight hundred two four five six thousand or visit t n you say dot comslash appeal turn to tax network you essay find your path to financial piece of mind tats t n you say do come slash chipuro again t n you say do comslash paper or one eight hundred two four five six thousand oka we have talked about the first three lessons of twenty twenty three first when people say their coming virgins you should listen in do something about it two whist people do not actually think you and three we canoness breeds aggression now lessen four what goes around comes around always and for ever if you do something to somebody else politically in the united states the chances are extremely hie that that is going to come back to haunt you when it comes to domestic politics democrats seem to be under the weird impression that playing with legal fire has no consequences that is a lie is an incredibly stupid lie the prosecutions of donga trump lire gan to carry well into next year throughout the election cycle four separate prosecutions three of which are entirely spurious the new york prosecution of dona trump the washington deck prosecution of dona trump the georgia prosecution of dona trump all of those are deliberate misreads of the law and obvious miss reeds of the law they are stretches not only are they stretches there is don attempt to push them before the elections the trial actually happens before the election as to the critically convicdonal trump before the election to effect the election the fourth case which is the classified documents case down in florid just by the statute true violated the statue also it happens to be that here reclettan violated the same exact statute knowing cared an now did anything in fact names come specifically went out of his way to change the nature of the law its letter off the hook all of that rap together looks a political prosecution of trump an true has ben making the case that the system is caponized against hin and then the cherry was put on top of that particular sundae by the collar out of state supreme court this week which announced that donate trump could simply be removed from the ballet in primaries and the general election as a quick that insurrectionist despite the fact that there is no definition of insurrectionist in law that dona trump has open convicted of or tried four insurrection even the cases in which is cogently tried do not allege violation of insurrection law the attempt to turn donate trump into the test case for this is totally insane furthermore when you issue executive orders that move well be on the constitution when you jobidon decide that you are going to use she the occupational safety and hazards administration to cram down babies on eighty million america in violation of law when you use your pen in order to simply relieve student loved debt when you do those things you are setting the stage for precisely the reverse to be done to you if you wish for republicans to abide by the law you cannot break the law if you wish for republicans not to abuse executive power you cannot abuse executive power once you open candor's box the box is now open andthabox is open because republicans seem to think that if bad democratic behavior justifies republican reactionary be behavior that is also totally fine things are going to get worse because then democrats are going to take whatever republicans add on to the bad behavior and the thegn to at on to that bad behavior if democrats decide that they are going to tried to take down trump post twenty sixteen with a series of lies that justifies donate trump lying about the law with regard to the twenty twenty election and suggesting that the vice president of the united state my pens had the unilateral ability to simply throughout certified votes and that the en justifies democrats reacting by abusing the law to bar trump from the ballad overtly or to prosecute him politically to stop him all of which will then justify dona trump denying the election results in twenty twenty four if he loses all of which will then justify riots and prosecutions we can see precisely where all of this is going the endless cycle of reactionary politics can only be stopped if somebody decides it not to be reactionary and to be reasonable and to stop that is the only way but is not just one side both sides have to stop he ais otherwise one side is unilaterally disarming and here in lies the problem with our modern politics there is no consensus that both sides need to stop this there are too many democrats or out their celebrating barring donate trump from the ball there are too many democrats ore out they're celebrating the political prosecutions of donate trump there are too many democrats are perfectly willing to watch jobidon be dictatorial in his presidency because he is member of their party anal that can justify is similar but more action from the other side which will justify similar but more action from the other side the nature of america politics is incredibly reactionary at this plenty time while you really need is for both sides to go weapons down we all which goes beats the second lesson which as we better find some common ground pretty damned quickly or things are going to get really ugly really fast allot uglier even than they are right now which is why twenty twenty four is shaping up to just be dumpster fire that finally lesson number five from twenty twenty three in competence has consequences this is true for every one incompetence rules the roost we are now in a race to the bottom now on the left that incompetence is coming from the fact that the meritocracy is seen as a it is an imposition of power that is somehow if you are hooded things and you are successful tats not cause your good at things is cause you exploited some one and to the best thing that we can do is get rid of the marytocray and then ignore the incompetents the incompetence is now bled through to every area of our government jobidon is in competent i mean he is mentally incompetent at this point i mean here is video of join literally yesterday randomly shuffling into curtains ism telling you that the the joke from share got about him being a roomful is just true it is not even a joke any more here is libido not finishing a speeches not knowing where to go because he is not he is non compose menus there is he turn around he does not know where to go is just going to random smiling now on knows where where is he going random do just to pop out from behind the curtain to give him some sort of direction as to where he is supposed to go where am i going still do not knower ism going no jo you are going throng way oh oh home trying to motor on over here o woman at the speedalwat of jobidon not competent there is a reason is in the thirteasan apprulerating even less competent comely arris who's picked because she is incompetent she is compact for being excellent her job she is pick despite being crappy at her job because she is a d eye candidate she is a candidate who is selected specifically by jobidon because she is a black woman not because she was coded her job she round one o the most incompetent presidential campaigns of all time she dropped out before her home state in an open primary as crazy athehundro ma orcas our homely security secretary wildly incompetent leaving the border fully open while maintaining that it is actually close secretary of transportation pet buddhijedge who loves chute trains that dude toke off for a couple months and no one even noticed then he came back and none of the plans land on time and trains ore blowing up the levels of incompetents are astonishing democrats in the senate or wildly incompetent democrats in the house ore even more in competent they cannot even find it in their named hards to send how condemned in the antisemitism of villhonomar and respected to lead but do not worry it is not to democrats republicans are also in competent republicans incomgress have decided to engage in an idiotic race to the bottom lasting a speaker of the house this year for no apparent reason to replace with a person who is just find by johns but who is now identifies by the exact same structures they will pass the exact same bills accept the they are probably going to lose even earthy seed just really smart stuff happening right here in competence has been wild we rewarded on all sides of the political isle because there is something a really sixteen that has been buried in the america body politic in the ground and is worn ugly fruit and that seed is that if you fail your failure is some one ease's fault this is true in terms of our agencies our agencies are wildly in competent on the state level as evidence by the valley fire where the state agencies not only did not to their environmental work they then did not even sound the alarms properly to let people get the hell out when everything was on fire our institutions are incompetent is hunches government our institutions are in competent our churches ore wildly incompetent they are filled with people we are abandoning eternal values the only reason o culture their abandoning those eternal values in this bazar push to fill the pews with left wingers who do not actually worship god but worship a weird on sign that is mufti colored and says dumb crap water is wet the amount of incompetents throughout every element of our side is truly a problem especially because when people our face with in competence they get mad now the normal reaction wo be get mad at the incompetents and then put competent people in power but we have forbidden that because we have created in entire ideology that bars getting rid of the incompetent people take for example are universities the best example of the day that in mate it is a wonderful force o clouding gay who the president of hazard she of course as come under fire recently because she went n front of congress an sh haven't ask of herself because she was asked whether in fact calling for the genocide of news was violative of hazard student policy the answer is yes you should not be calling for the genocide of news now if she had said we love free speeches and then ore red actually did love free speech that might be in argument but then a love are teacher hazard they suck it free speech at harbor is what she really meant is you can call for the gentlside of news but pretty much no other group well this then led to the opening of clouding gaze past and it turns out that she is a garbage scholar who has plagiarized in dozens of instances according to the near times hazard university in the face of mounting questions over possible plagiarism in the scholarly work of its president clouding gay on wednesday it had found two additional instances of insufficient citation in her work those issues were found in doctor gaze nineteen ninety seven doctoral dissertation in which hazard said it had found two examples of what they called this amazing language you at you ready for some some incompetence covering ready get ready for this language is not plagiarism folks it is quote to placative language without appropriate attribution oh you mean plagiarism that is literally the definition of plagiarism is amazing literally the definition of the word plagiarism is quote the practice of taking some one ease's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own here is what hazard is now calling this practice there are now calling this practice again the phrase was do placative language without appropriate attribution oh you mean copying some one's language without citing them which is stealing their language which is plagiarism by the can'gatrat a clouding gay because you see clouding gaze a black woman the first black woman present in the history of hazard mediocrity an in competent must be rewarded endlessly and those who call out mediocrity and failure those people are really the people to blame that the the comment of the year on this particular topic comes courtesy of a person actually had for contracts when i was at hazard loss call charges freed says professor freedmen i was there he is old then he is really old now charges freed are not this is such an amazing quote he is a he he worked for for pagan who's a solicitor general under pagan he was one of these supposed conservatives of the loss but he as never particularly conservative he is always middle of the road politically at best here is what he said quote it is part of this extreme righting attack on he lead institutions the obvious point is to make it look as if there is a wok double standard an he lead institutions and then he says this here is the comment quote if it came from some other quarter i might be granting income credent but not from these people that is right if you point out the incompetence but e you're of the wrong political persuasion for chrisrufo and he points out the plagiarism or if you are eransibarium and you point out the plagiarism then charges freed will not even take it under advisement because again the precious must be protected it is more important protect your ideological leanings than it is to protect any level of meritocracy in fact we built entire edifices ideology to excuse in competence in failure on both sides we now find conspiracy theories to undermine the basic idea of merit on the left if you are failing it is because as stated before you are victimized by the weadopressors and this is a prevalent ideology particularly among young people seventy nine per cents people eighteen to twenty for agree with that that if you fail if you if you suck et life that is not because you made bad decisions it is because you are being victimize by some evil today of people in the back groom whore screwing you on the right if you are failing it is also shockingly because of a today of evil people in the back room who are screwing you maybe it is the hedge fun managers maybe it is the people who love free markets and maybe it is people who want to maximize profits instead of turning this all over to a bunch of government autocrats for government subsidization a particular electoral clicks understand that the theory of populism which is effectively speaking that your own failures are not under your own control ever ever ever that is modern populism at least then have to be that way b that what it is right now that that theory breeds more in competence it makes the world worse more people fail and then because more people fail the beauty is that is completely unfalsifiable system an theory as more people fail the answer is not oh maybe we got this wrong maybe ought to promote merit it becomes whole that conspiracy theory man that must be true that conspiracy is strong and then because you believe that conspiracy you do not get competent at things another you fail more than t all man every year it is getting worse here's the reality the meritocracy is the great a merit an idea the meritocracy the idea that if you work card and if you are smart and if you make good moral decisions you will succeed that is the unique western beautiful idea it is the best idea maybe the best idea in all of human history because what it suggests is that if you make the right decisions you can crate positive externalities for everybody else see competence creates great externalities for everybody and makes the world better for every one you unjust been competent in building cars makes better cars for you you unmask sucking a building cars would be really bad and the same thing is true in every single job instruct every area of life we need competence in our government we need competence in our institutions if we do not get competence things are likely to get worse and worse and then people will blame ironically the system and call for more control by people who still have not actually shown any competence in these areas what is all this hat up to it adds up toe twenty twenty four sign to be an absolutely unless these trends our reverse unless these lessons our learn and people start to get it through there through their heads that meritocracy matters and incompetence should not be rewarded that perhaps we should seek common ground at least with regard to baseline america principles instead of ripping each other apart that we caress breeds aggression that there lots people world wide and domestically who do not think you andthat there are people gradually wish to path minor unless we ace would get real about the world another words that is the real short story here unless we get real about the world we are nous can get twenty twenty three again were gong to get way worse twenty twenty four i do not mean to be dooming gloom heading it into christian but ah dud our cane just t one second speaking of am what is coming or way we'll get the latest on the

particularly began jo biding is wildly under performing indicators the your bids wildly under performing over windfree who is a long time democrat devoted smash she campaigned with bedrock mama ibolician sort job n last timeout u shows asked if she indorses biding this him around and she is ism going to walk slowly away by or erasure her to well els it is on i never ben the man well by see later i love the creation one answer the election his the gam just ism just here to ut by now an over whin free cannot get on board with lake of course i hate donate trump y love doubt oberwyn are is a democrat obviously and ism even she is not on board meanwhile even jobidan' supposed success is are now turning to failure we mention those student loan payments that he legally decided to approve and then got struck down by the supreme part well now their back according to the wall street journal as millions of studentlone borrowers make payments this year for the first time since twenty twenty many are grappling with maddening autocratic problems narrower subscribing waiting on hold for ours trying in failing to get answers from their on services some receive inaccurate or conflicting in formation about amounts ode and the starts of their loans others heard barely anything at all only to be it with surprise bills the logistical morass which comes less than a year before the twenty twenty for election has complicated jobidan's efforts to insure the voter's credit him for slashing student debt bines initial plan to cancel up to twenty grand in federal student on dead for people making less than a hundred twenty five thousand dollars a year was struck down by the suprimcort in tune but that did not stop jo bid in since then the administration advanced narrower lone relief they wiped away a hundred and thirty to billion dollars and debt for three point six million barriers and just keep going with the illegality but it turns out that even that is a bleep so meanwhile even the education of apartment is noting the risks associated with transferring loans and messing around with all of this the education madman says these borrowers are attorning to a student lone system that is midstream making fundamental reforms to student on servicing and narrower benefits it is a mess it is onion to be grate for all those people who are lying on mobile an turns both when you lie to people and then people discover the lives are not particularly happy with you meanwhile become power is going confusion over at the federeserve again according t the wallstre journal federalreserve chair become pool was asked at a recent gathering what he does for fun he said quote for me a really big party is a really god inflation report but it does not matter because right now it is unclear exactly what the hell the get is going to do officials last week did not rule out higher rates but become phallic sighted o market rally when he volunteer that sum officials described their own rate cut out looks even if that was not a central focus it is unclear what exactly is coming out from the get the markets believe that the get is in a lower the rates again the get as not made clear whether its going to leave them or even increase the rates if the inflation continues the way that it has all of this is leading to serious uncertainty interstates could still be quite restrictive even for we adjust policy by lowering rates three times next year san francisco fed president many daily pointed out in the interview on money also it is unclear exactly whether the interstates are going to stay up that in the fives for a while to come of mobile is hoping for the fed to completely save next year that does not look that is likely to happen he is down to his last resort which always and forever is the democracy is a threat if you allow tonal trumpet to be reelected that is the final case that all of these f pole are going to may its can mean nothing but threats ondermocracy from here to the election this is presumably why blacksmith continues to push forward and obviously politically motivated prosecution in washington t we ton thursday smith file dey response to a motion by trump they would file demanding the court weight until a lower appeals court rules on the issue of presidential immunity they want a slow down the process the longer the process takes the longer it takes to get past the election smith wants to speed up the process what exactly is his excuse he says the public interests in a prompt resolution of this case fever's an immediate definitive decision by this court the charges here are of the utmost gravity this case involves criminal charges against to former present an basted on his actions well an offices not just any actions alleged acts to puppet perpetuate himself in power by frustrating the constitutionally prescribe process for certifying the lawful winner of an election the nation has compelling interest in a decision on respondent's claim of immunity from these charges and if they are to be tried a resolution by conviction or a quintal without undo delay why why i mean least these trials take years very often what is the big rush and we all know the big rush the big rush is for blacksmith to get a conviction in under the wires lose you damage tunnel trumps presidential chances in twenty twenty four in other words get ready for things to get really hot and really upsetting next year twenty twenty four it is on m an electioneer electioneers are usually exciting ah there

reported dad shot by a gunman from a balcony at the faculty of arts at the university of plague on thursday the g gunmen was report by local media to have fallen off the roof is going to brightbart he mastered was eliminated it said the several dead and dozens of injured around that faculty of ours building at the university of plague apparently the presumeshuter had been interested in killing as many people as possible any shool shooting apparently was obsessed with school shootings all around the world yetapparently shot as father earlier in the day in a small village outside o plague police attempted to find the twenty for your afterward it discovered that he was schedule to give a lecture at the university on thursday afternoon instead he had what sounded a machine gun if you hear the sounds and he decided to open fire on random innocent people apparently he was a history student wit the history of psychological problems it it is an absolutely terrible story obviously chekasthe check republic happens to be a place with significant gun control very very strung in control in rogue there is not much that really could be done to stop him he apparently had free rain with a view point above the areas that he was shooting at students were trying to hide on the balconies who as taken place on a high story of a building and see pictures men on the history building and students were tempting to cling to the ledge itself apparently one of the people actually fell from ledge and was killed in the fall its a terrific terrific story it is son just terrible stuff it is reminder that evil exist pretty much everywhere and once again is reminder that masshootings despite what the press will tell you is not in america only problem it is it's a problem anywhere you have people are mentally ill and have serious psychological problems and violent psychological problems and you can obtain guns it is still possible to obtain guns even in places tie significant gun control and there is no one there who could stop this guy because no one there had gun in response o came meanwhile an the israel commas war continues revelations every single day about the extent to which compass was honey combed throughout the gocestrip including at the hospitals in fact israel released avidin of the director of comma adman hospital admitting that he was a comas commander member whose the director of a hospital admitting that he was a camps commander here he was doing just that under interrogation he said what is yourfulmen woman hammed hassle all abut what is your nickname ablcasan what is your current position manager of the hospital manager of the mammal adman hospital when did you join camps two thousand ten when his last time you did military granting two thousand ten what is your ranking camass i drank that is parole to brigadier general wittdescribe how compass uses your hospital to hide military time those who are hidden officially which were coordinated than i know about according to rank they are the senior political officials eyre the seniors the military in villain officials they had rooms which they hid in at the hospital that they see their ten days than the changed places the different place and then they left the hospital yes of course they ware hiding in the hospital and of course the leadership of these hospitals knew the re hiding the hospitals and yet all those leaders of the hospitals been quoted by the media as excellent sources on the human rich violations the are happening in and round the hospital due to these rallies it is absolutely insane am e truly crazy meanwhile he can always counts on small minded bigots toy headed on used be see to completely miss the point by comparing what is going on in gossip to rwanda and our for it places where actual genocides were attempted as oppose to very specific military operations that have according to israel killed upwards of eight thousand members of compass out of the twenty thousand dead far and by the way a huge number of the people where not in that eight thousand number our commons fellow travellers were hanging out with compass israel been more precise in its targeting than any army in modern history but toy read is comparing this to tar for and rwanda president woman has hitch a the global credibility of america to the moral credits he have beaten this in you and that is just the disaster focus around the world i think of day for i think of for wanna i think of previous case as in which the i states of of watch seemingly helplessly as people died by teethe the the hundred s to thousands and seen of congo democratic of public of congo but in this case unlike those cases this feels this as us doing it the human misery is being funded by e i tie tact far yet it does not seem that he was public opinion has any impact well that is it to think you have public opinion that important to note has shifted the loss on this i true a i think is in the different place i then the the america political establishment is on this that of course is a former you estates payment official who left the state department because the take department refuse to acquiesce to his procommass at viewpoints meanwhile the am an end to days show at least for the non paying members on with the field good guy of the year if there is only one good story the come out o twenty twenty three it is the it is the transformation of john fetderman into a raging moderate again it is an amazing story we we here e having limit of federmania here is what john fetderman said he said with regard to left wing purity test he said it is just a place where ism not i don't feel have left the label of progressive its just more than it is left me ism not critical of some one is progress if i believe it different things he says that a lot people have worked minds on his rob as i do find it confusing where the very left progressives in america do not seem to want support the only progressive nation in the region they really embraces the same kind of values i would expect me want as society again john fetderman the shock of the year and we have more positive shocks in the

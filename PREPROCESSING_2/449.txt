welcome to the supermen conscience science palette i mend supermen and of a professor of neurobiology and upthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are talking all about habits in particular we are going to discuss the biology of habit formation and the biology of how we break habits think we can all appreciate the value of having habits habits organize our behavior into more or less reflective actions we do not have to think too much about performing the various behaviors that for instance allow us to brush our tea thou which side of bed we roll out of in the morning and then of course habits can be more elaborate too we can be in the habit of exercising at a particular time of day we can bean the habit of eating certain foods we can be in the habit of saying or not saying certain things but of course there are many habits that do not serve us well or that perhaps even undermine our immediate and long term health goals and psychological goals and even some habits that can really undermine are overall life goals today we are going to talk about making meaning forming and breaking meaning stopping various habits there is a lot of information out there about habits you will find this in the popular sphere therefore books the articles there workshops and forth however less are known is that there's a whole nauru science of habit formation and habit breaking and there is a whole field of psychology devoted to understanding habit formation and habit breaking and within those scientific literature i think there are some real gems that at least to my knowledge we have not pay too much attention to in the popular sphere to day we are going to talk about the biology of habit formation and habit breaking ism also going to spell out two specific types of habit formation and habit breaking programs and men of boil these down to some very explicit steps that any one can use my reasoning for doing that is first of all its the end of twenty twenty one many people are thinking about new years resolutions they're thinking about leaving some things behind from twenty twenty one and previous and acquiring some new behaviors taking on some new challenges and trying to bring new things to their lives but regardless of when you are listening to this the programs that it'll outline are grounded in the nauru science and biology of habit formation and they map very well to what the psychologists have described in terms of habit formation and breaking to day your in a learn a lot of science you are also going come away with some practical tools and ism certain that regardless of your present state or goals the will be something of value to you before we begin it'd to emphasis that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zerocostic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to thank the sponsors have today's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve saw delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there reason i started taking athletic greens the reason i still take out letegreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which ore vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens it get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you fie free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of date and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if were getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient incitement three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone cam slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element do cam slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you wan a try element you can go to element element do cam slash supermen let us talk about habits and any time we are talking bout habits that means our nervous system learn something now many people think that habits are just reflexes but pure reflects our things the blink reflect you of something comes toward your eye and you do not want i to get in your eye you will blink or if you happen to step on a sharp object or get to close to something that to hot you will reflectively move away those are not habits those are what we call hard wired reflexes habits are things that our nervous system learned but not always consciously sometimes we develop habits that we are not even aware of till they become a problem or maybe they serve us well who knows but the fact of the matter is that habits are a big part of who we are what we do habitually makes up much of what we do entirely in fact it is estimated that up to seventy per cent of our waking behavior is made up of habitual behavior you can imagine that there is a lot of biology meaning cells and hormones and neural pathways et camera that are going to support the development of those habits f habits are largely learned consciously or unconsciously we have to ask ourselves what is learning well learning is euro plasticity hero plasticity is simply the process by which are nervous sister changes in response to experiences we have to ask what changes well what changes are the connections between neurons neurons are just nerve cells they communicate with one another by electricity and by sending chemical signals to one another that inspire the next neuron and the next neuron to either be electrically active or not but at the end of the day neural plasticity is about forming new neral circuits new pathways by which certain habits are likely to occur and other ones are less likely to occur we have got habits we have that habits are learned we have that learning involves neral plasticity and that nerd plasticity involves changes in the connections between neurons nerve cells o case of that describes habits through the lends of negro science and biology but as many of you are well aware there are popular books about habits and there is a whole psychological literature about habits and those two arias point to some very interesting aspects of habits that i think are worth mentioning first of all is this notion of immediate goal based habits verses identity based habits immediate goal based habits are going to be habits that are design to bring you a specific outcome as you do them each in every time you do them for instance it might be that you want to develop a habit of getting and i sixty minutes of on to cardie each day o er perhaps you now three four times a week as we had into the new year have talked before on the pod cast about the fact that the scientific literature and the health literature really points to the incredibly positive effects of getting a hundred and fifty minutes to hundred and eighty minutes per week minimum of what is called zone to cardie down to cardie s basically any carry of vascular exercise that gets you moving and your heart pumping and breathing but not hard that you cannot hold ha conversation a contours you at the threshold of being just able to have a conversation that is a little bit strain but if you were to exercise a little bit harder and run a little bit fast or et camera you would not be able to talk while you did it there is a lot of literature that points to that as a healthy practice maybe your somebody that wants to get more of zone to cardie for instance that would be an immediate goal based habit if your goal is to get that cardie may be of four times a week every time you do it you could check off a old box and you say i did it you meet you met the goal that is different in called identity based habits where r there is a larger over arching hem to the habit where you are trying to become code quote a fit person or you are somebody who wants to be a an athlete or something of that sort it is where you start to attach some sort of larger picture about yourself or what it means for you to do that habit where there is both the immediate goal i complete the exercise complete the the section or whatever it is am check off that box but that you are linking it to some sort of larger goal now why am i making this distinction i mean at first of all ism not the one to first make this distinction others have made the distinction between identity verses immediate goalbased habit formation but the reason i making the distinction is that pretty soon in our discussion today we are going to talk about dopamine a molecule that is associated with motivation and reward that we make in our brain and how different schedule of dopamine release predict whether not we will stick to a habit or not and in particular whether not we will be able to form that habit quickly or not w this is absolutely critical to understand for the following reason another thing that you'll here out there in the literature is that it takes twenty one days to form a habit some people say eighteen some people say twenty one some people say thirty days some people say sixty days which one is it does it depend on the habit that one is trying to form or does it depend on the person that try and at form the habit turns out that there is excellent peer review data on this there is a study publish in twenty ten forstauthor valley ale a el of this study found that for the same habit to be formed it can take anywhere from eighteen days to as many as two hundred and fifty four days for different individuals to form that habit the reason i bring this up is that i always get asked is it true that it takes twenty one days to form a habit is it true that your nervous sister changes in six days when you redoing something repeatedly and the answer is as i mention before its highly variable what i did not tell you actually was what specific habit they were looking at in that valley study and it is interesting this the specific behavior was a health related behavior pretty relevant tour discussion here on the podcast which who has taking walks after dinner si she a really nice literature showing that walks after a meal and speed glucose clearance from the good stream can be beneficial for not just weight loss but cartvascular health et camera a walk after dinner seems pretty straightforward right well in order to form that habit it took some people eighteen days and other people two hundred and fifty four days how did they know when they form the habit well they were doing it about eighty five per cent of the time and they also reported not having to spend that much mental effort in order to get into the mode of taking a walk after dinner for those of you listening some of you might be thinking i cannot believe that it take some people two under fifty four days to get into that habit but as i said people are highly variable and if you cannot form one habit easily it does not mean that you cannot form other habits easily the mystery of wise certain people can form certain habits more easily than others probably has something to do with how well people manage what is called limbic friction now limbic friction is not a term that you are going to find in the formal nerbiological literature or even psychological literature it is frankly a term that i coined to encompass a number of different pieces of the psychology in your science literature limbic friction is a short hand way that i use to describe the strain that is required in order to overcome one of too states within your body one state is one of anxiousness where you really anxious and therefore you cannot calm down you cannot relax and therefore you cannot engage in some particular activity or thought pattern that you would the other state is one in whichyou are feeling too tired or lazy or not motivated both of those states feeling too alert and too calm if you will relate to the function of the called autonomic nervous system a set of neurons and hormones and chemicals in your brain in body that act is sort of a seesaw you are either alert or calm youeither a sleep or stressed those two states are not compatible with one another you proudly heard of wired and tired but that is really once you have been very stress for a long time to the point where your exhausted what is the autonomic nervous system have to do with any of this well limbic friction is a phrase that can be used to describe how much afford how much activation energy you need in order to engage in a particular behavior using this valley study is an example some people would eat dinner and then say oh that is right i haven trying to develop the habit of taking a walk after dinner let us get up and go other people will feel i just do not want to do it to day they are going to feel too much limbic friction and that limbic friction could arrive again from one of two sources it could be because they are to tired to do it or it could be because they are too anxious and distracted in order to do it this is a key distinction a lot of habit formation has to do with being in the right state of mind and being able to control your state of body and mind is we march forward what you are going to find is that this phrase or this term limbic friction is going to be a useful metric or way for you to touch in with yourself and address whether not you are likely to be able to form a certain habit easily or whether not it is going to be very challenging and i am going to teach you away to measure your degree of limbic friction that is how much activation energy it will take in order for you to execute a new habit and ism going to teach you how to measure your limbic friction an activation energy for how likely it is that you are going to be able to break a habit that you do not want to have the other key concept for us to address that is really mainly found in the books and articles out thereabout habits is this notion of what i call lunch pin habits linchpin habits are certain habits that make a lot of other habits easier to execute the sorts of linchpin habits that am referring to are always going to be things that you enjoyed doing a just give you an example from my life i happen to exercise not all forms of exercise but i happen to resistance training and a happened running ism personally in the habit of getting cargo yo vascular exercise three or four times per week may be third eat sixty minutes permission and ism in the habit of doing resistance training three or four times per week epically also for about forty five to sixty minutes permission now i enjoy those and for reasons that it'll get into a obit at er i place those activities typically early in the day because of the narrow chemistry an the various types of hormones at camera that are associated with performing those activities but i really place those activities under the umbrella of what i call lynch pin habits why because those particular habits are easy to execute because i enjoy them but they also make a lot of other habits easier to execute things being alert for work things making sure that i get good sleep the night before things hydration things making sure that i eat the foods that are better for me than may be some of the other foods that i would more reflectively reach to if i were not doing that training certain habits act as lynch pins meaning that they shift a lot of other things that can control and base the likelihood that in this case you or me we will perform other habits that are harder to access that we have less of an affinityfore again there is three concepts that we need to include here we got identity base verses goalbase habits we have got the concept that different habits take different periods of time to adopt depending on the person and the habit and that there are these what i call lynch pin habits certain habits that make other habits easier to execute and those lynch pin habits always always always are things that we enjoy doing our got throughout this episode is for you to identify which habits are easy for you to perform which ones are hard for you to perform and which habits you want to break if you want a grab a pen and paper you can do that or if you want to dictate some of that into your phone you can but right now actually if you just want to think about these concepts can always go back later it'll make sure to spell out of very specific way that you can chart out a map towards forming particular habits and breaking particular habits later on what it'd us to do at this point is to take that concept of limbic friction and for you to has yourself what habits you perform on a daily basis and these to be things as basic as brushing your teeth before breakfast are brushing an teeth after breakfast it could be ah for instance that you get exercise or you get it in a particular time a day or even that you take a particular route to work right where we are very habitual and we tend to do things more or less over and over in the same way unless we intervene in ourselves us just the way that we are wired now it'd to shift to thinking about a particular aspect of habits and that habits strength you all have different habits you probably brush your teeth at of particular time a day you probably exercise at particular times a week you pebbly go to the refrigerator in a very habitual way we are incredibly habitual organisms unless we intervene in our habits they tend to carry out the same way that they always have once they formed you can do this exercise now you do not have to write this down if you do not want to but you certainly are welcome we are going to evaluate what is called habit strength that is not a concept that i created habit strength to something that you'll find in the psychological literature habit is strength is measured by two main criteria the first is how context dependent a given habit is content dependents is if you go from one environment to the next do you tend to do the same thing in the same way at the same time of day for instance brushing your teeth first thing the morning may be some of you do that before breakfast may be some of you do that later may be some of you me do not even eat breakfast but when i travel i tend to brush my teeth at more or less the same time of day relative to when i wake up as i do when ism at home it is context independent it a very strong habit right there certain behaviors we perhaps what you eat or perhaps how you dress that are context independent that you might perform one way in one context in another way in another context the other aspect of habits strength is how much limbic friction is require to perform that habit on a regular basis this is extremely important because if you are in the process of building habits and consolidating those habits then it probably going to take more limbic friction to execute those habits what do i mean by that well let say you set out to get let us a forty five minutes of onto cardioids side every day fiver ay even seven days a week well if at first you are highly motivated limb friction might be pretty low limbic friction is how much top down meaning from your forebrain to your limbic system the part of your brain that generates autonomic responses how much limbic friction meaning conscious override of your state is required in order to engage in that particular behavior if your feeling particularly tired and you do want to get up out of bed and you do not want to go out and do your s own to cardie that than there is a high degree of limbic friction it takes some people think of is motivation but motivation is a bit of a vague concept to whereas limbic friction involve specific neral circuits and you can think of it in more or less quantitative way you can think of that your body is very tired its can take more limbic friction in order to get into action right you u have to overcome more limbic friction souse me whereas if you're very very alert it is there is less limbic friction because your moving toward something that is action or ended however the inverse is also true let us say that you are trying to get into the habit or you are in the early stages of forming a habit to meditate regularly that is a pretty quiescent or calming activity if you are somebody w comes home from work and your a very anxious and you have a lot of work to do an you have to deal with a bunch of things there is a lot of limbic friction to overcome in order to get into that calm state these two aspects context dependents whether not your likely to do the thing regardless of where you are i on travel at home on vacation with people around not people around et camera and how much limbic friction is required to execute that habit will tell you whether not that habit is deeply or just shallowly embedded within your nervous system the goal of any habit that we want to form is to get into what is called aromaticity aromaticity is fancy language for the normal circuits can perform in automatically and that is the ultimate place to be and if you have all these goals and things that you want to be doing on a regular basis you love for them to be habitual because it takes less mental and physical effort less limbic friction in order to execute those and much of what is out there again in the popular psychology literature in books that you will find on the books store shelf and on amazon and the airports are about how to get from that mode of high degree of limbic friction to aromaticity and they offer a number of different ways i think many of which are useful ism trying to get you to organize different types of habits into different bins value based and goal based and ism trying to persuade you that structuring habits at the particular times of day or in a particular way ore going to be bent official and indeed i think they have helped a lot of people what it'd to do is to take the scientific literature of how the nervous system learns and engages in hero plasticity and apply that to habit formation habit maintenance and if desired how to break particular habits it'd to give you a particular tool that is gleaned from the research psychology literature should mention that i learned about this from an excellent review article that is available in line it is called psychology of habit the authors are windy wood and penis hunger this is published in annual review of psychology the annual reviews series is a very high quality series there are annual reviews of borrow science andreviews of psychology and reviews of nutrition science et camera for those of you their interest an exploring review articles that are grounded in hundreds of quality pure reviewed studies the annual review series is really terrific v certainly among the best if not the best and they also then to be quite long an quite comprehensive this review psychology of habit by wood an wringer is excellent and here i more less paraphrasing from them are one to be clear that a these are their words not mine there talking about the various ways that habits form in the nervous sister and they mention with each repetition of a habit small changes occur in the chognivin neral mechanisms assets associate with procedural memory i just want to talk for second bout what procedural memory is in the now science of memory we distinguish between what is called episodic memory and procedural memory episodic memory is a recall of a particular set of events that happened whereas procedural memory is holding in mind the specific sequence of things that need to happen in order for a particular outcome to occur think of it a recipe or a protocol or if forsake of exercise its sets an raps or a particular course that you're going to run or psycho or the number of laps you're going to swim and how you are going to perform it it is very clear that for any one trying to adopt new habits getting into the mind set of procedural memory is very useful for overcoming that barrier that we call limbic friction how do you do that well a simple visualization exercise are does not even have to be done eyes closed you oftentimes we here visualization exercise you think about sitting in the low disposition eyes closes an you trying really hard to visualize something does not need to be anything that it can simply be if you are deciding to adopt a new habit to just think about the very specific sequence of steps that is required to execute that habit and it'll use a trivial example but this could be applied to anything what say i want to get into the habit of making myself for some one else in my household a cup of espresso every morning i would actually think through each of those steps walk into the kitchen turn on the express machine draw the expressive walking through each of those steps from start to finish and turns out just that simple mental exercise done once can shift people toward a much higher likelihood of performing that habit regularly not just the first time but as they continue out into the days and weeks that follow that is remarkable to me and the literature is really robust just one mental exercise of thinking through whatare the sequence of steps required in order to perform this habit from start to finish can shift the likelihood of being able to perform that habit from unlikely or to moderately likely to vary likely over time and that is because it pulls from this process hat involves our hippocampus in journal quarters and other areas of our brain and nervous system that engage in procedural memory it shifts the brain towards a a mind set if you will a it is more of a neral circuit set it would be more accurate but a mind set slash neral circuit set of doing things in a particular sequence which allows that limbic friction to come down and increases the likelihood that we are going to perform that thing simple tool but very powerful tool according to the psychology literature and actually the cellar and molecular mechanisms that under lie that sort of procedural memory stepping through phenomenon are known in this article i mention this beautiful review a they talk about called hetman learning donate zebras e psychologist a in canada and first this feel that is now lasted push o more than fifty years and is still very strong in hero scions an psychology of heavy and learning heavy and learning is when particular neurons are coactive meaning when they fire together they tend to strengthen their connections with form another and as a number of different under lying cellar an molecular features that we do not have to go into in detail but for those of you that want to know i know some of your hungry for obit more nerd science a this involves things end a receptors and methyl de aspirate receptors t enemy a receptors are really important i think for every one to understand just tell you little bit about them these are receptors that are on the iron surface and normally they do not contribute much to the activity of those anurans those turns are perfectly capable of doing their thing without activation of this enemy a receptor but when a neuron gets a very strong i put a strong stimulus that enemy a receptor triggers a number of mechanisms that recruit to the surface of the neuron more other receptors and other words it makes that our on more responsive to input in the future such that it does not require much input in other words it takes a neuron that is very unlikely to fire and makes it more likely to fire this procedural stepping through of the steps of the recipe or the series of action stops that are involved in sitting down to study and writing for an hour or generating exercise whatever it is the habit you are thing to learn when you are doing that exercise it is not as if your nervous system thinks you are actually perform in the behavior you nervous system is not stupid it is usually a lot smarter than that it knows the difference between a thought and an traction but when you do that it sets in motion the same neurons that are going to be required for the execution of that habit and when you actually show up to perform that habit it is as if the dominos fall more easily it is it is a on lower threshold as we say in order to get the habit to perform heavy and learning ended a receptors all that a nuts and bolt stuff are really the guts of the mechanisms of how this works but for those of you that just want to be more habitual about certain things be able to perform certain things more reflectively that you would in your life simply take the time do it once may be twice and just sit down close your eyes if you and just step through the procedure of what it is going to take in order to perform that habit the psychology literature as i mention and also the neural science literature strongly supports the fact that it is going to make it far easier for you to adopt and maintain that habit and if you are somebody who use to perform a habit and you do not understand why you dropped it and your frustrated with yourself than you try to figure out how you can get back into that habit well by all means lean right back into that habit but if you are having trouble doing that also just use the procedural memory exercise in order to shift your nervous system towards a higher likelihood that you will return to that habit just the same way i described for trying to initiate a new habit now it'd to discuss a second and what i think it is perhaps the most powerful tool for being able to acquired and stick to new habits this tool is rooted in what we call neural circuits and i do think it is important to understand a little bit about how those neural circuits work for those of you their saying just tell me what to do i have to say as i always say understanding a little bit or a lot of underlying mechanism will help solidify these concepts for you and well help in sure that the tools that i offer are going to make sense and that they are going to make sense in different contacts and for different type of habits that you are trying to learn rather than just tell you what to do om an i tell you how this particular total works and than in doing that you should be able to apply to any habit under any conditions the tool that ism referring to is something called task bracketing and the neral circuits associate with task bracketing a basically the natural circuits that are going to allow you to learn any new type of habit or break any habit that you would to break we have in our brain a set of neral circuits that fall under the umbrella term of the basil ganglia the bail ganglia are involved in action execution meaning doing certain things and action suppression not doing certain things in the experimental realm these are referred to as go meaning do or logo do not do certain things and some of us fall more into the category of we find it very easy to do certain things but harder to not do other things some people have a lot of logo type circuits that are very robust and they have a lot of behavioral constraint but they have a harder time getting into action and some people have a perfect balance of both but have never met one of those people again drawing from and for less paraphrasing from this beautiful review the described earlier in in review annual review of psychology excuse me by wood and wringer task blackening involves a particular set of neral circuits within the basil ganglia ism going to describe this here again paraphrasing a century motor incensory means just input coming in about sit sounds tastes et camera and then the motor systems the systems of the brain and body that entering action taking that information in generating action it turns out that there is an area of our basil ganglia called the dorsylateral stratum we can use the acronym d l s again torso lateral stratum torso means up lateral means to the sides a dorcilateral and stratum is a subdivision of the basal ganglia and its very important for the establishment of behaviors that are associated with the habit but not necessarily the habit itself and beautiful studies in both animals and humans that record the electrical activity in the dorcylateral stratum find that the dorsylateral stratum is associated meaning it becomes active at the beginning of a particular habit and at the very end and after of particular habit hence the phrase task bracketing it brackets the habit now other sets of neurons are going to be active during the actual execution of the habit but what the literature on the dorsalateral stratum tells us is that we have particular circuits in our brain that are devoted to framing the events that happen just before and as we initiate a habit and just after and as we terminate a habit in other words it acts as a sort of marker for the habit execution but not the execution of the habit perse say this is very important because task bracketing is what underlies whether not a habit will be context dependent or not whether or not it will be strong and likely to recur even if we did not get a god night sleep the night before even if we are feeling distracted even if we are not feeling doing something emotionally or if we are completely overwhelmed by other events if the neral circuits for task bracketing are deeply imbed in us meaning they are very robust around a particular habit well then it is likely that we are gong to go out for that zone too cardie no matter what that were in a brush our teeth no matter what in fact brushing our teeth is a pretty good example because for most people even if you got a terrible nights sleep even if everything in your life is going wrong chances are unless your very depressed if you are going to leave to work or even if your not that you are going to still carry out the behavior of brushing your teeth in the morning i would hope actually but you are probably less likely to perform particular habits that are not what you deem as necessary but if you think about it brushing your teeth exercise eating particular foods may be engaging socially in particular ways you are the one that places any kind of value assessment on which ones are essential in which ones are negotiable task bracketing sets a a neural imprint a kind of a finger print in your brain of this thing has to happen at this particular tame a day much that its reflects it and as will talk about in a moment there is a way that you can build up task bracketing that regardless of what it is you are trying to learn there is a much higher probability that you are going to do that thing d when i say learn meaning let sat your chine to require a habit that for you is really challenging may be at some that you are going to right for an hour a day on a book project that you have been thinking about or you are going to work on mathematics or you are going to do any sort of thing that for you there is a lot of limbic friction while it is important to think about the sequence of events that would be required in order to engage in that behavior that parssual memory a visualization exercise we talk about before that will help there is a way also that you can orient your nervous system toward this tax bracketing process that your nervous system is shifted or oriented towards the execution of a given habit this is for warming up your body to exercise when the dorcilateral striadam is engaged your body and your brain are primed to execute a habit and than you get to consciously insert which habit you want to perform in order to leverage the nerd mechanisms of task bracketing in order to increase the likelihood that your going to perform a particular habit i have to break it to you that one thing that you have probably heard over and over about habit formation is not true and what ism referring to is this idea that if you are very specific about exactly when you are going to perform a a particular habit that you are more likely to perform that habit and while that is true in the short term it is not true in the long term and the reason for that is that our nervous system tends to generate particular kinds of behaviors based not on time but on our state meaning what level of activation is taking place in our brain and body how much focus we happen to have how fatigued we are how energized we are while schedules are important it is not the specific time of day per say that is going to allow you to get into a habit and form that habit and consolidate that habit rather it is the state that your brain and body are in that is important to anchor yourself to now ism going to offer you a tool it is actually an entire program by which you can insert particular habits and activities at particular phases of the day not times of day but phases of the day because it turns out that particular phases of the day are associated with particular biological underpinnings chemicals an nerd circuits and forth and in doing it will make it far more likely that you will be able to regularly engage in these habits and activities over a long period of time old whether not that will move you from somebody who ordinarily u would take two hundred days to form a habit to one of those eighteen days to habit people in that earlier study i mention i do not know but i am certain that it will have a significant shift on allowing you to engage in particular habits more easily and to consolidate those habits more quickly the program ism about to describe i formulated for you based on the nonsense literature and the psychology literature of learning and the concept of task bracketing it involves dividing the twenty four hour days into what i call three phases the first is phase one which is zero to eight hours after waking up approximately call you can put a plus armings thirty minutes on this for yourself the second phase is the nine to fourteen maybe fifteen hours after you wake up and the third phase is sixteen to twenty four hours after waking up we have taken the twenty four hour cycle we have carved it up into three phases face one face to and face three everything ism describing or at least the way ism going to describe it is based on what i will call a typical schedule diurnal schedule you have heard of nocturnal well we are diurnal most of us are sleep at night and await during the day i do realize that a number of people have shift work are they have new born or other reasons why they have to be up in the mill the night in sleeping during the day if that is the case please listen to the episode that we did on jetlag an shift work because as a lot of tools specifically for that population but most people go to sleep somewhere round ten p m plus armings two hours and wake up some him around seven a m plus armings two hours to day ism going to use the to bed at ten p m and the wake up time of seven a m as the frame work for this but you could adopt it easily to your particular schedule phase one which again is the to to eight hours after waking has a particular petrochemical signature regardless of what you do the neuromodulators nor up in ran as well as pin difference that is noradrenalin and a adrenaline as well as the demodulator dopamine tend to be elevated during that first zero to eight hours after waking there are number reasons for this related to the fact that also coatis all is hirer in our brain an blood stream it is a healthy level sort is all upon waking body temperature is increased et camera and there several things that perhaps we should all be doing of talked about many of these on the podcast before that in addition to those chemicals further support an alert and focused state and i just list those off have done many podcast on each of these you would to access as podcast you can find them in the menu podcast on you twobapples notify et camera they involve for instance viewing sunlight or bright artificial light if you cannot access sunlight within the first thirty minutes of waking physical exercise of some kind in this first phase of the day zero to eight hours of the day ideally pretty early in that phase but if it has to be it the seventy eight hour transition point that is fine to cold exposure in the form of coldshours or ice bad or outside a with minimal a clothing on appropriate yet minimal clothing caffeine ingestion a fasting for instance a not investing a calories also will lend itself to increase nor upend affray dopamine et camera if you are going to consume foods foods that are rich in things tyrosine which is a precursor for dopamine you can look up which foods are high in tyrosine and for those of you that are interested in supplementation and to use those routs things alpha p c or final ethelaming thing or el tyrosine if that is in keeping with a what you are able to do of course consult your doctor if you are going to a rely on supplementation what is this all about well the already elevated nor up in felon an dopamine the sunlight exercise cold exposure caprine tyrosine et camera all of those place the brain and body into a state in which you are better able or i would say more easily able to engage in activities that have a high degree of limbic friction and where you need to override that limbic friction it we have heard that the morning is kind of sacred conquer the hardest things first thing in the morning and that is been discussed in the poppsychology literature and in the habit formation literature merely from the perspective of get it out of the way it you can feel good about having done it but what ism referring to his quite different what ism referring to as a particular phase of day that after rising after waking up that is for zero to eight hours right in that first phase your whole system is action and focus oriented and we know that when you're action and focus oriented and because of the petrochemicals that are naturally released in your brain and body that you will be more likely to overcome any limbic friction that stands in the way of performing particular habits as you list out or think about the various habits that you to adopt in your life take the habits for which there is the highest degree of limbic friction they are the hardest for you to engage in they require the most activation energy and put those in this zero to eight hours after waking this will greatly facilitate your performance of those new habits ism certain of that and in addition to that by doing them in this particular phase of the day not necessarily at the same time i man if you want to be very habitual an you want to do you are the exercise or the sunlight viewing always at the same time or you want to do at you want to drink your caffeine always at the exacting come that is fine but by placing them in this broader window of of zero to eight hours after waking what your doing is your creating task bracketing you are making it such that your nervous system will predict when you are going to lean in against limbic friction in order to perform particular types of habits and this is very different than saying ism always going to run or ism always going to study from ten to twelve a m every morning that is great and if you can do that terrific but the literature indicates that people who do that who are very rigid about when they do things t end because of context dependents to not necessarily stick to those habits overtime some people do but many many people do not think about the hardest habits to form and the the habits that you most want of form that are hardest for you to adopt and to maintain and is highly suggest placing those somewhere within this phase one of zero to right hours after waking now of course some of the things i listed out sunlight viewing exercise cold exposure hi caffeine fasting those might be the actual habits themselves but here i realize or i rather i want to acknowledge that many people including myself are doing sum are all of these things already and many people including myself are trying to adopt new habits that do not fall into the category of just trying to set your over all state again nor up aneffran dopamine and always neral systems will be greatly elevated in this zero to eight hours after waking however the other things i mention sunlight exposure exercise cold exposure caffeine fasting if that is for you or if your eating during that phase eating things that contain some or elevated levels of tyracene may be supplementing alit g p c or el pyridine at camera all of those things further facilitate the hero chemistry and therefore the state of mind that is going to be ideal for leaning into limbic friction and operating that limbic friction that you can regularly perform that habit what were really talking about here is leveraging normal systems in order to help you make it more likely that you are going to be able to engage and maintain a particular habit what ism referring to as phase one of each day is useful for acquiring certain habits but there are other phases of the day and those turn out to be us full for acquiring other types of habits face too as i mention is about again house are not specifics but about nine to fourteen or fifteen hours after waking during this phase of the day because of the circadian shifts in our biology the amount of dopamine and group and affray that circulating in our brain and bloodstream tends to start to come down and levels of cortex all tend to start to come down as the ideal circumstance in fact you do not really want elevated carts all late i the day that is likely a signature of depression and anxiety and number of other unfortunate things nine to fourteen hours after waking opening in norland efferent and corpus all are starting to taper down just naturally and a different neurmodulator serotonin is starting to rise serotonin is definitely going to be highest in this second half of the day and tends to lends itself to a more relaxed state of being now of course i do realize that some people are less of morning people and find that they really come alive and awake in the afternoon but most people do not fall into that category most people fear more alert early in the day even anxious early in the day and then as the afternoon progresses they tend to be a bit more sleepy a bit more relaxed a bit more calm there is certain things that we all cannon should do during this phase too of each day that lend themselves to a state of mind and a state of body that is going to be beneficial for the generation and consolidation of certain types of habits what are those things first of all as the day goes on you should try if you can to start tapering the amount of light that your viewing now this does not mean putting yourself into dim light at three o'clock or four o'clock in the afternoon that certainly not the case simply that you want to start tapering off the amount of really bright light that you are getting unless it sunlight talked about this before on the podcast but if you have not heard viewing the sun as it is it what we call low solar angle as its headed toward the horizon don't necessarily have to watch the sunset although that can be nice but getting some sunlight in your eyes in the second half of the day can also be beneficial for a number of brain systems and psychological systems you can get some sunlight in your eyes you can i certainly have artificial lights on but you want to start dimming those lights and bringing them actually physically lower in the room because the anurans in your eye that view the upper visual field they actually trigger this alertness mechanism in the brain and body and in the second half of the day even if your humming round and doing work at three and four or five or even seven p m you are probably headed towards sleep a few hours later things limiting the total amount of light if you can things anestyare non sleep deep least another a thing that's talked about on this podcast if you have not heard about this before non sleep deep reads is an umbrella term for things meditation for yoganedra very powerful am science supported tool for teaching you haw to relax things self hypnosis which might sound a little kaki to some of you but acute as a clinically base tool for which there's a lot of scientific literature ifyoure interested in that there is a great free resource called reverie r e v e r i dot calm there is a a for both apple and android this is an all that was developed by colleagues of mine in researches at stamford school of medicine you can do these short fifteen minute self hypnosis scrip says they are called that can teach you haw to relax yourself there is even ones for focus for sleep for chronic pain again all very strongly supported by quality pure review literature things reverie meditation things heat and sand hop baths hot showers those are terrific at things to do in the second half of the day they tend to support this seratornergic or high ceremony and lax state and lend themselves to more calm and relaxation for those of either interesting supplementation there's always ascheaganda which om reduces corpus all again piss in corpus all late in the afternoon in evening are associate with depression anxiety and forth aschuaganda as a prettypotent a cortesall inhibiting tool a i personally do not use it very often and i caution people about using it for longer than two week periods of time without taking some breaks a you can look up more about aschuaganda on examine not calm there is a lot of terrific literature with links to studies there but basically this phase to of the day is one in which your alert you are present you are working you are engaging socially your cooking dinner probably paying attention to a number of things but you should really be trying to taper off your stress level how do you leverage phase too of the day for habit formation well given what we know about the nauru chemistry of learning in memory given what we know about task formation and its reliance on certain forms of enrol plasticity this second half the day is a terrific time to take on habits and things that your already doing that require very little override of limbic friction these might be things that you could categorize a in common terms this kind of mellower activities it might be journalling it might be a that you already are performing music or i should a practicing music regularly but that there is a particular type of music that is hard for you are that your working on a particular piece of music or your thing to learn a language something is a little bit challenging but does not require a ton of energy in order to override that limbic friction the second half the day is a much better time to do that less resistance as we might say but of course resistance has a neral substrate and the reason for doing those things in the second part of the day the called face to as i called it part of the day is because your ability to override resistance is really diminished in this second phase of the day some of you might say will not wait i to exercise in the second a half of the day that is actually when i have the most energy that is when ism i feel warmer ism not a morning exercise that is absolutely fine what i am referring to is the acquisition of new behaviors and placing those consistently at the second half of the day in order to engage this task bracketing mechanisms i talked about before one of the hallmark features of those bail ganglia circuits for go and no go is that they are social with certain hero chemicals dopamine and ceratoid an a seat calling and other nerchemicals and by placing particular habits hat particular phases of the day those negro chemical states start to be associated with the leaning in and the process of beginning end as i mention ending those particular habits and in doing they shift the whole nervous system toward being able to predict that certain things are going to happen at particular times of day that you are going to be leaning very hard against limit friction early in the day and pase one and that you re going to be doing things that require less conscious override of limit friction in pace to and in doing set up this task bracketing system that the individual habits that your learning or thatyou are trying to learn have a much greater probability of being executed and consolidated meaning that pretty soon they will just naturally become reflective and as with phase one many of the things that i mentioned that support this what ism calling a ceratornergic state or more relaxed state in phase too things seeing smelt in the afternoon but not a lot of right light from artificial sources things nasty are things heat and sand a hop baths et camera ashragonda again all of those things themselves could be habits that you are trying to adopt i in that case do those if if you to explore them they are quite beneficial for a number of reasons ism not just related to execution of particular habits in face two of the day but also for improving quality of sleep and consolidating any learning that you might have triggered early in the day have talked about that before but just briefly as a relevant aside negro plasticity involves triggering the neuroplasticy setting it in motion but the actual requiring of the brain and the reconfiguration of means that will allow that learning to be reflexive that actually occurs during states of deep rest an sty are and deep sleep and i should just mention for those of you that can only exercise a prefer to exercise in pase two of the day i nine to fourteen hours or fifteen hours after waking that is absolutely fine however because of the importance of sleep and in particular deep sleep throughout the night for not just inoroplasticity but recovery of much muscle and other tissues that are tax during physical exercise if you do train and phase do i highly recommend highly recommend that you start doing some sort of anestiartype activity after you train within an hour or two because that will allow you to taper down and relax that you can get in to the next phase were going to talk about which is face three face three of the twenty four hours schedule runs from about sixteen to twenty four hours after waking during that period of time there are few things that are going to support being in a state of mi and state of body that are going to a low hero plasticity to occur that are going to allow the rewiring that you triggered during the waking part of the day to actually take place those things are very low to no light meaning keeping your environment very dark or very very dim i do not thing it is necessary to sleep in a room that is complete blackness i think that is a low bit overkill but for most people keeping the room dark and keeping the room temperature low is very beneficial for getting and staying in deep sleep the body has to drop by about one to three degrees in order to get into sleep and to stay asleep low light low temperature environment you can always pile on blankets of course if you do not want be cold at night you want to be warm enough but you want your environment to be cold typically people are not eating in the middle of the night although one thing that can be useful is to make sure that you great least well fed and nous when you head into this third phase of every twenty four hour day that you are not awake because you are hungry now a lot of people recommend putting a gap between your final bite of food and when you go to sleep at night some people say that gap should be four hours other people say two hours i your me i generally have something i do not know within two hours are ninety minutes of going to see but it is not a big meal but that is just me and i fall sleep and stay asleep fine with that you have to experiment for yourself have talked about supplements that can support sleep in previous episodes of the podcast things magnesium three inmate or magnesium bisglicenate things thiamine apigenan if you to read more about those we actually have a news letter that all just quickly refer you to this is the supermen lab curl network news letter you can sign up for it by going to superman labor homes very easy to find but even if you do not sign up you can go to the tool kit for sleep that is listed there and that tool kit is not just supplements that tool kit is a number of different things both behavioral and supplement base and nutrition based et camera that can allow you to get into sleep and to stay asleep more readily it is tolyzero cost you can find that gain at human labor calm things low light low temperature the supplements i mention adjusting your eating schedule appropriately obviously not drinking caffeine in the mill the night or too close to bed that is going to be critical in fact ideally you would not ingest any caffeine and face two of the day that you could get into this deeper state of rest in which habit formation in negro last sleep can occur what if you wake up the way have cast pase three is that yours must be in this deep slumber you not suppose to wake up at all s must be in low light and your brain is rewiring and those habits are getting consolidated et camera well if you me youprobably get up once in the mill the night maybe you go used the rest from perfectly normal perfectly normal but a lot of people have trouble falling back asleep very important if you get up in the mill the night to use a minimum of light in order to navigate your surroundings just as much as you need in order to safely do because light inhibits the hormone melatonin can make it very hard to fall back to sleep if you inhibit melatonin the effects of light in limiting meletonear actually very potent happens very very quickly try and keep the light low ain if you have trouble falling back to sleep that is when you might also want to use something the revery a they have a sleep script there that can hopefully help you get back to sleep or something antiar y u can find antiar scripts on you two of these are zero cost you can look up one that i particular as antiar made for its a company am associated with but the stars completely zero cost and there are other things the oganedra which you can find scripts for elsewhere again all of these habits or these behaviors these dues and do not around phase three themselves might be habits that you are trying to create for yourself but again have three is really about making sure that whatever limbic friction you have been able to overrated in phase one and trigger some new habit forcing yourself to right or forcing yourself to study or forcing yourself to exercise during that high limbic friction state and then whatever things you have been doing in phase too which a habits that hopefully have moved a little bit further along the continuum of newly formed her all the way to reflective or things that take less limbic friction in order to do phase three is when all of that gets really locked into the nervous system through those heavy and mechanisms enema receptors et camera that talked about before again neral plasticity is the basis of habit formation and her plasticity and the rewiring of nerd circuits happens in these states of deep sleep if you are not obeying this phase three if you are not giving phase three the materials it needs and your and you are not avoiding the certain things canine and bright light and stress during phase three you are simply not going to be able to build those habits that you have been working hard to trigger in phase one and face two of the day again these are things that have talked about in previous episodes of the podcast and elsewhere but really this is about habit formation and the whole reason for placing particular types of behaviors at particular phases of the day is to set a frame work for that task bracketing again task bracketing and those circuits of the basil ganglia indicate that it is not just the neral circuits that are engaged by the task itself but the neral circuits that are engaged be for and after that task execution that is what gets consolidated when you do things that particular phases of the day under particular conditions of hero chemistry what your doing is you are giving the brain a very predictable set of sequences that during sleep it can start to put in to your hard drive if you will it can really program into your nervous system that within a short period of time hopefully within eighteen or maybe even six days or who knows maybeven fewer days you will find that executing those behaviors is very very straight forward for you and that you will not have to feel much limbic friction or override much limbic friction some of you're probably asking o k if i perform a particular habit during phase one and then i do other habits during phase to and i eventually get to the point where i engaging in those habits in a pretty effortless way do i keep them in the same phase of the day and the good news is the literature says it does not matter and in fact moving that particular habit around somewhat randomly can actually be beneficial to you because actually moving it from one time a day to the other is that context independence that were we really are seeking by being able to do the same thing that we want to do regardless of time of day or circumstances that is how we know that we have achieved a real habit formation that is how we know that the habit has been moved into certain components of our narial circuitry that just allows to do t what seems reflectively although early are pointed out that these are not reflexes in the traditional sense the reason for that is that this brain area the hippocampus that many of is associate with learning and memory is not actually where memories are stored the hippocampus is where memories are formed it is where procedures talked about before procedural memory of how you're going to execute a popular sequence where that is maintained if we use the recipe model that is where the recipe is maintained until how to cook that dish and then the procedural memory literally migrates off into a different set of narial circuits which are the nail circuits of the no quarter where we have maps of century experience maps of a all kinds of experiences including motor maps of ha to execute thing we use one part of the brain to learn something but then that information in the form of the electrical activity of neurons is passed off to a different brain area now the neurons themselves do not move from the hippocampus to the quarter that does not happen what happens is the signals the sequence of electrical firing much a a script a for a move or the notes on a a sheet of paper for a particular musical piece is transferred off to a different brain area that whole process of reallyleaning into something that is hard then it becoming easier and then eventually that thing becoming more or less reflective involves a migration of the information in the brain and once its migrated out to a different location in the brain at that point it is achieved context independence it does not have to be bracketed by ah your coffin and your lunch it does not have to occur a immediately after your afternoon enemy are but before you're a four clock meeting on zoom or something of that sort all this is to say that one something has become reflective you should play with it a little bit about time of day if you want to keep it in the same phase of day great but if you one day decided an exercise in the afternoon next it you did you can exercise in the morning and that is the habit your concerned with that is terrific if you are able to do that that means that it is truly achieve contexts independence it means that you have officially form that habit an as i mention n earlier much earlier at the beginning of the episode the strength of a habit is dictated by how much limbic friction that was one and how much context dependence there is when it does not take much activation energy to get into the execution of that habit and you can do it in any context well then you have formed a habit we really cannot have a discussion about learning anything habits are otherwise unless we talk about reward predictionerror reward predictionerror is associate with the molecule dopamine although i should say there are other norchemicals in our brain and body that are also related to reward predictionerror but reward predictionerror is a very good system or i should say lends through which to think about whether not we should reward ourselves for performing a given habit a this is a much larger discussion that actually relates to things parenting ain self regulation should we reward kids just for effort should we reward ourselves just for effort what should we reward how much should we reward ourselves when should we withdraw reward should we use punishment these kinds of things is is a vast literature we do not have time to go into all the details but the notion of reward predictionerror is powerful that it can predict most if not all forms of learning including habit formation and you can deploy or use particular features of reward prediction if you would to reenforce or accelerate the formation of certain habits reward predictionerror quite simply is if you expect a reward and the reward comes a particular behavior that was associated with generating that reward is more likely to occur again that is pretty straight forward however the amount of reward in the form of the molecule dopamine that you will experience is even greater if a reward arrives that is unexpected she me repeat that again if i think that something is coming that is going to be great that i lets say i lean into a habit i manage to override my limbic friction and a doing my forty five minutes a writing in the morning with no phone and knowing turned and ism getting toward the end and ism anticipating homactually doing this is is great i did it ism feeling really really good i finish i definitely will receive a dopamine reward it'll make my own dopamine reward that is where it comes from remembers this is all internal however i will also receive dopamine reward if unexpectedly something positive habits and typically if something unexpected but positive habits the amount of doping our reward that we get is actually much greater than in any other conditions however it is hard to surprise yourself about a behavior that your deliberately engaging in that becomes a bit of a tricky one reward predictionerror also says that if we expect a reward and the reward does not come that the pattern of dopamine release will follow a particular contour and that control is very important here is how it goes lets say that ism writing and ism about thirty or forty five minutes in thing out this is great ism actually i man should do this i succeeding in in executing the behaviors that i need to in order to perform this habit ism overriding limbic friction just that series of thoughts will start to generate the dopamine release within my brain and body however if at the fifty minute mark the phone rings and i pick up the phone or i break my own protocol and break my own self discipline and i go on in check social mediator i do something that takes me out of that what is going to happen is that my level of dopamine is actually going to drop below the base line meaning below the level of dopamine i had before i even started the habit execution what this is is this is a system that predicts weather not rewards are going to come when we think a reward is going to come it starts to actually arrive earlier in the form of dopamine release this is the feeling that we experience as in positive anticipation you telic it hey we are going to go to the amusement park are re going to go get ice cream they have not had the ice cream yet they are not at the amusement park but there excited the dopamine release comes earlier they get to the amusement parked they get the ice cream they will also have some dopamine release associate with that but most of it believe it are not came in the form of the anticipation and dopamine has some qualities that make the actual ice cream in the actual amusement park experience more pleasureful than it would be had that open your release not happen of course the other way to do it is to surprise the kid you tell them listen we are going to the a class that you absolutely hate organic o see the person that you absolutely despise than you drive them the amusement park that is the big release of dopamine but reward prediction also says that if you tell the kid or yourself of gay were had to the amusement parked and get some ice cream that really really excite and he get there and its closed werethere not letting any more people in well then the roaming level drops way below what it was before you told them that you are headed there have going a number of different examplesthat hopefully make this clear reward predictionary governs virtually all aspects of effort and all aspects of learning why because when dopamine is released in the brain and body the nerd circuits of our brain body change there is a state change our over love a scheme our overall level of energy but also the sorts of sensory events that were paying attention to changes when there is a lot of dopamine in our system you can leverage this for habit formation think back to task bracketing think back to limbic friction if you are considering adopting a new habit or if you are trying to p break a habit something we have not talk too much about but we will in a moment it is very useful to think not just about the procedural aspects of what you are going to do but also think about the events that precede and follow that particular habit and the execution or at least the effort to execute that habit what your doing is your casting a kind of a spot light or around a bin of time ere a set of events for which dopamine can be associated what is this look in the practical sense well again it'll just try and use very simple concrete examples but this could carryover to anything let us say i were somebody you has a hard time getting in that third et a sixty minutes of zone to cardiac vascular exercise midmorning this is actually an issue for me i much prefer to dour resistance exercised can cardiovascular exercise all thigh once i do it i always feel much better that i have done it what i should do is positively anticipate the onset and the offset of that session right thinking about leaning in to the effort going out and doing that zone to cardiosection and i should think about how ism going to feel after not just think about how great ism going to feel after but also thing about how hard it is going to be at the beginning and then trying to reward myself subjectively for the entire experience another words start rewarding task bracketing in addition to rewarding the execution of the habit itself now some of you might be saying wat wait this is all self talk this is just positive self talk but it is not positiveself talk it is not saying ah i feel great about doing something that actually hate you cannot like yourself or you are welcome to lad yourself but the nursing literature of the literature of growth minds tat all the literature basically of mind that speaks to the fact that when you lied yourself your lying and you actually set up the opposite of a reward systems you have to be brutally honest with yourself that for instance i do not initiating this carry of vascular exercise but i do the fact that have done it after have done it what you are doing is you are applying reward prediction error to the entire sequence of things that is involved in getting into the habit execution getting through the habit execution and getting out of the habit execution how do you do this well i take us back to our procedural memory visualization exercise if we talked about earlier when i talked about it in that contacts i talked about walking through mentally the series of steps that is required to perform our particular habits on the case of the zone to cardie thing it would be o cabin o put on my shoes than in head out the door than i'mhn to drive up the row there is particular canyon your here that if ism going to run i i happen a running or i do not hate running enough that i tend to do it going through that heading back et camera et camera that is great but even better would be to broad in the time ben and start to positively anticipate the period headed into the habit even before you put on your shoes the fact that you are successfully placing the habit in in this case false one of the day and that afterwards ism going to feel a particular set of positive benefits elevated mood at camera i being hungry and lovely after exercise ism hungry i being hungry cause i eating and there is a whole set of things that link up with one another am not pushing about habit execution as this isolated little set of events or this little time bin but rather ism drawing a larger envelope around it and starting to positively associate dopa men reward with that larger envelope and for those of you there thinking wite this is just a psychological trick you con this is sorter line yourself it is not because you are not actually contradicting the fact that some of this is unpleasant what you are doing is you are taking this entire series of events what ism calling this kind of time envelope and your associating it with a particular reward that comes later which for me would be the feeling that ah that have completed this like are for me that is usually good feeling reward prediction error is beautiful not just because it is a sort of math of anticipation and reward or a math of anticipation and disappointment it is beautiful because you can stretch out or make more narrow the time bins in which reward predictionare works reward predictionere is the way in which people navigate for your degrees or hit i mean you go shore final exam to final exam et camera but ultimately there's a big pay off at the end and it is all basically for that big pay off and of course i understand that it is the journey not the destination but let us face it for a lot of us goals and habits are about achieving some sort of destination in the case of zone too cardie for me it is about try to stay alive for as long as i can am as long are i can with vitality that is and it is also the fact that if ism doing that i get to eat ah the foods that i i tend to be able to eat more which i happen to really enjoy eating much that id it just as an activity basically what you are trying to do is not restrict your thinking to just the habit that you are trying a form but rather to grab a hold of the timing before and after that particular habit and start to positively associate reward mechanisms in your braid with that entire time bin this is a very useful and very powerful tool in order to form habits and i should say that it is not something that comes naturally to most people in fact even as i describe it you might find its distill lobed abstract but what i encourage you to do if you are finding it to be a little bit vague would be to pick the habit you want a form write down or think about very concretely what is the sequence of steps involved in the execution of that habit and then write down or think about what is the sequence of events that need to priced that habit may be the immediate ten or fifteen minutes before as well as the immediate sequence of events and or feelings that will occur after that habit and then call the whole thing a habit execution the whole thing a effort to engage in that particular habit and in doing that and in positively associating with the idea that you are going to complete that entire sequent you will engage new red prediction error in the proper way that the dopamine serge can lend itself toward motivation because ultimately dopamine is not about feeling good its about feeling motivated this is something that have talked about numerous times before but dopamine contrary to popular belief is not a reward molecule as much as is a molecule of motivation and drive and the natural consequence of doing the exercise i just described of writing things out that proceed are involved in the immediate execution of the habit and follow the habit will allow you to experience and increase in energy and thereby an increase in likelihood that your going to engage in that entire sequence of events and the reason for that is that dopamine gives us energy and the reason for that is that the molecule epinefferon a drendolin is acting manufactured from dopamine biochemically it comes from dopamine dopamine is powerful and you can access more dopamine around even habits that you habit yet formed by taking this broader time envelope and task bracketing that specific task execution or habit execution way back at the beginning of the episode i promise to you that i would deliver two programs that argued towards habit formation and i promise that i would give you ways in which you could gauge whether not certain habits had moved from high effort when i call highlymbic friction to reflective we talked about a number ways to gauge that in researching this episode i found a tremendous number of different systems for habit formation is really amazing how much is out there there ones as sixty days to this are twenty one days to that or eighteen days to that something is just rampant in the popular psychology literature and in the self help literature i want a spell out a particular system that i think to be very useful to most if not all people that rooted in the biology of habit formation rooted in the psychology of habit formation and that is entirely compatible with that phase one phase to pase three typeprogram that i talked about earlier but encompasses a bit of a longer time scale and really arrives at at kind of a system if you will for how to build in habits and then to test whether not those habits have really stuck and whether not the likely to stick going forward and this is at least for sake of this example a twenty one day system i pick twenty one days because that seems to be the average or most typical system for engaging nerd plasticity as it relates to the formation of new habits this twenty one day system actually is one that one i know very well uses and is used for a long time as she use them a their kids use it as well and it has a certain elegance to it and i think om as i describe it that elegance will will begin to reveal itself easily what this involves is you set out to perform six new habits per day across the course of twenty one days why six and why twenty one we will talk about that in a moment but the a ideas you write down six things that you would to do every day for twenty one days what phase of the day those things fall in to well that will depend on what they are and how they relate to those earlier face one face two fays three but for now twenty one days six things per day however the expectation is that you will only complete for to five of those each day built into this is a kind of permission to fail but it is not failure because it turns out that this approach to forming habits is base not much on the specific habits that you are train of form but the habit of performing habits right it is the habit of doing a certain number of things per day you set out to perform six now another reason for not necessarily performing all six is that some activities probably should not be performed each day for instance in my case if i were to wait train or even run every day ism of the sort or mybiologyis of the sort that i do not recover well i would not want to do resistance training every day but i might want to do it four days a week for instance by having six things in that list could shuffle out that particular activity on particular days of the week and simply do four or five other activities twenty one days you list out forth five thing it might be on to cardie resistance training sunlight viewing om writing i could be journalling it could be learning a language mathematics again this is going to vary depending on your particular goals an the habits that you are trying to create but no more than six and the expectation is that you are not in perform more than forth five if you miss a day meaning you do not perform forth five things there is no punishment and in fact it is important that you do not actually trying do what in the literature is called a habit slip compensation which is just fancy psychological language for if you screw up and you do not get all four or five in one day you do not do eight the next day in order to compensate this i squally brings me back to an example i had from graduate school i remember when i start graduate school feeling very excited but a little bit overwhelmed by the amount of things that i had to do because id to both do research i was doing concourse work at the time graduates cousin stipend and still now unfortunately were a depressingly low as financially stressful there were number of things happening and remember it a neurologist the you see barely really fantastic scientist and person is name as bornite some of you may know him i remember he i went to him and i ask you what is the process by which some one actually navigates graduate school successfully an and he said listen you do not want to do anything or engaging or routine in any way that you cannot keep up consistently for at least five an ideally six days per week no no that is pretty good and he said every four or five years you might have to update that but you union to decide what you can you consistently what you can do every day or at least six days a week or five days a week that was very very useful to me and it fits we with this notion of habits slips that if you happen to screw up and not be able to engage in whatever habits you are trying to learn for whatever reason that the next day you just get right back on on the on the horse to speak however there is a really interesting feature from the your science literature and from the psychology literature that says that chucking this twenty one days into two day bens can be very very useful while it is true that the unit of the day that ourselves yours is a circadian one of twenty for hour clock there does seem to be something powerful about engaging in particular habits in a particular sequence for two days in a row and then resetting thinking oke i can do this for a day naif i can do it for day i can probably do it for two days and then resetting every two days your resetting your cut chucking this twenty one days into a series of two day bens in which you are trying to perform for to five new habits and then completing that twenty one days now everything have described about this twenty one day program with six things that you are trying to do as new habits and only performing for to five and not compensating et camera there's nothing your scientifically unique habit except for the fact that it is not just twenty one days broken up into two day chunks after twenty one days you stop engaging in this twenty one day deliberate for to five things per day typeschedual and you simply go in to auto pilot you ask yourself how many of those particular habits that i was deliberately trying to learn in the previous twenty one days are automatically incorporated into my schedule how many of them am i naturally doing in other words every twenty one days you do not update and start adding new habits you simply trying maintain the ones that you have built in that first twenty one days and this i think is extremely important because in all of the habit literature that i could find sure there was a lot of psychological data burro skin's data behavioral science data around here is how you form a habit here is how you break a habit there was even some kind of tests for weather not a habit had a really achieved context independents whether or not it was a strongly formed habit but there was not a lot of information at least by my search of what to do once you formed a habit and how to evaluate whether r not that habit is likely to persist long into the future here is the idea you set out these six things that you would to learn or that you would to acquiring your life these habits you only expect that you arguing to perform for five each day you do that for twenty one days again if you miss a day you just hop right back on the next day however you should think about the functional units within this twenty way one day period as two days you can trying nail fortified of these things for two days if you happen to get all six great but that is not necessarily required son nor two days then reset two days then reset two days and then in the next twenty one days you are not trying to acquire any new habitsyou are not enough row in six more habits that you want to learn you are simply going to assess how well how deeply you rewired your nervous system to be able to perform those six habits of the previous twenty one days this is extremely useful i believe because it will allow you to assess whether or not you can indeed make room if you even have room i should say for more habits right many people a try to tram many new behaviors into their nervous system that they do not stand a chance of learning all those behaviors what you may find is that you kept up two of those things very consistently throughout the twenty one days and perhaps there was one of them that you did operatically and that there were three others that frankly you did not manage to execute you may also be one of these people one of these mutants that sets out to do six new things pray for twenty one days and performs every single one of them terrific more power to you in that case for the following twenty one days lets see whether not you can continue to perform those very same six things every day for twenty one days and then and only then would you want to add more habits in you could repeat this twenty one day process twenty one days of a new habit twenty one days of testing those new habits as whether not there reflection or not you could do that for ever if you wanted but the ideas that this is not something that you are doing all your long is that you perhaps starting the new year or regardless of when you are listening to this you set out to make that twenty one day really the stimulus period in which the habits get wired in and then the following month and may been the following months or periods of twenty one days are really that cold of thermometer of the test bed of how well you have needed those particular habits and if indeed you want to continue to ad new habits or you find that certain habits that you were not able to imbed in your nervous system and make reflective you want to then bring those in fantastic but it is only once you've achieved all those six habits as reflective that you would move forward and i think this sort of system wile it could have been replaced with many other different systems again there is nothing wholly about the system but this particular system has a number of features the lack of compensation for is days the fact that it is a fairly high intensity program for twenty one days but then you test yourself a kind of a competition test with yourself if you will those features and the fact that habit slips missing of particular habits and not doing all six is con built into the system i think makes it a very reasonable not it is very a adaptable to the real world and i think it is one that provided you obey the phase one face two face three type system that we talked about earlier you collapse these two programs a with one another which hopefully will be easy based on the descriptions have given well if you do that i think is a very high probability that the habits that you try inform will achieve this contexts dependents and that it will take progressively less and less limbic friction to perform them thus far we have almost exclusively been discussing how to form habits but what about breaking habits certainly many people out there would to break habits that they feel don serve them well one of the challenges and breaking habits is that many habits occur very very quickly and there is not an opportunity to intervene until the habit has already been initiated and in some cases completed well there are couple of tools that euro science and psychology tell us can be very beneficial some of those things are somewhat intuitive and relate to what i call foundational practices meaning things that set the over all tone in your body and brain such that you would be less likely to engage in a particular habit or that would raise your level of awareness both of your situation and to how you feel inside things stress reduction things getting good sleep things quality nutrition things having positive routines arrange throughout your day all of those of course will support you in trying to break particular habits and while that can be very useful its admittedly very generic advice it does not point to any one specific protocol in order to identify a specific protocol that one could apply in order to break habits we have to look at the mirror image of the sort of negro plasticity that we talked about at the beginning of the episode the beginning of the episode we talked about a form of negro plasticity call long term potentiation involving the n m d a receptor just to refresh your memory alibi basically says that if a set of neurons is very electrically active it is likely that over time those neurons will communicate with themselves more easily because of changes in things enemy a receptor activity the recruitment of additional receptors et camera it is essentially a cellar and molecular explanation for how something goes from unlearned to learn to reflective now in order to break synapses or to break a part neural connections that are serving a habit that you do not want to engage in we need to engage the process called long term depression and long try depression has nothing to do with a state of mental depression or a reduction in mood i really want to be clear in when i say depression in this context it has nothing to do with psychological depression has nothing to do with mood it is simply call long term depression because just as long term potentiation says if neuron a triggers the firing of neuron b and it does very reboil over and over and over again the neuron a will not have to fire as intensely or as frequently in order to activate neuron b in the future because they become potentiate right the threshold for activation has been reduced there is a much higher probability that they will be activated together at low levels of intensity that is essentially what long term potentiation is long term depression says that if neuron a is active and neuron b is not active within a particular time window then the connection between neuron a and b will weaken over time even if they started off very strongly connected ocansomeon o repeat that the cases is a pretty a detailed nurobiological mechanism whereby if neuron a is active and neuron b is active but at a different time or outside of particular what we call temporal window meaning outside a particular time window then through long term depression the connection between neuron a and neuron b will weaken and just as a point of interest the n m d a receptor is also involved in long term depression although their other molecular components involved is well how do you take two neurons that underlie a habit out of synchrony how do you get them to fire a sincernisly this is pretty interesting with respect to the cellar molecular biology but at the behavioral level it is especially interesting the way that one would do this is let say for instance you have a habit of picking up your phone mid work session we that is a reflective habit i think that most people have experienced and we often here the idea that of the phone is filled with access to dopamine and incredible things that were just drawn to it but if you notice what is happen with phone you over time most people including myself sometimes i admit find ourselves just looking at our phone or find ourselves in a particular a without actually having engaged in the conscious set of steps of oh ism really curious what is going on in this particular a ism really curious what is going on in this particular weight and you just kind of find yourself in air quotes after those of you listening on making misquotes you job sort of find yourself doing it because of the behavior of picking up your phone as sort of reflective or as become fully reflects of you see this a lot at meals where multiple people are there and no ones looking at their phone and also and one takes out their hogan you will notice that other people just naturally take out their phones this kind of am observed a observation induced reflect and i would wager that most people are not consciously aware of the immediate steps involved the literature says their number ways to break these sorts of habitual behaviors or reflective behaviors most of those approaches involve establishing some sort of reward for not performing the activity or some sort of punishment for forming the activity have heard of on some basic things that people do they even put a rubber band on their wrist and every time they complain or em every time they do some behavior pick up their phone they will give themselves a snap on the wrist the at their factional there is that your trying to create somatic a very physical representation of something that makes it very real and harder to overlook other people just to a tidemark on a piece of paper the sort of what gets measured is what gets m managed kind of mind set where if every time you do something you take away the judgement this is very new a i realize but this is what you find out there if you search the literature and even on pulled a our reviewed articles that every time you engage in a behavior you just measure the fact you that you a did that behavior you just mark it down at the end of the d my people are suppose to look o that si o my goodness i cannot believe that i spent a three hours doing something ore i did it forty six times in fact a lot of a social media as we will start to give you warnings now if you popped in that you have been on the a for an hour would you to leave most people just clickright past and go back in i think very few people a say oh bygones hat seen an hour and therefore you right i absolution engage in this any more is just far too easy to just blow past those reminders well the literature on habit formation and habit reduction breaking habits has been analyzers a beautiful a met analysis which involves looking at a number of different studies altogether ah comparing the statistical strength of each of those studies looking indifferent conditions what sorts of habits were trying to be made or broken a the first author on this review is fritz if are it's am it'll certainly put a link to this a it is heather fritz and it is a intervention to modify habits a scoping review and it is indeed a very broadscale review its from the journal occupation for dissipation and health s publish in twenty twenty a really nice article couple of things i learn from this article and that it'll get into the specific tool for breaking habits perhaps the most interesting thing that i took from this review whats the finding that notifications to either engage in habits or to not engage in habits actually were not very effective over time they were effective in the in immediate period when people started using these notifications as were little sticky notes do not go into the refrigerator between the hours of whatever and whatever or a just visual reminders physical reminders ore electronic reminders were effective in the immediate term but in the long term did not predict whether or not people would effectively stick to habits they were trying to stick to or break habits that they were thing to break sadly that does not seem to work very well a and perhaps they just need to come up with am more robust reminders out in a mild electric shock or something that because what we do know only sort of getting about my electric shock but what we do know from both human in animal studies is that things electric shock things monetary penalties right having to pay out every time you engage in a particular behavior those are pretty effective ways to break habits the problem is when people are not being monster for habit use am for instance you can imagine a situation were you say ism not in to pick up my phone for the four hours in the early part of the day that i can get in a real dedicated focus work done a unless some one's monitoring them then people do not tend to monitor themselves completely enough that they punish themselves completely enough that they break the behavior another words that the punishment is not bad enough in order to break the habit which just speaks to how powerful these habits are once they become reflective they are just very very hard to override turns out that the key to generating long term depression in these pathways is actually to take the period mediately following the bad habit execution meaning let us say you tell yourself you are not in to pick up your phone your i can bite your nails you are not in reflectively walk to the refrigerator a particular time of day but you find yourself doing it anyway and what actually has to cabin is bringing conscious awareness to the period immediately afterward which i think most people recognized the real is ah i just did it again i just did i again and in that moment capture the sequence of events not that led to the bad habit execution but actually to take advantage of the fact that the neurons that were responsible for generating that bad habit were were active a moment to go and to actually engage in a replacement behavior immediately afterward now this is really interesting and i think powerful because i would have thought that you after engage in a replacement behavior that truly replaces the bad habit behavior right ah that you would have to be able to identify your state of mind or the sequence of events leading into the bad habit but rather the stage or the period immediately after the bad habit execution is a unique opportunity to in set a different type of what we would call a captive behavior but that could be any behavior that is not inline with the bad behavior let us give an n example let say you find yourself am you are trying to do focussed work you pick up your phone you are disappointing yourself for for picking up your phone you could of course just put it down or you and re engage the work behavior but if you were good at that than you probably would have done in the first place and what turns out to be very effective is to go engage in some other positive habit now this has too major effects the first one is you start to link in time the execution of a bad behavior to this other good behavior and in doing you start to recruit other curl circuits other neurons that can start to somewhat dismantle the sequence of firing associated with the bad behavior in other words you start to create a kind of a double habit that starts with a bad habit and than ends with a good habit and that seems to create a enough of a temporal mismatch that then recognizing when you are heading toward the bad habit becomes more apparent to you again i want to make this very very concrete let us say that the behavior is a reflectively picking up one's phone you do that you think a goodness i did it again here is what i man to do you would set that down and then you engage in some other positive behavior that you have deemed positive and here it is very subjective it is hard for me to give an example that will necessarily make sense to everybody but perhaps am your working on hydration may you i have a glass of water maybe you am you are trying to a do breastwork or something maybe her you are trying to enhance your language speaking skills and you go in you spend five minutes doing a particular type of language learning you literally exit whatever you are doing and perform that other new positive habit in the immediate period right after that even for a short period of time it is a little bit counter intuitive but what this does as it creates the kind of a cognitive and a temporal mismatch between the initial bad behavior which before is what we call sort of a closed loop in the engineers out there will know what i am talking about but in clothes loop is o one behavior one set of nail firings leads to another leads to another and then just kind of sets the same thing in motion it can be kind of a self perpetuating system by changing the number of features that are in that loop it disrupts the the closed nature of that loop it creates what we call an open loop and in an open loop you are better able to intervene as i mention before this might seem counter intuitive mi think why woad i want to reward the execution of it bad habit with a good habit i do not want o reward myself for the bad habit but really what you are trying to do is your trying to change the nature of the curl circuits that are firing that you can rewrite the script for that bad habit a different way to put it would be imagine that the bad habit is a us a cord on the piano that you play or a cord of notes are a sequence of notes that you would play and it comes very easily you can play at every single time but lets say as you are trying to learn a new piece of music you just constantly inserting that at the inappropriate times that was things tho decent enough analogy for a bad habit because it involves some motor execution you just find yourself doing it rather than trying to prevent yourself from doing it the next time you do it ad in a new cordon sequence that you are trying to learn what this does then is it changes the whole nature of the sequence of neurons that are firing from bad habit through to the end of this newly applied good habit this is the way in which you start to dismantle or when i say dis mantle really weaken the likelihood that if neuron a fires neuron b will fire because as your starting off in the mode of very reflectively performing a bad habit those turns are firing together without you consciously being aware of it it is almost impossible for you to intervene in yourself a without number of other features severe punishment a severe consequence ti outcomes rather tacking on some additional sequences if neuron a fires our on b fires and then you are saying o k while if no on b fires ism get a startincerting our on c d e f to fire right that is the c d f being the positive behavior that you are going to insert and in doing you create a chain of normal activation that then is very easy to this mantle and when people have applied this find of approach it removes the need to have constant conscious awareness of one's own behavior prior to that behavior which is very very difficult to achieve rather what they find is that they are able to engage in remapping of the neural circuits associate with bad habits in ways that are very very straightforward right because you can always identify when you have done the thing you do not want to do and then tack on to that something admit tonal that is positive now the nature of that positive thing is important you do not want it to be something that is very hard to execute you want it to be something that is positive and fairly easy to execute that you are not struggling all the time to insert this on top of this bad behavior whatever that bad behavior might happen to be but again this is rooted in the biology of longer depression it maps very well to the behavioral change to literature that i was able to glean that really shows that rather than just get reminders rather than trying and still punishment rather than setting up reward for breaking bad habits that perhaps the simplest way to approach this is to tack on additional behaviors to the bad habits make sure those behaviors are good behaviors or behaviors that are adaptive for you and in doing you will soon find that the initiation of the bad habit takes on a whole new form or that you are not even inspired to do it at all and of course i want to acknowledge that breaking bad habits is really hard we had an episode all about addiction with doctor on limpkin from stamford medical school is a colleague of mind who runs the dual diagnosis a diction clinic at stamford and in that episode we talked a lot about how attics for drugs alcohol people have addictions to certain types of behaviors or avoidance behaviors even that in the case of addiction there has to be a tremendous kind of full scale a campaign for them to be able to intervene in their behavior for those of you there are thinking about bad habit breaking in the context of addictive type behaviors definitely check out that episode a diction does employ some of these principles around habit making and habit breaking as it were a but of course because the a consequences of certain habits in addiction can be severer there is other sets of protocols and there is a kind of a psychological back top to it that is very important it also relates to the biology of demeaning you can find all of that in the episode with doctor on olempky to day we have covered a lot about the biology and psychology of habit formation and habit breaking we talked about we certain habits are hard to wire in wiser habits are hard to break down and eliminate and how we can determine which habits are going to be easier for us to access which habits are going to be harder for us to access and break we talked a lot about this notion of limbic friction and we talked about context dependents and we talked about a number of different things as it relates to normal circuits and the formation of new connections in the brain and strengthening and we caning of connections in the brain we also discuss two programs programs design specifically for you on the basis of the nerbilogy literature and the literature on the psychology of habit formation and habit breaking just a briefly recap one programmed involves dividing the twenty four hour day into three phases face one face two face three and to trying tackle specific habits at particular phases of the twenty for our cycle the second programmed involved a twenty one day process of engaging a proximately six new habits per day although the expectation as i mention earlier is that you are not going to perform all six of those and an assessment in the following twenty one days as to whether or not you have indeed formed those new habits or not and there were a number of other features that i mention that were related to those two general programs face one face to face three and the twenty one day program an how those cold be meshed together ism guessing some of you will probably have questions about those programs and how to apply them but hopefully they were clear enough for you to get started this is a good opportunity for me to mention that he housemen ladpodcast as something called the hurry network news letter that is sent out approximately once a month for the next news letter i were release a on paper version of these two systems and how they mesh together for habit formation and habit breaking and if you to acts us that you can go to superman labor cam you go to the menu you can sign up for the news letter first of all its zero cost second of all we have our privacy policy there but i can tell you right now we do not share your meal with any vendors or any other a sources those meal state am internal to us and if you to see what the sort of flavor of those news letters is the previous news letters for instance one on tools for sleep that i mention earlier or on tools for negro plasticity in the class from and outside the class from as well for teachers and for students of various kinds those are alsopposeted there you can access any of the previous news letters i hope is that to day you have learned both the biological mechanisms and the practical tools by which you can start to establish habits that for you you deem adapted healthy and that are going to support you in your goals and the you can start to dismantle some of the habits that you find to be unhealthy or maladaptive for you and for your goals if you are learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribe to our out channel that is a

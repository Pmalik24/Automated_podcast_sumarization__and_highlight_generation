no jolly ball i the anything that left its her friends which are confused as she is to the a going round e i wit no purpose and this is what bothers us the most that there is no purpose for them here they needs something to wake up for it in the morning and or here it is a too much pain and too much e dark seeing i this that is what convince macaw i a tom as right they need to get away from the tell the kids needed that but where to go now talking about this as a couple members of the cahoots were in a much bigger conversation about leaving the hotel has a group there as much damage to their cuts my homes an building set on fire burn to the ground bomb it would grenades and boots would take two or three years to refill before they can move back theywerelook hire at temporary places the

story bynefesa thompson's spires rat first by actor's esdavas enrich alexandera tuesday october first nineteen ninety one hello maniac ism sure you remember me from the class field trip to the petty in september it has been brought to my attention that your daughter fatwa may have started a nasty rumor about my christiania i hope to car this up as we both know how ugly these things can get it is true that christinia's hamster died recently but it is absolutely not true that it died at chick's hand at no time has crisis ever put jawbone or any of her previous hamsters in the micro wave drier or dish washer what kind of child would make up something that it sounds and i say this respectfully i hope you will not be offended fatwa has had a very hard time getting acklenlaed here and that is understandable but i do hope you will deal with her before any such incidents become frequent children who start lying young often and up with long time patterns of dishonest all best doctor licinda johnston did lifesence therapist welcome wagon westward primary events coordinator jack in jill clement branch money october seven nineteen ninety one dearlicinda i apologized for my late reply but i only found your letter at the bottom of fajita's backpack when i did my weekly cleaning thank you for writing to me fatwa says she only repeat it what christiania herself told her many of fajita's stories about christiania this year and last which i will not recount here have been disturbing to say the least but none is disturbing as christinia's enjoyment of torturing wrote fatwa has a strong imagination and writes beautiful lyric poetry which she started reading at e for but she does not have a history of line or telling gruesome stories and i'mlike christiania she has no history of running off with other girl's shoes while their feet dangle from the monkey bars i appreciate your concerns about fatwa and even though christiania has made it much more difficult for her to find friends at westward ffatima will acclimate soon she is going to a sleep over at family's this weekend is christiania going if i hope you will encourage her to play nice best maniac willies p h t p s it is true that liars who start young often windup with psycho logical in social problems of the sort that christiania has timistrateed over the past year how lucky for you and christiania that she has access to psychotherapy through your practice no an dear maniac i never expected much defensiveness when i wrote my original letter perhaps you miss read it all i wanted to emphasize is that i understand why a girl and fajita's physics n and one with her background would make up such stories it is hard to get attention in a new place there is probably some petty jealousy going on but i think we can resolve this i do not know how you did things at fajita's old school in frena was it but here we try to help the children work through their problems without getting too involved i suppose you already know and have known all along that christiania will not attend family's party there is no need for me to encourage her to play nice you have probably heard that history already i will not rehash but i will say that it was not chick's fault that family broke her nose when she felt finally and i say this respectfully but maybe it would be wise to go through fajita's backpack every night instead of once in a blue moon i have heard from more than one parent that it smells eggs my best doctor lucid johnston license therapist author of train up a child dear lucid or should i say doctor johnston it'd to resolve this as much as you would but that will not happen if all your letters begin in end with back biting ism not of the mind that the only two black children in the clash should be enemies nor do i the attention it draws to them or their parents when they are already in a difficult position i would think that a black woman of your stature and success would understand how isolating work in school environments westward can be for people us i hoped christiania an fatwa could be friends and could support each other in this space but it is been clear since second great that you and christiania are not willing to make that work ism sure fatwa would let christiania into her growing inner circle even her after school reading club if christiania would only apologize and behave jealousy can become a lifelong problem on that note i hate to bring this up now but we were surprise by how poorly christiania behaved when far time's open one over hers last year i to make sure that we do not in t with a repeat performance of that tantrum when the poetry competition roll around this year asked with a hard boiled egg we resolve that last bring and bought fatwa on new back pack and i believe you knew that already years doctor maniac wills oh d author of every voice counts helping children of color succeed an predominantly white schools maniac excuse the informal note i think you are doing both yourself and fatwa a great injustice by continually emphasizing her brilliance over other children lots of people ship grates and skipping kindergarten is not something to brag about i doubt that the standards at her old school were as rigorous as those at westward what exactly was she advanced at native if you will recall moreover i was there at the recital where fatwa read her a word winning poem and while my doctors yes floral may not be in literature ism pretty sure hardly any one would call butterfly pie a work of poetic genius you cannot rime pie with pie multiple times and call that poetry you just cannot even if you have the excuse of only being in forth grate is not your degree by the way and e d d lucid lucid ism not surprised if fajita's subtle word play was lost on you since it is clear reading problems run in the family not everyone is suited for literary work ism sure that from your own writing struggles in the extra effort you had to put behind your research in order for any one to take it seriously is not there still some kind of issue with your last project and the i r b or is the issue wit doctor portal's ex wife my very best maniac maniac ism not going to dignify most of your comments with a response this will be my last letter because i can see ism not going to get anywhere with you there is some kind of blockage there that i really think you should explore with a license to professional especially if you call yourself a professor it one time i wondered if we were too harsh and recommending that you an your family wait another year before joining our jack in child chapter but i can see now that we were right ism afraid i can never recommend you for our club you display a volatile combination of residual ghetto and pay ne guess and that will be your undoing if fatwa isn't sincerely doctor lucid m johnston license therapist author of train up a child welcome wagon west wit primary school events coordinator jackal jo er my chapter lucid ism not even going to respond to that but i will say that if some one here is up at it is the one of us with two little brats who have run off three o pairs who even uses that time if they are not french and ism pretty sure your cousinshir quant is not the nanny nannies and if there your old relative than they are just baby sitters or bombs who need a hook up this bushiness and the way o keeps you from connecting with your kids is half of your problem the other half you probably cannot fix without medication good thing you can write prescriptions

highest educated person in my family with no help but gods makes me up at and be it we are humble people in spite of our education in finances and we have more class and our experiment than you having your whole hamster murdering family and yes there is a bit of ghetto still left in me enough to tell you who can finish the fight if it gets to that point whenever too far from open or the outside let's keep it real maniac maniac i do believe that was a threat the care mot police department will not take this lightly and tell fatwa to stop penning notes to the inside of chick's book bag when she is not looking christy could injure herself on a dirty safety pen knowing you people and and up with happatitus a b or see or worse have tried to resolve our differences by working directly and exclusively with you and their teacher missus wagon but i will have no choice but to contact principal lee in addition to the police if this persists lucid lucid only you would suggest something disgusting as intentionally injuring a child with a dirty safety pin wat then again it was christiania who put that tack on rent pot's chair last year and caused her to need a etnas shot perverse

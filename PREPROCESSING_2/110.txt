the media rush to jo bison's defense as republicans prepare an impeachment inquiry against him inflation jumps again as the bide administration trash to make bionomics a thing and it round announced the end of his political career ism bencher of this is the bench parrot so the josponserb express we pianist time to stand up against big tack protect our data express vein si come flashed man most pretty obvious that re publicans launching an impeachment inquiry are going to end this process within impeachment there is no purpose for an impeachment inquiry if it does not end in an impeachment that just be a giant pratfall by the re publican party to launch an inquiry that does not actually end with an i peaches which means we are steadily moving toward that and the question becomes what exactly must be proved in order for an i detachments to be pursued with vigor and alacrity and the answers pretty much whatever democrats did in the last few years of the trumpet ministration apparently that means you on'noveh to butcher crime it means the do not actually have to pride evidence that a crime was was full on committed all you have to show is that there was corruption or abusive power enough for your own party that is basically all you need and to this point we have already shown that when it comes to jo bison and hunter bison and the done all that material is all ready public one the biggest gas lighting episode are ever seen this happening right now in real time as the media determine that actually there is no evidence what sever that anything is wrong with jo bison or hunter bison that that effectively these people are just as clean as the driven snow for example entire medium on cash last night of the media claiming there's no evidence of job's connection with hunter bidet's corruption which is a li it is an absolute avert we not only do we have two separate business partners of hunter bisons saying that job is involved in the business that be even archer and tony bobolink we have them both testifying that jo bid would stop by meetings or call into meetings having to do wit his son's business if direct acts from hunter bison to his own daughter suggesting that he paid daddy's bills we have what is abs from hunter bison's computer to foreign companies suggesting that if they do not pay up his dad my is sitting literally right next to him and will wield his outsized political power in order to punish said companies we have tens of millions of dollars moving around from foreign forces of sources into a variety of shell companies and then into companies unpeople connected with hunter bison and we have hunter widen living in jo bidet's house where a lot of the stuff has happening yow i mean there's old little but of evidence we i sad little i mean a lot of evidence the only thing that is missing is an actual transaction wire showing money moving directly from hunter widen to chorion but let me just make something pretty clear when it comes to parents and kids that sort stuff fungal to happen nor for the bill to get paid pointing this out it is pretty bodies have you ever gone out to dinner with your parents and the e pick up the tab cute you picked up the tab right well of but does that mean that your parents did not benefit from you picking up the tab or you have to actually trains for the money to your parents a counts and then they pick up the tab in order for to be considered a benefit for your parents idiocy anyway here the media denying to lying to night i gent remember these of the people who for four long years every single day on mean and remember i be at the him which is the only place the that seaman has ever appeared my life and seaman would unfortunately be on the wall and every single day wulfbletz r be talking about how new boy shambles emerging in the russia investigations can blow this thing wide open who is going to destroy the true precedency for four long years we heard all of that and in never emerge adamshift is still sitting in the house an honored member of the democratic class the media went crazy over things the steal save for years on in but here there is no evidence none not not not a wit not a scintilla not an soda of evidence that jobidon is corrupt in anyway just listen to our vaunted media having months and months of a conversation and hearings and a news coverage of well what exactly did go on with jo widen and hundred don's business dealings that a as we have all said no evidence yet has been presented that the bidets have made a lot of mynah in at earth again a no evidence that we have sand even som house republicans say the not convinced evidence exist la r publicans insinuated they might not back the move they might not vote for it given the lack of evidence to support such a drastic actions but how is republicans have far not provided evidence that biding directly provided off his sonbusiness on or made any deficient as i president cause of that we here is the thing the media are relying on a very very broad definition of evidence here in order to escape the reality there antler there is only circumstantial evidence lemme first point out that circumstantial evidence includes thing in court for example finger prints on a weapon that a circumstantial the definition of circumstantial evidence is evidence that indirectly points to in outcome but does not directly attest the outcome direct evidence is i a witness saw of season murder his exam life that would be direct evidence indirect evidence would include things blood all over of stepson's bronco blood all over the crimesene all of that matching i thou all be indirect evidence that be circumstantial evidence when you hear people si be there is only circumstantial evidence that job and hunter were involved together circumstantial evidence jo bison directly saying that he threatened the upranians the billion dollars and removed with drawn aid if they did not fire the prosecutor overseeing the prosecution of his son's company well yes that is circumstantial also is pretty indicative it is pretty indicative in again if the standard now on impeachment is effectively that if a party does not another member of another party they just get to i peach him then after luge a crime and and nun have to define the crime ages got to tell you if what i have stacked up here is donate trump impeached in twenty nineteen for the great crime of calling up vlodimerselensky and allegedly threatening to with draw military aid if lodgers lens did not dig up dirt on the bisons and then on the other hand i have jobidon being impeached for an on going scheme with his son to clear tens of millions of dollars by essentially using his influence as vice presidents of the united states or by the way even allowing his son to purport to use his influence as who's president of the united states and clearing actual money that way and shaping you ask policy that way because i mean why else does join care about victor showing why seen charge of you crane policy in the first placewhys you squiring his son around to shining a force to the mean those she those stack up at least ferry evenly at the very least and yet were told there is no evidence whatsoever none no evidence that that is a li there is in fact evidence but the mediate on to continue along these lines cabin collins for example over its yean directly asked re publican congressmen mike wall to flora have you seen any treat evidence we mean know he don't actually see bi the heads of breeze my handing jobidoni sack of cash but the these people do not know the definition of direct forms in direct evidence we have tons of in direct evidence for you yourself when you are talking out the evidence that ye say seen and for those listening how have you seen anything then directly ties present in biding and shows that he profited from his sons foreign business feelings we have is son complaining to his relatives about how many of his fathers bills he is haven to pay with these e licit gas i we have i ait in t we anthem i we did and profit we have it but i mean but the cabin the point of the inquiry is to give us greater standing to get the full evidence if we get full cooperation if they say we have nothing to hide and give it to us and we do not see anything than that when the facts lead us they a the ow e ta i shall i see get yet at do not get more evidence we n t we see at we work en to follow the facts were going to do this responsibly ah but again ism amazed at the standard ism amazed at the standard here i mean that to the standard which is hunter bided says to his own daughter i paid dad's bills and cabin collins i heavy stein t e evidence that under bid pay was bills whet mean he said he did that yes some evidence that he paid his dad's bills and the fact that his dad has millions of dollars of unexplained wealth i mean that that seem pretty suggestive i guess the new standard is that republicans have to show that hunter bid in directly sign a check to jobidon an has to have jobs robin's name on the back of the track handed to than in order for any of the to be good i do not think that is not how any of the pinwork an by thewy the america people do not believe that either the reality is t impeach or not is almost o rallevent because we know that join is not can be removed by the senate of the united states is dominated by democrats hell we do know however is that the america people by an large believe the allegations that jobidon is involved in corruption because he very clearly is will get to robin's response this momentarily first a company is looking out for you in the actually up graded your services and do not charge you for it it is great news for new and current pure talk customers pure tuck just agitated to every plan and includes a mobile hotspot with no price increase whatsoever if you have considered pure talk before the a made the sled we now oud be a time to take a second look for just twenty bucks a month you get unlimited talk text now fifty per cent more or five she dato plus their new mobile hot spot it is just one reason i love pure to k the veteran own they only hire the best customer service team located right here in the united states america most families are saving almost a thousand dollars a year while enjoying the most dependable five you net work in the country remember youvot with have e spent yourmoneys to stop supporting companies that actually do not you very much that is notes her true of pure talk that is a reason they sponsor the so when go to pure talk dot comslsh burial save in ti tonal fifty per cent off your first month because they actually value you that is pure talk dot come slash azure they have great covering no because i use pure talk by self pure talk is wireless four america by american's rant now thinking a fantastic deal hand art a portal dot tomslash pure save fifty per cent off your first month because again this accompany that actually cares about you o case the jo bison response to all of this is basically to pretend that is big nothing says that a campaign reception my lean virginity he reportedly said hunch we they just nearly one to a peach me know e best i can tow non a peach me because they wont a shut down the government look look give got a job to do everybody always asked about i peaches i got up everyday not a joke not a joke join is not a joke ans the do no one thought you were joking ism confused by you it i get avert not a joke not folk is done o peaches have got a job to do i got doit the issues that effect the america people every single solidary his theory is the republicans are pursuing i preachment they can also persuade government shut down which by the want is actually t e opposite of the truth even if you are cynical about politics what you think istle my earthy is pursuing the impeachment inquiry in order to get his own side off his back seen cut to deal with regard to the continuing resolution not the opposite but again i love one jobidon pretends the he does not knowhow the hell is going on with regard to his son when he very clearly does that the goalpost continue to move the white house is using the same line is the media creenshohm our says there is no evidence that jo biding did anything wrong we she says to net there is evidence that but it my favorite is they went from not knew nothing about hunter's businesses to yack knew something about hunters business is but he was not involved to well yah he was in valve but he nastily clear the money and now the moving to all eurnamean direct evidence that he cleared the money and from there they are going to move to what how could you effect him not to clear how out you took him not to benefit after all this lis not rely for him it was for hunter he just loves his son too much he just loves his son to much and that is going to be the final repository of this argument it was trotted out yesterday by the white house is in same saying that the reason that job stop by hunter's business meanings was out of love it was just out of love just no the in the coolly own family members the family would stop by meanings hell by other members the family just out of familial love now i love my family i do ism also not a public servant ism not somebody who works for the america tamper and it turns out that if your love for your family requires you to engage in corruption at the expense of theamerican tax par that is impeachable and quash criminal behavior i love this defense he day he just loved hunter to too much he loved him too much a a tragic love story why was the president at those meetings on those a foals well again i think this is part of the right wings is information machine to try to confused people ism about what the truth is the truth is that the present as he is said publicly for years a calls his family every day to check in he calls his son everyday to check in he calls his other family members to check in to see how they are down he loves them there's not their tighten at family then there is tighten who is just checking in his aunt he's doing which is why his son would call him the middle of business meetings and dad beget not phony say how is o learn an in in your grin and get on and there is a that is fine dad and click the phone at stand it call it an we and name down on the phone any time i want according to the our times the strategy here is to battle it out in the court of public opinion says en same to the near times e what good luck with that because again it is pretty obvious the level of corruption that join as been involved in his entire career this is nothing new for join this the petit is totally astonishing ism not sure how many democratic scandals getignored by the media on the basis that they are utterly unthinkable they totally cannot be true and then it is pretty obvious that they could totally be true have mentioned before in a completely different contact scandals involving for example allegations about braccobamas drug and sexual behavior in the late nineteen nineties belling that is unthinkable that is totally crazy ha that is terrible now maybe those rumors are untrue mayethey are the reedit in bother to look them up for five seconds why because they were unthinkable and then it turns out that brakobama admits in his memoirs that he was doing can and he also wrote letters to his girl friend talk about fantasies of having see with men and the media when those rumors arrive don't got that is unthinkable we cannot talk about this an then later they well's too late there is nothing really to talk about your get here is the thing as scurrilous is those rumors maybe what were they hill the most implausible rumors i mean not the most implausible rumors but put him in that aside were were not even talk out rumors here rear talk abut actual documented relationships bet tween hunter and job testified too bijou's business be by hunters business partners we have documentation from hunters computer backing all an we have decades decades of records ogjobitan engage in corrupt bargains on behalf of his family with a variety of sources ranging from m bone in delftware he was known as the senator from m bone he was known is this because his son hunter right out of playschool already being a direct got hired over it mbionet and ambinameas a huge binddowner and meanwhile bide was giving sweetheart legislative deals to m bane which was growing by leaps and bounds in the state of delftware and it that sort of stuff's been going on with the bidnsrt who is cut cunning sweetheart real state deals with the heads of m bone going always back in the nineteen sevenths cutting sweetheart deals with unions in order to get himself elected in the there is nothing n u about the corruption here he is cutting sweetheart deals with banks in order get those banks love long to his brother jimmy's wo his brother jimmy could startle is rot a rock bar in in wellington delftware him using his power in order to benefit his family financially has been the entire jordan story for as long as join has been i public office as been the entire stick why is this simple there is no evidence there is no evidence well actually there there is a lot of evidence goes there is a lot of evidence a meanwhile there is another scandal this piled on top of the actual corruption and that is the cover up of the corruption the obstruction of the corruption will get to that in just one second first are love watching my baseball even though y whitetocks are absolutely terrible this year be i i got it sucks the joy out of watching baseball

too is that job is currently the president and the do j was attempting to cut a very obvious sweetheart deal sweetheart deal with hunter obvious that the judge in the case in covered it and blew it up and the do j was forced to pretend that he had not cut the sweetheart real in the first place meanwhile the whitehouseis maintaining is jo din talk to anybody about the hunter case here is the insam'sthe witehousesancjus that gaming the president's been very clear about distance before he even took office that the justice to apartment in his administration is in dependent he has not been involved in that case he has out talked anybody but that case but do not take his word for it take the words of the go pes own witness is in the house who testified in an open hearing that neither attorney general garland nor president don interfered in this case i get well i mean what they did testify to is that the attorney in this case avid wives had ask for special council status from the do ja and was not given it or at the very least that he was not given special council status even if he can ask for it and the mericanlll you didn't mean askportan f wat it is not up to him to ask for you just give it to him if you wish f r him to be truly in dependent will now politicos reporting an bi agents involved in the hunter widen probe said the prosecutor leading it sought but was denied hope from a key fellow us attorney the lack of operations not prevent charges from being brought against the presidents son but it did make the prosecutors job harder the testimony's liver behind close doors is consistent in part with an iris whistle blowers description of the probe and comes at a critical juncture in the investigations into the bison family republicans appointed that whistle blower description when making the case for opening an impeachment inquiry in to president trobidon the agent said she did not recall another see part of the whistleblower allegation re publicans of fast on that avid whites said he did not final authority to charge the president's son apparently the agent sad quote i remember learning it some point in the in investigation the mister whips would have to go through his other process he is because the us attorneys office hat i guess in that sense using that terminology was not going to partner ask if she recalled learning the martinet start the us of turn for the central district of californium specifically decided not to bring tax charges against hunter by the agent said i understand that yes a decision had been made that the central district of californium was not going to i guess my understanding is they were not going to bring the case on their own here is the problem with all this and again this is is the problem inherently with issues involving the doge jobidon does not have to say anything to merit plan for all this tight done they are widespread reports in the public media in the near tons about how upset jobidon is about all these charges with hunter how much he loves his son howlet he is with all f the stuff happenything merit garland does not know that thing merit garland is not interested at all h his no political stake in making shore that a sweetheart deal gets cut with hunter a sweetheart deal that he attempts to bury in a undead you thing that that is jobidon does not have to pick up the phone and a to merit garland medick i want out quash this investigation hes new to signor lettering much oh my son make a go his not have to do that all yester is make it clear that he would that taipan a merit garland knows how to make that happen he makes it happen an one of was makes that happen is he says to avid wise ism not giving you special council status you work for me things go wrong here i get blamed anyway now like let us make this thing go away that is all democrats for the record are beginning to turn on hunter house democrats are beginning to realized that tom maybe hunter has to go under the boy in order to save jo here which is pretty dirty pool gets that momentarily first innovation refund has ben helping small business is the qualify he business merely tax refund through the

gave o meanwhile democrats while they proves that the is nothing here house democrats are preparing to throw hunter directly underage buncoing to politico quote as the house barely closer to an i peaches vote democrat's are valuing to defend biding to the end jo bid that is not hunter top democrats are to messing around a strategy to oppose the jet peas in preachment inquiry cleaving off the son's conduct from his fathers they think they have the facts to back him up since the rob as get to find any evidence to erectly linking enter bison's business dealings to job i gan they keep saying this over ad over i do not understand you do have evidence hunter talked about it tony bobolink talked about it dean archer talked badly what what are you talking about but get then gin a pretend we'll get stay plassgat of the virgin island has our job or my job will be to remind the america people of that over and over again hunter bison is not the administration jimmy rascal said you cannot in headhunter biding but he will be prosecuted democrats do not even plan to try to defend enter but his conduct during is time serving on the board of the craning natural gas company seriema that arrangement republican say allowed him to trade on his father's influence at the time as vice president by the way that is not just what republican say hunter himself see it he said of mid net lastname we not bid i would not have been on the board of a natural gas company in nu crane h knows nothing bout natural gas he knows nothing about you crane but his last name is bison instead the president's party is keen to keep job as far away as possible from the drip drip of damaging in formation coming out about his son hurry paddler of new york he says hunter bide may have very well done some in proper things he is a disturb band almost every president has had problem out i familembers yes but is the president in business with them question w we understand that roger canton bill client's brother was a really screwed up died was bill queering checks was bullet billion actively using his influence to get roger canton jobs outside the administration ism just ism confused but but there's what democrats think they are going to do they're going to throw hunter under the so oh it will be fascinating to see it is almost shakespearian whether job is eventually just on throw hunter under the bus as well if the if the mask of he is a carrying father goes by the wayside when his presidency is at stake if he says o hunter does a lot of corrupt terrible things and begot probes obvious land i i i was not involved in those but hunter man he is on though to go to job past you think job he's gin to do that all be interesting to find out meanwhile democrats have me up with a secondary angle here and that is the person behind all this is the nefarious trump oh trump trump is be trump is manic he is pulling all the strings here ism no ism skin to say no tee a lot of re publicans who think that jo bison has done corrupt and terrible things here nothing to do with dona true butt i gain everything has to be drums fall that dog is not going to hunt that is nutty dog that is going to hun that it is that it is trump from behind to scenes manipulating j genius all of this dona trump can barely manipulate his own hands are you kitting me that is not a thing dona true manipulating the republican party into impeaching mobile in give me a break but according to yah who knew on my sweeping radio overlooking the golf course tat his private club in bedmanster new jersey for a president donna from dine sundae nag with a close political ally marry tailagreen is ha chance for the former president to catch up with the hard right georgia congress woman but over halibut and diet coax greenbrought up an issue of considerable interest to trump the push by house republicans to impeach is likely potent n next year's election i did brief on the strategy i wants he laid out with impeachment brief a greens reading a brief phoned interview drums dinner with green came just two nights beforehouse speaker cove my earthy announce his decision on tuesday to or order the opening of an impeachment angry a just to get the straight the theory here from the pass is that trump talk to empty g who then dictated terms to cave my earthy he yaw that makes perfect sense nailed it that is probably what is going on here but of course he is what jam gaskin who gan was involved in the impeachment of true twice now as claiming that the impeachment is coming from trump ah this is tiresome writ is coming from it is coming from the fact that job bison is a lifelong corrupt politician for decades you know you what ye wouldn't have to worry about impeachment if he had not been a lifelong croup politician for decades deploying his drug addicted book at old prostitute abusing son to go pick up money for the family i mean in understand why this tuft understand it is amazing his gimme reason do you think the white house should have could have handled the hunter did in solo better you know but ism ism not closely watching the white house what ism doing is engaged in the work of oversight committed for seven months we have watched the republicans on the oversaw committing german firmer gat all of the witnesses they want all of the documents they want more than twelve thousand pages if documents and there is no evidence tot any criminality are wrong during by job biding there is ninety one criminal charges against donate trumpright now thirteen criminal charges in cant a congressmen saunters who as just on the show a few moments ago they eve nothing to say about that there no charges against jobigton and they wanton impeach to my that is obviously coming from donate trump down his going from down trump or maybe it is coming from republicans tho look at the fact that you impeachdown trump twice without actually a legging crimes and the turn about is fair play and your president is corrupt andiron coopers using anything trump is behind it oh it is then various trump i do enjoy the spectacle of dona trump is simultaneously a bumbling fool but also he is a forgive belly ingenious manipulating all the strings from behind the scenes see then is reporting that the form present trumps pop day with t has jury concern sharply to phonic about the impeachment stratify is he i mean is is he really the one driving this i do not know whether he is driving it directly or in directly certainly as as he a a participates on comedian talks about this on sociolmedia he is driving the act of is to call members of congress and an getting ball whether he called cave earth to directly or whether you a is just o sort of getting into tho the trips real u ism not sure which way it happen but certainly members of congress are hearing about it oh you mean well you shocker that roam trumpston's and publicly he wants jobitnin teacher the very first day it what else is new well tattle one the reasons the democrats are in a state of outsizes panic about something that is not going to come to fruition by the way again lemme re mind you democrats control the senate joined is not going tore remove from office the reason democrats our fighting mat about this is because by announcing an i preachment inquiry my earthy and the re publicans have successfully put this atop of the news and that's it the do not want thy will not talk about trump then talk about the old news of trumps indictments and all the rest of this kennistuff they do not want talk about jobidon being absolutely corrupt tit is not something they wish to speak about why what because they are fighting the mean they are afraid beyond all reason and all meaner about comely arris that is really one o the things that is happening here it is it is hysterical every columnthat tells job no to run always includes in a denim from these democratic can of advisers that comely also should not run divignacious as we takes about yesterday on the program having mafia sort of column in the washington posting job should not run and all stress and also comely arris which is kind of amazing right because she is supposed to be this wondering this political genius shes suppose o be amazing at this and we just all is understand her but the proven is nobody likes comely arris the reason thou panicking about biding ideas they gouge nobody to back him up who is the person waiting in the wings you dad's avenue him blame tell you running on the record of californium is not likely to win you the presidency or the very least tank on a go amazing californ's been bleeding population clouding my entire family for years under avenues i it is truly an amazing spectacle to watches the democratic party recognized them mean they really do that they must send this madam to wax figure of a human into battle and he is melting but you better you better get him back in the president yo before that you would completely melts because backing him up is comely arris and you can hear the democratic unease nancy policy was asked yesterday about whether comely arris was the best pick for vice president for jobiton she refused three separate times to say yes jam want job did pick but she is lay i rent an thatmila arris the best running major this president he think and that is what matters people should not under estimate but comma has ben to the table an do you think she is the the best running the she is the vice person a to big stay ton kill satin when she doing the the tat i tepiccessis the bi president that is the job discretion you do not do that much you know you you you you are a a force that strath inspiration intellectual rethorist and the grass again she is not saying that should that she should be theruning mi she is saying telling you know i she is great and and job pick nobody is comfortable with coma arris why wellcause she is terrible at us for example she is asked about her reminds on abortions remember the talking point from the democrats including from people sensory former spokes person for the president of the united states the talking point is that they are not for abortion on to man the problem is when asked name a situation in which you would outlaw abortion they cannot name any here is comma garrison faced the nation botching it once again the would what is it that you believe from what week of pregnancy shul abortion access be cut off we at to restore the protections a overs this way which we are not trying to to something new but does it meed to be specific in terms of defining i were that guarantee goes up to and where it does not a which week of pragnancin we an't to put back in place the protections proves this way you here i pain let i sit o because they're not trying it but we are not trying to do anything that did not exist before tune of last year s that be abortion on de man by the way turns not recognize the question was where would you limit abortion and the answer is ism not going answer question because they do not have any limits on abortion she is terrible at this everyday knows she is terrible a best and meanwhile it is a is a to it is a two front war for jobidon in the selection and on the one hand you have got his corruption and its in popularity and on the other hand you have a bad economic situation that is manifesting itself right now according to the waster journal consumer prices rob in august o the fastest paced more than year to would jump an energy cost illustrating the potential obstacles ringing in elation out o the economy without a sharper slowdown the consumer price index a closely watch in elation gage to zero point six per cents in august true the priormonth according to the labordepartment more than half that in crease was due to higher gasoline prices but that does not matter because i mean your till paying for it the monthly car reading likely keeps federal s ore officials on worst to whole in frustrates study at their meeting next week however on an annualized basis prices were up three point seven over all in august first three point two per cents in jury annual cart inflation is still four point three per cents in august these are not good numbers it supposed to be again at to per cent remember every time they say that inflation is slung rocking ice that all of the inflation that already happens not being undone if you say that a a good costs ten per cent more this year than last then you say next month that cost only five per cent more ante month after that three per cent me and the month after that two per cent more of the aggregate all of those for the final price right now people are paying in a boat load more the they were paying for their goods in services just a couple of years ago and that is thanks to jobidon which is why his economic numbers are in the toilet every single pole shows a plurality of america trust trump overriding to handle the economy without a doubt but meanwhile democrats keep sang they they keep trying to make watch happen its not going to happen keep saying by comics over and over and over and you just cutting cam pay commercials for a publicans of this on here is core on pierce sun jesting the bionomics turn the economy around which is quite a shop con siding the economy was already turning around by cut four of twenty twenty why teethe son gan again you heard your get however the o to specifically about the economy speak speak specifically about a major speech to major speed of the presenentent do tumor on by comic ever is talk about by nomad and how you believe has turn a the economy grown an just not from us from the down that we certainly have seen and this is the president has been very clear he wants to see an economy that con that built that is built from the on women about and not the tracer down economy that we thoutom of mental oubrahan publicans want it

evidence that the unions were actually heavily involves in jobiton's first senate election campaign ben shrackinsir rites bast this in his book the widens that basically the day before jobiton's original senatorial election campaign bacon nineteen seventy effectively there is a major that was supposed to go out in all of the newspapers that day and the unions picketed the newspaper to stop the sailor from going out back the a has to people connected with jo this or he is always been boughten paid for by the unions will now he is running into a problem because the u a w is seeking another big pay out from the car companies despite the fact that the u a b did enormous work in the fifty sixties and seventies to completely undermine america car advanced which is we by the cities by the time the eddies everybody was driving tooth the white house is closely monitoring as detritus big automakers and the u a u engaging acrimonious negotiations with the laborers threatening to

the car companies we will get that again join presume will come down on the side of the unions because joining care about the economy does not cabo the car companies he cares about pleasing his union cronies we will then presumably spend a billion dollars in the upcoming election to get him reelected forget all of this bodes ill for jobidon's re elect chances the good news for the democrats is they always have the republicans to fall back on which is exciting exciting stuffs republicans are about to have a a circular firing squad with regard to a possible shut down according to axis house republican to fallen into a state of paralyzed chaos on the second hay back from recess with no obvious exit ramp and a government spending fight of their own creation on the first night of the house speaker election we publish to piece headlining the in governable house grope eight months later the sentiment has never wrung more true the house was forced to cancilevote on wednesday and dancing funding for the pentagon after the freedom of caucus rebelled over spending levels another typically in controversial appropriations bill funding agriculture has been scraped entirely over an internal grope debate about abortion policy my party's announcement of an impeachment inquire appears to a back fired with some republicans trashing it as a distraction copy leadership is now advocating for a short torment continuing resolution to avert a government shut down but if my earthy put to bill on the floor mat gates is bowling to trigger daily votes to use him as speaker agent have a question what is the point of this milk what is seeking to be achieved here i said this with regard to the first threats to to not hand my earthy the speakership unless he handed some concessions to the house conservatives i am fine with that but can we name the points that you actually are advocating fore my earthy can either do them or not instead what we getting it seems is another fight over my earthy with nobody waiting in the wings to pick up the pieces because a hundred ninety republicans say their committed to my earthy no matter what and meanwhile democrats just sitting on the side shorting as what are they care now behind all of this is a real sort of bazar idea logical battle an it is an ideological battle over the value of tactics at all their there is part oftherepublican party the just thinks that tactic do not matter at all that the best way to stratagize in situations in which you do not control the powers to run to erectly at a wall at full speed with your head down and you do it over and over enough the wall will crumble have get see that strategy achieve any sort of real success lasting success it seems more likely the we should do is you should make moves that eventually guarantor full power across all branch of government then you can really make harsh moves but instead which can get internal squabbling mandates goes on mas and be see to bitch about the my earthy it is always a dad give way republicans a appearing on prison be see to do the sort of stuff this is about ternaliments balance question amendment and single such expending bills just you been sad for entire here i am the most investigated man and the entire caress and right there i say even my earth wire a did dog because i have never asked to to interfere it any fits bat i the a e i and big o hate me investigate me for three hears you covered it merely nightly and even you knowledge to then that me the miles held out consistently and the people this relies about me a sitting it a federal present right not because they or part of a criminal scheme not i not the he that has to e keep earthy but suddenly i guess the ideas that if what you you yellow hem carry that he will replace by whom who is waiting the wings you scholars does not want it him him morning an take it a what what a you tong about right no ow meanwhile mccartheis acts engages of keeping up with teeming up wit their swallow to attack his speakership this alight the glow gragggies man again in these sorts of firefights are completely useless but leave its republicans to shoot themselves directly in the foot when facing down the possibility o democrats doing the same i swear watching democrats in the republicans to battle with one another is watching a gun fight in which both gun fighters are pointing their own guns at their own heads and threatening to commit suicide it is it is an amazing thing its tending ten paces the part and the democrats if yo don't mom e what we want man ism a shoot myself right now in the head and republicans don't do not do it it'll shoot myself in the head and i all ta stand you why do not you i understand what why do not neither of you do that that seems that seems stupid i been saying for years of this point first party to sanity winds but the it seems club were not going in that direction any time in the near future and hen meanwhile other big political story of the day is that it money he's now announcing his retirement from the senate of the united states and it money is one of them more peculiar figures in the history of america politics he was a a very very moderate massachusetts republican governor he ran as the conservative in two thousand eight you will recall against john can cam in seconds john can in that nominating battle and he is considered the more conservative candidate against john can largely because of emigration then he ran again in twenty twelve and he won the nomination another he lost the presidency to broch mama in an election that i think actually broke the country because you had an incredibly milk tossed modern republican running against a radical democrat and the radical democrat winds by cobbling together a coalition of the supposedly oppressed against the against the the demographically elderly white majority in all this nonsense anna an he breaks politics permanently does does brokabmama in the united states his to then it money goes to the senate in you taw he moves out because he is a foreman he is elected to senate overwhelmingly and he proceeds to work with democrats on a on a wide variety of issues he is voting record over all is prettyconservative but on some key issues on certain bills for example the infrastructure actins of working with democrats the widespread perception from republicans about it money he's almost the circle it starts from he is a moderate republican not sure how conservative he is but he guess he is got an army his name to he is very he is he is a harsh conservative he is a harsh conservative in two thous name to he is a harsh conservative but he wouldn't really stand up to brokamoma the way that he should probably that is why he lost if he would been only a little bit of harsher to he is contomamoderte republican he can has an army his name but not all that conservative here is it money now icing he is not con run for reelection at the end of another term it'd be in by mid eighties frankly it is time for new generation of leaders there the ones that need to make the decisions that will shape the world they will be living in i we face critical challenges molding national debt climate change and the ambitious authoritarians of russia and china neither president been nor former president trump or leading their party to confront those issues political motivations too often impede the solutions that these challenge is demand the next generation of leaders must take america to the next stage of close leadership were ism that running for reelection on that retiring from the fight it'll be your united states senator unto canary of two thousand twenty five at he then shared in an interview with mckaycop ins his his hatred for all the rest of the republican partan and here is the thing about this kind of stuff we have a peculiar standard in send the republican party for what counts is loyalty on accounts a disloyalty for went money's attacking all the the republicans he sure unique discussed for senators at joshawley and tad crude we said wool put politics above the interest of liberal democracy and the constitution he also when after senator joy valid don't i do not know that i can disrespect some one more than joy dance and and in also that is considered disloyal by lot republicans i hear it i hear it where you directing your fireside the house also i tend to hold that rule about dona trump attacking fellow republicans inside the houseboat it is it is very strange to me that certain types of attacks are considered completely verboten and certain types of attacks depending on who's doing them are considered totally appropriates when donate trump suggest that in some way on to mantis is a my know his sounds but gat that is true and i way that is not true at all and then when people attack it money as eryngo then the same people will be well that is that is appropriate or inappropriate peptic about one standard for whether you attack people inside the caulis or notice when they violate actual conservator principles then you attack him donate trump spent the a spent the day celebrating the muster of it money which is again donate from spends more time celebrating the ouster of republican senators than any democrat that i know he he put out a statement sing fantastic news for america the great state of youtaught in the republican party that money sometimes referred to as pierce detect i we will say the gas rellybony that that was his a his peculiar screenname on lichen all turn of twitter account will not be seeking a second vermin new a senate where he did not serve with distinction a big primary fight against him was in the offing but now that will not be nasterycan grass to all make america grate again now in want ism fine with that homey stepping down and ism find with a lot of people thinking that was not conservative enough in stop i agree with some of those criticism a lot of this criticisms i just wen out the dona from his now celebrated the aster of of people ranging from eff lake to john mine to it money meanly he does this kennel of all the time when you talking about it is bad for romance to attack the republicans in the senate is not great to attack of the republicans in the senate you you you might think o hate time for some things i and then some things that i hate things that i to day i have to say that the the the pagan mentality is taken over court america is truly in astonishing thing there is an ad that was released yesterday by apple in which the effectively call for worship of mother nature i means i pure pagan guys worship nonsense this commercial is him cook and supposedly the rest of the apple board meeting with mother or nature who of course is a a is a black woman and she shows up to express her unease at the progress that corporate america has made in protecting her the environment and i here is how this commercial goes mother nature welcome to apple how here the other good in you the weather was however i wanted it to be let us cut to the chase and twenty twenty you promise to bring apples entire carponfoot print o zero by twenty thirty henry davit the to over here said we have a profound opportunity to build a morse a sample future for the planet we share event her ten o'clock said the sense they all right this in my third worprat responsibility gig to day who wants to disappoint me first well we have got some up tits we are excited to sere with materials status is there materials person yes we are in the process of eliminating all plastic from our pomading by the elemi guess fifty years from now when some one else is left holding the bag by the end of next year actually i cut can i get just point out a super thesis there re few things that incredibly super ofbethis this entire commercial which apparently was unveiled that the apple product launch to demonstrate just tow environmentally friendly they are first all it begins with mother or nature arriving and then they say how is the weather and it gets real dark and mother nature says whatever i wanted to be what are we world about you for ism confused if mother r nature is all that powerful then why is it the we are not seeking to protect ourselves from you and not the other way round which by the way was the story of virtually all of human history until last five minute mother r nature trying kill people and people trying to fig our way not to die it very much the story of all of human survival n civilization still kind of the story of all of human survival and civilization et but immediately it is it immediate contrition then it turns into how can we worship the altar of mother nature well we will not what if we were cycle all of our plaster on use plastic what we were cycle all the aluminum that we use in our phones and this s will were are proving to you what good people we are what amazing amazing people we are do not more about values do not worry about whether what you are doing is good or evil in terms of the product that you produce what c a protections it has for a children how contentactually reaches people sea the phones and computer s you put out or about an taste or you really ought to worry about is mother natures first of all the substitution i me this it is paganism worshipping nature is a form of paganism because the reality's nature do not care about you and if you are making pagan sacrifices to the gods but what your offering up is not rain and meat what you are offering up is instead recycle the aluminum ism not sure what the differences made my favorite part about all o this is the apple board the supposed apple board meeting with mother nature here it is supervrerse you got a black lady an again woman in india woman there is wit the actual apple board looks right now that is the whitest group of people in human history that is a very white group of people there's maybe one person on this entirelist who is not white ism yah they went wont put that in the commercial cs then we just be aboutchtal white people meeting with a black lady and i wouldn't looked nearly as good or or quite as diverse what i about this is it is good when the mass comes off when when corporate america basically says en people them cook while you now my my chief gold is to worship mother natron to use my trying company to do meanwhile it'll produce all of our product in communist china or they completely abuse the environment do not care about anything ye i i i do not believe you but but i appreciate the sentiment ilk a time for some things that i hate are i things that i hate to day samsmith is running out of boundaries to transgression has become boring i the other day samsmith who used to be a talented musician and now has become a parody of himself thyself herself myself put up a tie to dressed up in tell a tubby boots ism i hesitate to show this just because it creepy by i hero t as samsmith o creepy man in a beard wearing get shorts and tell a tubby boots in a teashirt with a small boy on it eating an apple grown man wearing shirt with little boy eating apple on it in short short short gene shorts daisy dukes and tell a tubby boots as he dances to the telletubby music why are you doing all these things involved with children branding if you do not have fit has nothing to do with children ism just wondering tank in it i do not do children activities in the absence of my children bat i do not sit around dressing in tell hubby's outfits or playing with tellatubbies or doing any of those things unless i am you engaging in some sort of play with my small children say smith is a gender variable gay man who is wearing daisy dukes and tell a tubby outfits what is this what is this if results it is hideous but besides it besides being hideous i ism not sure why were noesis to fine that creepy cause i it is spirit is superdupercrepy but entire media have brought into the m have brought into the bazaar creeping nature of our of our gender postgender world which is why presumably mi sense the former vice president this cornily running for president this appearing on scanned and he has a face down a question from a mom who is distraught that her trains daughter would not be able to drop in mi senses america ism this renews nation rather not siphon a fou me to ask these questions after juster what a herd what is your policy plan to protect e ransgencommunity specifically black and brown trains women from thistoricly high level with vile merles e levin say i ism dilly grieved to hear about those treasure circumstance es to and i hear your heart nim dumb by your motion o truly but fin present in united stay soon ism not a see to the protection of every america and the right every america but to whether a that is that is squares with my values o not i a ism a bible believing christian i have e particular view as he m desk matters and the and you have different new of those for out yon but i want to a believe in the you are not a bi believe in the free and so religion i believe in the freedom of conscience i believe one every medical to live to work to worship according on was hearts heres the el pence is answered isn't matter nearly as much as the questions being aired this the actual answer is black and brown transgenders a transgender people are not experiencing historically high levels violence there not ay they the the lie that there is a great slaughter of transgender people going on in the united states is statistically untrue hey would put that aside the actual answer to this is not i i feel your pain i here your heart all f this kind of stuff the actual answer is ism sorry that you are very upside boys are not girls girls are not boys men are not women and women are not men it is not an age dependent argument and you are doing a great disservice to human beings when you tell them a li when you tell human beings that the delusions that they are experiencing are in fact reflected in reality and that it is the job of every one in society to reflect that back at them you are not doing the many favors you are engaging any cruelty it may sound heart but at some point som was can have to say somebut something harsh about all of this if the a medical people cannot take that then maybe the america people deserve what they got honestly if you cannot take basic truth then your your voting for what you receive try is thereat that so continues know you not come to misfit will be joined

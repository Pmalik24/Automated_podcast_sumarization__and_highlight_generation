a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in today's episode of the show if you are fer a beep version you can find that at our weight this america life dot o work hi the america wen just get the selection over with already we have a enough excitement right more than enough pot this president getting coroner of iris rule better ginsburg dying the hopfirst debate the alleged contents of under bisons hard drive with rather totally in convincing or deeply urgently important pending on yo point of view we find i got to see the president's tax records after all these years and bear we see to make a get in anything militia plotting s could not the governor of michigan and then after that the president's followers chanted lock her up the president joking not joking told is suborders in worth caroling to go out and try to not twice and then after that the attorney general declared on seaman to wolf blitzed the voting twice might actually be legal i do not know the law in the particular state a cello twice i do not know what the low in the particular state was on when that not be comes fine any state that was you can not twice well the shul a you can to maybe you can change your rod up to a particular warm i do not know what the a it shall not it at he was turning general willing bar looks mainly relaxed as he says a this calm nothing's out of the ordinary nothing to see her officer watching him it is hard not to think is this really happening i get the same feeling looking at photos the president's rallies where even now his packing people in cons of people with no caffs not following ecdyses god lines hes doing this even after he his wife his son his are secretary his campaign manager the chair of the re publican national committee white house housekeeping in military staff members of the vice president staff stepped miller cell an company and hop his all got coroner of iris even tough cases are an all time high and on the rise looking at the not dial ye distant crowds it's is this really happening and now coming out is coming tuesday rather than have an election with the queer winter or apparently the vote contested the contest election seems possible because the president keep saying over and over his way ahead in the poles and the suppose that we are always saying on the new saying the his way behind those are fate and if he loses he says is only one possible explanation teethe way we can lot n my pinion is e man fraud e apery we runs all over the country you seeing it this s an tour ans a ballet thetas money in downtown here he is an oh posse was cousin be cause the only way what get lose us election as if the election is red to remember that istle only way way git lot u elect and we cannot let that happen here is no evidence for any mass of frolics talking about wen talks about mainland ballast being a problem which he does nearly everywhere is no evidence for that either lots more democrats in the republicans are voting with mail and ballast this year here is the president on sundae in new samphire calling this ballast in to question the other way they sad idiots a ballast we do not know whose sending on we do not know we the going we do not know whose bringing a back we do not know side at it should not be allowed and the democrats no its a how and we should not let it happen the this tuesday he might fight this ballast and we might find ourselves in a big no holds barred season fanatic tested election constitutional national melt down we both sides arguing over whether to count mail and ballast and ballast hat arrive after nonmember third and if the happens people on both sides of pull take to the streets to protest and who knows where that might head and then of course there are the scenarios where the whole thing gets thrown to congress said the supreme court to decide many different ways as could play out where whichever side loses red or blue the probably never be able to see the final decision as fair in legitimates of one half of the country will not accept who the other half puts into office or may that will not happen maybe somebody is going to win decisively that is the we are a world is either about to slip into utter chaos or the sectional go just one and things to be find that is the unreality of now there are many things right now that make it feel the ground underneath us is thin as a cracker with moltonlava underneath many things is hard to understand this is real this is really happening and to day in our programmed if people w trying to get their minds around that have to say that is much on the mood as we had into the stepson's hollowing special of an election day the b you be easy chico says america life on mere glass stay us the one wouldyou to come up to first class the journalist e gene carol has been in the news this week when a federal judge ruled that the president can be sued by carol carol says the back in the nineteen nineties ton we trump raped her in addressing room in the departments store bergderf good men he says she is lying she suing him for defamation she is one of dozens of women who accused the president of sexual assault or harassment the president denies all of their allegations the stories have been widely covered and everybody is used to them at to carol if fellow get this point they were just being ignored it seem con om incredible to her a bergamot day is aby people feeling is this really happening and she definably felt that about this it killed her that these stories just somehow did not seem to matter and the summer she decided try to do something about it head a bunch of conversations with other women who cause the president and publish theme in a series of stories in the aplanatic and her idea was most people only have a vague sense of these stories and do not have much of a sense of what these women say actually happened and by diving into the details of these stories she would restore them to human size in full color she is adopted one of the articles that she wrote for us it is with one of the president's accusers name vesica needs wanting about content before we start this is a frank conversation about sexual assault here is e in carol let me set the sea midsummer twilight and vesica lesanare letting down wit is left of our hair jessicas in her elegant crib in the blue ridge mountains ism in my little shack just off the appellation trail and we are resuming two old screeches discovering how much we have in common which includes our love for mister pal leman our age in our height are you now well i m ism five seven now i was give nine at li i a lost to interest i lost yo atom i do not know where they gone lost om i love being tall when i was working i was always thankful yet mature i was tall about forty years ago when vesica is working as a sails person for a company that sold news friend to publications the washington post she sat down next to down trump on an airplane let me just say that if you've never sued with a silver hair stonily seventy eat year old woman who describes what it is being strapped in a seat on a brannoth airlines with a future president of the united states trying to fasten his lips on her a six foot to sunfish well in m y opinion you have not lived let alone zoomed at all but before we bored that flight a refresher vesica was one of the first women to publicly accused trump of sexual assault in two thousand sixteen it was on the front page of the new york times i knew if the story did get it in e attention that the first thing trunk would say it tat i was not pretty enough you mi i knew i knew instinctively that that is what he was going to say how did vesica now because vesica is an old bat old bats are the best even better than screechelves ism an old bat myself we old bats do not kit ourselves and in fact one day after the new york times published the story about what happen to spica on that plan in nineteen eighty trump yammered about her accusations at a rally oh i was with oral trump in nineteen eighty i was sitting with him on an aroplyn a ye want after me on the pile i ma negwift believe me she would not be my first choice that i can to you do not know that would not be my first yuck i told messiah the same thing happened to me i knew was coming new i knew at a person and he said about me she is not right i it is a running pictures of me when ism seventy five years a right ais not fair it say i cousin e as i looked you and i clock tons of shit because were older wen it for the honor of vesica leads and old bats everywhere vesica is a beauty now and she was a beauty forty years ago when she got on that flight to new york and as she remembers it it was a brand fight brannaph was the she proline else would have been full grain leather her flight attendant would have been clad in arson and her playing it would have been painted in perse screen mercury blue or sparkling burgundy it what were you warn you remember when you got on that en out i had my best suit was was a brown sweet oh i loved that suit and and was jacket and and a skirt it was a fabulous outfit it really was i never world again after that day though i hung on to it for quite a while but i never wort again i know exactly what she means it was the same for me with the dress i had on it bergdorf i did one e thrown wags as a beautiful don i cabin i never sot away at i could not put it on because bad thugs hap yet s exactly o has is manage win mucin come o i you were not tell me what having yet on the play i get on the plan and i had i was sitting in the back and i remember watching the stewardess come walking down the isle and she saw me in sheath said would you to come up to first class we have we have space never occurred to me not to say yes i gathered my my purse and i went up to first class that did happened before ye as having to me you yet i kind of accepted the fact that it was entertainment for the be concise up in first class now i do not understand people understand we tolling about but that is what they did they chose the got he got rest he one put him up in first that is right what were talking about is how things used to be binary ticket but non our best clothes hopping on a cocktail party heading for new york or chico on mime or any easy city essay and this party zip unless somebody very rich or very pretty was present many first class with size up the female passengers before boring and hold a brief conference with a check or alternately a helpful fighter tenant with simply stand in the isle waving people away and rearranging the seeding chart that an extremely tall chap for instance with black hair grease felt could have the spot by me which is what i told vesica had happened on a jumbo jet to fella after the playing took to following the meal the chap shows me a photo of his private plan then he shows me a photo of his roll voice then he shows me his erection it we never cured to me to calling any a anything e wot expecting men to make a pass that i was not surprised i expected it for men i jessicat you and i were born during the second world more o he did not report we expected it and we last ut you know we were wrong we were wrong we should have spoken up ha tan doing now well we we were thankful though a no to have the tacking job get oh absolutely oh my lord the food a tenant escorts vesica to the front of the plan she sits down in the isle seat beside download trump is i recall he introduced himself the man meant nothing to me it would not have this was in nineteen seventy nine nineteen eighty stet vesica was not a native new yorker it within she was not yet aware of all the levels the ranks of spears of new york society of the trump a young rat out of things was chewing his way throughout he was very good look here night you day do you agree well i got a very attraction a into big yet he was very pretty ye i guess i i he was nobly i can remember i do not remember my my reaction i he was perfectly reasonable when i first sat down i ye is blond tall good size man that sort of stock but i i do not remember being overwhelmed by his looks or hes ass you about yourself what did we talk about we talked about him i remember we took off bond they served this wonderful meal and then they they came and they picked up everything and within a short amount of time all of a sudden he is on me a wet blanket he terry kiss you first yes yes she glances away from the screen with he revolted wince e was such a shot it was all of a sudden he is on me vesica is ladylike therefore allow me for i have experience with trump to say in plain english what i believe trump is about to do i believe he will go straight for the crotch just he brags on the access how i would take this man who to day clans that he has never kissed or groped a woman without consent it is it is got for extrahands because he is grabbing my grass he is trying to kiss me ism trying to get his hands off of me and this come of struggle went on for a little while and then it is w an he started to put his hand up my skirt that i got a jolt of of strength and managed to wheel myself out of of the of the see vesica grabs her purse and storms to the back of the plain no a did he make it all thewy t your panties or not now no because you had by that time say to stand up right right was there anybody else but i goth was thither was the guy across the isle whose eyes were about the size of a saucer and i kept thinking a hat why do not you say something or where is where's the stuwardius on this whole thing now why does not somebody come and rescue me and that is when i realize there as only me that was going to rescue me i that is when i a why i you thought of i tut the we some women freeze in this situation yes yes i no you did not freeze no no but i certainly did not say anything i i i did not screen m did not no i laugh did you l o no i do not recall laughing no i i took it seriously i mean i i this this was a real physical attack and not an attack in a skull ye although we talk about trump groping woman most people do not understand how brace an trump really is because no one knows what groping means it is one of the reasons i wanted to talk to the trump accusers who knows what the heck trump is actually doing or on what part of the female body he is doing it why of trumps accusers described for me trump putting his hand up her shirt an on to revolver and she used the plain english it was a squish she said a squeeze and she made him motion with her hand squeezing a rubber duck that is groping why does trump do it vesica and i ponder was try to finger this out the man question is he now he is nothing to be able to have intercourse as you on the plan he knows ten why was he do this why what did he think he was lento gan did it was not sexual thin he you turning him o just such an extend that he could not stand it what was it well i personally i cannot i the i thought he was bore o nothing happening yet is let us let let us let us crab a little pussy here you know s it such in inside to me this is such an insight got it but it it goes along with his holly would take and know it get he has no attention spa no no was he reading it all beforehand no no his paper no who get a fly id nit e at without a tell i mi newspapers a waist exactly an he had nothing to read no i sot he was born that is an insight that i think it really sends it o because some people have claim he does not for power i do not think it has anything to a power well could be i but i i i really kind just chalked it off to he to being bore the trump grabs one woman then he grabs the next woman and the next woman and pretty soon we start thinking rump grain women is normal then trump grain woman becomes normal is born it is old news and there much that he is done but jess an't not old news were the most cure thin we tried to parable we tried to wan america this is who he was and now we seemed toe been forgot were been pushed of been i nor and this drives me crazy this is we we are doing this rejoin e knot between now and the election that is our duty to once again tell america what this man is wife well some people may have forgotten us but who is not forgotten us the men who are voting for trunk because he gotten us because his mot jo because trunk proved he can pal any woman he wants and who else is not forgotten women vesica and i we will never forget how often did you think about this between then and two has not teaching what he came to the for again i probably would not have had it emblaze in my mind if it had not been for the gala and sax to having the gala at axis a this is a year or two after the flight and it is a benefit for the humane society of new york an a few other charities vesica is the assistant to the present of the humane society and

yesterday is as it was really a fabulous a fabulous eating and then trunk with his wife one came up she was pregnant very pretend and he looked at me when i handed him is table assignment and ism looking at him thinking your the rascal from the airplane i remember you the future president of the united states remembers vesica too and he looked at me and he said i remember you you are the junk

before we get to the big news of the day i want t to give you quick up date on the story the we reported earlier this week about d e i in medicine and surgery and many of the tapes that we showed you on this show with regard to duke medical school and people working at do talking about how diversity equity and inclusion should be tot priorities as opposed to the merit of particular surgeons well duke still has not responded to any of this we have still awaiting comment from the dupe medical school dean we do know that some of the tapes were then removed that som the tape that were up and had been put up presumably by an associated student group that those tapes were taken down but we have not heard anything after many request for comment from the leadership of duke members of congress are calling for an investigation into everything that is happening at these medical schools what is happening with regard to surgery and we know this is just the tip of the iceberg by the way the the the prevalence of diversity equity ant inclusion in every aspect of america life including the most critical aspects were the only ting you care about is the competence of the person as opposed to that life experiences or the color of therein we know that we have uncovered just the tip of the iceberg we now have a tip line if you have something we should look into please send it our way a sap put my name in the subject line or gets my teem immediately tips dot daily wire do come we will get our investigated him on that immediately tips dot daily wire do come i gan now on to the big news of the days the big news of the day is that bitch my call has announced that in the fall he is going to step down from his position as g of leader that will be presumably before the election my call announced his decision in the well of the senate and here is what he had to say the she can c t m she is you m a allege to we not recall e an college sushburgearg pogge but what a wage of a to precut college i urge can to belong to late u chop so she re sorted bistro roger a college the shut this will be male char urge republic o beer r say i gas the question of course is who replaces him but the blow back on this has been kind of extraordinary on the right people who are shouting about the evils of mitchmc call now bitch my call is one of the most effective motive eolian political operators of my lifetime i do not a lot of the things that he passed but to pretend the much my call was not in effective operator is just false the reason that there is a six three republican appointed majority on the supreme port of the united states is mitchmc call its not doll trump it is bitch my conallbecause bitch my call is the person we actively said we will not allow merit garland to be appointed to the court and the of course from cot elected is not tor deprived trump of all the credit from gets a lot of the credit but it was bitch my coal who made the decision that he was going to who led open that see until after the election and it was bitch mac call who made the decision that he was going to hold democrats feet to the fire to their of to their own rules it was democrats who in twenty thirteen decided that they were going to use the nuclear option to ram through beroccobama's judicial nominee and it was bitch my call warning them in twenty thirteen if you do this it all come right back around and it'll hit you he was right here is a younger match mac call twenty thirteen majority later primal the primal over and over again that he would not right the rule for the senate at a to than an a to again tat you a other prefer tat you o out of regret tan not e o the ta a you regret any a the a lot terete he bitch my call was incredibly competent at his job and again this this does go to what jobs are in the senate what they are in the house there's been this mistaken assumption that the senate majority leader or the house speaker is the person who sets the republican a agenda that that person is a spokes person for conservatism an that if they do not hold true to conservative principle in every single thing that they do without compromise than they are somehow betraying the cause that is not the job of the house speaker or the senate majority leader that is generally the job of a president meet be the job of the head of the r n we but the the point of the house majority leader or the the housebreaker or the senate majority leader anybody who is ana position to actually count votes that she have several jobs much my calls job that he was very compete at was actually thank to pick people running for the senate because he controlled how money's were dispersed to various senatorial candidates and bitch my call it turns out was much better at it then dona trump was just as a is a point of fact bitch mac call led republicans to a very very sizable senate majority and over the last couple election cycles selection of primary candidates that when against wetmantch my call was recommending did not and well for republicans that was job one of the senate majority leader job two of the sent majority leaders to raise lot of money which bitch my connalldod and job three which is really job one is to decide the rules and procedures by which legislation moves through the senate and pick exactly how that legislation gets made that means counting votes it means back scratching it means ugly politics underside the the seamy side of politics the so that nobody likes to nobody wants to see if you are a popular senate majority leader it is likely because you are bad at the job and meant the general public because popular senate majority leaders are people who do have to make the is not guellian decisions legitimately all the time and that is how the sausage gets made and the sausage getting made is really ugly but you have a joys the sausage get made or it does not get made and the reason that is relevant is because when it comes to replacing much my coal the question becomes who exactly is going to replace him is it going to be somebody who considers himself a philosophical purist iris on o be somebody who wants to make the sausage because the reality is that philosophical purism ends with minority status in the senate of the united states just as it is very likely at this point that philosophical purism in the house make may lead to a republican minority in the house it turns out that america just want the sausage they do not want a see how it gets made there very not interested in the morgue aliomanipulations they just want the thing done and that is true of any job that we delegate power to in our lives it you do not care how the plumber fixes the drain use care that the drain gets fixed and if he comes to you and he is but i am print on a principled matter i am not fixing the drain in this particular i did not hire you to do that i hurryedyou'o fix the drain and when it comes to what the senate is there for we can have arguments we do all day long on the show about what legislation is good should you vote for it should you not but if you neglect the part of the job that is the core of the job counting votes manipulations back scratching the ugly part of politics then why you gan end up with is somebody who says pretty words and does not achieve the things you need them to achieve and then get your party booted from majority status in the senate of the united states purism is a wonderfully easy way of appealing to the public without actually benefiting your party in any serious way long term again that is not to whole people feats to fire the s a job re we are outside of government in the end it is the voters who are going to vote these people in and it is the job of people me to be purists in order to suggest what i think is the principle and then to explain how far our politicians are straying from the principal but it is in fact the job of people bitch mac coal to tried to get the most of the lot that they can and bitch mac call i think over all got a lot of that loaf and again that is with meeting very critical of his stand is on things emigration and the border if bitch mac call is replaced with somebody who is far less interested in making the sausage or who is going to refuse to make the sausage at all in the name of political purism then republicans will burthen up with no power that is the reality you can it of can dislike but that happens to be the reality there are three candidates who largely seen as the possible leaders right now to replace mac cornball one is the senate minority with john then who is from south to coat he is sort of on the the sensor left of the re publican caucus john throne it if you look at for example his heritage action score heritage action score are our sort of a a decent proxy mess for how conservative a member votes for example the the most conservative members of the senate people get very high heritage scores we repeople senatorcrus r center cruse has an eighty nine per sent heritage action score senator ran pal has a ninety six per cent heritage action score however if you look at sudan collins sudan collins has a heritage act ion score of ten per cent be which make sent real that there trying to grad people on that spectrum much my call for what it is worth had a heritage action score about forty three per cent spent kin of half way in the middle of therepublican caucus and the reality is that is not the worst place for the senate majority leader to be because you do have to unify your caucus i no it's an in comfortable political truth that every party is a spectrum of use and that it is the job of the majority leader in the senate and e house speaker actually cobble together that coalition in order to move things that he want moved and get most of the loaf or again you can sit there new nothing my call sat henna dead enter of the republican party positionally speaking say is a forty three per cent heritage action score my call's heritage action score over his lifetime is fifty nine per cent the average sent republican has a heritage action score sixty five per cent he is really dead enter of the republican caucus the people who would theoretically replace him and and this of the problem with with somebody let that's been ranpallis been suggested for example as a possible senate majority leader almost in possible to see how he gets the job also in possible to see how he nobles together a polish now it may be that senator pal says i do not want put make the sausage there is a principal argument for not making the sausage just to ends with republicans and minority's towhead's again i tend to agree with with a lot of that from ranpaul or from senator crews that the job of the senate is not to pass legislation the america public ten to disagree with that overall and the do not tend toe congress is where the sausage does not get made in any case the three candidates whore up for the for the job are senator then senator thorn has a heritage lifetime action score of sixty two per cent again the average sent republican is about sixty five per cents o again he is sort of dead enter of the republican caucus he is being per trade as a wild leftist senator thorn which of course is not true that is because he is at odds with donate trump true took a swipe at him in twenty twenty two suggesting he was going try to primary throne cartoon was not sufficiently support a of him in twenty twenty and didn't go along wit the election stolen kind of stuff in then trump got half hated about it and in thorn one his reelect in a walk there there a lot of people on sort of the right side of therepublican party who do not throne because they think he is to moderate that he follows directly in the path of my coal the thing about thorn is that he does have a lot of training and he worked under maconall for years in how to make the sausage john morass is another possiblicandidate hes significantly older than john thorn he is the senateuope conference share from coming he has a strong relationship with trump he is actual the senate sent is the second senator in america to indorse trump has a heritage lifetime action score of seventy to per cent he is slightly more conservative then the overall republican in the senate from a conservative prospective brass might be your guy a brass seems somebody who knows how the sausage is made and also happens to be more conservative overall then my call and has a worm relationship with trump he seems the obvious pick the cling downside is hes seventy one years old now i understand that in modern america politicstht makes you spring chicken but still he is seven one years old senior john corban has been suggested from texts again he his e not at quite as as much at odds with trump as the john thorn is there is been dis content with corban because corban has supported some of the more by partisan packages in the past has a herbage action timeshare of sixty four per cent again most of the people are pretty close to the senate republican average they the calls for that the the suggestion radiates says all we we want a big victory because my coal stopping to my call's eighty two years old and who is having freezes and we plated it on the show he littlelye freeze up for minutes at a time mean it is kind of amazing when you thing about the fact an ancyplosy's eighty two years old and she said i do not want to be house minority leader any more ism too old and then you have much my coal who is eighty two years clinic i do not want to be he entire get peeliater any more ism too old and then you have jobidon who is ism going just pin he is ben be eighty two years old when he is inaugurated if he wins next canary and he will be starting his second trump which means for more years of that that shows how out a touch is is this likely to be a transformadofe moment for the republican party well depends on who is picked there publican party does have a choice that can pick somebody who is competent at the job of senate majority leader and gets most of the load when re publicans have majority and makes smart decisions and does the job and again the job is not to be a person who just says things is to actually get things done pick good senate candidates that means picking purple candidates and purple states by the way which gan does not please the base all the time or he con pick somebody who's a purist get's very little done and you went up into minority those of the choices before publicans om interesting see which way it republicans go say all of this is sort of fascinating with he back top of trump one of the things that is been happening with regard to the senate race to replace my call is that trump has been in voted a lot and what you see from people's all ism ere glad we got rid of my call because now we can put somebody who is more grumpy in place and one of the big mysteries about dona trump is what is more grumpy what does that what is tat even mean the is been a question about dona trumpsince twenty fifteen what does it mean to be more grumpy have always suggested that terror sort of two sides of trump that we have to assess and we eve to assess them separately because they actually do not quarrel one is rhetorical trump and one is policy trump and what you see with rat policy trump is a bunch of people who tried to craft a trump is around what is actually just a set of political i pulses by trump that a generally moderated by his staff what you saw is fort out house the isolationists claim that trump is an isolationist he is not there is not much to suggest in his actual policy record that he is an isolationist for example there people who suggest the doll trump is superficially conservative there is nothing in his polish record to suggest the dona trump is super socially conservative and when people say we got rid o my call that that fuck moderate and now ore going to go more trump single say but what are be talking about in drums of policy what is i rhetorical trump the different he mac call and trump is much more oratorical than it is policy oriented and this is troupe for trump and lmidnerally everybody else trumps rhetoric is completely out of the box he is a stand up comedian who ran for the presidency and one and he is great at it carmine's hilarious he is entertaining ay all those things are true rhetorical trump is not policy trump which is actually one of the reasons folks why donate trump has a really good shot of winning reelect why because if you look at were donate trump is positionally if you put aside the rhetoric if he outside the crazy if you look at where donate trump is positionally he is significantly closer to the middle of america politic than jobidon is if america politics traditionally speaking has been run to the extremes during the primary run to the center during the general donate trump almost perfectly fulfils that incept he actually has not been running to the right in the primary he is ran as himself because he has much fat among the republican electorate that he is been able to say heretical things that no other candidate would be able to get away with going in to the general as jobidon moves to his extreme left in the been sighted at tent to garner the love if his radical bases to we talked about yesterday he is abandoning the middle of the playing field n the reality is then terms of policy aside from borterpolicy which the major distinction donate trump and mite my coal look very very similar and in fact there areas where dona trump is to the left of metric call particularly on prolifissues the reason that matters is if you are looking electorally the reason again donate trump has a very good shot of winning a reelect is because he does not follow the re publican party orthodoxy one of the great ironies s the people who are for claiming we need in cut pure one hundred per cent grad a trump and what they mean by that is that we want to go full pool life full con full isolationist that is not actually what he does what he actually is is the moderate in this race of the dirty secret dirty secret is when it comes to independence donate trump is much closer positionally to independence then jobidon is an it is all affect much of this is affect is that donate trump is very militant in his affect ben trumps of where he is on the positions that dude is a middle of the road to publican on is my middle of the road out ti than on policy again leaving aside the border where he is quite conservative donate trump in many ways is closer to sudan collins than he is to ranpaul and that is not a rip on him that's just an observation about reality it is one of the reasons again why i think that as a general elect candidate he is a during much stronger than i think people thought he would if it ls put this way if he had on to sans his position and his own and his own disposition if sheet if he mutant rontosantis on a portion right pro life all the way to birth and and from inception if he mirrored that position and he had the affect he would not be a viable general elect candidate but he does not right now one to go through the positions of donate trump because are on to show you is that because jobidon abandon the middle donate trump is about to seize it is it the biggest story in presidential politics that no one is covering is that positionally speaking jobidon abandoning in dependence has led to a huge saw the people in middletakel look a dona trump by the way you can see this happening broadly it in sort of in sort of more celebrity circles a bunch of people who certainly are not on the right suddenly takin a second look at trump and going it'd vote for that key it job roger is not a right winger jo roger we will likely vote for donate trump over jobidon that is just a reality i know job that is that is very likely to happen and thing he said at publicly you on musk we will vote for trump over jobidon you on musk is not a right winger i know ye on moskoheh the this is true for a huge swath of people who consider themselves moderate left and coupon once treated out this very famous me of the political spectrum and what it shows is that the person on the basically is it n ex it is an ex access and originally the ex acids shows person on the right here another person left here another person theminale here and then it shows the person on the left moving way the hell out here which means that the person themiddle is now closer to the person on the right relatively speaking cay that is what is happened in america politics donate trump's positions right now are almost identical with the positions o big canton in nineteen ninety two donate trump ironically looks more a new deal democrat circus nineteen forty then jobidon does join looks a jokester who goes to colombia it is amazing a case let us go through some of these numbers i took a look at the latest hazard herispoll which examined what were the biggest issues that america think are facing them the number on issue is inflation jobidon is under water by eighteen points on inflation has thirty seven percent ta royal in fifty five per cent disapproval and there is a reason for that that is because cordon's position on inflation has been ism going to spend more money and more money and more money and do not work about the inflation it is fine and dona trump's position has been you should not spend that much money it is bad to spend that much money and you should not inflate the currency for example sure was jobidon this is early on in his administration the is jury of twenty twenty one saying that inflation is transitory welsh thaws a economy has temporary a sues from prison reasons some folks of rs work that this could be a sign of persistent elation the fest on our view or experts poly the that is shows that most of the pricing crises we an are were expected and expected to be temporary reality as you cannot flip for global a economic light can not expect just to happen that was jobidon's perfect found inflation is that sound close to middle o you or does dona trump sound closer tote middle's is from remember of last were under my laudation inflation wish not existent we had glassily that one dollar and eighty seven ears bionic e coed dynamics from hell the average monthly mortgage payment is on from one thousand seven hundred forty six dollars under my administration to three thousand three hundred thirty two dollars to day but you cannot get the money it does not matter does it matter again what he saying here is quite moderate it is particular moderate because his i will not create mass inflation also ism nock uncut you entitlements o trump has taken the moderate position on entitlements is closer the middle there jobidon or dona trump take him migration jobidon is currently twenty three points under water on immigration thirty four percents approval fifty seven per cent disapproval an twelve present of america say this is their tissue by the way making it the third biggest issue after the economy and inflation and those are can the same issue here is alahondra mayor's february element saying that the by administration bears no responsibility for the border in its all republican's fault dos he a moderate position to you or s seem a very left wing position to you no doubt there is gridlock on congress but do you bear responsibility for what has happening at the border what the president himself has called a crisis it certainly is a crisis and well we do not bear responsibility for a broken system in war doing a tremendous amount within that broken system but fundamentally fundamentally congress is the only one who con fits it no one believe that no one believe that that is a very left wing position and by the way the left wing position on emigration is being articulated all the time obey soon comes to presidential politics what happens with other politicians impacts how people think of the presidential candidate and you never random sent candidate i missouri a fact toe presidential election pang on what he says yesterday the mayor of then georgia was asked about the murder of a young woman at the university of georgia campus in then and instead of blaming the open border because an legal immigrant kill this woman the mayor of then tried to blame trump this is not going to hunt hell twenty nineteen was not that long ago you might remember the dynamic we are living in in the late teens in this country where you had president of the united states speaking in the mes vile terms about people who are foreign born and you had that new tan ma tass a si in place as shares that is insane so that it is charlottes will was responsible for any legal immigrant killing in america woman no but people probably perceive that to be the position of the democratic party is that seem more moderate or this trumps more moderate this canary of this year talking about the open border i victory cannot come soon enough under crooked jo bin country is my a country is my a borders open giving it is i gist won letting drugs five an millions of five millions of a lira aliens for in to our country we've never seen before nothing this has ever happened to our country before left this perceive this as extreme rhetoric because a gain of trump t affect he is much closer to the medium position and migration than jobidon is or san jobs in the economy join to prove on troops in the economies five points underwater forty three per cent of prove forty eight per cent disapprove all aboctober twenty twenty three galloped poll they found fifty four percent of america believe the government is trying to do too many things that should be left to individuals an business is just forty three per cent believe the government should do more to solve our country's problems which means donna trump is closer to the medium voter than jobidon is which will would play two clippers one is of jobidon counting bi comics and one is of dona trump talking about by comics which one sounds closer to the medium here i can't off wit the vermin change the economic direction this country to go from trickle don a economics turd every one all the vernal financial five began to call i comic in come up with ta day i really did i now claim but there the ones es first but i think its a plan do happy to call genomics a a i noma of work genomic is about the future genomic is for thewy sane restore the america dree it is e work before traded what wee always work best at invested in america invested america be use when we investing our people restrengthen the little class receive the economy girl a verifies all merit that is the america o get does annual late here is dona trump ripping in to by comic and which one sounds more a media voter here during this holiday season families all acres america struggling under the brutal weight of bi comic yet by comic seeds about of bet the exist here alone the typical america family is seven thousand five hundred dollars former because crooked job lobules blunders and greedy betrayals have really heard us badly to day a two thousand dollar monthly mora shaman gets you a house worth less than two hundred ninety five thousand dollars under the trump administration the same number would get you a house that today would be worth four hundred an sixty thousand dollars that is a big different as long's crooked who bides in the white house the america dream instead instead you do not hear about the america dreaming we a people want to survive again which one towns closer the midday about climate change corn pew research from august twenty twenty three only thirty one per cents of america are interest in facing out fossil fuels that is the stated position of the bi administration they took a thirty one per cent e position every sin glue issue jobidon and his team have decided to take he thirty per cent position which is insane that is insane politics here remember twenty twenty three john carry card a a ran in saying that we have to face out fossil fields good luck with that did now remember what i just said the science says we have to reduce the missions does not prescribe some particular discipline that has to be don sis reduce mission we bell that that means such you god a reduce the admissions and you actually going to hit the target o that is er of twenty fifty you have to do some this again ears no other way to get to that target we a said very clearly that you got to have the a largely largely trace out of fossilizes a unity systems by twenty fifty jokes ting i cabin capture tacnoleties on the hardest to a take sectors like stealing semen been en concern for now it is good to be a mine folks of things that get us to success here thirty one present of america agree john carrying one office out fossil fields meanwhile donned trump ganurary went in force you no what were on a drill born america a cheap ass it turns out we had come together wee going to oil say be oil right away even gan that is the mother position habit national security jordan six points under water forty two o forty eight now the left will suggests the reason that joins under waters cause he not left wing enough that is actually not true the reason that jobidnis under water is because he has a vagrant concept of had forge policy ought to work he speaks in platitudes with no actual and points and then he commits america resources to those platitudes for example youemember october twenty twenty three hoiden made a speech about it was most be about israel which ha just been hit with the worst tear attack in its existence and instead he decides to link tat together with you crane and then talk about democracy more broadly being at for when you start to talk platitudes in form policy you get yourself into trouble real fast it turns out the america people there not real fond of the platitudesyou know they they winning and they not being bother that is what america mostly they when our allies win and when they are not bothered these are the things that america jobidon does not understand that to he bothers than and does not win a the all on hisroecos nearly twenty ones of war tragedy in reality inflicted on the people of you trade people that ere very badly her since could launches all out in nation wee not forgotten the mass grades the body's found bearing signed of torture great music a weapon by the ruffians and thousansand thousands y craning children forcibly taken into rushes stolen trouble their parents it sick a moan put represent different trace ut they share this in common they both want to completely you water neighboring to morris completely a pirated meanwhile here is down trump ripping on jobidons foreign policy and saying none of this would happen if you actually had a clear and coherent foreign policy which is do not screwing america or our allies who will bust you in the mouth and then we will win and then we will be left alone here is dona trump again this is much more a in to how most america feel thou form policy october twenty twenty three making america great again will begin with making camera a strong again and making agaric is say again under my leadership the world was peaceful and come because america was respected the president was respected i dealt with the strongest people in the world they was smart they was street was they respected me i respect them they had differed view points at sickly try but they were afraid of america today they left at our country they laugh with crooked jo bison you have chaos bloodshed war term death wok what is happening to a because they occupant of the white house is a laughing stud all over the world amerces enemies can not believe how lucky they got they got real lucky every months her villain dictator test and their plenty of a i know must of a i got to know a lot of a all over the planet the having a feel they because they know they will never have it better they they do with crooked jo who in many cases receive money from this countries i wonder what that we aba he is not wrong he is not wrong that topmost america think about form policy america foreign policy is a weird make of we will eonian idealism ans from classical lady rob vote speak softly and carry a big stick real polity an america ten to the latter more than the former in this area and the they should in a second on gets you more of be fact it is just a fact that in this race dona trump is the moderate and jobidon is the extremest it's that momentarily first forget getting an extra day the daily ware celebrating it leaped ay with an extra year of daily war plus to day only when you buy a dailyware plus annual membership you get

through all of them jobidon is on the left dona trumps in the center he is not on the right that is because the left went crazy on education jobidon has an approval rating that is plus too but that is because he is forty three forty one at is a very low approval rating on education for democrats typically the way that you gauge educational approval is how much money willing us men join spend allot of money on the stuff the or problem is he is also a jokester for example here was jobidon talking about the evil book bands in the state of florid those book bans by the way most america understand our things gender queer being left in school libraries for eight year old to find and look at the porn inside jobidont defending the sort of stop is not a good look in the educational sphere we cannot fully prevent people from been raticaise to hat is but we must we must a does there matiest exploration of the in the cremoblize vermis that is can hard conexpen memanication wifirstomam we a not to do that is why should a contrasfirstever nationalization an concern dimestiterson an i sign landmarcate rim irisation of we pave a past we have to continue to actor now's the time for all for o prom when hires being a are books er been man even think we have is compricatiostidiversitys been attack as i said we we one of most the first contrast his to the world diversity a street of our nisi acorns on of our democracy and most people see right through that platitude what they see is jobidon backing critical race theory and gender theory in the classroom which is who went own from size and made twenty twenty three that is went cut funds for schools teaching we arty most america agree with us this is a middle of the road position contrary to what the lugs to me to tell you this a middle of the road position no one wants there kids going to school where they learn that they are inferior because they are white for example that they bear his stoic guilt because of their race t school that is i h grratheor what meanwhile by the way on crime again this a major issue for most america jobidon has inprovalratig of thirty seven per cent fifty per cent to secret we because jobidons perspective on crime has been deeply imbedded in this critical race theory equity nonsense the idea being that if a disproportionate number of black people and up in prison for crime that is not beau it dis proportion number black are committing crimes is because the system is systemically races which means you have to crack down on police departments for their supposedly systemic racism here was jobidon right off the bat canary twenty twenty one signing an order on racial equity to fight systemic racism an the simple truth is our soul be troubled as long as the steric racism as allowed to persist we cannot eliminates not to be overnight we can eliminated the but is corps this destruct and it is costly it cost every america not just to felt the sting of rica injustice were not just lessen were not is an nation a borrowing deprive because of sustenigration we are also less prosperous we are us successful less secure the must change and most going to take then but i know we can do it an ire firmly believe the nation is ready to change but government has to change as well wee ton make equity injustice part of what we do every day to day to borrowing annular if that this this nonsense these speaking right here comes up directly against the fact that people want criminals in prison now true nonmember twenty twenty three saying here is wet do we should execute druggealars now the legs yo mere all my got that is terrible how could he say such a thing you would almost america are totally find with axicun and regulars why there a hundred thousand people a year in this country are dying of dentinal overdoses and a lot of that is because the sentinel is poison were we are making ut i in episode of divided states o biding on this right now an that the fact is the matter is that many of the people are dying o final overtop is are not buying sentinel and then injecting it into themselves they are buying other drugs at a all pills theatre least with sentinel when true says give dealers death penalty ism on board here as trump nonmember twenty twenty three when i to the peoples smart the pressoisis he said he was sport ism suppose to say that not intelligent people presidentciaiti controls one point for been people with an iron hand no a yon ate e de get penalty for the drug dealers that the i you want to yo do prop aft the institute of meaning for the penalty for drug i not wrong on abortion i all the positions that we have discuss a far ones that then most main stream conserves agree with and they happen to be moderate positions on abortion dona trump disagrees with main stream conservatives on abortion and yet he bible get away with it this the best example donate true being the guy who seizing themiddle ground jobidon actually believe or not on abortion has an approval rating that is five per cent under water thirty eight to forty three what the pole say about what america are fined with in terms of abortion restrictions forty eight per cent a plurality of america support i sixteen week band on abortion which by the ways superstate an most utopian countries are twelve weeks but a sixteen week band n abortion only thirty six per cent our pop to a he is legislation they mud band abortion sixteen weeks and beyond that happens to be the position that dona trump is currently exploring meanwhile hoiden has taken the position abortion until birth funded by taxpayers in twenty nineteen you will recall the jobidin reversed himself he ad spend his entire career saying taxpayers should not have to fund abortion because you do not agree with somebody else saying in abortion what he paying for it then in twenty nineteen under pressure from his left long he denounced the high amendment we now see company republican give do i no care o millions of the most forest e most vendible america by refuse even medicatexpation i can justify begin mills of we without access of the purity e in the ability to constito exercise their constitutionally protected it if i believe how care as right as i do i can no longer supported ameer the makes that right dependent on soon tax pay funded abortion up until birth he is the democratic party position under hoiden meanwhile the actual donate proposition on abortion does not match with my own you will recall that in september twenty twenty three dona trump ripped into governor rondisante and flood for six week abortion band he has taking the absolutely milk tost middle of the road position on abortion people principe nickel hailed for being middle of the road on abortion trump is just as middle of the road on comes to public policy here he was in twenty twenty three ripping on an actual abortion ban on heptane florid if a general ban landed on your desk if you were reelected would you sign it at fifteen you doing about a complete ban a ban at fifty wealth people people are starting to thin of fifteen weeks that seems to be a number the people are talking about right dow you find at at i would i would sit down with both sides and i negotiate something and will end up with piece in that issue for the first time in fifty two years ism not on to say a wood or a wouldn't i mean to sank is would ins willing to sine a five week an six week bens support that you hin that if what he one is a terrible thing in a terrible mistake but we will come up with a number but at the same time democrats will not be able to go out in six months seven months eight months at allowing a torsion again how do you demonize that position as radically right wine trump is actually taking one of the democrats most potent issues in the after m f the repeal of reverses wide or the over turning of rover's weight he seftsuhe takin off the table for them because he is a moderate on the issue on foreign policy by the way i know there a lot of people who are big trump fans who think that he wants to cut off a u ran he has never said that he is never actually articulated that what he as said is that in fact he is action said the posit he say he would increase ad you crane sufficient to pressure potent to come to the table and make a deal the ifferecseen him in bid is that he wants pouted to make a deal where is biding his provided no offal in you crane and again that is the middle of the road position according to polling data is from hazard arris twenty five per cent of america favor increasing military aid to u crane twenty eight per cent favor decreasing military aid twenty nine per cent favor maintaining military aid the real question is whether you consider more military a u crane maintaining military aid or increasing military aid but fifty three per cent of america our favorable onto is supposed to twenty two percent unfavorable now again many o the peoplewho are trying to craft a in a sort of isolation is to trumps ire ignoring his actual positions that he is taken on these issues when donate trump says that he wants members of native to pay their fairshare he is not calling for the dissolution of dato in many ways hes going for dato to be strengthened i know that every attempting to misread his joke about ism it invite everybody to hinvadnatve countries of the tit that is a presser tactic folks does actual mean that he is long to tell russia to go invade moldova it when when when jobidon says again big words bat u crane people do not believe him here was join in tune twenty twenty three sand will stay as long's it takes most america are not intuawll stay as long's it takes because he does not mean anything and we know that they are lying i commit meets to crane long term security long term security toter future fraction after this wore ans is is a got and we are advancing this got by providing and the support the crane needs now on the battle field and helping tan strengthen that the military over the long turn the fact that the matter is that i believe we will have the funny necessary to support your ran as long as it takes and i believe that a were that that support will be real even thou the you hear some voices to day i apostle hill about whether not we should continue to support your crane and for how long we she sport the fact the matter is i asked people picture what would happen if we were not supporting you crane do we think russia would stop in been do you think that is all the would be happen i think not i think of ask majority of my collins even a critics i think that would not be the case s or it trumstakes that thisapplatitudes and empty words and unclear policy here is trump this is last week folks is is not two years ago here is now trump last week talking about you crane and sounding feral we conservative on crane patent is not a fain of mine actually you remember when they is to a all true you though they had a body language perseden seen affect is and they had been cutin together and they said to the expert hell who is the dominant force and the experts wait as have analyzed that at sped a lout of time doing it and i do not think it git alike the answer but president chump is the dominant force said that at aka try i don't to not er we not walk one in but i got along god with him but he does tit one to have me he once see bison because he is going to be given everything he wants including you crane that is a gift he is got a gift he is go to have his dream of getting new crane because of bison the whole thing is just crazy baton has given him the only president in the last five that hasn't given russia anything is a president known is dona ja trump that i do not have to go over the list but bison lions er to give em you train the ways looking to me its turbo oke that is trump outflanking bison from the right on you train that i being more hawkish than bison on you crane on comes to israel same ordeal job bison right now is taking you minority position on is dona harass the vastmetorey of america a eighty to percent of america support israel for hams in fact according to latest hazard herispole sixty seven per cent of america believe that here should only be a sense fire between israel and harass after the release of the hostages and harasses remove from power bison is taking the position there should be an unconditional seas fire or at least that is what he is pushing right now and bison is retiring israel that is not the main stream moderate middle of the proposition in the united states it is not thank god is a good country hate here is here's it jo bison saying this this weekend that israel is risking its on legitimacy this is not the middle of the rob america do not agree with us you believe may be there is a future for a two state solution but fora sitting it does see the does not seem to be the appetite for that right now you see what is because again we see this horrible every day we see this horrible images out of gaze and is there a path for it is they safe future for the people who live there there is a path for with difficulty there is the path ford look first of all there are the hostages being hell must be released and that we got up any o principal agreement the be a cease fire while that takes place romadant's coming up in as man an agreement by these reality that they would not engage in activities during roman as well in order to give us time to get all the hostages you that gives us time to begin to move in directions that a lot of our countries of prepared to movement but but it is a process and look israel has had the overwhelming support of vast majority nations if it keeps us up without this incredibly conservative government they have and ben gave another most have known every major for policy leader in israel since go to ma hear there going to lose support from around the world and that is not an means wrong on merits but this also happens to be a wild left winged deerborn michigan position that is not the middle of the proposition in the united states what sounds more reasonable donate trump saying that you will strip student visas from foreigners who come here and hate news that seems a prepayment whin most america and of agreement that we do not want foreigners here who do not news is a pretty it is should that be controversial i be shocked if it is here is dona true under the trump administration we will revoke the student vises of radical anti america an anta somatic far at our colleges san eerisan we will send them straight back home that go back home enjoy your life that is the middle of opposition get all of this is you say that the only argument the the bide administration the bine campaign have left is the dona trumps a bad orangutan that is at they do not have any positional strengths they do not even on the traditional democratic strengths abortion which has benefited them since the overturning of rover's weight donate trump has taken the bat out of their hands because he is middle of the road on that issue every other issue the democrats to moved far the left that donate trump owns the middle of the playing field which mean that donate trump strategy at this point should just be to say that over and over and over if he focuses in on his positions and jobidons failures he is going to be the president ironically not because trumpisim income wild extreme ago forth but because donate trump himself politically positionally is a middle to left republican that is the reality he wants to maintain in settlements he want to sixteen week abortion ban he is someone interventionist on foreign policy may all these positions are the mains from america positions which means that positionally join has boxed himself right out and there is another problem for jobidon too the other problem for hoiden is that people proceed join is corrupt that same hazard derris caps poll shows fifty per cent of america thinks jo bison benefited from hunter bisons caravan things around the worlds pick up

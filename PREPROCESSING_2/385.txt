welcome to the superman lad guest series where i and an expert guest i gust science an science ace too ring and your supermen and om our professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day march the second episode in the six episode series with doctor and gain a professor of connesiology at castrate university fullerton and one of the foremost world's experts on the science and applications of methods to increase strength hypertrophy and endurance to day's episode is all about how to increase strength speed and hypertrophy of muscles professor doctor and gain gray to be back last episode you told us about the nine specific adaptations that exercise can endure everything from strength and hypertrophy to endurance muscular endurance on and forth and you give us this incredible tool kit of fit tests for each of those adaptation that people can assess them for themselves and then of course improve on each and every one of them if they choose by the way people can access that information simply going to the first episode in this series with you and it is all there in time stamped and i how the recommend people do that to day we are talking about strength and hypertrophy and right out the gate at is one to ask you why should people think about and train for strength and hypertrophy and that question is of course directed towards those that are trying to get stronger and grow bigger muscles but i know that many people out there perhaps have not thought about the benefits of strength and hypertrophy training and how beneficial it can be noxious for people that when i get bigger beeps et camera but that have other goals longevity goals and health goals unrelated to what most people associate with hypertrophy what are the benefits of training for strength and hypertrophy for the everyday person for the athlete for the recreational exerciser and on there is a wonderful saying i think is billbarmin the founder one the founders wacky and he owns that if you have a body or athlete and and i think that is very important for people to understand because one the major to services we have done this field is convinced people that things strength training are for athletes or for growing bigger muscles and carry vascular training are for things fat loss and hart health and that is a tremendous to service because it puts a lot of unnecessary barriers and leads to a lot of false assumptions and therefore poor actions a class examples of this are people who are resistant to strength training because they do not want to put on too much muscle people who only perform one type of exercise because they want a fat loss or they are in it for longjevy and health and they do not world than at worried about being in athlete it is a right out the gates we can act to draw back little bit to what we are are previous conversation when i walk through through the history f of exist science and the reason i did that is to help you understand the are the rail roads that you are running down and you do not even realize it an terms of every one thinks of strength training and they immediately default to or principles to optimize muscle growth and that is not the only adaptation one should be after with strength training when we think of endurance training we immediately default to things again party of ascot health or fat loser things that what i really want to do across this entire a series in conversations is to to just break that immediately talk about all the other things that you can do with your with your training and that people can be comfortable and confident in doing an optimal training program for whatever got they have whether that be specific growing muscle or non specific just feeling better having more energy being more prepared for life an and longjevyn and to directly answer your question i could really we could do a hundred episodes on the benefits of exercise and we can run all the way from mood and folios cognitive tasks to a better amen function you will get less colds you will be you will fight them off more effectively to mortality rights some of the strongest predictors of how long and how well you ill live are exercise however there are independent benefits that come from just under and straining and there independent benefits that come from strength train and u just give you one categorically the way to you want think about this is resistance exercise and strength training is the number one tool to combat near muscular aging you cannot get that through any other form of exercise besides heavy overload strength train and we an we can walk through in detail at that is but that is reason umber one in general human movement is is the function of number one some sort of narrow muscular activation nerves have to turn on the second part is muscles have to contract and the third part is those muscles have to move alone a if you want to be alive and you want to live by yourself you have to beagle to engage in human movement if you have any dysfunction in the narrow muscular system there than you are not can real to do that and again as i mention the only way to preserve that or fight that loss of aging it is to strength drain people will tend to hear numbers you lose about one per cent of muscle size per year after age about forty and that is true however what they do not realize is you lose about two to four per cent of your strength per year the loss of strength is almost double that the loss of muscle mascwoif aging muscle power is more eight to ten per cent per year and we can very clearly see the problem you are going to have with aging is not going to be preservation o muscle although that is incredibly important it is going to be very specifically preservation of muscle power and staring and why that really matters is your ability to again stand up an move your ability to catch yourself from a full your ability to feel confident doing a movement that is the function of muscle power more than it is muscle size and fun nationality is really what we want to be right you want to be able to do whatever you want to be due physically and feel confident in doing that as you ate that is going to only be obtained through strength training is it appropriate to say that training for strength and hypertrophy is also a way to keep your nervous system healthy and young y absolutely it is the only exercises weren't we have or that i if you look at just basic numbers motor units you can to see that older individuals have a thirty to forty per cent reduction total motor units when you say older approximately what ages are your referring to cause i know many people out there such as myself are forty and older but i know many of our listeners are in the twenties may been in their teens and i can imagine that people that start doing strength and hypertrophy training younger will afford themselves in advantage over time but that everybody should be doing strength and hypertrophy training for as much of their life span as possible that is really the message that ism getting i if somebody is for instance forty five would that fall into the ben of older your in a start seeing detriments pass again around that age of forty or another is a lot of genetic variation there and a lot of other things going to that equation your sleep and your nutrition but that is a fair number o sort of think about one actually responses it is actually sort of counteract of the wonderful thing about strength training is you do not actually half to start at a young age you can actually in fact i was reading a paper this morning because of our previous conversation it was in over age ninety these are folks ninety plus and they saw improvements thirty o hundred and seventy per cent in things muscle size and hypertrophy over a very short period time i think it was twelve weeks you do not actually half to start there are some adaptations that you are conned for health that you you really need to starting your twenties the reason i to mention that is because if you are lessening you are fifty and you oh i i have not been strength training you are not tost you should absolutely start now but you you gan to be able to get to a a fantastic spot very quickly similarly to if you are twenty or twenty five and thirty you are not lifting there are still many reasons why you should do that now and o i it'd to point that out because a lot of folks would be all my god they said i have to do it when ism twenty or twenty five or an o it'll be to screw and that is not the case at all there is really no age limit on this in factory's actually interesting day that just came out showing ism did this reduction in muscle strength and ipertropy that is for talked about is basely ameliorated with a preservation of activity in other words you do not lose these functionalities because of aging you lose these because of a loss of training to state that again you do not lose these because of some innate physiological thing that happens with genes become less sensitive you lose functionality used pretty much can describe the loss of function of strength and muscle in aging is exclusively because of a loss of training an nutrition an an anabolic resistance in some other things you can do a lot more than you think ism when it comes to maintaining high quality muscle and that is really important to point out ism reminded of the words of the great sharrington he won the boatbill prize your physiologists i guess the near scientist trying claim him as a serow scientist because he worked on the nervous system the physiologist claim as of as ha physiologist he is want hundred percent of physiology i would call m neuron scientists may be wank can argue about this later a we well glad i think one of the key things that sherrington pointed out was that i do not believe they quote was that movement is the final common path and what he was referring to as ta fact that i significant fraction of the brain itself is devoted to our ability to move and our ability to engage in resistance tight movements and that resistance tight movements and the continuation of movement throughout the life span is what keeps the brain young and healthy and vital and there are some much data now to support that but id grateful that you brought up early this fact that there is a negro muscular length as i think a lot of people think about must skeleton they forget that the nervous system is really in charge of the on strength of of the muscle contractions and the types of muscle contractions that occur ism certain we are gig to get into that in a lot of debt to day ore look close there were not totally right but work close o we well i i look forward to be corrected yet and to achieving the precision that you are known for around that discussion if we are to step act and say strength training and hyporoturopy training is critical for people of all ages yet for developing and maintaining the near muscular system and for our ability to function in the world yet not just off said injury but the ably o pick things up and move et camera what are some of the other things that strength and hypertrophy training ism can provide i know a lot of people use strength and hyper tore training for changing their esthetics yet what is your sense about its potency for changing esthetics as compared to say party vascular exercise yet the the mantra i always is the reason you want exercises threefold right you want a look good fill god plague that that is really that comes from sport ism comes from football specifically we away said hatband what that means really is you want ta look good people want to look the way they want to look whatever that means to them and there are any versions of what you feel to be aesthetically pleasing and that is tolly a relevant but people want to look the way on look ism number too you want to be able to feel good what is that mean you want to be injury free you want o energy throughout the day you want to bill to execute anything you want to that you want t go serf in the morning you want up a rack o ball you want a high or you want to do all three of those in one day you should have the ability to do that i then you want a plague which means you so bill to execute ism any gan activities that you want execution of the means backing on what is i got in through question ism one of the major benefits of straight training is the responses tend to hap an extremely fast you can see noticeable changes and musclesise certainly within a month i absolutely within six weeks and we have this wonderful feed backup that sort of tells you am i doing the sing correctly oh my got yes i am also its very addicting the feed back the response the physical changes whether this is actually point two or three look good a flood flagon or it is even just part one you are starting to see that when you compare that the things fat loss that journey tends to be longer it is more difficult it is more relying upon other factors nutrition et camera strong training is really about there is some very mental ynutrician requirements outside of that it comes out of the training and the feed back is immediate that is powerful because if you look across the literature on exercise adherents you will see that that is in fact the number one predictor of affect in this of any training program what that means is if you were to put any variable possible and frigate what is going to determine whether not this program works this is what we typically call the methods are many in the concepts are few the methods of exercise the methods of strength training the met of the methods of hyperatry training which will talk about or art infinite however there are only a handful of key concepts that you have to achieve in or fer that program to work adherents is one of them and again is often the top one you need to do something you need to do something consistently when you are getting that feed back and your seeing results in your appearance immediately and you see that every single day every time you take off your sure every time you ism look in the error you see that result that tends to drive adherents o really powerfully it is important to give people winds e special people who are not may be you and i who are ominous lift weights and oman exercise no matter what the rests my life as i just love it not in ones that and giving them a little bit a carat of success and if you can achieve that in you all say three to forth five weeks already it is very powerful to m before i begin id to emphasis tot this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is also separate from doctor japan's teaching an research rolls at castrate fullerton it is however part of our desire and effort to brings yourocostic consumer information about science an since related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme wed to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is momentous momentous make supplements of the absolute highest quality the supermen lab podcast is proud to be partnering with torments for several important reasons first of all as i mention their supplements are of extremely high quality second of all there supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations if you are going to develop a supplementation protocol you are going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations with single ingredient formulations you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regiment for your goals in addition momentous supplementship internationally and this is of course important because we realize that many of the suborn ladpodcast listeners reside outside the united states if you to try the various supplements mentioned on the hubermanlabpodcast in particular supplements for forgot health for sleep optimization for focus as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery you can go to livemomentous spelled o u s that livmomentous dot calm slash supermen to day's episode is also brought to us by eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity have been using an eight sleep mattress cover for about the last eight months and it has completely transformed by sleep ism sleeping about the same amount but ism sleeping far deeper and ism now getting the proper rations of called rapid eye moment or red sleep and slow wave sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically the underlying mechanism for all that is very straightforward have talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature that is in order to fall asleep at night your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees in terms of cur body temperature and waking up involves a one to three degree increase in corody temperature with eight sleep stress covers you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be one temperature at the start of the night a different temperature the middle the night and a different temperature as you approach morning each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep and have you waking out feeling more refreshed than ever if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dot calm slash supermen

activities affect your health by giving you real time feed back on your blood glucose using a continuous glucose monitor many people are aware that their blood sugar that is their blood glucose level is critical for everything from fat loss to muscle gain to healthy cognition and indeed aging of the brain and body most people do not know however how different foods and d fer ant activities including exercise or different temperature environments impact their blood locos levels and yet bloodlucos is exquisitely sensitive to all of those things i for started using levels about a year ago as a way to understand how different foods exercise and timing of food relative exercise and quality of sleep at night impact my blood lugs levels and have learned a tremendous amount from using levels it is taught me when best to eat what best to eat when best to exercise how best to exercise and how to modulate my entire casual from work to exercise and even my sleep s if your interest in learning more about levels in trying at continuous glucose monster yourself go to levels dot link slash supermen that is levels dot link slash supermen let us talk about strength and hypertrophy if you would please remind us what strength and hypertrophy are in terms of the specific adaptation they represent when i me n by that is when somebody is training for strength what are they really training for obviously it means the ability to move more weight but i know that it includes a umber of other things that well and when one is training for hypertrophy for the growth of muscle fibers what does that represent cause i think if people understand that they will far better understand the methods and protocols that are going to be best for strength and hypertrophy at its core you you have basely described it when we talk about strength or talking about an actual function can you create more force across a muscle or muscle groups or are total movement and hen we talk about hyperchufou now were specific referring to just an increase in size there is no actual mention all function a muscle can grow larger without actually technically being stronger for a number of reasons however there is a strong relationship between strength and ipertrry lot of the times in the general public in the lay conversations we sort of lump those two things in as the same thing and s we have to recognize people who are a new to training our people even are intermediately trained there is a huge overlap between strength and perjury once you get pass that though they become disentangled and a good example of it is this if you look at the strongest people in the world this would be people who compete in the sport of power lifting right that is a true test of maximal strength it is a dead lift the bench press and a back squat and you are going to do a one repetition man and all three those and whoever winds is he person who lifted the most among weight one time that is it it is not world strongest man where it is how many reps can you do in a real or your time right is a true maximal strength us and you compare those to say body builders now both of those individuals are strong and both of those individuals have a lot of muscle however it is extremely clear the power lifters will be significantly stronger then the body builders on average right their individual exceptions but were just talking collective averages and the body builders will have more muscle then the other ones in addition whether you look at olympic weight lifting or power lifting or world strongest man for that matter there are weight classes and the reason is as you go up and weight classes you will always see the world records go higher and higher and higher right you can clearly get stronger without adding any muscle however there is a point right were you simply have to add more mass to get a higher number and that is why we have weight classes in those sports and in combatsports and loss of other things we have the dis a lot of confusion right because people think men either these are the same thing the or if i want ad get strong or i have to get bigger which is not the case at all another is homer here is i cannot get stronger unless i add muscle that is not true either rightness a similar idea what what ism saying is you have the ability to do whatever you if you would to get stronger and d muscle great if you add muscle you are probably going to bring some strength along for the right however if you want to get stronger and you do not want to ad muscle for any reason personal preference on esthetics whether you in a way class you simply can afford it it is quite easy to get stronger or not ad mush muscleman either and differentiating these two things is one of em is simply a measure of size n other ant is a measure of course and when we talk about strength or really talking about our two unique components component one is what i call the physiology what what is the ability of the no muscular system what is the ability of the muscle fibers to contract and produce force the other one is we call mechanics and mechanics is simply things it is amnesia down to how long your fevers are relative year tibia or or other things this is by mechanics this is also technique this is skill this is how smoothed you feel this is are you firing the right muscle group in the right sequence and order in all of these things playing to strength somebody who maybe has a more force capability in their muscle fires but their technique in the movement is worse may lose in a competition or somebody again whose a if you going the world of speed and power especially you will hear lot people talk abut the rhythm and there is test a certain rhythm that has to happen if you want a jump as highest possible or in spouts fast as possible but that is all mechanics at this fundamental level when we look at hypertrophy it is just still simply about how big the muscle is those are the really the the similarities and distinctions between strength and i entropy when strength improves and when hypertrophy increases is there also involvement in the ligaments and pendents that is of course the ligaments intendant are involved in the movements and yet but ligaments andtendents themselves grow end forget stronger this field is really difficult because a connective tissue is not vascular and their plasticity is significantly lower than skeleton muss in fact if you look across all the organs a sell in muscle is one of if not the most plastic meaning it is the most pliable the most responsive i them on it is going to a just it is basely it is paying attention to everything that is being said in the body a you cannot change blood pressure or p h or a maccernutrans floating around without muscle knowing about it it is a a fact this is why we call muscle an organ people do not ten to thing about this if you are ever on jeopardy and ask you that question what is the biggest organ system in the body people tend to say the skin muscles actually correct answer i amino site you when i get it your rot on party i do not have any immediate plants your yet every but who knows oh they go celebrity jeopardy and you human rag i do not know what the celebrity part but a jobbery would be fun ya but i will say the muscle and it'll all if you get come call in jeopardy i do not not have not seen that show o very long time i maybe ever then ill it'll call you but that makes sat am there the muscles would be the largest organ system ye out the reason it'll saying that is muscle is both listening and talking it is controlling atheedemian system lot it is controlling blood glookclose regulation it is its the central deep for a meanoassis which are needed to do things regulate the in system build a any new red bloodselfso lot of the stuff is coming from smelled a muse it when we say organ by the way that is actual a physiological definition something that is communicating a to either another organ itself or i throughout the system it is listening and it is talking connected tissues not the same way and we do see adaptations with strength training i in connective tissue it is just much lower it is difficult to measure am effectively what we know now is yourecanto have a combination a of adaptations throughout the connective tissue it is beneficial ah this is probably one the major reasons that is that strength training reduces injury risk which is very very important because people who tend to want a pick up an exercise routine after say ten years the the classically has i played all these things in high school and i went the college got a job now ism twenty five or thirty five or whatever an you sort of want to jump back into what you did you are twenty well there is no tissue tolerance slight and what we almost always mean by that is connective tissue the tolerance in there it is not ready for the louder about to handle and you go through some movement and then boy sprains tarts i you even the the more significant ones around keel's air which is not really side line you those are some of the problems and we no strength training as a a large rolling injury auction for stress and strain are over youseinjuries and that specifically coming for the connected tissuadaptitions again the difficult part here is it is very hard assess we actually i but i was a doctor student we played around with a battle tenant biopsies actually had one it is a tees old piece of your protelattenan missing ye because your own ye on lad now give probably had i do not know how many hundreds of biopsies live performed on people ism probably well over a thousand certainly well over a thousand have probably had thirty five or forty done o myself i there is no problem you i have no scartissoe have no loss of function and give stock needles in every leg all over myself like quads a my solely is pastor all a taking tissue out ye you want the needle looks a pen basically and you yo you are live n you going an grab chunk you pull it out and we cannot come to your laying get by absolutely at you are right oh looking underage microscopical just look the molecule canine there is tether is the usual friend of ours who came down onto that he's a big big big gentlemen big in the lifting very into strength training a and he you wen to that experience and he was a my gosh it was not what he was h up an et he actually had unbelievable muscle morphology his fibers were am the diameter of muscle fires is extremely large i it is on of the biggest cells by volume an all biology selling a muslin human not large i help myself am millimeters well you yet length writing you have with rig lengthwise it can be extraordinary long you can be a the classic examples your sartorius it is the front of your hip to the inside of your knee cap theoretically those sells can run the entire length with would be one muscle fire running that thing if ye far to de bus an you and i i pull that tissue out i could actually pulling individual fiber out with tweezers and hold it up and you can see that whole muscle cell him beef not in yen how to get my as am you be stone howling there an it is his was the size of rhyme the diameter of his now he has a a well documented assistance in the area muscle growth will see a but yet let those can be large what were we been talking about there well i was asking about tendons and ligaments you am because i to understand the various tissues in organ systems that adapt when one gets stronger we hole tissue grows and i i do one ask about bone and here ism not referring to all bone men or a density what i was going to ask is whether or not bone itself can grow and get stronger and the reason ism asking as there is a favorite result of mine i have about thirty eight hundred favorite results three thousand pet peeves and thirty eight hundred plus a favorite results a but one of my favor results is from epic knell's lab at colombia epic one the nail prize for learning a memory and his laboratory got rely into the effect of exercise on learning in memory and they had this incredible result which is that load bearing exercise yet stimulates the bones to release something called all onto also excuse me and then onto also axes a more less a hormone travels to the brain and enhances the memory systems in the brain by enhancing her on health that is the basic proof of the studies there were several of these and the moment i saw the first of those studies that will here is another reason to do resistance type exercise and not just erotic exercise and then it brings to mind whether or not bones themselves get stronger when we do resistance training i do not know the answer to that yes very clearly demonstrated and we have known that for for many decades a you have a diminishing ability to do with age particularly a you need to this in your teens and twenties aloe can have the largest ability to enhance a mental density and it is particularly responsive to axial loading now ism a muscle guy ism not a bone specialists we would have to i consult somebody who can give you more position here but that you won an axial load and it is it is up and down it is vertical y it is almost ti got a cylinder out weight you the on the small end of the cylinder it ism both small ended the solders yet is someone does not do this in their twenties teens however can we assume that some degree of positive change will occur if they do resistance training e en of it is a small fraction the answer is yes i it is small a we have worked with e number of women in our a or rapid health program at that come in and they are in their twenties andtheyre n their thirties and they have significant moment or density prams and eight months later we can see noticeable changes that are outside of the measure man error of evidence apositvg positive changes correct and and if you worked with a therefore many physicians of specialize rinse area you you are going to need a nuts nutrition here strengthurin alone is probably not going to get you there particular with women because you have to figure out why and and there is a lot going on with the physiology an bout chemistry you probably almost surely needed t have some blood chemistry done with that you have to figure out what is going on menstrual cyclewise in fact often times what will do for our women very specifically is we use a think a the rhythm bless of thirty day was you can act o a salary test across the entire menstrual cycle and you can take a samples it is about every other day you'll get fifteen or sixteen samples and you get a really beautiful picture of its happening commonly across thanhirer menstrual cycle that is really really important because typically for women if you get a single sample or simple time point whether it is salivary earn or blood you can have a well a order of magnitude difference in in any number of metrics because of what has a in this is one of them many reasons why it is been such a challenge to do a lot of physiology research with females some metrics change throughout the menstrual cycle others do not strength is a very good example i can strengthen i can do a wonder at access on a woman at any point i do not have to do that at a certain phase of their menstrual cycle because it it is the evidence i think it is pretty clear at this point that number will not change i have no qualms including females in any of my studies where strength is an absolute is an important dependent variable because i do not have to just around menstrual cycle other factors anything in in blood anything hormone related you cannot have to automatically account for i what i would say is those folks should absolute work with a qualified physician and and you you can have to get some nutrition supplementation potentially and then maybe even some other stuff going on to make that even more complicated if you are on any form of birth control or not that is going to change the entire question especially for the hormone base with construal it just gits really really complicated to answer it though you can see adaptations they are significantly diminished relative to if you have started in your means in twenties but there is hope using to work with somebody specialize rinse n that area fear both men and women boys and girls what are the major adaptations that occur to underlay improvements in strength and if you mud if you could just provided bull et point list of that and then we can dive into each of those in detail for instance our nerves g t in more efficient at firing our bones enjoying adaptations in different soave bone connective tissue relationships that that underlie strength have to imagine all these things are happening but what are the the major changes that are occurring in those organs an organ systems that reflect some one's ability to on one day lift a hundred pounds and then a we have later to lift a a under n five pounds now it'll it'll try to keep tiscondense against could be an entire university course a i will also try to give you a little bit of bones here normally as a muscle i only i take all the credit and muscle turns out the nervous system gets a little bit of credit to here the you have as we walk through it just in as as a big picture if we think about again what causes human movement basically everything along that chain we will improve the straight training and ism not really being using too much hyperbally there it is quite impressive good's going from the nervous system sided the equation what has to happen for human movement is a nerve has to send a signal through a motor unit now motor unit ait is comes down and innervates multiple muscle fires if you think about your actual muscle it is not a thing it is a component of many individual muscle fires you have got millions if not more i think of it a pony tell we collectively say pony telling you think of it as a one thing but really a pony tell is a commination of tons of individual hairs a muscles the same way this motor unit comes in and innervates a lot of dish different muscle fires now every one of the fires in a motor unit is generally of the same fiber type fast which or sloatridge and they are not laid out next to each other in the muscle they are spread out a cross a horizontally vertically as well as a closer the bone and further to the service that they are moved throughout the entirely this is what align you would have smoother contractions and you will have specialty an things that we see improvements from the her muscular side firing rain we see sincrinization improvements a that that are coming in you also see ism improvements in things i seel coming release from the precenaptic her on is you are getting it faster we see dowsing recycling is improved back a to their in an order for without walking into too much the bout chemistry in order for a signal to go from nerve to muscle there is a little bit of a gap there is a physical space that happens and and what happens as you release this molecule call the see coven is goes into postanap the cleft and then that actually binds to a receptor that receptor actually opens up a door that let us sodium in that is really what is happening is not the seal going that us seel coming then sits on that receptrecihe it is broken down put back and in recycle back up in the precenaptic nerve sight the faster you can do that the faster you can recycle that signal and almost everything that i describe in that entire system improves and has been shown to to to increase with training that alone it is given give you benefits we haven walk in to getting from electrical signal now into an actopetential which is can a cause a muscle contraction getting from nerve into the muscle we see thin everything from improvements the we call contractility which means the muscle five themselves can produce more force ore more velocity independent of muscle size changes does another component when we ask house hat i got stronger without getting bigger well in the muscle fire itself it is ability to contract force increases in this because we have everything the sarcomas in reticulum which is the place the stores and releases a calcium which was what is needed for this entire cross bridge interaction from the mas an an actin i to happen i know a lot od ether's lost a lot of people but don't go look at some these images the sarcasms mathickeum gets get's active fitted more gs more want it is better a releasing calcium bringing aback in and doing in again i the bond between the crossbridge the mason act and gets stronger i the couch affinity is the phrase that we use there i increases we serenity walking through almost the entire process of scuttomus of contraction here and every step along the way we we see improvement that net result is we see again more force production independent of any change in size independent of any increase contract you units we did not add anything to the equation we did not change size we did nothing but improve efficiency effectively independent of that now we can actually star talking about changing muscle fire type we can change our fires from a slotted fire to a fast witch fiber that alone is going to give you more force production again independent of size faster fires ten to be larger than subtribe fibers but not always especially in the presence of endurance training if you do a lot of consistent insurance training it is very common for us to find soldier fires that are as similar sides if not larger often very often larger then the fast did fires if you did us low fibers big slow very metabolically effective vibe extremely fatigue resistant it is not a bad thing to call them slow is we ten to stay fastest lowland let slow has is negative connotation but it is the quite healthy fire type to have a outside of that now we have not in gotten into things venation angle this is a angle at which an muscle fibrous interact with your bone we tend to think about this is a muscle fibrous pulling on a muscle will some of these are warpaint it it ore almost ta ninety degree i fire runs perpendicular into the bone and some of em are closer a forty five degree and some of a closer to almost parallel and that confers a lot of unique mechanical benefits in one area it is icy gan increase force production you go the other direction increases velocity and we have all kinds of changes in the angle at which the muscle inserts into the bone we now were already an mechanic side of it right swerve we have influence how effectively at pulls i and with any these things it is always a given take you are going to give up in the case of donation angle you going to give up strength but you can increase veto shorting velocity or if you wont increase velocity you an to give up sort of strength's we have not got into any of the energetics at all we have not talked about increasing storage of phosphocreatine which is the energy i system needed to power that muscle contraction at the fastest possible rate we and continue to go as as long as you want here but a hopeful you are getting the point of a little bit of the adaptations that occur i the reason i want actually my i think that is elf is important to bring a back i made for musters i know i took down a journey there in your disk what the hell just happen that matters because again this is the specific explanation for hows if possible that i got stronger but i did not get bigger and this is also li strength and i berth fee are intertwined and heavily overlapped but a not necessarily the same thing for example weaken increase muscle size and actually reduce strength because of us called lattice spacing what happens is i'myoueren't you have to con to remember your muscle fires are these long cylinders and of the way that they contract requires an optimal space and what happens as you have this molecule called actin and you have his molecule called a myosin myastan sits in the middle and there are six actin that surround each individual main and ism in a three dimensional circle here you had a mason in the middle the house of these globular heads another can reach up and grab and actin and again there six sort of around them rank ism well one of things that can occur is if those those actin are too close together imagine my hands ism ism reaching out doing a giant the it some horse on aught there well if my finger tips are the tips of the myosin and ism trying to reach up an grab and actin and i want to pull those actins closer to my face well those act and stack on top of each other and that is what action makes your muscles grow up i i fleas my bicep it actually grows up three or four inches cause you are starting these these sarcoma's o whether called on top of each other are i great well if ism reaching out to grab them and the muscle is stretched too far i cannot actually make that strong of a connection it would be if i reached out and grab something that i can only reach my longest finger tip on it when i go to contract it cannot make that strong of a contraction cause my grip is weak my grips can a break before i reach my strength leet if ism too close there is nowhere to go ism already close if you actually disrupt that lats spacing too much you can actually lose a little bit of staring i it is not that getting bigger will ever make you weaker it is simply that you are not optimizing for strength you are simply optimizing ism for size and that that can explain a little bit of the discantgurity between growing and performance i to to a brief break and

to claim the special offer what are a few of the major changes that occur in muscle nerve et camera when we experience hypertrophy have heard of proline synthesis yotchanges ism assuming that is true maybe can tell us a bit more about that changes in blood flow yet perhaps changes in nerd innervation a who knows maybe even changes in facia i ye ism not aware of any specific my but am i have to imagine that the somehow involved sir the when we talk about hi purchase a lot of the adaptations are going to be similar because the the mode of training is close enough your nerves probably are not smart enough to differentiate between u set of five raps or a set of eight repetitions there somarapt to differentiate anything they know everything that is going on but it is going to be huge overlap the primary difference with hypertrophy is a couple of things if you think about the muscle micro structure m i have a whole series of idiot on reuse e if you an to see the visuals behind this in fact in there i include the specific diameter is and muscle fibers that i s failed to give you a few minutes to at we will provide in inactive link to the what happens is this when we talk about and you hear that this classic buzz phrase of muscle proline synthesis generally what we are talking about there is is contract on units and when we say contract o units were talking about the mas and an actin and are really trying to do i say o cam there is some amount of proline turnover where we are coming in and we are trying to add more prolines to the equation and it has to happen there is a series of steps step number one is there has to be some sort of signal from the external world on this could actually often times its things stretching of the cell wall which is what happened with exercise rights you are contracting a shoran you get this big striped of the sell wall it cannot come from as simple things and a monoacid infusion this is just eating pooching this is why proline ingestion alone is anabolic i do help you grow muscle independent of even moving a just eating proline will grow your muscles yes certainly i knows that those datary are very clear ism course anything there is a saturation point in terms of total an not you need to get to and in things that but if you were to walk into a laboratory fasted overnight and i gave you thirty grams approaching we would see a very measurable increase in routine synthesis ism quite clearly for several hours probably doctor five plus hours i we can maybe bring us so people of to know those data better but many hours lev no waitron correct i imbedding that most people are not aware of that fact you now it is action interesting about it is i if you do thexactim study again and you just it strength training you would also see in proven approaching synthesis i but those factors are independent and the mechanisms are independent such that if you do them both to gather they stock on top of each other which is really wonderful and if you are to ad care hydrate in that mix now you are actually adding fuel for the entire mot o muscle preaching to this is process and now you can a see even needed benefits and this is why for many years i this is that bore the whole posts exercise anabolic window thing which is you got to get cars an preaching an posts exercise to maximizes i must i putting now that turned out to be like not totally true in terms of the window train do not be as strict as people initially i asserted i i recall but but that is ill i thing that superinteresting these are parallel pathways for for praying synthesis simply eating approving i were training each independently increase is praying synthesis i i cannot help but ask is the same true if one does not endurance type exercise if i go out for a forty five minute jog i where i can naval breathe the whole time but if i hereto go any fastest have to kick over into mouth breathing as well i led shown to is pray i will i see an increase in preaching synthesis a simply is he consequence of that jog now this is one of a the unit factors of strength training you you are not going to say then fact you d it is difficult to measure praying break down that is been as extraordinarily challenging at in laboratory but you are not gingko see those benefits i in fact you gin to see quite the oppose citizen is an a tire molecular cascade i this is onto outwork you have t have some summer signal on the outside and this can be a energetic signal ism this could be glucose up take i could be proving in take i could be a physical stretch i what happens is on the sell wall there is some sort of it could be tistostro rights as postpone confined to aware after neritic receptors and this act of it is h whole series of cascades of signalling pralines and this probings bask play a game of telephone one tells the next one that dies a next one in a sort of walking interment will that molecular cascade its fundamentally the same thing whether regardless of the insult but they are different pathways and the pathway from strength training a preaching ingestion it is going to go to the same nucleus it is gone act of ate a whole set of gene cascades it a an tell you to to go though his entire process approcicences which it'll walk through without is in a second if you do in durance training it is a different pathway and instead of act find this entire thing of m tour an a t in this this anabolic signing cascade it ingoing to do a different one i which you can think of moron as am p q ism an energy signaling thing there is a cross over point here in fact what one of things you will notice is m tor an t do not really influence am p q i but there is some literature that an years ago showed m p k will act of ate another proving called am ts to and that will actually inhibit m tor an that was the first molecular explanation for the quote can interference of felt of endurance training on i pprochive could you just a highly for people what this is because as you describe the signalling pathways i down it on maybe just put it a top contour explanation the tour pathway is synonymous wit sell growth yet both during development as organisms humans included mature and sells get larger stories abundant in the system toss to put it quite simply and then the menu pathway in some of the metabolic signalling that you referring to is more synonymous with cardiovascular exercise if a release in the contact this discussion and full utilization yet and will you described as a cross over point were certain forms of exercise can happen to both of these yet bat at least for sake of this conversation were largely separating them yet because the the the by product is the thing that that matters here the result of a tour and act getting into the nucleus is going to be increase in proving synthesis the result of am you running down to the m it is going to be resulted increasing matocontrabogenesis the net come is different now i did do want o forget very quickly this is an extraordinarily complicated thing and a in fact on our laboratory we were able to to be one of the first that figured out how to measure all the different sub units of m pique an individual muscles by fiber type where is you ripping people's muscles out of their knees and their yepatelertennce a antitisand the they are gently removing winder ire protocol of cops for am even when we say some ampiqu it is not one thing ally we say things motor it is not one thing either is you have the total amount that matters you have the activation activation sides are many of them it is not a simple am is what i long in at i just want et the a big concept of kind of what is happening here the to actually kind of answer your question which is oke how is the musclelactury growing but you have to understand is is a little bit of how a proving synthesis occurs what ism generally meaning is you have the whole bunch of the meanlasses in the sentry goes back to may be middle school biology class right if you take a munch of a molasses and you combined them together we get these things called a petite right and if anyone is ever heard of peptides that is all it really means you put a bunch of those together you have a jolly petite you put a bunch of those together and we now have approaching any proton i want a make its going to go to the exact same system exact same steps it does not matter f that proline is going to be a red blood sell it does not mater that is going to be a heroical does not matter is going to be skellita muscle that is basically preaching synthesis when we tend to think of preaching synthesis we we just paint this picture of growing more muscle and that is not the only thing and when we talk about the benefits of having high quality muscles being this place that is goon to regulate most of your preaching synthesis we tend to lose some people cause her thinking i do not need to gain muscle and that is not we we are talking about we are talking about regulating even system a regular were t along about regulating any proline turn over any proline that is degraded or needs to be broken down in your in your system at all a topiary this is the unlike this is such an important buzzword that is just proline break down of of an unneeded our damage protinere that whole thing is going to go through proline synthesis to be able to come back in replace things the only reason you go through a tophogys toucan clean that garbage out and then come back and build an a more properly functioning proxy it is not just about growing more muscle masses why you want these systems to be operating well the proline ingestion is going to disactuate that cascade is is pesetas saying o hey look we have an abundance of supply here why do not we make something out of it because we do not know the next time this thing's going to be round carbohydrate in fat or very easy to store proline is very challenging it is more transient and you can store som of it and keep it around but most of it you are going to lose and when it is available your your body wants to act very quickly it does not necessarily care if you a lecture fat flowing around your system ans are it less's package upon stowed we can easily bring this back out but if you got proline around you are going to want to use it and that is why it alone will activate and increase proline synthesis am independent of exercise those effects are additive a said because the signalling process is independent and once you hid a rate limiting phase than it you are you are there i better it is onset those things will work independently oh that being said what is smelled a muscle hypertrophy in general we think about it as this increase in contractual proline some mason enacted effect effectually get thicker ay now what happens is since they are thicker and as i talked about a second ago that influences and actually hurts the latest spacing and at your body does as result to say hey let us increase the diameter of the entire cell that we can maintain our spacing between these things right it is perfectly if if you on the two of us were sitting this room and you doubled in size and i was lie wo you are my personal space i double size now in each other space the at some point we just have to make the room larger and that is exactly what is happening in the cell and as you can continue to increased muscles sine you can nap an a muscle mile other a cretin you are going to continue to increase muscle fire size for years there was this other commit about am nonfunctional hypertrophy and this is often call search plasmic hipertroby this is not sarcoposic reticulums is the fancy way of saying my muscle is larger but it has no function and the question would be wild the use ut possible if i have more contractile units and i can make more these cross bridges perform more of these power strokes is what the contractions a gold how could i possibly be be losing function well it that was challenge for that was process for a very very long time in fact wore it really came down to as are there different types of hypertry training some that induce contractile proline hipertroby and some the induce says sarcous cypertroy and that was the signify challenge and tell reason mike robots did at auberge a series of wonderful studies a showed quite clearly that sarcoposmic i perchaveis probably happening and in fact there's probably a pretty easy explanation in general what happens is it is it is a increasing fluid in the muscle fiber and this would allow for the dime to be larger but since there's no addition of contract i units no more force production happens and he actual as a wonderful review paper i believe its open access we you can go look any crater o a wonderful graph i thin ten sin what in my hypertividios on tip as well and you can actually see that it is likely happening in phasic changes throughout your training experience at the beginning of your training but as as the years and year weeks rather months and then eventually years gobbing your training we have a change in the hypertrophy that is coming from a contract o units verses sarcoplaic i think that it is an important note because the gan people wondering how the hell is it impossible for me to get larger muscle and somehow ism not stronger well if it came from simply fluid retention and this is not blowing this is not there is won't negative really to this it is simply am holding of a more hydration in the cell the amigos larger and the everything works that way whet you just describe calls to mind something similar in the nervous system which is serow plasticity intercourse says the nervous systems ability to change in response to learning and experience and damage for that matter yet and we think about it as one term but there are many different forms of narrow plasticity ya at discussion that we do not need to get into now wit their spike timing dependent places unbelt p and lantern depression which has nothing into wat psychological depress yo and on and par pulse facilitation and on and on and on in short turn plasticity and what ism starting to understand is that there are many paths to what we call strength increase and there many paths to what we think of as hypertrophy many of these are going to operate in parallel it is going to be rare that any one of them is going to be active alone yet in order to create hypertrophy our strain changes and that certain forms of exercise and certain ways of doing exercises in terms of sets and repetition schemes and rest intervals between sets and between training sessions are going to tape in to different mechanisms but also overlapping sets of mechanisms which is why if i understand correctly you mention at the beginning that often not always but often strength increases are associate with some hypertrophy changes and hypertrophy increases are often not always associate with strength increases to have that right correct and the beauty of this whole thing is while we do not yet know the mechanism specifically and as a lot of confusion this a lot o changes that happened there is a we actually just submitted a paper a few days ago i myself a jimmy barley at sancisco and metameric at thrones has a wonderful muscle physiology lab it arcanson and we we we actually it's b are lay article actually it is incredibly sin read we describe the the role of my nucleation in a muscle perry and this is actually lot o enter suiting et into there but were we are learning more and more about it as a quick example sell in muscle is unique in the fact that it is large in diameter it is all unique in the fact that to mufti nucleated what that means is atypically in biology you see a cell house one neuclious that is the place that houses and hold to demand it is the control center tells it to grow shrink i repair that whole thing well selling muscle in human as son because it has thousands if not more the nearly i which gives it that plasticity and a normal cell has one place that has to go to for any time at once to regulate down regulate do whatever the thing is your muscle fires have these vital control centers all throughout them and for years we were of gray the amount of hypertrophy the you can experience is probably limited by the amount of lucky i you have because your not going to exceed a certain size of muscle fire if that is going to mean you loose control and we are o cake great we found and identifying a limiting fact or to what will determine how much i muscle can actually grow and then the next question was an then wear these since coming from and this is were sale it sells came in and is very clear a dislike sell that saying torment sort upon the outside the perfect of the fiber well then go in i into the into the libra y will turn into amount neural and then it can actually now increased your waiter that and then actually it was hay your actually limited by the amount of these sidle sells you can get in inter a newsman and then the evidence came out tho showed hay what if you de train sort up i used to lift weights a long time ago and i got big but now lost lot of my muscle if i train again you actually get that muscle back faster then it took you the very first time to build it t that is what we call muscle memory an ariel now on your side equation muscle memories something differ its in i wiener you mind i about muscle memory the abilityaride to bicycle after many years of not having have tried to ride one that is i usually largely independent of the muscle has somebody to do witches one a the independent it its it is basically a nervous system phenomenon not a present a muscle memory has been cooped by different communities to mean different things yet el am on our side muscle memory is going to mean that ability to remember that muscle size right that hypertry because ad you explained the motor control things that it is a totally a nerve as the one it'll give you this one you gets the nerve people can have this one well it seems to me that there are a tremendous number of parallels between strength and hypertrophy changes and narrow plates this is coming up again and again in this conversation am because we know for instance that if you are exposed to a couple of different languages early on in life you'll learn any number of different languages far more easily later in life of course that is because there is some cross over between different languages but our satin base languages that el la all for that there is a sub straight for it it is similar to the the ability to li on a bicycle again phenomenon or playing instrument phenomenon but it is broader than that and again i think this speaks to the huge number of different adaptor changes that occurring in the cells and news that generate these cells when one experiences increases in strength the ibertrophy to to round that out i in ta go back to courante what were actually learning now is that nucleation thing and by the way this entire trajectory story is probably over the last eight years this is how fast we have changed our understanding of how muscle grows the sarcoposan were tiki am thing five years ago is was pro sines now it is its preywellestablish the modulation thing as ain't to ten years ago it is changing every week this paper we just submitted this week showed actually why we had generally thought a few years ago in fact you can find me on podcast and probably in some of mividios talking about this and ism n i tell you right now those things are wrong we have just had new things come out is cocoa years where that detraining of fact we thought was a reason of when what happens is if you had the muscle before and you have brought in these nuclei apathy differentiated and turning to intoenuclen and then the muscle got small again you preserve those nuclei and that is why when you got a train again they were already around the muscle grows faster the second time that did the first where now that looks that isactioly not the case in fact it is actually probably hap was happening is it is a it is a epigenesis change in the necleasability to access the dean a needed to grow muscle it is effectively the analogy we used it is the nuclei ire remembering how to write a bite it is quite funny tat you said that because it is not really necessarily that there being preserved of time there they have learned the sequence it takes to grow approaching there and it goes it happens faster the second time and we have also learned that there are specific neural we have know this factory a while were found us our lab a we don't discover it we justle saw this and and our some of rivers but there are different shapes the neck some are more oval some or more elongated and the shape determines the lot of the function some of em are hanging out more towards a perfect in some of em ere hanging out right around the nuclear well it looks the actually probably different types of nuclei idea lot of em that are specific to the matter conduit ism fact you to see take on some of the imaging we have we just there just packed around the the ma the metal country and there some that are probably specific to injury repair and this is probably explaining a lofty the individual variation i mane i know you you said previously tike you are just a very you are very slow it recovering there is a lot of things that going to that and i would i would love to walk through sort of all the buckets we maybe later an into recovery but one of the inherent genetic variations is could be simply that you may be have more ore less the neural responsible for tissue repair i that something that is been happening the last handful of months that is been coming out we will see if that holds up is true or not ism as we are learning more and more almost every day about muscle physiology what is superior and interesting and i that the most exciting what to do and durance an turns of hat of train and how to eat and how to do thing else take get these adaptations has been pretty well established for a long long long time we are just figuring out how what is tapping in the muscle now but we know what to do from a practical stand point pretty together protocols for any outcome that you want or do not want for any morality you do not have a gem you have wait you have dumbbells only you only have cuttle bells you do not want o it you only use byway we can you only have three days week you have sevendays a week you want a maxims muscle growth you want to get a little bit stronger any these variables you want throughout me we have a large evidence base for exactly he to get those adaptations and not others while we have a lot to learn about the mechanisms an the physiology we have prettygood legs to stand on terms o want to do to get whatever adaptations you want what are the essential components of an effective strength and hypertrophy protocol oh what ever to actually do is is walking through both of those because as we mention before they overlap but the training needs to be differentiated that you can optimize either strength my pertriphe or if you actually want you an get accommodation both this a lows you to then get the adaptation you want avoid once you do not want and then get even combination if that is the preference you lot of people to talk about i want to get a little stronger i on adds some muscle that is a different answer than someonewho wants the truly maximize muscle which is a different answer from somebody win maximizes once man my strength which is a different answer from somebody dance man my strength but not actuagain muscles we have all these combinations what is important understand before we get into toe details is a couple of things number one we were been teasing this concept far the concepts are few but the methods are many and i want to hit those concepts aright now these are as you as you say these are the non negotiable that half to happen in any training program and and ism a referring these in the strength an i brio be conversation but these are true of power developments be development must it endurance endurance any other thing these are things are just half to happen for any training program to work i mentioned one a little bitterly which was adherents and the my frequent collaborator can garner will constantly say consistency beats intensity again in fact the literature will show you very clearly inherence it is a number in predictor of physical fitness outcome we want to do something that you will engage in will you will put effort into n you will b able to repeat tississinloverytime that is number one the second one is and this is a major reason that people do not hit their fitness call in fact i would argue outside of not doing it the number one mistake they make is progressive overlooked in to walk you through exactly how much you should be increasing youresepts and a ps in wait et camera a peewee vermouth i later but that is the biggest thing you have got to have some sort of overload the body works as an adaptation mechanism rang in fact we talked previously about the harbor fatiglab and one of things actually people tot realize is the concept of home states is actually comes from research of the harbor fatiglab it was a work that they did on an endurance runner i forget his name and the sort of realize that after a long period of time working out this is an act exercise about the body actually comes back to some stable place despite the fact he was continue to work and that is exactly what bore the phrase steady state and that actually then they launch office a while there is the state that the body once to been and we will call this home stacks that will those all concept came out of excess physiology which is really really cool right we do not get a lot of love lot of some scientifically but that is a good one that we to wive out all matters is we have got to achieve some sort of overload without a going excess we will cover that later of exactly what to do andgeppetentually getting overstraining and mongering and mattering things that but you have to have some sort of consistent predictable overload that is what is on to cause adaptation into continue t contrast if you do not do that you can still do things burn calories you can still get some the other benefits of exercise improved mood cognac function its scenery set flexibility increase is all those can happen without a progressive overflow but if you want to see these gains an strength and i hypertrophy you really need to i progressive overlook that is conseptnemver to a the third one here it is going to be individualization and this is going making get into things personal preference in equipment availability you have kettlebells or dumbbells r you only have bands we have none that these are all smaller details but that is an important component a to it the last one i really want to get into is picking the appropriate target and we went through this when we talked about the fitness protocol and if you run through something that and you run some testing in figure out where your biggest limitations are that is on o help you identifying where you need to go i if you can do all those things your going to be into good spot to balance specificity and variation right if you want to make sure you grow your biceps you better make sure your biceps are working having said that if you over rely on specificity you are going to increase the likelihood of over u centuries which is going to come back and actually hamper consistency over time all right this is when hedging toward specificity's important but too much can cause a rob if you go the other direction and you go too much variation imaging you've a sort of doing all kinds of different exercises every time you you work out that is actually not enough stimulating directly on the muscle or muscle groups or movement pattern if you are wanting to learn a new movement to get you very far and this is a classic problem of ism doing a lot of work but i do not h have a very clear direction i lack specificity ism working but ism not seeing a lot of improvements and this is in the business worlds ecetera this is doing a whole not to different things mean you get nothing really done that is the game or to player right how do we overload the stuff how do we make sure balancing specificity and variation howdy we make sure i want to do this and then how do i individualize it from my needs and circumstances and and movement restrictions and time ofilability and my calendar and desires in all these things those the concepts we absolutely have to hit the methods that we choose run across a handful of variables and we call these things modifiable variables because as you modify them or you make different choices within these variables you get different outcomes are adaptations this is exactly what determines the in adaptations s we that we have been talking about the way that i to say this is exercises do not determine adaptation you cannot simply go i want to get stronger therefore ism going to choose these exercises that is not how it works what determines adaptation is the execution of the exercises a deadline is my favorite example a deadline is a common a example that people think of when they want to choose a lower body strength exercise but a deadline will not increase your strength unless you are executing it in the proper fashion a only talking about technique ism talking about these modifiable variables the same thing for power exercises we will commonly thee mistakes of doing a activities a boxjump which is great people think oh i on to get improve my power which we know is extremely highly correlated to a activities of daily living and particularly living unassisted as you age right is reduction o power they will do in act jivey a boxful what there failing to realizes unless you do it powerfully you will not actually increase power if you do not move fast you will not get faster the the the way that we manipulate these variables is everything to determining the adaptation you get or again do not get with that foundation i think we can into run right into these things and we can start off with perhaps been power and what o what i would to do is walk you through all those modifiable variables what to do with them and then hit you with as many different methodologies as as we really have time for and then we move on to strength and i pericope and cot around the entire thing out and then may be at the end we can talk some other variables what happens if a i have a training photo call and ism half way through it i cannot finish my work out what should i do reduce my weight or produce my duration or things that there is lots of wood if serials we can go through the potentially a a lot of people listening have questions about son a plan sounds a plan i to take a brief brave to acknowledge responser inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood india ay to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals have long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health and well being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test one issue with a lot of blood tastanty antes us out there however is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones an metabolic factors et camera but you do not know what to do with that information inside tractor makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy they have a personalized platform that lets you see what your piss i numbers are of course but then also what sorts of behavior old dues and donates what sorts of nutritional changes what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you if you to try inside tractor you can visit inside tractor dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per scent off any of inside tractors plans again that is inside tractor dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off just interrupt briefly and make sure that i and everybody else have in mind the proper nine adaptations that we've been referring to in that we are discussed in detail in episode one i have listed number one skill in technique number to speed number three power which is speed times force nuder four strength number five hypertrophy number six muscular endurance number seven an aroid capacity number eight maximal erotic capacity an number nine long deration steady state exercise yet you nail tho thank you for for that is probably important clarification for everybody is that being said let us jump right in to to speed and power now all do these a little bit simultaneously they are different if you're a high performance ally you really need to separate these two things forth most people though we can probably think about them is is the same thing there is not a lot of pure speed training that the general public is is sintered ted in if you on actually further break down we there multiple components there is acceleration there is topic velocity there is change of direction or agitating things that will dis kind of call f all that speed and power or now now at the onset there is this three to five concept thatthat we take about many times where this is really fairly true for speed power or strength now i i did not develop the three to five is just an easy way to help you remember one concept that will run true across all these sang three to five it refers to three to five days per week i pick three to five exercises and you are going to do three to five repetitions per set you will do three to five sets and you will rest three to five minutes between each set if you do that and you execute any of the exercises you use at a high in tent and that part is critical you do not get faster by moving kind of fast you cannot improve power by moving and powerfully you have to be trying regardless of whether action moving faster or not any time you are talking about speed or power you are by definition using sub maximal weights you are going to be able to lift it that is not the question the question is how fast can you lift that implement and intention is incredible important if you do that the same for strength by the way if you land on that that allows you to run the gait from as little as three days a week you are doing a three exercises you do three sets of three which is a very very low volume it is a a very low amount of days easy to handle all the way to five set o five of five exercises five days we it i it is again as it just one sample that is something easy to remember and is quite effective for a very long time and this has been let's to quite extensively and in both the coaching rounds as well as the scientific rounds to be ism quite productive and and easy to follow and grasp if you do that all you need to do is slightly increase the load or the volume but mostly the load over time and the number we want to look for there is something a three to five per cent increase per week than example would be if you are going to do an exercise at a hundred pounds you cannot necessarily just add five pounds every week that is on content you pretty quickly and you may have to run some a smaller increment if your doing a lower body exercise where you might have a couple of hundred pounds on the weight you can probably get away with outing five pounds could still lay a low percentage of the total load that is roughly the guide that we want to get to for speed power and strength that sounds incredibly simple and effective yet i have a number of questions r first all if somebody is using the three to five approach does that mean they should not be doing any other weight training of any kind in those work outs or at all no you you can certainly do that combination with anything else you would especially if you think about speed in power those are very non fatiguing and if you could imagine a your going to go to the beach and you are to take a ten pound to twenty pound medicine ball with you and your going to do i four different exercises were you are throwing the medicine ball as high as you can in the air four times in row taking a break and you two or three that is that you do may be three or four different types of throws that is very good for improving power extremely good but it is not very fatiguing see you could certainly finish that work out in twenty minutes and then run on and then do any number of other things s you could doe m some high intensity and a robe a capacity work you cut do steady stayesof you could you could even do hypertrophy on top of that there's m there is a two made your categories of what we call quantization there is there is many many many of them but the two that have the most scientific literature are what is call linear periodization and another is called undulating a often daily undulating pertersatio and ism flagging these to again despite the fact the are many many many more because they represent two different concepts when you d actuary is touch upon it linearpartization as a hall marked by basic saying we are going to train one adaptation at a time imagine going six six to eight weeks and your only doing strength or you are only doing hypertrophy you interns for that matter in that particular cays you you would not do anything else in commination if you contrast that to undulating peartization you would actually be doing multiple different styles of training eve pul either within the same day or just different days could be today's power wednesdayis strength fridayis hypertrophy whatever or could be a little bit of strength every single day a little but i perjure everyday little bit of power every day and you would just change the amount of each that you do within the day to alter the emphasis right now if you look at the studies an there have been many a arceetis on us the result of both of these trying programs is generally basically the same thing they are equally effective here is the major difference though one if your goal is very specific to one outcome you want a head toward specificity if you are ha ism trying to man a mines the amount of moss can build in the next sight weeks then you do not really anything else besides that is just distraction and potential interference does it really matter or not de matter but it is not helping anything else linear peartization is is fundamental an providing focus and therefore the the adaptations ten to bee a often times larger gnat specific are that downside is you now go six to eight the ten weeks of doing nothing else and you were losing those other adaptations at a great at a faster rate and you can imagine doing something speed work only again speed work by definition is non fatiguing when often times we doing a speed work is all i did latter drills and i did all these things an i threw up at the end but that is not speed work you just did a different type of endurance train it which is great an important true speed work is very high rest very low fatigue and actually truly trying to reach a new level of speed or velocity non fatiguing if you did that exclusively for ten weeks you would be pretty unfit by the end of it could you did you would also lose these sanmonomuscele mass not because there is an interference effect but simply because the fact you have not simulated muscle growth for eight o ten weeks and neither one of these is better then the other weren't see this classically across all a program design or peartization strategies is it is just a it to give and take there are tons of different systems and and perhaps at the end we can talk about some of the more advance privatization styles on these ones are are a both effective a you could do these with beginners you could do these with advanced athletes youculd do them an inspector but their the some of the more well document of one it is just a pro an consume rats it is what you willing to give up the worthy you solved that problem is going back to that fitness o session and you are analysis and really truly under standing what your gold is is your gold to do a little bit of strength than a little about at oka great maybe undulated pertization is in approach if your gold is really to man my strength and maybe you can wait on putting some as some mass on maybe linear realization is a better a porch or another style appearsation that is opal for straining it is simply about addressing you things one the major problems folks have in addition to locking progressive overload s they do not have any foresight past the next day of the training and is really important that you set off blocks that are anywhere between six to twelve weeks long we you are going to have the specific plan ideally you have an idea for the whole year i actually have a a de structural lucky through a for that but even if you do not have that really think about what you want then next we've weeks and then maybe next twelve weeks after that and that is going give you lot of guidance about what to do and what to focus on terrific what about warming up i was taught that one should do higher repetition movements with lighter weights in order to warm up and then one of the things that did make a big positive difference for me in terms of strength and hyper retraining was to do a a moderate repetition warm up with a fairly light weight but then to actually keep the number of warm up repetitions fairly low and work progressively toward the first call work set when you say three to five that is three to five work sets correct yet a you also can tell me three to five warm ups no i you also can tell me that has to be done between three and five f m so i terms oevrydois friends in all seriousness a what does i a good warm up look ye and i realize this will very depending on how cool your training environment is time of day et camera but as it got of umbrella for a good warm up o we what should people do the you have already sort to jump the gun with my answer it is honestly very dependent upon the person some folks respond very well to a minima war up others have had loss of actually o professional fighters have worked with where the actually hae a sorely baseball player right now he is one o the best picture o pictures in the game probably the best and the longer we warm up the better his numbersget we actually to a vertical jump tissue is ghetto kill me cause he get mad i wanted to see how long it sort of took him to reach a plaque vertical jump and most times this takes people something five to ten sort of reps and i said take it up all the way to a maxim of vertical jump and then what want you to is continue to jumping and tell you have three consecutive jump or you are down lower the ninety per sent and i what we were trying to look at his sort of win is he get a break cause in baseball he is not throw a hundred pictures o or trying to figure out win is his plaque velocity on is fast mawkin ta drop and sort of basis conditioning on that it's a different style of c edition get's power endurance is really what t is a he called me in the middle of it o lie o done whatever new is no how many these mess was to do and all the queytocames i'monrep a hundred and thirty or something and i was what what rest did you peak on he piked on up seventy something that sixty nine i think technically is he scoop a he is a class example of work in for many many years we have a ton of data on him a ton of biological data a ton of a nerlmoscularsef all kinds of stuff and it just the more he warms up an absurd amount of warm up the better he gets and the better he gets in power production and the better gets in speed and velocity his warm up prior to games is it is totally absurd and just the more volume we throw at him the better he does i have other folks you get past two or three reps and fatigues are set in and now here actually producing power production there is a ton of variation that goes in the i can give you some guidelines them you need to differentiate if your training for speed power strength or i perched here is what if we understand a little but about what is causing the adaptation that is going to tell you what you need to do or avoid for example volume is the primary driver in hypertrophy an tensity is the primary driver and speed power and strain which what that means is you need to preserve intensity for the first three you need preserve volume and the second at most if you are warm up is except extensive in the hypertry training that it compromises your training volume because of fatigue even if it compromises the last set of the last exercise then you are actually probably walking yourself backwards by doing that expensive you would been better off starting your first working set slightly so of them i cause it is not you are just prying our true volume at that point strength and powers the opposite and tell your moving very very fast or powerfully you are not really causing the adaptation there is no pony starting your working set until your really basically at a hundred per et the warm up should be as long as it takes you to get to where your mobilities in the right spot your joins feel good you feel fresh you feel activated and you really feel pique power anything before that is a warm upset and the sport of olympic way lifting a a lot of times the coaches will measure baba velocity traves mash has done a fantastic job with this he is got a lot of at on was called velocity base training a trying man at missourian and mama tons a work here and generally those communities are not going to count any re petition as a working set and tell you exceed seventy per sent of your wonder at man where that is change because of a lot of people doing the velocity stuff is now they are basin that simply on and achieved velocity and really the warm up is irrelevant they do not even it is sort of just do whit ever you want and order to measure the barbell and till you actually id an outcome and now you are what a working set a different ways to think about it a depending on what you are training for that's give you little bit of a guideline if you are training for anything pass i perceive then really and specially even i pert it just comes down to are you feeling a ready to work are you cold are you moving though correct positions and if all those things are fine i do not care if you start a little but early in save some gas the inevespecially for your person you who may be a bit more incline to fatigue quickly a relative to trover of just have no response to big whatsoever is it useful to do more warm up at the beginning of a work out say before the first exercise and then once one has achieved both local and systemic yet warm up in air grots a then perhaps on the second or third exercise forth exercise et camera won or maybe the zero warm ups yet fair point we generally think about warm ups in a couple of ways this is a really actually this very clever question you want to have some sort of general global warm up scheme awe ten to prefer dynamic warm ups this is whole body movements rather than sitting and stretching a static stretching things the something that involves momentum you at momentum or movement right this is a think about this and old him class your high geese and your and you are but kickers and just different things that we are moving a different planes m you are moving joints through tons arrange o motion you are you regretting a lot of movement there your getting the local warm up you are also getting the the total stomach activation everything else is going on there that ischia all be consider be a general warm up five minutes it is a very sufficient number perhaps ten if you are a slow goer achy and somethings that and you really got to get the ankle warmed up if your doing lower body stuff really makes surethat that is moving correctly the hipsinies will follow a upper body stop really get the roller places in the act making sure your going there and the elbows will follow after that a five to seven minutes of a general warm up a lot of times classic exercise science it will even just put you on a bike cycling for five minutes i do not that personally a dynamic movement is more preferred if you really just move by disown minute you will be fine there now specificity within each movement it is very important that your first exercise of the days generally the thing you have prior ties that is often times the most important you are going to do f it often times is also the most complex and the most moving parts it tends to be multiple join i tends therefore you need to have a movement precision in skilled did t you do not typically start your work outs off with the forearm curl right this you do not need a tremendous about a warm up to get going on that you are gust start off with medicine bathos or a snatch or some agility work you you need to have the whole system going because multiple joints ore moving position matters techniquethere just a lot of skill requirement et camera the individualized work out a the specific work out a specific movement for that very first one my general rule thumb is whatever it takes to move perfect in that first exercise pass that you do not necessarily need to o individualize warm up for your next movements unless it is a movement you are trying to learn or does even get alibi better at i drop the load a little bit work on some accruing some practice raps fantastic or it is another dissimilar complex movement let us say your first exercise was a front squat you got later for that analogy o move into a pull up but your mechanics are not the best there unto you really need a change and doom may be more specific activation alormups for that or something worse running or r something totally different yet you do not know o rewarm up for every single exercise as you go gently once your good to go the same muscles that your going to use in the next exercise are warm same joints then you are god to go you talked about intent within the movement what about specific cadence's for repetitions ye i was taught that one should lower the weight slowly the will all the eccentric portion of the movement and then to try and explode the weight through the concentric pase and then also make sure that one is using full range of motion and perfect form ye as it were now of course that is one tiny slice of the possible repcadenceis ye and ways to approach resistance training although i think it is a pretty good one ye what are the general parameter that that one needs to consider you could imagine lifting with you for seconds concentric lie for one pause for two e century i realize he's an infinite number of variations here ye but is there way to use decadence repetition cadence that is as a way to work through weak points a and to be strong in every position of the movement ye a lovely question i think the the way i would to answer this is may be going back just a touch to get directly to that i think if we walk through power strength an apostrophe and i hit you with the concepts at are specific to each one that is going to lay out your answer because the most true answer there is it depends on the goal the answer for what is potable for strength is diametrically opposed for pretense wits optimize i pertrovy the same exact thing can be said for moment we have class they heard things this i mean o do not balance at the bottom ism you are cheating if you are doing a lap pull down or something you do not you do not bounce some rebound you do not you stop at the bottom slow down all these things are thought to be truisms of strength conditioning but guess what those are all truisms assuming we are trying to grow muscle and that is that actually goes back to our conversation and and episode one about a lot of things we think are is fundamental truce about strength training are just fundamental truce that came from the body bending world another are not wrong the good ideas but there are the adaptations one needs to get from strength training that are not just maximizing moscegrop what will lay out to you as a case for which you should balance a case for when you should go fast as case for when you should be under control all these things are or different variables we can modify and get different adaptations for is her way that you could lay out for us optime repetition cadences for strength specifically verses hypertrophy specifically just a sort of book end the conversation and then migrate toward the middle in terms of repcadences that would satisfy the desire to have a bit of both we can get pretty close yet when you are talking about strength verses i pertain you remember strength is movement hi pertriphy is muscle size that is that is the teethe key to your answer here when you are trying to get stronger what you are effectively trying to do is get better at producing a certain amount of force try movement now force is mast time's acceleration what is the mass in the bar multiplied by how well i can accelerteit intentionally going slower is only reducing acceleration right it is hard to argue that going slower is going to improve strength cut sure simply reducing acceleration you need do practice lifting heavier at a faster rate now does that mean if you are trying to get stronger there are no phases of your training in which you will slow down a be no of course not there are certain rules and different organizations ore you have to pause the bottom f a let there is there is all kinds of little things there but in general we want a thing about what are we trying to do here we are trying to get better at moving a heavier mass at a fasteratioe acceleration that is more force that is more strength i hypertrophy is not that the goal here is not a functional outcome it is what is needed to cause the most amount of hypertrophy and when you get tapestry then you are optimal cadence is up to you you can do any combination in fact you could do it the same exact cadets that you did your straight training wist and get the same adaptations as i perry if you modify the other variables appropriately or you could go slower or you could do pauses or you could do a thing that is a called tribasic training were you spend the first phase several weeks of your training were you do eccentric only s you just lowering the bar n your based stopping you can then do the next phase of your training which is isometrics woof just holding at that bottom position and in the next phase you are training your focussing on the concentric portion of a i prophase a one to three eccentric isometric concentric that is a fantastic way o of developing actually strength little bit of hypertrophy but tour manipulating the variables and terms of how you've execute the petitionary you can actually induce a lot of hypertrophy moving the way fast as you mention even down in to control now one thing one will never advocate is moving any sort of weight or load in controlled the assumption here when ism saying fast is you are always in control i never want you bouncing and crushing your sternum with the marble a your best but you you can move at a a lota rate you can a the biometric i mention because this is when things bodyweight training come in to play you absolutely you can gain strength and even a little bit o hypertrophy especially the upper body doing isometrics is much harder to do this but the lower body ism you you you outrun that coverage really quickly you need load but there is a lot ways this is also probably why people have done things on de yoga only or apologies or some of these things that are bodyweight base and there is no eternal load and they've actually increase muscle case s on getting the picture there are a tun of options and am the repcadences however can we say that one should pick a given decadence within an exercise rather than changing it from set to set within an excise or that one should perhaps even pick at certain decadence for an entire work out ism suspecting that your answer is going to be it depends ye it is but if ism necking they use that if you had a under your head cut situation but if you had a gun your head what would be the rep cadence that you would describe yet for strictly strength or as much strength with as little hyprotriphy as possible and in picking that rapcadence then it therefore has to thread throughout the entire yet exercise bout you are actually right you can because of that undulating perisationself i talked about you can actually do this an a lot always you could do one exercise at the beginning where you have a set cadence say a three one one it is a very one that is con that is lifting for three pause for one lower for one i be gently the oppose o case to the first number is always the eccentric generally o case o lower nips i lowering the the weight for account of three ye use for one it told do has an exercise a dead life starts concentric and finish the eccentric but a bench restart hotdogs it else art to finish start to finish is the better y t think about t yet in it it'll clarify actually when we say three when one were gently talking about almost always the eccentric is a slower portion regardless if it is the first of the last right wether you are doing a bench press when the eccentric is lowering the bar to your chest that is the first part of the movement one to three pause one one up which means accelerate as hard as you can the way up that is meou described i as supposed to say a row a row which is actually going to be starting off concentric you are to be pulling that thing your chest as fast as you can under control not slimming off your jest holding for one s secondhand in taking three seconds to lower back on the rack or on the ground or whatever the reason we do that it is somewhat in to it i but it is again to make sure you are not advancing a bore or an implement on to your physical body den extremely castrate that that is very difficult to to deal with i three one want us a very standard strength photo call that it is something you could just run with if that that is all you ever wanted to do would be absolutely fine lower the bar for a count wit three a tax titans a being approximately three is you super hardly anybody is counting off ethenes precisely it is suppose it is durable but then pausing briefly yet and that brief is almost o that pause is almost a unmeasurable it is simply are you on her control before you transition from these center to concentric or contacting much its just a safetything will not you feel down you have reached complete range a motion our rage transition than just go you do not really need to go thousand one another go up is just making sure again we do not slam weights off body parts and that final one in the three one one is really fast the execution of the usually concentric portion of the exercise yet it is fast you boss we can no get to that would be for the majority of the outcome being strength yet and of course we should acknowledge again there are ten of variations that one could implement there but the that would be god staring place on the opposite side for somebody who is mainly interested hypertrophy what would be the rap cadence that a if you had a under your head that you would prescribe i would probably do the exact same thing but i would it would make the last number two three one to you get also just keep three wont on it is still very fine even exploding on the contract is still a fat highly effective for training ha pretty if you what to keep a super simple and just make rep cadence not a variable that you play with cause you have other ones to move that is great if you want to add a little bit of time to the concentric phase fine it is not going to do it is not going to make enough of a difference for most people for youth really worry about i guess its that sort of the point of really one may this is wore classic it's the classic example of wore deep into a method right if you long as you at the concepts i talked about earlier whether you want to do three one one three two three three the three triphasit are not i things this is just a method choice it doesn't mean the our relevant they are there are subtle changes within them it is just eighty twenty ell right eighty per cent of benefit is going to be from the concept twenty per cent is this small thing if your superinto this field ore you actually want a work of qualified a certified coach or something they eat there is lots of reasons to play with this if you are just on your own here and run in this thing three one one is fine three one to totally find anything that i you really just ant to make sure that in the strength side o the equation your under control and you can add enough load to stimulate strength and not get her with an acute aroma right on my perry side you just wanting to load enough to where you can get volume i you got a put a lot honor if you want to go lighter if you want to go slower fine you if you go slower in your re petition maybe even a five set second e centric a two second pause a three second rise that is great you can actually then stimulate the same among of hyperchipy and either do it with less weight or do it with less repetitions it is a variable you can play with if you are hay i do not have enough waits at my house o only have a kettle teller a unwell how am i going to stimulate hypertrophy e your only option is really doing for raps well eventually that that train runs pretty shallow oke here is the thing you cannot play with maybe just ad time undertension or calling ram i just you do slower re petitions go longer ones and hold it it is a variable that we use to individualized programs rather than something that you should really be focus on us a for aspect that is going be driving whether not your program works it is us a tool we can play with in the what if scenarios i i will use this stuff a lot when ism traveling you can do a tremendous work out in your hotel room just doing a ten second eccentric a ten second hold a ten centric concentric you've had some decent hotel room work outs they are not my preference but a by simply doing things am ten second lowering a hand stand push up against the door total a obviously assisted for me i do not i cannot do free hands in push up yam i but just do not have the skill the strength are both am you can do some sort of configured dips between the beds or chairs and this kind of thing am reallthat is put squats or great to do in hotels but your back foot up on a on a bed get an amazing put squat work out none ye lugloobridge is lots of something ye with a jumprope if you have ever heard so one jumping in the morning a wo ye am may r may not ben me could be any number of things but i now to skipper open a in hotel rums a not to get overly detail but i think there are going to be number of people wondering about how to breathe during repetitions and how to breathe in between sets it'd to just briefly touch on this and this is something that i know we are going to return to again when we have our discussion about recovery yet but is there a general rule of them for how to breathe during repetitions during work yet for strength maybe even strength verses hypertrophy in in a way that maximizes oxygen and put to the system he keeps you a alert n conscious but that also protects the body by creating some rigidity in the system might be a certainly being deep with all your exiled the body is a very different beast in terms of stability then with the body full of air persist you do not breathing during the repetition movement there is a maneuver that is long been a la let the volva technique what that really means is you are trying to use error to create interadominal pressure an what you aerially trying to do is create a cylinder around your spine the real issue you have to to play here is regulation of blood pressure and spinal stability now you should be able to breathe in brace hat i mean by that is you should be able to crate total interdominal pressure regulate a spine control all breathing it is just very hard for a lot of people to do it is it is a skill you should absolutely work on ism you can actually you can do this and you can go around i do this chicken glass and soon can codein can push any part ism of my entire abdomen it is supervise and can talk ow it is going be littlest labor you can hear a little bit of difference but you should beagle to do that if you have to hunch down and you cannot even muster breath and it takes that to great pressure you are not actually a you do not really understand the abominable control necessary to crate that is stability tenable want is that is they'll now with the blood pressure thing we have to be careful because a standard blood pressure a ideally if we sat around right now it is probably something a hundred and twenty over eighty stoic first is historic that is a normal number i i blood pressure is something over that well with an acute about of exercise you can see that number reach is highs four fifty over three fifty whit is the factually means you have total blood inclusion right you are good pressure high blood is not moving anywhere and the middle of a very heavy sat especially complex movements especially when they are loaded on your body ism this can be and overhead press i r squat variations an that i blood pressures can be problem and reason why that matters is that is at gone make you pass out it is not the fact thatyou ran out o oxygen in three seconds it is the fact the good pressure got high you blocked mouton's we want to have have to play this game of releasing a little o the pressure we can actually get blood to move a little bit making sure that we do not lose spinal stability ism we can finish or work ut that is really the question you asked r i hade i play this game of oh i have several hundred pounds on my back or my chest and i do not want o ex hail right that do not loose spinal stability but at the same time i do not want to pass out i which is a which is a problem a con of a couple of rules o them if you are going to be doing something in which you can complete the entire exercise without a breath and it is of a maximal or close to load that is probably your besstrategy that particular case you will see a lot of breathing techniques i where yofregngto take a very large and hail ideally this is done through the abdomen not the shoulders we should not seen clericals rising during the sang you'll see common mistake of of the bars on their back andyou see people do this big inhale thing an all they do is relevant their opens that's not necessarily going to increase pressure through the aliments which is loach your looking for you want to be thinking about belly moving out in all four areas in front of you to you are left in right and to your back that is that quadrant sort of idea of stabilizing your spine you can do that independent of your capitals moving your shoulders do not need to rise for that you do not really need the oxygen for i metabolic or pass you are just using the air for a brace that is really all you are after you trying to visualize your tor as more r less a cylinder yet and you are trying to fill it with air the logic being that if i were to push down on to a say of a full unpen can of soda yet water for all you sugar fobs i underwater a and then push as hard as i could it is going to be hard for me to crush that can but if the can were empty or if it were little bit kinked in the middle correct then i could likely crush that can yet what your really doing is you have your spinal record in the back and then a whole series of abdominal exercises and you actually have some normal control systematic control of contracting thus but the you do not have muscles on the inside o you are basely bringing in air in saying it'll use air to push from the inside out n i use muscles push from the outside and to crate this brace and i do not want over compression with the muscles this is a i cup you if you see people that have just enormous spinal rectors some times that is an indicator of a actually a poor breathing are bracing strategy because you are using spinal rectors crate clothe compression and not actually using the inside enough it is not always the case but sore a thing to think about over compression through thespian rectors is not necessary ideal i you if you wanted the the best scenario is a little bit of a brace of both use some air to push this ideas som mustn't sure to press that way and t en that that spying is is nicely held in position i again not in a position where have locked down my diaphragm when i cannot get any air out i should be able to get that brace patter i in the beablispic affactlict ism doing right now and you will see a little bit of of if your really paying attention my voice you can hear little bit of a subtle difference but i should real to this for quite a long time right light i i wold could take a maximal repro here in this position whether ism over at pressing doing some sort of row anything and feel fairy braced in an entire squadron this is very helpful i ism going to work on it but can we say that a an effective way to start off in terms of breathing during repetitions would be to take a gulp of air during the lowering phase the eccentric face and then to exhale during the yet concentric exertion face i ask that because that is what have been doing for a while and major me feel safe i do not know if i am and it allows me to exhale as i exert the the a hardest portion of the exercise yet and perhaps i also borrowed that from marshlands where one tends most often is train to exhale on the on the strike yet if you are going to be doing again the number of re petitions can be completed without a breath a lot of times you are better off saving that explanation into complete well but if you not a to but for a reasonably have said of hack squats or even leg extensions and given ta already cannot lee extension my poison way maybe stasis i may is is why i the id e of holding my breath for an tire compound set gat ism claim loin to mine mum wears my insurance card who is going to drive me to the hospital this kind of thing in all seriousness what if i want to breathe during the set yet it'll clarify ism generally meaning if you doing a one rat man or something that scam the turn li could hold my breath for a one repetition maxim that may be a double or something that depending on what your doing mike make a triple i bench breast you can probably do three and get a if it squat to gets harder that if it come i to ens an exercise i you want to take that death breath the prior to the eccentric portionnon during very lower breathe in wack or set and now start our movement paten wherever into be imexhailing on the concent proportion during it is fine it is no problem m especially if you are not extremely heavy and you are up your were your thoughts on grunting and screaming yes fine i do not care i do not tend to do that i occasionally known to squeal or whimper but i n be a batt your person i doit very quietly i think of oven i think squeal temper absolutely thinks i if you are going to be doing maltier re petitions i what we actually do for he ani a combine as we team them a very specific excellstratety we less one test that they do which is they bench press two an twenty five pounds for as many rests as possible a lot these people will get twenty five to forty repetitions we have a very specific reading patter it would be something if we think that they are going to do around twenty five raps say that is our goal we might sale a do the first ten with out of breath in an exhale we set and in do five breath and you might do five breath three breath two breath and n one breath per rap until we cannot get i more i we will have very specific strategies for them i what i would say is is think about how many you are going to complete and and then breathe a cording the and it tends to increase in frequency as the number gets closer to fail your nature on to want that that air a let bit but yo just want to make sure that when your see when you are breathing back in you are in a safe spot you do not want to be catching that re breath when the weights on you you ant to be in a locked out position or away from you when you are standing ism tends to be at the end of the exercise not in the middle of it i which s it is going to be recipe or problems if you take your breath the one of the reasons ism happy to have you here having this discussion is we can really get into the weeds but also hit a number of questions that i hear a lot yet how does one contend with the first attempt at the lift not working out is it too heavy something goes wrong fully not injury promoting wrong but something goes wrong do you count that you reset the work out and then the counter part to that question is would you do if it is too easy when wrong because you can put enough weight on the bar don't pick up a heavy enough set of dumbbells do you abandon the set and and replace it with another i guess is really a question of how much margin for error is there in volume yet when doing this three by five program our a two things that electostarwhat number one is i talks about lenis afpudization an undulating derivation there is actually in new model new is model called auto regulation which basely says your a going to day and depending on any number of bile markers performance markers or your performance you will adjust your training based on how your feeling that day and seventy per cent as that may be for example not necessarily seven per cent of your wonder petition man highest ever it seventy per cent what you caaccane do that day and it actually lows you to actor regulate your training based on actually wit is happening and you do not have to have as much long turn planning in your program design a because it will sort of figure itself out as you are going you can use velocity determine this out o regulation you can use actually as taking it out to close to a man for the day and then basing on your percentages on that daily man or a lot of different ways that is actual one of very effect of strategy and there's a old of research coming out on out o regulation there is a lot of different ways to do it that is one thing to say another thing to say is this threat five out a it depends on it for going for speed power or strength because while all those other variables are the same for three to five the for difference between whether that is a power work out or a strength work out is the load right if you are at a moderate load say thirty percent of your one re petition man up to about seventy per cent that is going to be a power based adaptation assuming you are going with high intent you edit i char i i have to interrupt maybe just clarify what intent is yet you are attempting to move the implement or go through the movement pattern as fast as you cant great thank you if you are trying to go for strength and you are below seventy per cent you are not really going to be improving strength because the total mass is not heavy enough and really when we say strength were assuming you are at at least generally seventy per cent or hire know if your new to training tonally different thing i but if you are moderately train to highly train your you are engobe while north to seven per cent name below that we soft retie count anyways i that is those are warm upset basically one thing to actually give you some very specific numbers here and i do not have all of these memorize can perhaps provide a chart later send out something to them but here is a chart that you can look up called a prilipan chart how d stronger a p are i all i p i n relevant and there is actually been a few studies on it it say it is o it is it is been old it is been on for very long time it is sort of in the coaching round that a handful of studies out a new zealand came out verifying in invalidating a lot of it but what a perfectly does was as if strength is the gull and this comes from the the power lifting wait lifting sirtecmintits sort optimizing for strength then how much time do i need to spend at each intensity range seventy per cent eighty per cent nighty per cent et camera because specificity is going to say this if you want to get better more a muscular guy at shooting a baseball the most important thing you could ever do as some to baseball under the exact circumstances that you are going to do it right specificity always went if you want to get better at strength the most important thing you need to do is that exact movement at that load in in this case if you wanted to get better at your bench press lifting at one hundred per cent of your man on a bench press is the most specific thing you could every do the more you can do that the faster you will increase your bench press man however that is a very hard to do without kitting hurt it is also not addressing what i call your defender if the reason you cannot bench press higher than wherever you are benching now it may not be your pure strength at may be any number of things you do not have enough morsel or technique he say o get great specificity over here i variation on the other side we are playing this game we have talked about of of how do i make sure that i can have enough specificity n my training without leading to a over you sentry all how do i maximize or how do i reduced my chance of injury while getting enough specificity and we have a class of paradigm hoverer one actually training protocol you can look up as call a vulgarian method and the vulgarians were an amazing ism at the sport of limiting a probably a fact a the a the the patriarch of this entire thing recently passed away have ben o bat i above a new sulemonaglu pocket heckles when the greatest way theaters of all time came out of the system and they do a lot of things but one example in the bulgaria system is you are going to do a one repetition maximumstatch you take a littlest of get you will do one repetition maximum clean a dark take a little bit of great do one repetition maxim in front squat take little bit of bark and you can repeat that two tor three times a day every day that specificity right those people get extraordinarily strong ow they not do that all you are round they do not doth all their lifters but this is when we are trying to plaque for a major competition the olympics we are going far into specificity and that was very counter to the russia system at the time which is much more of our classic peertization sort of abroach of a specificity's is tremendous but in doing that the vulgarians disprutalize a lot ashes right is it is very difficult to handle something that you cannot really do that that long without getting rest and there is the goal is to win metals the rolls with it is a totally different thing than longevity i here wright we are trying to push the boundaries of prosthetic changes unless some one has a naturally balanced physique to in general if people do one sort of moment i find that they tend to resemble the equipment that they did the and that that him re that is a joke against kettle bells course of course of course i got it we know spestibicities tachnetly optimal but it is not realistic not for that kind of it youextreme situation how do we balance these things well hit turns out this primp an chart gives you guide lines for how much time and by time i mean how many repetitions to stand i in each of these rep ranges that you get out of the best of this world you are going to fined the same thing by the way when we get in in durancestraining there is only much training you can do at ninety five per cent of your heartright before starts become a quite detrimental you need t act you spend a lot of time at those lower intensities the prilipant chart walks you through how many sets and it gives your range you ta i think that the bottom of it is how much time you spend at sixty to seventy per cent every one r a man and it says liking a minimum of this set to maxim oof this get but the ideal number of reps per cent per week is eighteen and the el walks you through and there is there is four criteria on it i thin its fifty five to sixty five per cent age how many reps there is three to six reps per get i eighteen to thirty reps total i think the ideal re ranges twenty four something that it gives takes you fifty five or sixty five seventy to eighty eighty ninety in the ninety plus per cent but you will see is the ninety plus per cent number it is more one to two reps per get for total of about seven total repetitions if you start cruising past that i other bad things search creep up in there that is a really effective chart what it really highlights though is even somebody was trying to man my strain you are going to spend something thirty five or per cent of your training time between this fifty five to sixty five per cent range you are asking er well do like even count that one the aunt the answer is ya you in that range if it is bel fifty five sixty per cent you probably do not count it now i gan some coaches do not count on us sits even most seventy fine it is not a made your distinction but you are gin a spend the bulk of your time yow accumulating some some technic baby and skill and tissue tolerance very important the next step up is twenty eight per cent i think is is sort of the the cut off of how much time you spent between seventy andeighty per cent every one at man and then it jumps down twenty three per cent and then all the way to to seventy per cents you can walk yourself through that and that gives you an extremely good guide line and you will notice all of these are still in three to five range it is just really you are manipulating at by total gets or to exorcises that can give you some structure plate with we will provide a link to the prilipin start yet in the shownote captions training to failure when the goal is strange yet should one do it should one avoid it where does it depend well yet it always depends a the way that all general say it is because of what we just outline t in the blip in chart you do not have to go to flour see strength wins especially early or even moderate and ism talking may be five plus years in you are lifting career would you call beginner zero to five years of training intermediate five to twenty years of train ye something that and then advance would be people that really put the time and energy into fine tuning their program the vast majority people who think their advance or are really what we call it immediate in all the remains of life fer it even as a scientist i yean quite rare to reach that number of advance i actually do not have any proem going to failure quite often ism also final of people who do not want to go lathe way there you can get most of what you need getting will be call technical failure this is o k that was really challenging a boy you starter o have some break downs a technique wore on to call that good the only exception here i i want to point out is people who are either novice or beginners they really have no concept of what one hundred per cent means and i think it is actually very fruitful to take them to one under per cent just to give them a guideline of where it is that now of course do this on exercises that they are comfortable with or close and you maybe make this is on a machine maybe this is a single joint movements or whatever it takes for them to have confidence but i actually i do not think you should be scared of the the they are not really am that much more dangerous than anything else there is and we think about it if you've on o do a front squat there any exercise and you are one to maxes two under pounds is it really that much more dangerous to do one try at two hundred five pounds then it is to do five tries at a hundred ninety pounds is it really that muchmernt no it is not you can do we talk about in the the first episode you can do a repetition man testament will you get the eighty five to ninety five per cent will you think you are and instead of adding load you just does many relations you can go go that number and that will tell you the conversion estimated what you are on o maxes that is fine but also have belly no issue in fact i generally encourage it to take people up to that level certainly not day one or anywhere close to that but at some point wet els see what you actually got ism just ism must con a cutie off early whet ism in at consider to be opera man anything more than mine or technical break down is is for that crew were in a stop and can call that good an i really with a spotter specially am in a bench pressing do not bench rest alone in your basement kind of thing a few people die each years from buttressing alone in their basement ye were use dumbbells if you argon to do that yea hard hearted to die the using don get else i suppose you could i drop them on your head or something but not get stuck under them u exercise selection and frequency of exercise implementation across the week i can imagine with this three by five routine done three to five times per week you can imagine changing up the exercises every work out although concerning most of these three by five routines are going to be done with compound movements generally the sooner or later one runs out of movements if the goal is to it major all the major muscle groups yet however lemme give an example and ask if it is okay to for instance do the three by five routine we one of the exercises for back as say a bent over row you do that money wednesday and fridge i i can imagine one could do that and still recover and improve over time but five days a week bendeveros five days a week is that get mean can one still progress and and there i could imagine it is a strong answer of depends because some people recover more slowly en others am very comfortable doing pity muscle groups once directly per week and once indirectly that is work for me far better than two or three times per week you n i get looks of sympathy when when i say this buts shy is just how my physiology works an kind of ye well it may be ism not optimizing a number of different features but yet the point being that some people really do seem to be able to train at a muscle every day and still make progress other people seem to have trouble when they train a muscle every day how does one establish exercise selection when the goal is to make progress and and this brings up something very important and wherein to have in whole episode about this but locater my systemic recovery yet is the whole nervous system becoming fatigued and is the muscle group and the related muscular skeletal systems becoming fatigue wee re on to go back to thinking about when when you make these comments about i takes you three to five days and you have got better results there the assumption that you are probably running under is your training style is more reflecting that recovery time than it is your physiology it is not you tit is hi your training if you look at again all the alembic way lectors i the a competing they are gin to be squatting or some variation of squatting every day that that is on to happened i lot the times are raining multiple times today they will be doing some based barbell full squat multiple times a day everyday six days a week something that they are the best in the world are getting powerfulthey are tremendously good a getting strong you can do it right it comes down a to what does your volume look what type of moments are you doing and what rep range what over all volume are you hitting how are you doing it if you look at athletes they train their legs every day when they are running around their doing speed agility training every single day they do not need in three days to recovery been imagine a barbell player try to ask or three days to recovery between practice vet well to be fair as you as you chuckle at me ism doing other things on the intervening days yes all train at a muscle group mike legs and then it'll give it four days before i do in indirect yam what i call an indirect exercise orbits which for me would be sprinting yet then at it two days and then ism training them again but none the less and alley have to do that every day right right depth a answers you absolutely can train any these muscles every single day it really comes down to volume in it comes down to movement type and how are yougeating with in the case of of whalifters and an athletes would tend to see hap an is there is not a there is two things there is a long period of conditioning and i do not mean endurance what i mean is is tissue tolerance and conditioning y they are not going to start off their career at that pays right the their career might start off start off at five days a week but may be every other of those days is a pa c pipe only pandour just training the movement patterns you are working on tick an et camera then eventually may be after six months or year those previous see pipe days turn into barbell only days into now you went from now a pound to forty five pounds then eventually as your years go on that that wretches up it depends on the stole in general speed and power stuff is light it almost require because its non fatiguing it requires almost know about no recovery if you were truly doing say you will when you say you is funny cause when you say i do legs on monkeys you don't even realize it but an ally does legs every day but you are saying legs and you wat you are really saying as i do his perchafy legs monkeys pretty much the i don't want o get into what i do specifically because it is less important than what other people chose to implement but the repetition ranges anywhere from for to twelve correct a sora pretty e you are smack that in the peak soreness longest recovery rain volume is relatively low intensity is very very high thevverecouts are very my if you were to switch that and you were to stay under four repetitions higher quality a higher rest and between them i would be willing to bet i large amount of money they would be fine the next day certainly forty hours and if you were o actually go wallower and keep yo three to five keep it very very light train for speed youwould have absolute no issue the next day it really comes down to function of a training you are right in that hypertreson which is something that you probably need forty hours at minimum to recover from because what you will not see a body wilder training the same muscle group onmoultiple days very often at most it would be in direct but generally they are not going to do that every single day forth same reason your training in that style that is what it ingoing to take to recovery if you trained any different style then it would not take that long to recover for the persons starting out would you recommend they pick three to five exercises and stick with those that they can get their skill and movement and positioning and breathing all that really died in and then start to experiment by varying one or two of those exercises overturn that is great if you look at the the conjugal model these are the the strongest power lifters as the collective group that ever existed ut but they are very good at us they keep almost the exacting weekly structure but they make a very small change in exercise variations for example say sain wednesday is bench day right they are going to always bench on wednesdays but maybe this week they're get into close script bend and then maybe next we could son to be may be a a especial type of barbell then maybe the week after that it is a a maybe the willchange a range o motion a little bit it is actually the exact same exercise when there making a very small variation in that change alone allows them to do enough specificity but also gives them enough variation o wherein is not the exact same stimuli in exact same spot over and over and over and that is what allows that group plus lots of other assistants but it is what allows that group to train very very very heavy very consistently not have to worry about too much planning for realization in another stop that they get there back off by making small variations an exercise i will say a major mistake folks do make is the change our exercises entirely way too often m if i were to have to pick one or the other i would say do not change anything in your exercises for six weeks probably reallysic maybe even ten the twelve weeks and then you can make some changes i you should not be changing every single week the jury up you just your not to see progress it is can be very difficult to do that it is going to take you three weeks generally to figure out the group of the exercise to figure out how well you can load it what is too much to where you woke up unbelievably sore that was the train wreck how much do i loaded at apposition longs is conic it is can take you three or weeks and then you can really start pushing there changing it before that or in that time frame is is you are nock can beagle to progressive my overload yours knock n no exactly we are at on all the exercises it is very important to great standardization within them and then see some progress in a movement or a muscle group whatever you are going for and then make some changes before we dive into our discussion about hypertrophy we just get a brief recap of the general parameters for an excellent power in strains straining program look it let me hit you wit these rapid fire and thing may become asked questions along that remember those modifiable variables i let us go tho them an order and what they mean specifically for power for strength modifiable valuable number one is called choice which exercises do i select for strength in penal for power or speed or strength we want o select compound movements you do not often see people doing maxim strength work for a precept kick back right it is typically multiple joint movements and typically complex i movements in selecting these compound movements we generally want actually thing about exercise selection of movements rather than muscle group this is an important distinction because we see this is a different ans wren we get i perhaps what i mean by that is wen we think about again strength training we tend to think about body building concepts we go to the him and we do things i got to make sure i get my chest to day and i i i mac strain my hand strings and now your selecting exercises based on a muscle you an a work for strength development and power we want a thing about movements rather than individual muscle group there should be things i need to train expulsive hipictension which is a a a vertical jump or something that i want a train pushing or pulling movements i want a tain real trick i want a train rotation which is a whole area we have not got into which is very important for all real health well mist lung levity we want a select big movements by the muscle the movement patterns the we want introduce and we just want select a reasonable balance between these i do not care what the exact ratio is you just do not want ta go in entire six months without doing anything in this rotational area or an entire yo eight to ten weeks without doing something am a with it is a lower body hinge right any number of examples there just think about the rough movement patterns upper and lower push and pull and then some sort of rotation that pus you a prettgoodspot if were using three by five method andyou are going to pick as little as three exercises just pick one from each one of those group pick a rotation pick a a push a pick pull i can easily think of a pushing a pull am for example a bench pressor shoulder press your a row or gin for pull and then squat or dead lit for a hinge it what would be a good example of a quality rotational movement yet any time a you can use a cable machine get the him and you can do it is how a her to describe this exercise but basely yo can to stand facing the cable and you are going to pull it toward yourself another rotate your pivoting ere a either swinging a gulf club or hitting a baseball bat you are facing one direction ism facing you right now ism pulling the cable towards myself and that ism in a seen to one hundred eighty degree pivot and face exactly away from you what i finish and then return it back that same spot that is a rotation we ill provide a link to an example of that then you consider a quality example i medicine ball throw any number of things this our great rotational exercise right we selector exercises base on that we generally then cate because that as a case we do not worry about things eccentric purses concentric because you are genially doing a whole body athletic movement i which the eccentric concentric portion is going to be fold into that you really cannot separate them out right that is exercise choice our first very the next one is exercise order because that everything driving power and strength is quality based you want to do these at the beginning of your work out you would not want to do anything fatiguing before this non party of aster training no other a re petition to fail your stuff if you do those before and now you are slower all you have done is practice getting slower and and these need to be done when you are fresh you also need to do them when you are very fresh because they are the most neurologically demanding they are complicated they tend to have multiple steps and there often and multiple plans and coordination is a difficult thing and if you are trying to do all that a maximum speed you are nervous best an easy be treen my fresh any amount of fatigue here is only going to compromise results i to cent a recap that one the major mistakes when training for strength and especially power is people were way too much about fatigue those things should not be part of the equation in fact if they are it's a very good sign you are it doing this correct y these are non fatiguing movements especially speed and power choice order is next i the next one after that is volume and we sort to hit volume and intensity which is the other one i we t we talked about that the volume is basely identical between power and strength the the gentle number were to look out here is something three to twenty sets total per work out bur work out but that would be twenty would be debilitative especial case three to five s in u till you early eighth ism just saying sometimes you can actually go quite higher in cases but that is the general length and one somebody finishes the three by five work out for power or strength if they decide they want to throw in some canvases and curls and totally o forearm work or a little bit of a doggy on the treadmill er something that is o k absolutely that there is your very little risk of interference for things speed and power strength you have a little bit of risk only because now you are introducing fatigue which if your really pushing strength that might compromise recovery ah i could imagine doing the three to five routine for strength or for power and then somebody finishing up with i ten or fifteen minutes of aperture for arm work and then being very seriously compromise if they try and come in the next day or even the next day correct and do those big compound movements for speed and power that is i not just because they are sore but the muscles may actually still be damage and i know later were in talk about a the i somewhat ten yours relationship between soreness and recovery yet that that is a hat's a really nice a heuristic to pay attention to is you can but just be careful energy starts ta matter at that point i if you are really truly trying to man my strength you would do nothing at all outside that train i if you just a on own to get stronger and some other things and you are willing to lose strength in five percent of your strength gangs then you are you are totally fine ism the same can be said by the way for superseding superseding is an idea that says wait a minute you are telling me do i got o take five minutes in between each set that is not much a prompt is with on oo you earphones because people are filling their interest intervals with social media in text in correct you you do not really have to go that long in fact there was actually a study that came out in h last month at showed young really two minutes is probably sufficient for most people having said that if your really are trying to push maximal strength adaptations three to five is very very reasonable i your those train sessions are long cud you have to take your spending more time not doing anything then you are doing something but you are trying to maximize quality that is a sort part in parcel if you are not superworied about it you can actual do somersetting which is let us imaging again you arguing to do some some lunges and why your legs are resting doing their three to five minutes you can go over and do an upper body row or pull when your upper body's resting you are going back to legs that really cuts your time and half is it ideal no we actual rand a study a may be ten years ago on our lap and we look to that specifically and we did see a reduction in strength performance in the superscetting group relative to the group who do not supersede the question then it becomes is not enough for you to care if you ere if a to say hay i can cut an hour off of your work out time but you will lose five percent of your strength gain almost every one would take that exchange with the exception of people were going close to competition or really trying to set a new lifetime p our somethingthen you might say no i do not want any interference there that last little margin is what i care about give me the extra rest great it is not a does it work does at not work it is always a what you willing to give up a per isn't the practicalities of superseding your staggering pushpin pushpool in my mind are real because you you've to take over large segments of the him which often times leads yo a situation where your rest times are too long or highly variable because people are working in or you cannot finish your set us sound some one jumped in to the machine right totals crease three or five of your friends because it is obnoxious when you are taking over all the equipment but in all seriousness i think m it is wonderful if you have the space in in the form at to do it but at least in my experience and observation om these people know who they are it is not practical to do on a regular basis if you train in open commercial him yet tuft upon of i we have covered choice order volume an intensity to a sufficient level the last one is frequency and we have forty sort of indirectly talked about the were frequency can be as high as you in this area it really depends on your recovery if you really truly pushing maximum strength you probably do need if you days to recover although that is depended upon you but s been power can be done multiplies at ay almost every day basically the one exception would be maximum sprinting speed you need to be careful there for things ham strain i mean try specially four pretty fast you want to be little bet cautious that but if you doing easier movements ism medicine ball throws or handball swings or something you can do those quite often as long as the volume is is stank pretty low last little piece here is progression how i process over time i mention this earlier but just want to fill this gap right back again before we had over to party which is three to five per cent increase per week of intensity in general and you can do upwards of about five per cent increasing volume per week over time and i generally recommend running that for at longest eight weeks but probably most realistically you want to go about five week or and then have some sort of a reload or back off week if you do that you are you are gently getting me a pretty good spot m those are the for concepts now there is a whole watch of for methods you can play it with within all these categories and and i i would to action cover just couple of em i if we have got a little more space for that sure it'd love to here about those it'd to also just cue up one which is were i joked about people testing and doing social media between sets i it is not a joke i well i confess i stop bringing my phone into the him i because of the urge to you no take my mind off or the work out and i just started en joying my work outs a lot more yean they work outs go far better that way and there's there just much more efficient it for me i i realize that some people their careers take place in the gem an for the i do not look down upon any one using their phone at the him but that really tends to help u me but i do wonder whether not there is an optimal behave your or in set in between sets i have heard before that pacing around can actually help diffuse some of the lack vague and other metabolic a by products of of work in exertion ye that can lead to better performance have also heard that shaking the muscles out and there is all sorts of him lore about this but maybethere is also some decent science some just curious a if you have any specific recommendations that people could play with or trying yet for for speed and power i you want to walk this balance of stiff and but fresh and if your literally finish our repetition sit on a bench for five minutes you would stand up after that fairly stiff and you would not feel risk this is all si this is all non sciences is all pact o application right ane data anecdote a strength is little bit different but this the same concept you are walking that line i in general a lot of the times if you see power lifters we lifters and between sets there going to sit down a not move for i porch if you can be little a different because you are getting towards fatigue and the factors you mention clearing lac they will first to a lactate is not actually causing fatigue that is that is a giant myth which is why i treated up noises i but in the case of against men or you not going to fatigue fatigue managements on a really an issue you want to make sure that you are getting complete your logical recovery which is little bit slower then muscle energetically your not out of any gas whatsoever right i you are not a lack of fuel you are doing three repetitions of a ferule jump ye no canyon again totally what about stretching between sets yet you probably do not want to do that either i there are very clear examples of are exercise stretching static stretching been quite detrimental for maximum power production the same thing for speed i an strength and that is been shown actually a number of times in a number of laboratories which is a a class i hall mark any scientist looks for if i really jumping on board it an idea if i shown not only multiple times but in multiple laboratories for multiple scientists and there all seeing the same thing ye stare to et a lot o confidence that that is real finding and that is been shown we have done that n a sent er for spore performance not myself but one of my colleagues has done about stretching researching he seen that a lot on everything from vertical jump ism to icconetictinamometers and enforce velocity curves and there is we we seen this is printing we have seen this an speed we seen this and loaded stuffs i yo you do not want a spend a ton of times stretching statically stretching a muscle perimetric if you do that an you have o do that say safe for example you finish tat you just feeling really tight yet go head to you need to get height position especially for most people where are you willing to sacrifice ten per cent a power to make are you not get hurt yes that answers almost always yes outside of some very specific tales scenarios if you are not in the right position i actually member having this conversation with kelly call start a long time ago its is yet fine it'll lose five per cent that means ism not going to get in a bad position and hurt my back i and i totally totally agree if you got open up a hip or an ankle or something to get there get in the right position never one we will live with the five per cent reduction and power and if you do just reactivate before you o o your working set go do something fast again a vertical jump a short sprint an acceleration and sort o get that system cleared back up ism if you did not stretch it for long enough you did not hold a furlong enough you should be able to be just fine when it comes oi perfume y can really stretch we want course not it is not driven by intensity or outcome its being driven by an insult into the tissue and if you are are fatigue for i perch it does not matter if you are prestretched that does not matter we are not going for quality of outcome ore going for quality of internal signal which is not going to be am changed by your force out but it does not really matter you mention a few other things that one might consider yet an in light of a the list that you provided of choice order volume frequency and progression right starting off with power just want ta hand the the listeners sure with a whole bunch of different methods to to plight with is long as you get those concepts the repetition range for power thirty to seventy percent of your one or petition acts depending on the exercise and your training status am you are you are onto get power long as our tempting to go fast is mic grey a lot of things you can try clip metrics are our great example i of things theater effective for i for power development we've mention medicine ball throws a short friends you can even do friends unlike an air bike which is a great supersede activity you can do them from a rolling start when you can o i get going a little bed and then you explode for five seconds to see a fast you get or a dead start both of those are very acceptable ism wait lifting movements o snatches in clinging jerks are tremendously effect of in fact they are pound for pound by far the most effective a exercise choice for power development without question miso those are good ones clapping pushups been squats these there all whole whose of different things that you can do airspeed and power development ism depending on your a kettabell swings another great one ism all these can be done depending on your preference exercise of inability what is that your gem or not gem any those things if somebody is mortrokest on strength as opposed to power what are the additional variables they should consider again within the contact of this overarching theme of choice order volume frequency an progression absolutely it is almost identical with a couple of small exceptions number one you probably cannot do there is many working sets per week for strength because now your introducing a heavier load and ask in to represent some sort of fatigue i load on the tissue all those things you could probably get away with doing twenty sets of two of a vertical jump four five times a we you probably could not do that at a ninety per cent on squat right the total amount of sets in the total amount of weekly load you can get to just needs to be lower and then the intensity rights we talked about that needs to be generally higher than seventy per cent with now some portion without being working sets of some port of that really truly being at ninety per cent plus everything else it is pretty identical you've still one emphasis maximum speed despite the fact you may actually not be moving faster because you have introduce load you still need to be attempting that but you are onto be picking complex exercises you are generally going to be hedging more towards barbells in machines this is a case where a body weight training can be effective again particular for the upper body but at some point you are really in a have to move pass that because there is just a certain amount of load you cannot put on the lower body with just your byway you get limited by how much you way or a there is a couple o things you can do but you are get a run out pass that pretty quickly and inswhen it comes to strain they tend to be less athletic movements because i mean we have to have a barbell on us we have to have a were to be on a machine or something that and that is a subtle difference and exercise choice we need to also be careful about the eccentric portion and things that we do not have as much risk in an the compeer power one ism some o the diferenthings you can play with there we have talked about doing things pushes and pulls i also love carries a farmers carry i pushing a sled dragging a sled all kinds tot thing a yolk lock all kinds of of carry modalities that are very very effective at for strength i there is eccentric overload training which we really have not got into but it is really advance technic you can actually load at greater than one hundred per cent of your one repetition man but you are only going to do the eccentric portion of it ism physiologically you are much stronger eccentrically than your concentrically ism for a variety of of a muscle tissue reasons actually and imagine if you can do a bench press at two hundred pounds ism what you might actually dos load to two hundred twenty and you would have a spotter and and maybe even use it in a rack and you would lower it down under control alltheway to the bottom and then stop your friends would lift o back up the top and you just practice tat eccentric portion you would actually we o the lower say to it or twenty pounds effectively despite the fact that you would not have ail to lift to back up you do not need to start there but that is a very effective method i for secret in fact argue one of i a on of my doctrine soon strain now as is doing a project on the set you see and he a see folks in directly on the in its it it is quite clear this often times more effective strength developmental anything else could you can actually just in the speed example were you want actual practice moving faster instead of practicing an a hundred per cent of your on or mantra straight you act your practice set hire n a to get better at it that is that is another a much more advance to please do not let me get sued by saying i folks be careful make your doing the proper exercise in your position and and i cannot caveat cannot we but outside of that it can be is its told fine and say yet with it when people get injured they cannot train cannot train you do not progress to you lose progress a certainly that that is worth i letting two more a little more o vast needs that that not throughout there and one of them is called cluster sets cluster sets are there is a bunch always to do it but imagine taking a many break and between every single repetition bayou can to do five repetitions or interrupt but you are auctioning to dos do one repetition set it down pas for five to ten seconds and then do the next one pass do the next one pauspaspasspasspass we you can imagine doing a squat and bought a go down explode up you are standing it a rack it out you a cannot i shake back out cat your breath walk back ain do another one rack it out andyou' repeat that until you have executed your three or four or five repetitions and then you take your three to five in a break before your next set that is an incredibly effective way for both strength power and actuallyeven high petrify because you can keep the quality the force output the power you but very very very high cause you regretting this little many breaks and you are not getting fatigue setting in by the timeout your say third or fourth or fifth re petition in that set after repetition one you start to see very small subtle reductions power out but because you start to see a little bin fatigue you you take those five to ten seconds off even up to twenty seconds you can actually do it you do not see any drop and an force out put over the course of the five and what you really have done is you have got in five in this example first repetitions which is the waste we canna mayor all five of those had the same quality as raptemberjuant which is again as we talking that is the driver an straight and that is the one we want to preserve it takes a little bit longer for some exercise its not very good it is grate for a delft can you set aback down shake a back out regret hard to do with the bench you get a repack it back in than re rack a back out that is it is a kind of a penmen the ass there is some exercises it does not work well with and and sone that to that set i cluster sets and the lot a research on those i very festive would you recommend the somebody is doing cluster sets ta they do them for every session within that weak or just titis em occasional you can do it the de this could e your training strategy ye absolutely you can really take it that serious am in fact if you look at again the waylifters hey will do cluster sets by default not even trying still say they'll do a clean and whether drop the way back out there suppose to be doing say a set a three but almost always they are on shake it out regret another pull it again and sometimes there set a three takes a minute and then it is ye hears fun ink psych iliac and i set a trust a triple pear you no you did three singles cousin if is y doing three singles an as sat a three when you took a minute between these rap i blow that community yet a make cap your strategy it could be hay for this five week block this is all my training especially for your compound movements if youegig to go to start doing some the smaller movements maybe you give up on that it could also just be something you do for your one primary exercise for the day do that thing that is the most important first and just do it for that one and the rest of hem you can condichet if you need to save little by that time it cold also be something you do by feel yoyoure your two reps into kill am not feeling copy here repack it catch a rest for quick second and do it does not have to be ultra plan i guess what ism doing is is ism giving you an excuse to make sure your superfresh for every rep it matters the last one i want o talk about here is what is called dynamic variable resistance dynamic variable resistance is i fixing the problem we have withal called the human strength curve the are of constraints again you're only as strong as you a in your weakest point of a movement depending on the the movement you do this happens at a different range of motion well the deadly diseases example limit is also because we have done research in my lab using this stuff on the dele i can speak to very directly when you go to pull it off the ground some people are in a fail right at the bottom mean they will not get the weight office ground d all some people i fell just below the knees that is locally can come the hardest transition period and at some people will fill right at the top just before they can lock out o kat grant what that means is at some point of that lift you are going to only be limited by your strength in the weakest area right if you have a constant load on the bar in those other two parts the range of motion for you are not the weakest they are never truly being tested for their maxim of strength cause here always being limited by the previously this is the same argument that we would get into if people ask about should what a you think about using straps right am strapping your hand to a bar for beadles things that there is protean confer there times when you want to use the strap an their times when it is a bad idea what dynamic variable resistance's is either using things a heavy band or a or chains on the bar infer see people do that ism in my lab we act have a force plate on the ground and the we have i built in a likely hooks ism the front the back we can actually set a a barbell on top of the force plate where you stand on it and then run bands from the back to the front running over top of the weights and when you stand up as your going up vertically the bands are getting tighter and tighter and pulling the weight towards the ground the weight is getting heavier and heavier as you stand up as you start to gain mechanical advantage and your positioning you start to increase load cause the bands are getting tighter and tighter and tighter is a lows you to train that full part of the strength curve and a challenge am your stronger airy is with have your weight and your weaker are is with lower weight ism you can do the same thing with a bench press you can do it with a a squat in any other exercised variation and dial i variable resistance i is incredibly effective for a number of things ism your going to give up a little bit ism because the total load you can put on the bar bell is lower because you can be adding in large cases several hundred pounds of band tension and i proven cons it was a game it changes the curve but it is it is is a very good technique ism that that people it is ferry easy implement it is fun an affect if you try this on on a bench or squat you can o o the first time you give to go you c all my got as the bands are pulling you all over the place ism see have to get very stable very quick ism been showing a number of times a hand full of studies at a many laboratories to be a very effective training technique a little more advanced but i want to throw that in there fur the folks get her maybe just tired of sort of doing the same barbells a numbles and machines and and you want try some different a very effective technique tells one less great with your permission ism going to read back my summary list of training for power in training for strength according to your description and you can tell me where ism right in where ism wrong ism going to pick three to five exercises and these should be compound exercises to multijoint movements ism going to perform those exercises for three to five repetitions each ism going to do three to five movements total perform out an't ism going to rest three to five minutes between sets if ism training for power the weight loads on the work sets o not the worm up sets but the work sets we're going to fall somewhere in the range of thirty to seventy per cent of my one repetition maximum ye and the larger the movement the higher that number got on a squat you are o k getting fifty or sixty percent on a bench you would not want to go that high i you would want o stake close that thirty to forty per hinting the way you smelled et up and down as dependent upon a the difficulty the moment great if training for strain ism going to have my work sets be seventy per cent or more of my one repetition maximum ye and the only thing to a there is in the a case a her actually all them a it is tactical less than three rests per set a single or a double one or two went is also fantastic we use three to five as the concept but less is of going more than that is generally not a good idea less is of morse telly not and then you listed off a number of really valuable i do nobly want to call them fine points but important points to keep in mind within each in both of these programs one that really stands out in my mind is this idea of if i perform this three by five programmed but ism also including some hypertrophy work for arms or calves or muscle groups that might not be hit as directly as one might during the three by five component that is of but do that after the three by five training and keep in mind that that additional work can potentially compromise recovery for the three by five power promoting or strength promoting program the example being for instance if one does arm work on the first work out of the week or even the the third work out of the week or the fifth work southerly and that arm work is higher repetition hypertrophy directed work it is reasonable to assume that it might impede some of the three by five power promoting or strength promoting training in the subsequent work out such as to be mindful of that and perhaps turtle back on the intensity or the volume or if my goal is strictly power or strictly straight probably best to leave out other forms of training yet love it one lost little thing i don't think we did justice is intention and the real i won to go back to this now is because we have talked lot about specific loads you have to he an that is generally the case but if intention is there you can fudge those numbers and terms of how much load goes on the barn fact you can get as lows no load on the bark a great example here is a plank exercise you a do a plank in which you get in position and you simply contract the least amount necessary to hold the position also you call contract as hard as possible pulling your slap you let down on back squeezing your core squeezing your quads squeezing your gloves that is actually going to still help strength production because your attempting to contract very very hard even know quote quote the load is the same that thing extends to weight on the bar you could theoretically to large improvements in strength at fifty per cent of your won at man if your contracting as hard as possible and there is a lots lot and lost of different ways you can train for strength that our outside of this weight lifting weight training spectrum and in envy people if you hear things this and your well i know i read this book or i saw this other coach who i i had much stronger that way well if intention is there those are absolutely possible this could be anything from body weight style of training it could be very low low implementself a kettle well a kettle bell or a ball it could be single leg training is all kinds of different methods they will only work for strength tough when you are past your first in a handful of months of training if intention is there and if it is then these specific numbers and protocols do not matters much do not get too caught up in them if you are not worrying about exercise quality and this is very very important because you mentioned earlier about how you stop taking your one into the him with you one of our former students a ramen indie is a the headstrengthengion coach at the university of canvas and he made it he made a great post a couple of days ago or he ye gave sort of a tip of how do i improve training quality and one of his tips is set your playlet before you go t the gem another reason is people send spend much time and between shuts just finding the next song if they it makes there work out long and on productive that is one strategy or do it you do which is ditch the music entirely when you do not have music or a phone to look at you only have one job you will have one thing to pay attention to and what you will find is the quality of the training we will go up exponentially you will feel kind of once board but that is just mean you go back to training and you will get a lot more dentate of one thing to focus on you can get a lot more done when you avoid those distractions and when you are doing straight and especially power work since it is not fatiguing a strength will be a little bit but power wont be people then t get very word there used to either feeling a a pump or a burn or a sweat or and that is there perception of my quality of work out these exercises will not hit that for you there has to be another metric you are looking at which is ism going to try to move as well as i can as hard as i can that is going to produce your results if you cannot do that you missed is not to these work outs go do something else you are just going be wasting time you are gong to be burning a very low amount o calories you've wasted an hour and you can go right back to that place you ore be very intentional there are actually some some study showing that music cannon hands performance we have done some these are lap what is that mean its not about the music persuades about the focus and intent and do whatever it takes to be very focus and intent and you can actual get in in out very quickly and get a lot of work done and she lot of results of it oh get let us talk about hypertrophy topic that occupies the minds of many youth young men but also a lot of women think one of the really interesting progressions that is taken place in the last debate or is that far more men and women are using resistance training in order to evoke hypertrophy growth of muscles for aesthetic reasons and for all sorts of reasons what are the ways that people can induce hypertrophy not to correct you or insults you but probably a a better way o think about that question is really what stimuli do i need to give the muscle to induce hypertrophy now there are a hormonal factors aware important there nutritional factors but just to stick with the contacts of training this is really g at a frame a lot of our answers and as you will see it is one of the reasons why i call hipertre training kind of idiot proof interns of program now the work is hard difficult and all that but the precision needed is a lot less than what we saw in power and strike and if t there that it is very important the you do it in this style with this intent and with with these within these parameters and if you outside former is not of yet i perthafe has a very broad a range a interns of your actual applications and this is why you have and well continue to see countless styles of training that all work i may i know you a were mentor earlier in life by one of my favorite people in this entire field mike fencer this an absolute character his style was completely different than what you would see in a a classic text book a or or any number of different influences or coaches or individuals and if you have ever sought thought yourself while i all these programs work and people love to tempt to things well it is the starworts l just get that of the equation for now independent of that a that is not even part of the equation you are still going to see results and the question is why well that is because what is driving changes in strength and power are the adaptations of specific what is driving changes an hypertrophy is much more well rounded and you have options to get there remember your training a movement and now your training a response and a muscle the cosmic growth that is very very different if we look at the classic dogma we have to basically challenge the muscle to need to come back in this case specifically bigger and the new trains need to be there to support that growth get the neutrinos aside perhaps we can come and a few more menacing and talk about that so all we really have to do is going back to our our dogma of activation of something on the cell wall we have talked about this earlier that is got induce that signalling cascade that is got to be strong enough to cause ta nuclyist react to it to go to the ribezowns to any shape this entire cascade of preaching genesis gay that signal has to be one of a couple of things either has to be strong enough one time it has to be frequent enough or it has to be a commination of these things alright i can get there with a lot of frequency and a moderate signal i can get there with very low frequency and a large signal more can to what you did with with mike back in the day ism sure and still train that way still train each your mostly route mainly once a week directly and once a weak indirectly all you can all you have to do there to not fail is to make sure the trainings hard enough and it is going to work if you choose the frequency path then you actually have to make sure you are not training too hard there you can actually maintain the frequency the only wrong combination here is infrequent and low intensity in lo volume that is it is long as one of those three variables is high you are git to get there because the mechanisms that are needed to activate that signaling cascade a wide ranging and this is why when we even see things blood flow restriction training right this is when you put a coff on your arm or your leg and you block blood flow and you use no load or as low as say thirty per cent of your maximum and you take it to fatigue failure that actually is an equal the effective way of inducing a pertrupy despite the fact in you are using three five ten may be most twenty to thirty per cent of your one at me why because you went there through the rout of of metabolic disturbance o other ways say a higher load may be as heavy as you can for a say eight repetitions is on to get there though its called mechanical tension and there is there is these different pass that can get the same spot now eventually these things have a saturation point you do not need all three of these mechanisms the third one of course being muscle damage or break down and and i know i want a cattle about that but none of these three are absolutely required you can have multiple of them in a session you do not have to have break down at all that is a complete really to float out lie that you have to break a muscle down to cause it to grow that this dos not needed at all you have to have one of these three things them and again this blows you a lot of flexibility which is why crafting your program which is best for you is actually fairly simple when it comes to i purchase you just have to make sure you do the work and you aught to make sure you have i fou standards in place with the exercise choice and some other things at we will witness a second but that is really the fundament a way of getting to it making sure either that signal is loud enough or frequent enough to give then nuts i a convincing enough reason to spend the resources could you have to remember two things in order to grow new skeleton muscle you need a menoasses which are your a supply another you need primarily care hydrates as the energy source to power that synthesis process you remember basic chemistry and says if you are in to take two atoms and you gan a pull them a part or put them together right that is going to take energy typically and in most of actually metabolism when you split anon you can get it scale extragonic you are git to get energy from that when you put them together that is going to take energy this is why we call that proline synthesis right you have to convince you are nucleus that one invest those resources in energy primarily car hydrate but number to and more importantly invest that is supply there is the on possible mystic an energy but there is a very low amount of emenomassis available and you need them for many more things s then just taking your beeps from saving hinted inches to eighteen inches right it is not going to do that if you are in a position where again you cannot sustain a mine function if if red bloods sell turn over needs to be higher are in the other main tons of things that you need protons for you half to big a say are you sure you really want o spend these resources and build it in a muscle because once we do that it is very difficult to go backwards break them back out bringing me lasses back into the to that availability pool we can use them for either another function entirely or even a other muscle group that is called proline redistribution by the way when you say a maybe you do not do i a lot abuser body work and your training and you are not meeting enough proving or amiable amount and you are doing a lot of lifting your legs you will you are notice your legs will get larger but that is actuallyabout o times you are pulling the preaching from your upproboding this case and redistributing it back down to the quod that is the way you have that is what you have to get to and in terms of application what numbers to hit we can go through each one of our modifiable variables ism dislike we did with speed n strength and power and walk through some of our best practices in each category yes it'd love to talk about those modifiable variables as they relate to choice of movements order of movements volume set in repetitions and frequency of training and ta particularly interested frequency of training because that relates to the called split where typically one is not training their whole body every work out although there are ism sure hypertrify work outs tat on our whole body work outs but where people are dividing yon their bodyparts and on to different days weld love to go through this lists one by one starting with exercise choice go great in the previous section we pretty much set exclusively choose your exercises by the movement patterns and you want a balance between pushing and pulling and rotation of things that in this particular case you have the option to do either here is my recommendation most people default almost exclusively to choosing by body parts here right ism going to do casts and shoulders to day and chest and back whatever combinations to things they want that is clearly effective strategy however a many studies act have action been done when you choose by movement patterns and that is actually equally effective not one little cannot act i should have see a few minutes ago when we talk about the research on musslipertropy it is important to distinguish the fact that the vast majority this research is coming from a novice to moderately train individuals there is actually more and more research coming out on train individuals but that is still moderately train right even those when what happens in those people that are actually way pass that point we do we do not know scientific it is very difficult to research there it is important cannot i will acknowledge when i say hay you do not need to do this sir you have to d is you were assuming it a a train in status of moderate to low may i may not be true pass that we do not know scientifically i have certain thoughts personally but the science all only take us that far that being said you can actually choose by muscle a or by movement patten here whichever is is your personal preference and this is actually where you can act just become a good coach whether your coaching somebody else through this fitness journey or to yourself and give them a little bit of a economy may be we select the first three exercises and then let them select one every day and if they especially want to make sure that one must group grows let them target that muscle and may be the rest the day you have actually spliced up as push pull or something else that all those strategies are effective personal preference as long as the total mount of volume on the working muscle is at quoted throughout the week which will get to those numbers in a second than you are get to be the exact same spot no problem i would actually generally en courage people to choose exercises ism in a variety of fashions i actually think that it is important that you do some a number of combination of what we call by lateral and uni lateral exercises by lateral being think about it a squat where by meaning too lateral yet two feet on the ground moving insequencere unilateral is one this could be something is simple as a a rear final of it is but squat it could be a single leg press or single beg curl could be a pistol squat something were the the individual limb is moving one that time you need to have a combination of by lateral and you lateral ism trained that is good to do for strength as well probably not superimportant for power but ism also very important for making sure for i portrays sake you are not getting any in balances a as you progress especially through months and years of training make sure you are doing a little bit of combination whether you want a pick specific implements that is really a methods question and a preference question then it is concepts unwell great caterbell fine barbell possum band does not matter bodywaiht that none of these things are as important ism because all you are trying to do s crate a certain insult in the tissue and the implement is just which every one you feel best doing it and this is where actually machines come into play a lot machines are greatly under appreciated there are a phantasmic resource especially somebody whose either early in their fitness journey or somebody who really is having a hard time targeting muscle group with a bigger compound movements when your choosing exercises for apertuphy your on to want start with those bigger compound movements that is going to be a drive a lot the adaptation you can get to these single joint movements a little bit later but having said that because of of the way that people move differently their bomb a their anthropometric and an their to mechanics and even their technique the same exact exercise well not necessarily work the same exact muscle groups for most we people if you and i both went did a back squat ism if you did it little but more of what we call a high bar squats to this is the bar is little sitting up higher up on your neck you are keeping your back more vertical and because in order to do that you shift your knees much further past your toes keeping of course your whole foot on the ground in good position that is going too generally put more of an emphasis on the knee joint righto that's not a bad thing i you tend to see a little bit more work in the quads there i little bit less work in the spile o rectors and back because you are actually not supporting am the weight horizontally which is a riff it is in much more difficult position it is it is vertically stacked if i were do in the classic lumbar squat which is again lowering the bar down my further down my back towards a mummer my shoulder blazes i probably take a little bit of a lighter stands and when i squat i drive my gluten back further away from midline in as effect as a general rule if you take the midline of your body the thing that move is the farthest away from that midline is likely to be the thing that active acting the most in the case of the of the front squat ism you are not generally going to be using your gluten as much if you are in that are not in fresco just that high bar squat where your very very vertical your knees an t be moving very far over your toes which is fantastic therefore its little be more kneed dominants can we say it the other version here you keen keep your shins really close to vertical you move your but backwards you can a have to then lean forward with your torso which means that to be more low back more gluten and a little blast a now that is a general statement is not necessarily always true but as a guys long there that is one exact exercise or we may be going man ism trying to improve this clear weakness i have in my quads i cannot even legustench an my bodyweight i have a significant problem there maybe in your particular case if ism hammering you ore your hammering yourself in a squad exercise and your wondering why your quads are not getting any stronger or are growing in any size it may be because of the style of the movement i may need to go drew are right look squats in general f you look at the research are an excellent exercise for quad development but for you there not because of the way you stand or just because of immoral activation it does not matter i need to take you to machine and isolate that muscle group we can make sure we see development in that if you are trying to grow a specific body part area individual muscle it is a very important tat your actorseeing progress there and do not worry about well in the text book the bench press is supposed to be good for your pack cause if you are not actually moving the right position or depends on the angle in which your sternum actually sits in your body t a bench press may act you e doing very little for your peck and you may need t a just to say an incline bench or decline bench or a peck fly machines can be fantastic at letting you isolate without having to worry about things stability i your low back position n getting her where your neck at you can really concentrate on just the movement concentrate on the muscle and let everything else kin of go away and insure you are getting training in that speck fix area those are excellent recommendations one thing i want to ask about is prioritizing specific body parts and therefore specific exercises and here ism not necessarily referring to thing to bring up by called weak body part no at area that tends to be either genetically deficient cause in some cases i learn for instance having seen a lot of a compete trackanfield championships a love washing trackafield is a spectator of the hayward field an organ whenever there is a meat opera really love that the sprinters are amazing a they have some of the highest calves in the world that have ever seen i an i g milo micro calves but their fast to sell thees and it or right behind the knee and i have a very long distance between that calf and their foot just makes a propulsion excellent they would not stand a chance as a compete body builder but because something different is being selected for in body building but obviously their their a magnificent printing most people of course reside somewhere between the extreme of very long muscle bellies from on origin to insertion a or very very short muscles usually people have one or to body parts that they want to emphasize for whatever reason these days it seems to be a people really whether they sang now gloats of the new biceps or biceps of the new gar i do not know anyway you see the tell i love be by the way i am pro curls in the squatrac there a love there you don't nobody kill me everyone has their thing but the that they would to emphasize but i have a question because we are specifically talking about hypertrophy which is should people give themselves permission to not train a body part if their goal is balanced hypertrophy it'll give a couple of examples one of the reasons why i for instil not done a lot of freeway squaring is because i despite my quaterseps being rather weak according to you a they tend to grow rather easily relative to other muscle groups and the goal for me has always been balanced development and i emphasize hamstring work and i emphasize a a calf work in dempster work am is come that do not train my quads at all but i do far less for them and i avoid the big compound movements for them i occasionally do them and what again this is not about what i do or do not do but i think that in the contacts of a conversation about hypertrophy is it appropriate to give people permission to say listen if you are just genetically a in a strong large lats doing a lot of chips in rows might actually be the worst thing for you if your goal is balanced development and i a i ask because i do not often here a any one any a credential people give people permission to completely avoid training a given body part if their goal is balanced development and yet i think most people who are resistance training our seeking balance development i do not know anybody that actively wants to have big upper body small legs i thing that comes from neglect and laziness inmost inn sometimes injury related or other things but i think this is an important point to raise that any good program for hypertrophy i would think would have to take into account people's genetic and natural variation am sport based variation in which muscle groups just tend to grow easily for them in which ones i require a lot more focus and work yet absolutely you first way you permission to do or not do anything you to terms of o i rich see training i general would not recommend disregarding in muscle group entirely i know that is not what you actually suggested but just to make sure the people did not her it that way what i would do is in this example is i would continue do those big movements i would just keep the volume up i might do two sets or something a twice week there is a whole wench o reasons you want to make sure that those motor patterns are there you ought to make sure that the the especially the benefit of these compound movements is you get to work many complimentary muscle movements at the same time in the case of loaded squat you are only working stability in the hip as well as the need button are also working upper body you are your wrong boys are keeping in position your neck has the same position your toes everything is working and it is really difficult to get those things when you take that movement out and your place it would say a a machine handspring girl that whole element of balance in your logical control is very very important to maintain over time and at just gets removed with if you go to machines only i would keep some wit those things and maybe not all your round may be one quarter of the year or two quarters every other rotate at something that as long as it's en you are not if the reason you were not doing to say those squats was because your at hurt my backers o cake grate then leave it out but if is is simply you do not win your quads group you much i would just keep that volume look and do something just ta count of touch it keep it activated and to maintain all those other things flexibility arrange a motion i would bet anything your adductors are probably underdeveloped now you can get those by doing your squats cat you are not really doing ism sure much auction training and this things that that just get lost when your only thinking all big muscle groups that that calm inherent in doing the larger movements and we don't have to worry about them are train them separably i appreciate that and in reality i do to to three really hard works that is o had hack machine squats per week ye which is plenty for me to maintain and even get a l bit stronger ye but per or earlier discussion about a year ago i shifted to doing very low repetition ranges to main strength in that move thegn but i am actively avoiding hypertrophy in that muscle group yet or another solution would actually be do something one set to failure a week not even extremely long just do something in the aid to fifteen repetition range at the end of all that strong that in just i lit la bit of pump there and and it just just suggest that those muscles can touch that level of fatigue touch a level of strain and ma can nival tension work away great thank you for that what about exercise order amazing in implicit in this exercise choice thing it is what you cannons these modifiable variables interact with each other right and you can clearly see how when we talked about volume and declaring volume is the repetitions multiplied by the sets that is typically how we express boy well that is can be directly influence by intensity the heavier load you put on the bar bell the less repetitions you can do and the inverse ray a rest initials the shorter you keep your restinables than either the lower the weight has to go the intensity or the lower the rep range passage order is the same thing choice is the same thing all these things modifying each other they play a little bit of a hand and an whateverything else does with the exercise choice thing rolling in t exercise order you get to play a couple of games here when we talked about strength and power i basely said stick to the big movements most complicated compound movements first you do not have to do that with hypertrophy you can do the tin a couple of ways you can do the thing you are is simply most interested in first you can do the thine called or fatigue say you are you are going to do a back day you can go in and do nothing but isolated biceps as your very first exercise and then roll into your your pulling movements because what you will see is during most pulling activities the beeps marry secondary ore tertiary muscle group but you have prefatigue them you have guaranteed that muscle of most interest got its it is most training in and everything else is secondary you can start if you want with single going movements you constant with isolation of or you can start with compounds up you the way it just really comes down to preference and what your specifically trying to develop now this also goes back to the exercise choice question right cause it is up sorter the same thing right which one of mi choosing and where i wanted it the captives was the exercise splits and you sort of talked about it my doing by part splits and i know a question i get a lot heres which ones should i package together ism not really concerned with it what you all you should worry about is how many times per week and fact total volume you achieve on a muscle group per week and i do not does not really matter how ere those things are folded in it it is really a personal preference issue i one mistake that we see here commonly is grossly under appreciating that the legs are not a muscle group i the legs have a whole bunch of muscle groups in them we see a classic split it'll do shoulders and chest money and than it'll do biceps and four arms tuesday and then legs wednesday whatever and then back to upper body and ails you women you have four days dedicate t the upper body and one for quote quit legs well you hope you u can see the balance what that is going to happen tho her time is you are going to do it do far more paper body than you are lard body and that is not appropriate you just want a thing about your lower body you oud do if your going to do body par splits than include those things as well i know just chunk everything in his legs once a week you want to do that that factory o k but that day has to be very very challenging and you probably would do a quite bit of volume a the cause you you are almost surely not going to he the total weekly volume needed tortoise muscle growth if you are literally only doing once a week of your cotton quote legs along those lines let us talk volume yet how much volume does each muscle group need per week in order to generate and for that matter maintain hypertrophy right the the kind of minimum number were look for here's ten working septs per week correct per muscle grew correct and a just to make sure that everyone on the same page if i do a chin up or pull up ism going to mainly be training my back muscles my lats if ism dong it correctly laps and conoids a bye the i and if you are but they will be indirect targeting of the beeps would you include indirect targeting for instance if i you said ten sets per week lest u sense beeps audit seems t that is they go to a generic muscle for what we is that by the way that when people ask somebody o fleets their muscle they always flex their by set they do not flex their calf had or their glue certainly i guess there some public decency issues i can tell you a with my children that is the very first muscle i thought them reflects their gluts no there they are a ta always as they are and in good a good a healthy parenting advice from doctor in to yeoman if it is ten its per week for biceps in order to maintain or further grow the beeps but does that mean if somebody does ten sets of chirrups or ten sets of chin ups and rows that they are checking off any of the boxes for beeps assuming that they are doing the movement properly and targeting the major muscle group that a given movement dispose to target in my mind when you are doing a chin up your spas to mainly be using your back muscles and then there are secondary muscles or secondary accusation of other muscles but of course some people their arms grow crazy when they do gin ups and their back does not grow at all sit is where we are back to the kind of am kinetic reloading of the system year if you will how it has one meet this ten sets per week minimum when dividing different body parts and thinking about this direct and indirect aggravation to think there is no specific exact rule here and this is why these set ranges are ranges a in thiscisnt we way we do not stay tens ten would be sort of the men mum number you want to get to the more realistic number that most people especially if you are advance or even intermediate is more fifteen to twenty working sets per week now if you are very well trained you probably want even pushed more towards twenty five and in fact a pass that there is ness not on a recent the option number may be thirty we do not we do not really know it just hard to get that much work an my may actually be detrimental and here were referring to natural athletes that is people who for whatever reason either because they are not taking any prescription drugs or maybe if they are whose levels of stirring hormones mainly the androgen testoatram et camera do not exceed the normal reference range valley either because that is what they are naturally or that is what they are replacing through farmer colony yet whereas it when we think of technically some one could be taking xogunists hormones to replace a deficiency and the other still in normal range get but i just wanted a clarified because you work with athletes in number different sports were drugs are in are not tolerated et camera and the general population that what were are talking about here is for the general population you not for starlight using athletes correct nonet crib i ten was distort er that absolute minimum number to maintain which is actually pretty cool if you think about it this way i if you went in and you did three sets of ten the very stress tats of ten repetitions correct you you already at three you did that three days a week you are at your nine that is piston if you also dust wont to him one day a week you did three sets of ten and you did three exercises you've at nine s at working sets you are basely don achieving ten sets per week permuscle roup and now we're not even talking about indirect activation of a secondary yore you are going to hit ten fairly easy i extension o that hitting twenty is actually still not that horrid because of what is actually con a happen there in your example if your doing your chin ups well would the biceps down the there is no exact rule there because there could be technique issues could be hand position you mention chin up very specifically a chin up is actually on to put your hands and in this position where your palms are facing upright this is supination of pronations you to be there well that is actually quite different than a pull up were your hands are earn the opsidirection m be chin up actually is onto be prettygood activator er biceps for most people you would expect actually probably count that cause it is going be very difficult to not see some fatigue in your biceps depending on you are mechanics depending on and by that i mean just the the segment lengths of your comes that is devour muscles or originating sir there isothere is nothingyou could do bout not even a technique ore a focusses you assist simple fact the matter that is how you pull best in area m the position of which your hands are m on the barber wider grip or narrow grip it is going to change muscle use we talked about i earlier i think in the previous episode that exercises do not deter adaptations applications but exercises do determine things the movement plan the joint you use and typically the e centric concentric sorteratio as well as often times the muscle groups involved there is just not a lot of things you can do depending on how you are built of some exercises activating a second year group you do not want us o not always ta techniquisour may just be that is how your belt right the same could be true for a squat the hi barbarous lowbaric sort of example we talked about earlier its you know you you could see plenty of of evidence on a muscle activation studies where people even doing the vertical back squat still have tremendous glue activation and folks down the the lobar i have tremendous quit activation a lot of it depends on personal mechanic what i country is the question really you just have to ask yourself number one do you really care that much you have a range to get to if you ere anywhere between ten to twenty five working sets your fine if you counter do not count it it is just not change the difference between whether yum did seventeen working sets or twenty three an either way you are fine i do not release here number two are you actually feeling anything there if you are doing your chin ups and you are biceps are blowing up ism counting that right if you are doing it your nonet feel any fatigue there us all my then i privies i can running an a count that is miss towards them iyoufcan just let that guide your little bit torrents your account ye have always notice that there are certain muscle groups that are very easy to isolate yet when under load and those are almost always the same muscle groups that are easy to contract very hard without any load whatsoever bingo that's actually really in rightful you can count y use the eristic of of if you can contract your lats just standing here you are probably going to contract them very well when you left if you cannot you can probably bout the same things can i happen i yet you will know this expect the lasts are actually really interesting because they tend to be one the more difficult muscle groups to learn how to active if you are in your journey you dust i have no idea and a you can look up a at pose how do you howdypoff your last how you show it and if you do that you are while there is no movement here just recognize that is extremely common and that it is probably going to take you many many many months of trying before you start you see movements and probably even a few years before you really start to she activation you your not some sort of specific special penance anomaly it is very very common it is uncommon to not be able to active at your biceps right that everyone can do that but if you just man i cannot get this here ism discant a stop doing it do not do that just keep at and just keep concentrating and thinking about the muss group it will take some time it is very common to to have challenges activating lats give noticed that many of the muscle groups that we are responsible for a large fraction of the work in the very sports that i played as a young child a muscles that are very easy for me to selectively isolate and induce hypertrofean suppose ism one of those mutants where my lats happen be one such of those muscle groups i think that is because i swam lot when i was i yet dolt going ask reason yes i do not tell tells every one every kit in my town swam and place soccer and then later i i escape worn some you generally hear to answer is that you either were a swimmer or your wrestler sos that pulling and pultortus is thousands of repetitions allowed you to get very god o contracting but because am i also played soccer and escape wording but i did not do any baseball basilar football muscle groups deltoids very challenging to activate nyala i do think that early development is superimposed on a genetic templet the predicts which muscle groups are going to be easier harder to isolate and and trains also a very good case for whit is importing to do as many different athletic activities as you can in your youth ye and if you do scape word dealing learned to ride switch cause every every scape order i know has one legs that is larger an now the a had that is larger than the other and the stay for that matter am people do marshal arts that do not learn to a if there not south to if that do not learn to switch out and o their a there work southpaw you see the same thing in your building in a symmetry into the system and it is noxious muscular it is curl o estrodinary curl yet am ye kids am parents get your kids doing a bunch of different things i suppose your monastics would probably be the best sport all round in terms of am movement in multiple planes and activating all the different muscle groups a yes an now a there is a lot of benefit no question about it there is a lot of other thing that it that has limited ability ism almost everything in not to lent gym mass ray but almost everything that is preplanned which is a major downfall right the joy of scaring is there much properceptive import that you have to make decisions very quickly ism in in small windows now you have a little without in your flipping in the air and have the land but you gymnastics dimness tend to have a very specific routine at their working on they work on that retire for years an at it i gathering for me was transportation it was freedom and it did not require any coaches or parental overside he yet ball hurts have the beauty of overreaction and things i meant all of them are wonderful a yet a good to do a lot of them you have establish that ten really to twenty sets per week yet is the an abounds for am maintaining in and initiating hypertratry yet if i were to flag one of them i out say fifteen to twenty is this at that you want to get ism working now it gets complicated when you ask how many wraps per set do i have to get to o well we also can complicate that by repetition type and temple just sort of let l that go for now and just think if you are getting close to that range you are in the spot and all you have to do now as balance to things recovering continued training gave if you are somewhere in this ten to twenty working sets range and you are in a position where you can continue to do that you are not sore and damage and beat up that you cannot maintain that volume for n eight weeks at a time or a least six weeks at a time the ion probably say either the style of repetitions the out of re petitions preset you redoing are too much the volume is getting to you however if you not seeing adaptations then it is they may be the repetitions are not enough and that is that is the cot game you are running now there could be plenty of other factors intensity of course yet tensity i intent ante of course the other things sleep patrician et camera all these other things that that going to our visible stressed category that we always analyze this this sort er brings up this idea of responders and non responders we get this one a time wise it some people i might my him buy my room mate we go to sleep the same time run the same nutrition plan we work out together a she triples an muscle size and i do not have logan whatsoever well there is a lot of a work that were trying to do to identify the molecular mechanisms behind responders and non respond rs cause they clearly exist in fact this is on o the reasons why i every paper basic will ever publish again if i you now if i do always reports individual person data rather than group averages you get to see if there is ten subjects and it you get to see how each other ten responded because the group average can get confusing but you really want o see is how many actually people got better how many got worse how many may be change if ism we'always report those individual daticaus when you go to train your you are you you are not the group average that is very important to know if you do that you can see a beautiful line of these hyper responders the bell curve the middle of the normal ponders in those folks who mike through any training study just will not get any better i if you can tease out which you cannot but let us say in science you could tease out all the act factors totalstressslow hydration sleep et camera what you often see is non responders a lot of a time a it is not that they have a physiological inability it is this that they dit they need a different protocol and lot of times it is they just need more volume if they can handle that and a not accessibly beat up just give then more volume in they ten to see a lot of break there i you see the same thing with plateaus ism typically sort of to sycocay the routine you are on you ben on it for too long we need either go to the other end to the hypertrophy spectrum for intensity which means if you have been in the site to seventy per cent every one our petition mac range maybe we actual need to go heavier a take a re petitions down maybe even our total volume down a go haver try that a great way to break though plateaus of gran if all the other boxes are checked i the other one is is do the posit which is oka we aren't go higher wendigo sets o twenty such a twenty five his very high repetition range and really get after it am not a do as much damage cause you do not ten to get at sore from those really high repetition ranges you will get more sore from the e lower repetition higher intensity range thanyou will typically the other ones and and see if we can bless buss through and plateaus there it just generally means you need to do something little but different than your your training partner we have talked about exercise t nice and were talked about the number of sets that one needs in order to induce hypertrophy per week what about re petition ranges you have mentions a pretty broad repetition ranges how many re petitions purse at is required in order to induce hypertro yet they are two carrots here before you what the number is somewhere between four to thirty raps thirty re petitions absolutely in fact i think long go much high the first twenty have to be feel exceedingly light correct and during those first twenty or repetitions is the goal still to contract the muscle as hardest possible on each repetition this is the carrots here cannot number one is there is an assumption that by the end of the set you are getting somewhat close to failure and you are do not have to go to absolute failure to to induce most prove but you you also have to get kind of clothes if you are going to do a set of twenty five and you finish it in your who yes i that was kindstarting at hart then that is not going to be enough if you are gin to do a set of five or six and the same sort of expression comes but you out that is not can et in that case it does not matter were up range if you are not getting somewhat close to failure again it does not need to be complete failure a good number to think about is minus to which is ally call rests and reserve which the sort of i got within two or reps of failure than i stop and can we define failure at least for sake of this portion of the conversation as the point in which you can no longer move the resistance could your body could be ye a wait machine et camera that you can no longer move the resistance any more in the concentric phase of the exercise movement in good form correct ut that is a really night momentary muscular failures as hide typically define it there is a wonderful review i think it is open access that just came out the last handful of months merit alms's team out of new zealand the epic is is a great sciences and a very experienced physiqcoachand competitor himself he knows a lot about the serial and that paper ring through all the exact definitions in detail all the carrots tat when i can have time to get into today i would recommend folks check that o they wan for information but i it'll try to get the high lights of at right here what the bases showed is going all the way to failure in the defining failure you just did right momentary muscular failure you cannot complete another repetition through complete range of motion through whatever range of motion you determine prior to was well as with good technique other body parts are not being compromise serve et camera and does not need to be total failure that mine us to failure is still needed in cannot to which is again very very highly trained individuals you will not see people who are epic or a jokes who are six to eight to ten years into very serious raining i who do not have to go o fill your probably little but more than what i just said the the the lay out that they brought in their paper was very nice and the basis sailor a here is a couple of scenarios in which going to fail sure is maybe the best way to do it ism number one you probably should do it on a little bit of the safe for exercises maybe taking your back squat on a barbell to complete failure in doing that is a standard protocol multiple times week it is maybe not the best choice maybe if you are going to do borrow el back squats you take that to your you are you are one or two wraps and reserve stop there it is a lot of work at actually going back to our discussion of the prolipan turn it is a similar idea right wrens spend most of your time in these working sets seventy to ninth sort of preset and then you can take that failure to maybe the hack squat machine ore maybe even the likestension machine a little bit of a safe for exercise they also can tend to be single going exercises do not have to be but they are just ones that are not as complicated and you are not likely to injure other body parts when you are doing it i ism that is one what one way to go about it another way to go about it is simply doing it on the last movement of the day right and again you are nocking to do it on your first three or four exercises but whatever your last finisher is you will it total failure on that one and that kind of keep to in a range of yet hit some failure you got a lot of over all worked on cat's a lot of stimulus that is a lot of noise going to that new places as roll roll roll got grow but you did not totally obliterate yourself i especially if you do not have the assistance of anabaloxeris right that is very import if you have those you can push this lot harder use your recovery would be significant hands if not i you cant won a walk away from that have too soon that your ninety nine percent of people to saying this do not an am an and yet among those who are not taking anything i in terms o vanabalics there i think is a large range of recovery emotions out there some people just tend to recover better some people i think also are far more diligent about what i would call the necessary but not sufficient variables of yo adequate sleep ya proper neutrurchin am limiting stress and and on yet i cannot wait to break on thief down i got a whole in a very long discussion for all those things at we will get into it in all its practical realities and actionable om before long what about rest between sets great this is the interplay now one actually thing we said for long time is you want a stick between thirty to ninety sconce of rest between set frioportrophy and that is because we are trying to i activate this meatball disturbance or disruption am you need little bit of to burn a little bit of a pomp to go there more recent research a lot is out of brad shoinfells lab and others have shown that that's just does not seem to be the case again for moderate i to to newly trained individuals whether that is the case for the highly trainfolks i do not necessarily no i do not think there is any difference here you can take up to three to five minutes e resting between us and be fine the cavy to hear those this if you are going to rest longer that means the metaballit challenge is lower you need to then increase the challenge in either mechanical tension which think bat is wait load or muscle break down you cannot lower one of the variables keep youverthing else the same and expect the same result if you are going to have more rest than you need to either preserve the load on your bar or the volume one of the two hast to happen this gives people a lot of opportunity i generally tell people if you are going to train fripertrophy it is probably best to stay in the two minute range almost you can go longer but lot of people have a hard time actually coming back and then executing that next set with enough intent to get there and or it is going to make your work out tremendously long you can stick to the short or one you do not have as much mechanical tension but that is say i you just ti it there but reality of t is you can do whatever you would tell me if this is a reasonable structure given what you have told us three exercises permuscle group first exercise slightly heavier loads repetition ranges somewhere between u say five and eight with perhaps getting failure close to it on the last set rest periods of somewhere between to or let us let us get wild and say five minutes sir o case what is i bit more of us strength type work out at that point but then moving to a second exercise of three or four sets where the repetition ranges now eight to fifteen shortening the rest periods to ninety seconds or and then on the third exercise re petition ranges of twelve to thirty the number thirty kind of it makes me wide i do not ye that cameral at some i i a set of of thirty thinking it was for hypertrophy but what your san makes averysansentery is research back o very short rest intervals maybe thirty seconds between between sets would that allow somebody to target all three forms of major adaptation am might in my mind it works you are telling about mechanical loads if i mu stress and damage and you are talking out meatball express is that better then to for instance to all the high repetition work in one work out per week and then higher loads in the other work out it does it matter if you divide them up or combine them it wilt would not matter i would say it matters in the sense of your personal practical situation while long rest for me i love training heavier with longer restart but ism hearing that there is real value to doing these higher repetition range and yet the formula you set up therein a second is right if you want to do t the other way that is fine you really it is kind of idiot proof you can that this sup howerif you you could actually do the inverse theoretically you could do the theta of thirty first and then move to your sets of it does not really matter ism because we are trying to just get to a certain total stimuli and you aregoingto hit it eventually you have a lot of room to play here you also have a lot of room to adapt based on your circumstances got of short on time to day typically my work out takes me sixty minutes for this plan i have have only got thirty five to day what do i do well if you are training for strength that is a different answer than if you are straining for i perfidy if you are training for i perish we you need to make sure you hit that total volume this particular case lower the load lower the rest intervals and just get to the burn and get going as much as you can if you are training for strength i would rather you cut your volume an half get those few repetitions done at that high load and is do not do very many shots today that is a better result the goal that you are going after is going to determine what we call chose management which is that thing that ism running out of time today my time is short or yettinven think my time as short something i cut off ism not feeling it to day ism in a hotel et camera at camera at camera which is life right that is going to be ten to fifty per cent of your work outs is gin to be chaos management well how you make those decisions it is going to go back to understanding number one what go you are going after the number two what of the physiological consequence would call these physiological limiters for each one and that is going to tell you what to select and prioritize the volume the intensity or whatever else it'd to ask about frequency but it'd to frame in a list bit differently i then that it'd to ask about total work out duration which love tails with frequency because if one is hitting the appropriate number of sets per week and one is combining different muscle groups on the same days well then work outs are going to be a very different direction then if one is doing a different body part each day for instance and to any discussion about frequency has to be within the contact to work out duration and vice verse yet if you are a a lifting junky and you are very consistent your subdural ism actually okay with body partsbuts most people hat are not that and the concern there is if you say our isolating and waiting to do your cuts on one day the week and something happens on that day you might go another thirteen days now before training went between work outs and that is really difficult to maintain the frequency will not be high no unless the load and volume on that one day his astronomically high its is not con a happen while if you look at the research ism frequency in terms of how many days per week does not matter that much as long as the total load and failure are equivalent practically it is a challenge s o it it is hard because life gets in the way for most people especially if you've kids in a job an an all these things of the i actually prefer doing something more three days a week of total body and if something happens you have just mist that body part for portent hours seventy two hours i that little better for most people not because it is more effective but just because it is a little but more resilient to life and you can get there if you wanted to actually do a little bit of combination if you wanted to do two days a week of whole body and then two days a week of a little bit of a body part split than you are actually sort of hedging against all risks the is long as you get to that total number there now there is actually some evidence in a couple ways that may be a little more frequently is little bit better but the difficulty's now i going back to the practicality question if how many people really can train just their straight training six days a week that does not count any of their long duration stuff it is not h their high heart rate their flexibility the it is just really really really hard to get on that stuff an it is it tends to be easier on folks and trims of execution and long term adherents in my opinion to get that volume accomplish in in a little but more frequent patterns but not once a week i li to kind of have it right there for most people not again not because it is technically on more effective but because your less likely to file to progress because of skipping a work out something popping up you are power going out in your card story being locked on your would imagine that that happen to be this morning folks can at my dry week is a gat the electronic gat wit a down because the power is down any way solve that problem yet the way you describe it my sense is that work use will last somewhere between one in two hours of real work is that about right it doesn't have to be knew you that long a you could certainly get enough to work done in thirty minutes if you've din a whole body work out ye i absolutely if coif you doing that three days a week remember the numbers were trying to hit here let us they were trying to hit fifteen working sets for muscle group per week that is five working sets per day for muscle group if you did one exercise for that dillesated squats used five sets you did at three days week you are done there isyoure fifteen but there are other muscle groups to hit on that same day your going squats your doing whole whole body yes you you've gotten him already and all leg muscles in that example are a taken care of ah you would not do separate hamstring work and s you would not need to now ihandsterings is actually little it of a cavie that is a good example of an exercise are a muscle group that's probably really good to make sure you sold it is challenging to get with your standard a dead lift an and squat it it is one of the probable one it is most important to go target outside that but in the they medically though outside of that youofld get most of your leg muscles done with even a single exercise and even if you wanted to change it up you said are money ism in to do a squat variation awednesday he next day left ism going to do some sort of d d lift hinging variation and then maybe fridge my third day imine to do some sort of unilateral i maybe rearefitelof any spliscal after something that right maybe even a lateral lunge maybe different plain look at your a pretty good spot you begin to hit most of those muscles i to you are fifteen working sets especially if you take sort of that last set each day the pretty close to failure that is gong to get some more serious work done but your not can be fatigue you cannot come back in train it a couple of days later and you will be fine you get evensput tat up into two days week and now all you really have to do is it something seven working sets maybe that is two exercises per day maybe some sort of leg press and a leg hinge yo a three to four sets each you net six to eight cat's that day you would that three is a week you'll send you are at that twenty twenty four sets molding ben same the l you or body i just gave lower by examples i the lord body ores i it is not that challenging to get to those numbers and split and that those work outs can be extremely short if your if you were doing that three days a week i you know your going you are doing that one exercise everybody one exercise lower body that certainly should not take more an forty minutes ism happy to hear that not because i do not training press please excuse the double negative but have found that resistance training work outs that extend longer than one hour of work and certainly longer than seventy five minutes of work leave me very fatigued oh sir and fatigue to the point where concentrating on connive work throughout the day i can be challenging met a longer nap in the afternoon om a big propose naps in the afternoon in any case but requiring longer naps in the alteration et camera at least for me restricting the resistance training work outs to about fifty five zero to sixty minutes of real work ye for me three or four times fer week has help tremendously it is a case were doing hirer intense work in a shorter period of time and asshole hitting muscle groups less frequently for me that again once directly once in directly ye as worked really well and as you mention earlier this could very well be explain by not my recovery quoting as on a sort of a genetic or physiological variable but the way that ism training and indeed i to do a few four straps and go to failure on tare says in the another leaned in that in that om joker of training it is the little fun rich just train hard it is rally for it is i think that ism have learned a lot by training to quoting to failure from i think there is a lot of learning in there ism provided its done safely but what you are describing actually inspires me to at least give a try to these other sorts of splits and and ways of training for hypertrophy an strength because this notion of not severely having you go to failure and still being able to woke straight and hypertrophy i adaptations is a really a intriguing one i dare i even say a seductive one and that leads me to a question that is based on findings that have heard disgust on social media which means very little if anything unless it is in the contacts of people who really of no exercise since and on your one such person and that's this idea that because resistance training can evoke approaching synthesis adaptation response but that adaptation response is last about forty eight hours before it starts to taper off that the ideal in quotes frequency for training an given muscle group for hypertrophy is about every forty eight hours is that true yes and no a couple of things there remember in order to grow a muscle there is multipletups here you have the signaling response which actually happens within seconds of exercise and can last depending on the marker up to an hour or two hours stop number too then is gene expression and w we see that that is typically piled around two to six hours post exercise and ton you have following that proline synthesis and that is that longtime frame somewhere between twelve hours there it is certainly not piqued for forty eight hours it may be still there fortyeiht hours from now but it is is absolutely coming down at that point depending on seven omer factors that that part of his sort of true that that this is a commination of some half truce in the some may be just pedantic things that are not really that port a differentiate the we real question i think is is hit oka is it a cay to train sooner slash is at better to train sooner or actually a better to wait longer there is no real reason to think that you need to train if the gold is hypertrophy any sooner than fortnight hours afterwards i cannot think of an advantage that that would confer i i also cannot think of any practical applications athletes physique body builders coaches that ever found tremendous success doing that i would be very skeptical that that is at any way better now could you do it in some instances of say you have got travel coming up that that you just suspect yet one of freeload the system by destroying the how no pot in then waiting seven days or fourteen days have known people have done that before i do no cations or lay every time every single i annihilate themselves and then take it only lay off yet and it is there is no benefit there other than psychological i just love it it feels great to be superstore i feel less crappy not training for those coupledayscomic of supersorring you need the extended rest yet of course and its dis it is just a crappy justification in my brain that i excuse to do something really wild and i tolly do not need and get waytsor that i should get doctor and alba suggestions of what not to do but that he does a hundred per cent is i say not as i do the famous words of every research proven yet i think forty get hours is a reasonable time at to wait cannot think of any advantage going soonerthan that there is really not a tremendous amount of advantage of waiting much longer than that certainly seventy to ours is fine is long as you are hitting these concepts we talked about you can let really life determine that the mean there situations to it wit a particular athletes where we have to count o break that because of schendral obligations they are playing every fifth day every third day son that your just on have to lift o back to back days n use con have to get done ism but yet i cannot think of why oud go out of my weigh do that the second part of that question is let us say somebody trains a muscle they train it properly the hid an appropriate rep ranges an appropriate rest et camera that the stimulus is there the adaptation is set in motion they are getting some where somewhere at forty eight hours or a preaching synthesis week that is going to taper off but they do not train it forty eight hours later or seventy to ours later they train it five or six days later not because they are lazy not because they u they do not care but because they have other priorities at a woven in with i they t hypertrophy in this muscle i there are people who exist only to get hypertrophy an a even muscle group but let's be fair most people would to grow that muscle group but then does it necessarily mean that the muscle starts to revert to its prehyperotrophic state that is does it atrophy and get smaller again because if it does not i could see a lot of reasons for hitting a muscle group once every five days or seven days provided you hold on to the hypertrofor yo that you initiated five or seven days ago yet there is no reason to think you will lose anything in that sort of a time to main five to seven days the only challenge with training that infrequently is can you actually get enough total volume done if you are going to train the muscle once a week you either have to go to real failure real damage in soreness or you have to figure out away to twenty sets that day in the muscle not at all impossible especialleverything well actual i have you this fifteen have i do five sets of three exercises that is not outrageous not at all absolute possible if you are wanting to go more towards twenty ore getting closer that twenty five now it starts to get pretty challenging i scientifically the research wall suggest it is going to be equally effective practically it is challenging for people to get sufficient volume without just being demoralized afterwards because therein much pain they cannot et out of our car the their legs are trash they cannot set in the toilet and get back up without crying from pain it's not good no that is not i say that cause those r actual examples that have happened in my life i i realizing as we are having this conversation about was to stimulate hypertur fee that have sore defaulted to more intensity is supposed to volume because of the time factor i have lot of other things going on in my life and within that hour i cannot get enough sets in across all the muscle groups and to hit and ism only can do it about once a week and it is at least for me mere advantageous to just train extremely hard i should use the are exhaustion technique that you mention before yet our prefatigue as yo referred to it of sitting something really strong with an isolation exercise than doing compound exercises ism trying to think that on what you have told me that are fatigue and then a compound exercise in some ways it is not really two sets because if you are going to failure in horse straps you are pushing past failure then you are doing a compound exercise and you are doing that two or three times well that sounds four to six sets but the force repetitions are almost an additional set yet and it is not twenty sets but it is four to six really really hard sets that go beyond what we normally think of as a set totally skates is sorely a difference between running on concrete and running on one hand what i don't up for a sand run it is a very different experience totally yean this is why i should not mention this the very very beginning of or our chat to day but all of these numbers that will give you for any exercise adaptation you you you cannot think of them as hard lines they are radians and when we think about the number for i percriyou then terms of repetitions i said four to thirty would you think happens at three you think i perter to stops in fact the number you will seen literature's more six to thirty i actually slight it down to four though the personal presence because that but it just fade say what he think happens at re thirty one thirty five things it just fades really over time you actual wet have brought this up when in your questions and ism not sure if you are u thinking about this or maybe you were i just babbled on about something else but if strength happens between this one to five repetition range and i hypertrophy typically happens in this eight to thirty range what happens if i residue to sets of six or god forbid seven seven and nine are these numbers you just absolute do not do in strength training prase is that's one two three four five six got eight ten twelve do not program a set a third now ism train sets of seven and need well use cat's a seven allot m with walentrice cause you in actually count numbers mordant the bit but what happens in seventy nine granges this is actually wonderful area of these five to eight repetitions where you are going to get a nice combination of a lot of strength gains and a lot of hypertrophy some one is coming in going man i wantage stronger and a one ad muscle what do i do here will that's actually really nice answer train pretty hard in that four to eight repetition range and you are going to get a lot stronger and you will still induce a lot of hypertrophy if you want to really maxim hypertrophy i would probably spend most of your time in the eight to fifteen repetition per set range you can go up to thirty admittedly though i do not think it is obtainable to spend most of your time at more than fifteen rapper set it is very challenging to maintain the focus required at rap twenty seven to actually get sufficient failure by rather the you just you just give a join tour it is hard to do the same thing at the bottom and that spectrum ism terms of of really heavy to get there i really honestly think eight to fifteen is still it is clay shades that expect number but tit is a reason that is a tactic it is tried and true and very very very effective if for instance you want to get stronger though and not in vow a lot of hypertrophy you have a couple of tricks you can pull never one stay south of that five repetition ran you do sets of one set of to go as heavy as you can with appropriate considerations an stick within it may be even up to three reps preset you strive getting to four to five to six niagnastran itching towards that that hypertre are stay down there do a lot more total sets do a class example would be something eight sets of three i you can to get a lot of practice you can get twenty four very high quality rats with a lot of rest in between you go from there you go to managing colonic intake making sure you preaching is still on point you not a recover but if you are total calories are not a no greater than ten to fifteen per cent above your maintenance needs then you are not no to be able to put on a whole bunch of mussclemasky so just do not have the fuel for you can also then space your work outs out that times is not coming extremely often if you do that thing a couple of times a week it is not enough frequency and that signal remember that signal has to be frequent or loud you did not make it superload and now now making a superfrequent you can get very very very strong that and in put on very low amount of hypertext if that is sort of the choice you told us a lot about volume and frequency and how that relates to prating synthesis an recovery to evoke the hypertrivi adaptation respornin how should people think about systemic damage in recovery because obviously the nervous system and the wait interacts with the nor muscular system is the sight of all the action here world have a lot of the action and the nervous system can in fact become fatigued yvidbeon i has a great capacity but the whole system that were talking about can be worked to the extent that even if a muscle group the beeps or the back is being allowed to last while your training legs and other muscle groups that your whole neuron muscular system needs rest how does one determine whether not your entire body needs complete rest or or low level act to rest or exercise of a different kind a assure i wanton actually tackle is cause we are on the topic of hypertrophy ism assuming that that is the goal in mind here yes you are i asking specifically with right objects of hypertrophy i realize that for other training rolls the answer this question could be quite different of we actually sent couple of freeways let start local and work back to stomach right because a never one what you are really concerned about is at the local muscle level is them i get a great accessory damage and i do not new early mean muscle dam timing injury it ism the cettarulth only uses three to o ten an trims of soreness if you are more than three ut of ten an trims of soreness latest are to asking questions if you are higher than six at a ten were probably not training this is subjective total subjective measure right and you will you will know very quickly right if you if you can bear my graze your peck with your finger tip and in yin ah i do not care what you square that were not trying there is is no damn if you are three at a ten if yous ism kind of a little bit stiff here but when you get warmed up you pardon o k you are probably o k to proceeded that is is a very easy way to just think about ornis you gong to be a lit a bit tight to any on train frequency now fuming out to systemic we use hae whole host of things we actually have a a whole host of bow markers we out seen get a look the from blood you can look at things cretin kine that is the very common one marker of muscle damage am we will actually look at i ell the age will look a mile glibulane i that is just you've thing aba hemoglobin is the i is the molecule the carry's action throughout your blood a mil globin is the the part that that is actually in muscle when muscle it is broken down that get sleeked out putting your blood that is one of the markers actually can be associated with things radio which is a you you are see you yearn is purple it is extremely dark because you got much muscle break down the at happens and penny's go have a robin you put a much is up in there we use those mile markers we're curly also look at a probably couple things are your familiar with a t and a these are excellent mile markers of muscle break down if we are actually suspecting that this is a chronic problem ism organ actually go again pulse blood if its just ism superior today german use that subject or marker but if we are seeing this is constant man are we really pushing you way too much is there's some sort of systemic problem ism more going to blood an er look at all those different things now a s t total t is is really specific and i do not want to take us too far off track here but the ratio to those things is actually very important s well if you look at the a t to l t ratio typically the number will look at us one point six seven as that ratio is her than that you have a pretty high risk of muscle damage but really between you menu and a few of these listeners any time we starting s t out kick a t were immediately think as an dacha being higher than one ism remedially thinking that there is something happening muscle damage why i let's actually think you coed indicator of just total muscleman because the fast memory that is can be in muscle ism those are actually some markers that we a lot if muscle damage is a the thing wore concerned with if we are more concerned with things hotel training volume systemic overload then we may turn to something more sleep there is a lot of information we can actually get plane from changes in sleep i behavior in function i you can also look at things h r v harry very ability which is a very classic marker and much more sensitive to changes w training than something a resting her rate i which is which is one thing you can actually do that is totally cost free outlook at your changes and any elevation resting her rate over time especially more than three to five consecutive days it is indicator but are is much more sensitive ism two things training in ducked overlook that is a quick version of stuff that welkin a payattention do the last one i would a there is simply motivation if you are really training hearing you training heart and you just cannot force yourself to going you more that and of itself can be a good location of it may be not the day may be not the week ism with all of these things you want to be careful about over reacting to a single day measure again we t we need to look out at least a trend of more than three days honesty on looking to more than five days ism ominapll back from that and think about what phase of training were in what part of the year wherein topic tor at tutoring in season preseason possess and offsets in et centra to make our decision about what were going to do about it are we canning the entire work out are we do on modified conversion or intensity ism mi default generally if hi erchfese the goal remember volume is the driver there if i can can we get in can we go real light let us go to six to a ten or pe relative perceived exertion maybe will reduce the range of motion maybe wool make a lot of it easier may beg to machines or instead of going a squat will dust no a we sentiosonming that but i want still get enough volume in there that will keep you on target an any gain even going at fifty per cent not not to high repetition yo fifty per cent for a cent o ten three gets is get nice buffo hen there getting and get it out aid recovery and then move on an come back the next day that is probably what i would do rather than canning the entire cession how do other forms of exercise combine with hyper training for instance can i do party vascular training for two or three days per week provided that cart vascular training is of low enough intensity and not disrupt hypertrophy progression and can i do that cart f vascular exercise before or after the hypertry training or does it need be separated out the answer to this is really will recall the cross over our interference effect it is really an energy management issue the only time insurance cares are starts to interfere or block or hinder tanyoueight hyperchapy is in one of two broad characterizes never one total energy in take or your balance is off you can acierate this by just eating more if you do that then interference affect generally goes away the second one is you ant o mature you avoid exercise forms for your endurance training that or the same working group and specifically the eccentric portion for example we see much more interference with running on hi purchase than we we cycling wrist less eccentric pounding and loading less damage blessings to recover from the tissue seems to be totally fine the only other thngyou you t worry about here is total volume of your endurance work if your doing a a moderate intensity for a moderate duration say seventy per cent of your maximum parade for twenty five minutes it is unlikely o do much damage and terms of blocking i permeate your totally fine you can you do it before or after your work out it is probably not in a matter that much are it are fatigue is o cayfri perched if your or fatigue is coming from endurance than your totally fine not a bedel afterwards cool you ant to break it up into multiple session that is probably better right if you do your endurance work on a separate day that is probably best case minaret if you cannot do that but you can break it up into two work out say you lift in the morning than you do your conical cardie at night maybe that second best third best is doing it at the end of your lift and finishing it that is fine us make sure that your maximizing your recovery on all the other tricks will talk about later makes sure the cavalries ore there make sure not doing a lot of eccentric landing in that endurant stuff and you will be just fine and where does higher intensity cardie fit into a hyperghif you program i hirantensy cardie o for instance in my mind is getting on the assault by and doing om eight intervals of twenty second spring in ten second fatherland between or perhaps going to field an doing some bounds in spring farthings o that sort not going all out not a in a running for one's life but you getting up to bout eighty five ninety per cent of of running for one's life to we have a topless information on the potential interference or not of intensities of it the stuff we do have suggested and may actually aid in hypertrophy and that is because if you think about one the potential pat to activation a muscle growth is this metabolic a disturbance you are gig to get that a lot with the the hinters anerwill thing it is not a terrible thing to do i would not do it to the level that it compromises your ability to come back into your primary training your fatigue your legs are superheavy the pleaded you now have to invest act carbohydrates to replenish model again to be able to handle both recovery and curtaining et camera that could then lead yo a problem but in general we really do not see any reason why that is going to completely block or or make it such that your training was conical wasted or did not work an fact actually a very recent a study came out were they a had individuals perform six weeks of purely aerobic endurance study stay elongation endurance for six weeks i think prior to starting hypertry was compared that to individuals who did not do that and those folks that did these six weeks of just i think it was cycling actually just endurance work had more muscle growth at the end of their hypertry training than those folks it did not this shows you very clearly there are a lot of advantages that come with being physically fit to growing muscle folks tat also a have actually hit plateau lot one of the things you may actually see some benefit from is actually doing a woodmen more endurance work whether it is a steady state stuff maybe as of the hire intensity stuff ism certainly if your starting a training face it is a pretty good idea to do that and there is a number of of physiologic reasons of why that is potentially occurring but the the lowest hanging fruit here is week sort of job they you if you are unfit that your tying your shoes in your warm up and your already breaking a set you probably do not have enough phis fitness to do enough training to get enough hi perry that is in fact your limiting factor you are not recovering you are speed fatigued in damaged and sore because you are unfit get fit first and then you can actually get more gains we painter you have to count kick the and on the road for a few weeks but tan weeks later you will be in abetter spot than you r investing vitamin your conditioning sos you point out before and i can only assume you referring to me a hypertorretraining is idiot proof a meaning there is a lot of leeway in the variables but not much leeway that people can do anything it the yes bounded by these general principles with your permission ism going to do a brief over a view of my notes based on your description of the modifiable variables that we will dire somebody towards hipertrikeeping your mind this backdrop of exercise choice exercise order selecting appropriate volume that sets and raps training frequency and needing some matrix or way to have progression y either by adding more wads or by more tension or more medabalicstracts and on in terms of exercise choice it sounds the choice of exercises is not hypercritical interns of specificity but that the ideal circumstances that people are targeting all the eager and frankly secondary and minor muscle groups if you can even call them that across their exercise choices that they are picking exercises that they can perform safely and that they can generate enough intense that are getting close to failure without placing themselves into danger i on for some people that might mean including large compound free weight exercises squats in dedliffs and bent over bargain roads as well as isolation exercises and for some people there might be a by as toward more isolation exercises and machines but of course machines do not necessarily meanthat you cannot use heavy loads in fact plate loaded machines hammerstrangth machines allow for quite substantial loads picking two or three or more movements permuscle group can be valuable but that over all consistency is going to outshine variation in the sense that you do not need to hit muscles with a different exercise every work out coming back to the same things has a benefit and we heard about this in our discussion round strength and powers well kin terms of order of exercises there too it sounds there is a lot of flexibility one could do the large compound exercise for let us say a quadriceps and hamstrings includes first a a squat or a front squat were could did lift for that matter but then if one dead lifted in primarily hit the glues and hamstrings than you might want to target the quadriceps more directly with extensions or if one squatted and was loading that squalor carrying the squad barren away that was predominantly quadruped and let glue and hamstring then leg curls would be a good choice et camera of in train your cats folks very important unless you are genetic freak of course youacu good opportunity to say unlessyou are genetic free or you to have a genet predisposition or you have done sports and and you have a genet predisposition that gives you very large caps do not require any training it all i i know people this there there is somewhat rare but they are out there and those folks sometimes want to stay away from or minimize their training you told me that even if you have a muscle group that is a hyper responder in terms of hypertrophy getting at least one or two good hard sets per week is good because you want to keep functionality in that narc muscular system of it of in terms of volume again we have large run a variation is what ism hearing that the total number of sets per week is a strong driving force of program design and selection that ideally your performing ten to twenty and probably more fifteen to twenty set per week and that to be divided up across multiple workouts we are done in one work out but that is ten to twenty sets per week per muscle group not really taking into account indirect activation that would be ten to twenty sets for besets your back work is con your biceps little bit maybe a bit more depending on the exercise selection but it is really ten to twenty and given that hypertrophy can still occur in maybe n occurs better with more volume ye then do not include the indirect work unless something about the architecture of your body in the inability to engage certain muscle groups makes the a pull up really an arm exercise for you you have that right the way that i would maybe to find it is typical with movements week consider to be they're to be primary movers secondary movers and then tertiary that it is right if it is a primary secondary ism probably counting if it is tertiary or less ism probably not counting got it going back tour example of a pull up an example of plus i probably would not count the biceps and pull up it would probably count the bi sputtering a can would you count the rear deltoid in a pull up a probably not maymaybe li e it is depends probably not tho train the rear debts also that that is only honestly the reason i answer that is because most people do not do anything f the real day doubts anyways but they should right absolutely that is why don on account i want you to god your way to make sure you to something specifically for the real redoubts for aesthetics and for functional o have for health and and balance across the shoulders totally neck shoulder all of it ism happy to here you say this ism a huge fan of people doing rear destroy t work for all the reasons you describe end neck work for that matter i people forget that the neck is the upper part of your spine yean for postural reasons and for stabilization an safety reasons it is really critical but i think most people are not familiar with how best to train the reardeltoids and neck and i know a number of people are afraid of getting a big neck which for reasons that are still on clear to me is referred to as no neck but let us leave out that no neck comment for the moment wat er some good exercises for targeting the rear deltoids and neck safely that people can perform for realization and for hypertrophy i would recommend people check out epic dressy he is a a wonderful a strengthens ionic coach each is i think the director of pitching for the new york bankers now is that spell see a e excess i ye see are e excess e why i believe and he is got a facility in ai believe boson as well as in a florid he is very very involved in pitching as well as hockey an n things that ism he has many free videos and resources on a on much of the shoulder girl mostly because he he is dealt with overhead and throwing out the and the precision required their instrument o you want to be very careful when you start playing in this area because the wrong positioning of your scapula can cause a whole month of problems in your neck and low back and he would be a great resource to go take amok of that ism repay on how you are your scapulas are gliding and sliding and that the way that you want your rotate o cops firing ism you wrong boys there it is lek very complicated very quickly you want on more go there as a very very quick couple of answers om one of my favorite exercises is is lying on a bench or a putting some but gentian then is doing a reverse fly basically ism the reason i stabilizing the rest the body you can make sure you can focus on just using those reardolithis and putting a your scapulas in the right position now the is there is a specific at a chewing that you want the slap you the move down and back for again check out arc or any a number of folks in that area to do i but that that is a very simple way the reverse flip to get there great and then terms of new exercises is told to avoid bridges because they can cause damage to the disks we overly never do er i the rest of my life am i some metrics er are a great exercise for that because if you think about we awe are asking muscle groups to do and the neck you mostly wanted to be able to do a certain type of rotation a little bit of fleets in extension i handsome some other moments but in general it should be being stable ism see ant a walk through these joints but asking count what they do r they moving jointer they stability join in this case you want it whether i some ethics are going to put you in a much better position there is some actually pretty cool devices that you can wear and you can put him on your head nu can do all kinds of movement i an get some great trying there those are great starts but if you do not have any that just basic i sommectrics are greater to go about it i neckbriges would not beyond that list for ma no neck bridges folks in terms of says in repetitions we briefly touch on is but anywhere from i believe six repetitions all the way up to thirty re petitions but probably more in the eight to fifteen repetition range for hypertrophy most o the time yet and it'll just throw in there cause i love this idea that if you want to get a relatively balanced adaptation related to strength and hyperctovy that seven to nine range the a the no mans a or then no woman's a land of a a training repetitions always joking class coke we we go the whole thing right you one to five strength eight to twelve now i perorating like gray in course six to nine means nothing ill happen at all t i it is riding down like i good way to for everybody to remember that the our adaptations triggered in the sixty nine rearrange and it is a balance of strength and git you is it thrown out of any him that ism part of pugnacity do that a but the important point is to get close to failure and occasionally failure maybe occasionally throwing a forced repetition or a rest cause re rest than to a few more something that but those intensity increasing maneuvers will a require lo bit more attention to recovery either time or or attention in some other way and here is a little bit o care it all through ut people because people generally do not to be told to not go to failure that often i there is a handful half the folks are sweet how have to train that harden get there and those folks as i yes but also said you just cannot do a half work out you have to get pretty down clothes to failure and most people do not really know failure means for that group it is actually it still probably harder than you think you ought a train the other group though the once to completely blow themselves out every single time dragging them back it is more the key now for those folks here is what i can say if you make sure that your hidden stresses invisible stresses our completely taken care of you can go to failure all lot more oft and you need to dial those things in and the i can go hammer yourself because you will recover much quicker and we see this very commonly ism in all our programs with with our athletes and and are non athletes that when we get the rest of the hidden instar invisible stresses taken care of their training volume goes up much because the will just art coming back and tat as all my got ism not sorely more oh my got ism not nearly a sort i may you did this exact work out an countless times before and now ism doing it and ism not sore at all what they all we did not do anything different with the programming or really the nutrition but we got the rest of that astatic load under control and bone things take off slolike drivers many people seem to be riding the break and some many people seem oo heavy on the accelerator yet s like you hun the ways we describe it is you want to go faster people's inclination step one is to get the gas our our step number one is making sure your left foots not on the break you will go faster with less resistance which means you'lactually weary down the system a lot slower by just taking your foot off the break first if you freshen not going fast enough now we can push accelerator but ism not pushing that cellar waiter why your footstall on the break you can't go a look a faster but not as fast as you should be going without much work and you can start wearing down break peddles and things that that analogy hiding that ten to twenty says or week repetition range is pretty broad provide you get close to failure hit failure every once in a while could be the final set of oh exercise or maybe do one work out were hit failure on everything but thin you do not do it for many more gan that there something there is a lot of play in the system here rest ranges anywhere from thirty seconds all the way up to three or four minutes depending on how heavier training and how close to failure or to failure maybe en quoting beyond failure if there is such a thing your training a throwing in negatives and things that we did not get into really high intensity techniques but people again vary in extent to which the pushing the system but there does seem to be some value to mixing up the rest between set ranges across exercises and across work outs but you could combine them all in the same work out is what i heard yet and then in terms of progression it sounds to me the goal wen hyprtovy training is not necessarily to add more weight to the bar although that is one way one could do it but that the progression actually can arrive through this really extensive kit of changing the speed of movement changing a the number of says adding some volume a maybe changing the split that you go from a three day week full body work out to more of a embody parts one or two body parts per day every other day or two on one off it any number of different variations bitter out there sounds all of these can an will work provided that people are obeying the general principles of this a hypertrepe adaptation inducing protocol that you described and that they are meeting the necessary but not sufficient variables as well such as sleep ye nutrition and managing the streets in the rest of their life do i have that correctly yet that is really really good one more thing i to add is this is a situation for i perhaps in which there are some exercises that actually do not think our good ideas on a makes sure week we include those in the conversation that is not a surly case for strength you can really do i noterono and that is specifically plan metrics although in fact if you look at the there is a a recent review paper come not showing that this cliometrics are effective as well for i firth one can do almost anything as long as it falls within this parameter a the concepts are few in the methods are many and the methods for a perching are many many in general though cliometrics are not my first second or even hundredth choice a for hypertipy they if there are part of a total trying program and you gets om a hipertry result cool your lucky not the first place on gone the other major category are weight lifting variation that when ism saying way lifting a me specifically alembic way lifting has in snatched clean in her and their variations those are just not a good exercise choice is it that they do not work in just the risk the benefit ratio starts to fall pretty fast and a in the negative favor and sos is not worth doing sets of ten of a snatch unless your in a sport where that is the competition whatever but if the gold is simply hypertrophy ism toosdifferent exercises then not great i realize that we are going to do entire episodes related to nutrition somplimetation recovery et camera but i to just touch on two or three specific topics in questions that come up a lot around the question of hypertrophy specifically and that probably also relate to strain training in training for speed ism going to ask these in on not rapid fire tret it'll give you shorter answers cooper that i will ask these questions now but with the cofyaht that we will get into these topics in much more depth e very soon the first question is about the use of cold showers and ice baths and cold water exposure which i know many people use for resilient training to increase the dopamean which it does and for recovery but there is also this issue of when one should use cold that is deliberate cold exposure relative to hypertrophy training specificallyand that is because have heard that if deliberate cold exposure is done too soon after i have pertophy adaptation inducing work out yet and all the sorts of things we can talking about that the hypertrophy response can be blunted reduced or eliminated is that true and if when could people do deliberate cold exposure while still also including repertory training in their program and still get hypertrophy great ism a lover of the cold i i still have a deep freezer in my house that is filled with water at all times that is plugged in and and is a frozen chamber i still do the old school stay of it please don planet before you get in it oh yes absolutely and then do not do it by yourself that the lid close on topyou and the we do not see you sort of ever again o o the hon forfeit is time for me not greatest when these new fancy give amusing is for many years i love it i obviously have ben involved with exit and an gabbing laird and bring my density in these folks have ben doing tho suffer a long time of but i do not n know how many hundreds of folks in the ice and then of eateries there are a lot of benefits and we could talk about those later however that that being said it is very very true you do not want to get in the ice postie hypertry training you would not wont do that immediately after the work out you probably do not wont to before the work out you probably do nobly want to do at that same day it is is not worth it it will blunt i portray in specifically we have talked earlier about what is driving muscle growth is that signalling cascade through that gene expression to that muscle preaching synthesis cold exposure blocks that signal remember adaptation comes from stress you have put on a stress rand now you have block that stress you have literally blocked the signal that tells your body come back and grow arteries not a good idea to do it if you are training for some other purposes it may be strength maybe there is an argument there although maybe not ism for speeding power maybe get away the endurance may be a separate conversation if you are in season i have no promising it immediately after a gave the goal is entirely different even if we did a hypertricy type training program we are not doing it try at o ma dry to maxima growth and tow particular case our priority for a recovery is higher than our priority from must growth we choose optimization in that category you can only make those choices though when you truly understand what is the goal for the day the week the month the phase of training and really what part of the year yearn we have that all plotted out for for all the people we work with i know when we want to choose one over the other is not a this is the choice you always make such nation that is this not how we operate many more precision in though that being said we are gently not going to do it if we want to do a lot of icing during a phase in which we are i using a lot of hypertrophy we are go i do a couple of things not on we may just not use it there are phases in our training or i do not want a maxim's recovery ism not going to give you any tricks here ism not going to do ice or any the other methods were not talk about why because the whole point is to cause overlooked that's what is going to be to stimuli to cause adaptation if all ism doing his blocking that stuff attenuating it smashing a back down ism undercutting myself ism choosing to fill a little but better to have a little but better performance right now knowing that is going to compromise the result ism going to get six eight and twelve weeks for now i ism not going to choose it all in reality of it is if i really am trying to maxima hypertrophy ism probably not doing any ice work from that whole phase maybe my off day i know that similar to a set up you have one day a week when ism not training we will jump in some ice maybe even to some hot cold contrast ism i love the expetprota cellists were probably talked about it before it is a great set up ism or or dies not do it at all i it does not something we need when we do move into another phase of training were were trying to maxims adaptation or maxims the result and and get the benefit of that training now organ to hedge more towards recovery and we are to bring in some of these strategies in techniques and not worry about causing the most stimuli there cause we are trying to attenuate we were trying to actual lies the work we did six a and twelve weeks before what about cold showers do those have the same hypertrophy blunting effect and general no and general you can do cold showers that is notch be a problem you are not can be there very long and you are not can to get nearly as cold ism as you well submerged in thirty degree ice water foot that the we that we do it none the less i have no problem standing in the shower for a couple of minutes ism using it for other reasons if if you want to that snowshoe it'd to talk a little bit about nutrition and supplementation as it relates to hypertrophy doctored north who is been a last on he here in ladpodcastan we both no throughout a number range related to prove intake on the backdrop of how much proving synthesis can occur by meal across the day et camera to of lot of research done there an some important work by him in particular and the the value that he threw out was one point six grahams per kilogram of bodyweight being the lower and of the range up to i believe is it was as high as two point for maybeven as high as two point seven yet grahams of proline per kilogram of bodyweight per day that is a pretty broad range but it is on the higher end of what i think most people think of in terms of proline and take and then again some people might already be right there or may be even above that value of course this all depends on whether not people are omnivore vegan i meet base et camera we will not even go there but assuming people are getting enough proline per day somewhere in that range and they are spreading out that proline and take to accommodate the fact that the body can only assimilate a certain amount of proline in any given sitting what do you to see people in jest at some point post hypertrophy inducing work out in order to get the proline synthesis advantage if you will ye that is stimulated by that work out earlier you mention the u non the post training feeding window n in the nine see and probably earlier peopertime at o within the first ninety minutes you have to get the is amoral yo was it the even minutes of excuse me a certain number of grams of carbohydrate and proline et camera i think now the understanding is that that window as much broader am and how broad and et veterans is still a matter of debate but when somebody is training specifically for per hypertrophy assuming they are getting enough prone from quality sources in their other meals and assuming that there overall macronutrine and take and color can take is high enough that is they have enough of a caloric surplus that they have the the the raw materials for for hypertrophy what do you to see people in just at some point post work out in order to facilitate muscle proline synthesis and recovery and this could include nutrition and supplementation or if you want divide those answers out an peelfree do yet look at great tonal work came out a don lemons lighelex actually a land mentor as well as to chilies at my masker ton work there and we can answer a number of things here lanes numbers that he recommended also notice about a graham approaching expound o byway it is a great start now once you slide belowrhound right one gram expound right and earlierweres its s a to make sure wo cause ogler changing units here i was one point six grahams per kilogram of body weight all the we up to i think it was two point for bombers highs two point seven yet i grahams approving per kilogram o bodyweight two point to in that unit would be the same thing to on programs for kilograms the same as one gram per pound it dopannyo which are your listening at to this at one of those may be easier the the other for you i if you start getting below that number now you do start running into questions of proving quality proline type and proline timing this is of of the reasons why actually fully agree with lane is just get that number higher than you think and then all those other variables do not matter if that number is low then you need to start paying attention of bunch other stuff you have hat it now complexity or to your program things u got to pay attention to just stay high an need it does not matter and you mist leave a lot of the things off the table that seems to be fairly clear and in the work of some of his gentlemen i just mention that as long as you get to that total number the question about timing in types and quality it seems to matter a lot less in fact a a us recent work in dawn animal base proteins it really show that to be fairly clear that those are quite effective assuming total proving an take is high enough i the amount of loosing another amunaasses in those actual proteins matter less if the total threshold is superheight just do that in your fine now the other can't we have to say here is timing of mackernutrians is seems to be somewhat irrelevant for proline but that is not the case for car dehydrates that timing does matter replenish men of muscle again is very specific and you want to make sure that that is round a lot if you are doing either maintaining training quality or your sliding into endurance i work and restraint timing does matter with car dehydrates may be less e protein and certainly less with proline if the total proving egestion is high enough it depends on what we are going after in arms of a training i and where we want to get were shall this sings in general the waste we to thing about this is if you are doing a strength type of work were you are truly barging that then a one to one post exercise proline to car hydrate ratio is generally organiclafter this would be something thirty five grams of proving and thirty five grams of carbohydrate it does not have to be post it can be are or my favorite is actually mid i or post but somewhere in that rain especially if you are trying the morning and you have not consumed anything prior to your work out that is not utterly eating the mill of the work out that is drinking a dollars ye it is can to be i yet she solving a s hotshot a in the general though ism sure it is happened ye one to one is that sort of stand or number here if you are going to do sort of more of a really hard conditioning work out that number slides up to something three or even four to one which would be car hydrate to pooching ratio if we wont stay at thirty five grams of proline borgnago may be s highest a hundred or a hundred and forty grams of car hydrate get depending on what type of of training resorted going if you argon to do a little bit of a combination then you a little bit of strength the litlebit conditioning an kind of a standard work out which is probably something that a lot of people ill do then you may be want to go to something total one thirty five grams a proline sixty seventy grams of car hydrate and those are count just rough numbers that you can go by and for pure hyper you be training would yo o see people in jest from carbon hydrate post train for pure hyperchpy training i want to see that is many those neutrino around the training is generally possible now again i may change my mind when our fastinstady comes out but as it stands now there is no advantage ton not fueling around the training and there are some known and some other potential advantages to fueling i just see no reason to not do it i in fact most people are generally going to do better now this is not science this is just my coaching experience and this is with our athletes and all of our non athletes that we have worked with and do work with they are just going to be better spreading those meals out mentally throughout the day and there going to be better if they have those neutrons either premed or post and they are going to get even for i perched they aregoig to get something that one threetoon ratio of carves a preaching personal preference some people do not keep before they train some people have to eat before they train some people cannot nowt in food in their belly immediately after work around that you can you can play basted on personal reference but we want that feeling in there because we want a maximize that etenstof growth and we wanted just get a jumpstarn a recovery because we are onto be training again pretty soon supplementation is a huge topic and one that we will go into in great depth in e soon to our episode but if you had to pick one supplement that can benefit most everybody if not everybody for their training directed toward strange power and hypertrophy what would that supplement be and how would you to see people use it meaning how much should they take and when should they take it you if you do not count proline and carbohydrates as supplements they technically are but we just walk out right story i should be more specific ism not referring to a non food for mam proline and carbide powdered proline in part of powdered care hydrate et camera am it technicallear supplements their highly process but there a but ism not in cling that ism referring to a non backroom new trident type supplement ye dos testostfro account am well in the contacts i is was hundenigits a to the lost from the people are manufacturing themselves ah say the cheating kind an erogenous kind now a me cretin is they answer here without question it is the most well studied it is the most effective and it is a benefits are robust meaning they are going to confer positive adaptations across multiple physiological domain and we can certainly have a very long chat about some of the interesting things that people the fact we just had on daring candor on our barb showed pot cabstand he went into extensive detail about all the benefits of creating the people have no idea about including things boy general density you asked about the there creating is actually fairly effective for that ism let alone the thing a the benefit in things cognitive function decision making memory i the work that there is being done there for neurological disorders i depression a whole host of things at that creating is being studied for some of those studies show a lot of benefit some of it may be a little bits om none but there is a lot of things creating can do miso when we could talk about muscle recovery or massive perched am that is where the bulk of the research is and and and its very effective ism in terms of type creating on a his rate is still the best one and ask us because here is the largest evident space ism you can may be make some arguments for some other types but you are really going to reach saturation pretty quickly within a matter of weeks and there ism at a dose to jimanywhere between three to six grahams per day ism now five grahams is the very standard number we give reality is i change that number based on size that is just the honest truth i if you are two hundred twenty five pounds you are not on get the same dosage of creating as a hundred and twenty five pound girl that just this this is not wonbergan to do we may slide that number down a little let closer to three for t e the smaller a girl boy does matters female physical size if you are one of our two hundred and seventy five or three hundred and thirty pound offense of right tackles and the an a fell you are not going to get the same dosage everybody also that numbers going go up to seven eight in maybe ten grams to day there that is this kind of scale in general if you wont e nest answer five grahams is the standard take in after training the timing does not matter totallyour relevant take in the morning breakfast taken at night taken in time you not take et free we tend to put i in a lot of peoples ism work out i shakes just to make sure the get in not the day but the time is a relevant great well thank you for that very informative answer and i look for i to much more discussion about nutrition and supplementation and recovery and all the rest in the episodes to come this was incredibly informative thank you very much i appreciate the opportunity i had a great time

welcome to the superman labpodcans s gust science science pace to e proud i may injury superman and om a professor of neurobiology an opthemology at standard school of medicine recently i had the pleasure of hosting two live events one in seat washington in one in portend organ both entitled the brainbody contract where i discussed science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance my favorite part of each evening however was the question and answer period that followed the lecture i love the question answer period because it gives me an opportunity here directly from the audient to what they want to know most and indeed to get into a bit of dialogue to really clarify what are the underlying mechanisms of particular tools how best to use the tools for things focus and sleep we also touch on some things relate to mental health and physical health it was ha delight for me and i to think that the audience learned a lot i know that many of you were not able to attend those events but we want to make the information available to you therefore what follows this is a recording of the question an answer period from the lecture in portend organ i hope you will find it to be both interesting and in formative it'd also to thank our sponsors of these live events the first is momentous supplements which is are partner with the suberin labpodcasts providing supplements that are of the very highs quality that shipmaster national and that are arranged in dosages and single ingredient formulations that make it possible for you to develop the optimal supplement strategy for you and it'd also to think are other sponsor which is inside tractor which provides bloodtessandean ate you can monitor your immediate and long term health progress it'd also to announce that there are two new live events schedule the first one is going to take place sundae october sixteenth at the will turn theatre in lot evangelists the other livevent will take place wednesday nonmember ninth at the beacon theatre in new york city take its to both of those events are now available on line at superman labor calm slash too that superman labor calm slash tor i do hope that you learn from an enjoy the recording of the question answer period that follows this and last but certainly not least thank you for your interest in science what are the current best practices for post this dramatic brain injuries for those of you that i ware not familiar to i specially long termultipl et camera thoughts on hyperbaric poem glad you acts this dancing mortgage as treatment for t b is o k t b i one thing about t b in concussion everything's football guess what most of the t b i is not football there are not that many football players there just large they stand out there might be a f a her this evening of course football players are concern when it comes to t b i most head injuries are going to be construction orders if you ever seen the hardhats they wear those arivanof they they are just there for show it does not make sense and that we act my have a habit stamphord that is focus very hard on try to solve this problem construction workers carat and bicycle accents portend amazing city to cycle ism frankly afraid to cycle or small moving object around these big objects and people are staring to their lie aperture on their phone while driving i mean whatever happen to that by the way o not text while driving somehow it that just disappeared it is it really has just disappeared there was all the science showing that it is worse than drunk driving t t be i well the basic rules of the do not apply if you get ahead injury do not get a second ahead injury but that often is in feasible for people that need to work continue working construction or that are struggling what do we know well this is a great opportunity for me to distinguish modulatory foundational tools from things that directly change your brain in ever system the way that you want to what do i mean by modulatory we hear much and there many studies showing that great sleep quality nutrition good social interactions avoiding chronic stress and on and on and on are important for everything reduce there related to alshimers there related to eighty egg to i mean we could do thousands of podcast episode just returning to the same ten things sleep not do not trust too much or too long good social connection of vow toxic people eat good food not too much process food we could have an argument all night and i do not want to have one about weather not its mainly plants or this i mean on the inner this obviousleep eating huh quality food o something that we shall be doing which foods you select is a topic that is very barbed wire and i can give only my opinions all of that modulates your brain function but it does not immediate or change anything directly it is setting a foundation of what is possible we should all be doing those things and especially people who have the my now this question relates to hyperbaric chamber hyperbaric chamber there is very interesting davit is essentially hyperoxygenation of the brain for very brief periods of time i think the date on hyperbaric chamber and the are very encouraging the problem is much in the way that a few years ago crib was only available in a few places and now people a doing ice was and cold showers on their own it is hard fine to hyperbaric chamber they are not just laying around and they do not have them at spas typically and they are quite expensive yes they there are interesting and important date think on hyperbaric chamber you deftly want to work with a physician or somebody who is very skilled a practice shiner who is very skilled in hyperbaric chamber they do seem to improve bring function by hyperoxygain the brain for brief periods of time seem s to improve a number of things but above all it seems to improve the quality and duration of sleep which indirectly allows the brain to repair itself because as i mention earlier brain repair occurs er brain change largely occurs in sleep if you do not have access to hiperbare chamber but you do have t b i what are some of the other data what are those point to well i go on and on and you do not have to get this from supplements you can get it from food but this threshold level of essential these e p essential lady acts they are now many data much data on the valuable roll of these essential e p a lady acids thresholds being somewhere between one and two grahams per day of the e p a much actually that there now prescription forms of e p a that doctors are starting to prescribe for people with t b e although for most people you can get this through you can look up and we have done podcast episodes about different ways to access this also functions as an aunt depress and equally good believe stare not in clinical trials to assess or eyes it once one gets over the one or basically two grahams per day of the e p a the the resident expert on the internet about this is pretty extreme about the dosages in that doctor on to iatric who by the way deserves a a nod of of acknowledgment and support because turns out that before me or davits and care or mat walk or any these guys were blabbing to the world about stuff that they had learned in the our lives of science and in their laboratories the first person in was this woman name onto trick as far as i know the first public facing formally trained scientists to start going on all these podcast in risk her reputation in the this kind of stuff that you deal with when your put your knockout there that and anacondas i think terrific at we do not agree on everything and they would be weird if we did but i think she is really been the proposing of of these overdoses of e p as for t b e and for cognate function in to all ages we often here about ways to increase jopemin however are there effective ways to decrease opening when you get to much of it for certain behaviors or habits we want to break kat ham i think is the last name thank you kat for your question yet dopamine is i is a slippery slope and doctor onolemky is the expert in this and we have had a lot of conversation she is one of my closer friends on the faculty unfortunately for her are coffee discussions often last four hours or more her portions and family a here is the thing when dopamine is higher in your brain and body when you have deployed it through excitement or farm a college or otherwise it tends to narrow your focus and make you seek more of it in that general theme that you happen t be focussed on could be anything that is the scary thing about dopamine what can you do to control it and to re use it well for those of you that are engaging in habits that are healthy maybe that does not require reducing dopamine how do you define healthy verses unhealthy well i think the simplest way to define addiction at least by my mind is that a diction is a progressive narrowing of the things thatching you pleasure and a good life is a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure rather simple definition and yet when we think about the biology of dopamine i doubt dopamine is not unique to one pursuit it is not unique to pursue the pursuit of sex of the pursuit of warmth when you are cold or or cool environments when you are to warm or food or social media it is just a dommolecule that puts you into this forward state of mass small visual aperture and a kind of obsessive nature what can you do to counter that well the best thing to do is to not get into that state too long but if you do the best thing you can do it is to try and switch off that system not through pharmacology but by not pursuing more dopamine the day after a big event the called postpartum depression named of course because of true postpartum after the delivery of a child that quite common for people to get very very depressed there is a lot of no chemical and hormonal adjustments that are occurring but different types of postpartum depression occur after a big party the money blues the sundae blues the post whatever blues the four month mark and a relationship it is typically when dopamine starts to draw i always tell people just wait ism telling somebody very close to me right now just wait four months four months four months and also spend as much time with that person as possible i do not know what this deal is about not spending as much time with people i think people are afraid that the dopamine wavepool is just can o pull them both under i think they've called at the escalator model of relationship were you o sort of find yourself in the relationship because you went through the stages without actually deciding on them in any event four months seems to be the stage in which the dopamine crescendo starts to relax a little bit not in a long distance relationship however we know this right anticipation is dopamine that positive anticipation and there is a whole beautiful science of this in the and i should say psychology of this there is a wonderful book actually the name of the book is embarrassing always i do not know for me to say it is at it is by psychalle is called in love last which is at a psychoanalytic book about this dopamine ceratonan system and the kind of see sawing back and forth and the fact that in relationships people often just slam on the dopamine side of things and then they hit a wall and want to break up where they go into this warm cosy fuzzy feeling thing and they go hell i guess the exciting part is over and this idea that one could actually or too people or however many people were in portend could oscillate this see saw i do not think that you want to use farm a apology to turn off the dopamine system but for people that have a hard time sleeping and that are really in a state of agitation and constantly obsessing the psychiatrists one of the oldest and most effective treatments is that the psychiatrists and this does have to be prescribed will use a very very low dose of a dopamine receptor blocker haliparadol which is a use to treat skis offend a very low dose to shut down the obsession component smart well educated psychiatric know this as a useful to but this is at one time thing with a very low dose because having your dopamine block socks it does not feel good but not being able to sleep and being an obsessive mode also socks it is silly a very potent clinical tool form apology should is one tool but really at the far end of things i believe that one should try and modulate their own dopamine by not rewarding one self on a regular basis but only randomly random intermittent reward is truly the best schedule of reward hence slot machines and on and you should engage random interment in reward and i think this is also the way that we should train kids a sent i call training kids you can sell ado is the you do not reward them every time i do not believe everyone should get a trophy every time nor should you always just reward the winners because those winners off and we see cases of this high profile cases of this they often crash and burn main the number of huh performers that crash and burn publicly and for knows how many do it privately is remarkablat's cause their dopamine system is all messed up random intermittent reward is the schedule reward that we should impart on ourselves if you had ten minutes a day to improve your brain places what would you do and when would you do it richer conman thank you well ism going to say again i would absolutely anchor my physiology with morning sunlight viewing i cannot help it it is interesting it'll tell you very briefly you know at special about morning sunlight this low and solar angle sunlight i have i only have talked about this much on social media or on the podcast there is a group at the universe washington a couple ja and marine nights they run a lap together that sounds a horrible thing but they do it and they get along very well and they discovered that the sells in your eye the neurons that set your circadian clock make you alert during the day and make you sleepy at night and on those sells respond best to yellow blue contrast and orange tones now this is important because when you go out in the morning even if it is not at sunrise but it is close to sunrise or you look at the sun in the evening what you will see is yellow blue contrast or orange yellow blue orange at old thing from kindergartener first grade that is not the color of light that you are going to see when the sun is overhead now this also is really interesting because artificial lights at least to mime understanding even the daylight simulators have not picked up on this there is just about bright light some one ought to design something that can mimic this but nature has done this beautifully for just and viewing low solar angle sunlight in the morning and in the evening is most effective because of those yellow blue contrasts now here is the really wild thing those circuits that set your levels of alertness and sleep yest they respond best to yellow blue contrast but what that tells us is crazy what that means is that color vision was probably not related to color perception first because all of that is completely subconscious the pathways that do this our present in people who are pattern vision blind is what do i mean i mean that color vision likely evolved from a need to synchronize your internal state with the external world and the best stimulus in the outside world to do that is yellow blue contrast in other words our ability to detect color was first and foremost and we understand this spared on evolutionary genomics and forth to extract time of day information not color of fruits or color of skin or anything that that is all secondary which is wild and crazy and this is yet another example of the way we think things work is not the way they work it is completely a hundred degrees opposite ism just can evealla teaser i had a guest on the podcast isn't we have an air the episode yet his name is epic parvis he works on speech and language also has admitted the alvenily dance company again who are these people is a professor of the rockifellor anyway i learned from epic and you will learn when that episode comes out that you only find a elaborate speech and language in species that also engage in dance and song and that you nomen point to the fact that song and singing came first and language came second and that led me during that episode of the podcast i wrote down in my notes i was listening to him talk and i wrote down in my note book is just scrawled and big letters is as i am happy right now i was just blown away i could an it make much sense when you hear it that this colors in the sky were what we our system is trying to extract not a perception of those colors in the sky cause there informing us about time and orienting us in time that song and the communication of emotional states would be simpler and more foundational than communication about specific patterns of language when you hear it suddenly it make sense but of course were human beings and unless your epic parvis or alichromer on olempky you think about all the stuff backwards as i do how can i navigate my way through taking supplements to optimize my health when my career demands a infantry prevent me from being able to stablish consistent brucines andriagan will thank you for doing what you do drew the consistent routine thing is tough here the here is what i can say without going into a long to and half hour piso n about jetlag shift work which we have done the most powerful way to anchor your brain and body and time is indeed viewing light sunlight at consistent times of day that is not something i made up we we know this based on a lot of work the dates back to the nineteen thirties the second most powerful stimulus is going to be movement and changes in body temperature in prertular increases in body temperature ten to make us alert and decreases in body temperature and to make us sleepy body temperature drops one or three degrees to get us into sleep why does a could shower wake you up a adrenaline as released in believer not your bodies heating up internally to combat that cold unless you make yourself hypothermic son hot baths to get sleepy cold showers ice was et camera to wake up sort of obvious when you hear it but it is counter intuitive because you think o heating up the body to wake up and cooling down the body to go to sleep getting into could to o cool me down but your body compensates just if you throw a cold towel on a thermostat you crank up the temperature in the room an vice for for heat of what you do you want to try and use as many of these things light temperature exercise food when you eat is typically associate with waking very few of us are capable of eating in our sleep and then the other one is social activity and rhythms now that the discombobulated person as can be the person that has not a lined these things and a consistent way while schedules vary and admit do not know your exact schedule what i can say is if you suddenly go from daytime behavior in sleeping at night to the called vampire shift as it is called in the military and suddenly your up the middle the night in your sleeping during the day than when you come off that shift what you want to do is trying combine as many of those same things at one time it would beget your sunlight go joking without your sunglasses drink your coffee engage with other people and communicate eat a meal afterwards or s the case may be before try and bring as many of those things together the same time of day for a feu days and pretty soon you systemic map around that the reason i encourage for those of us that are not doing shift work to try and be fairly consistent about sunlight viewing is it sets in motion everything else that is correct but if in terms of timing of eating appetite will follow when your alert will follow you will struck to learn your own rhythms when you cannot control your schedule try and combine as many of those cues again light temperature exercise food social engagement into one period of time and trying lock that into a more or less a one or two hour period or plusher ileus one or two hours at a particular time of day for at least two or three days and your schedule beaning your internal clocks will lock to that how a social media changing our brains homes at well you hear you hear all the terrible ways in which its changing our brains and i think that again i we go back to the thing is is it the aperture that were looking at as it the format that were engaging in things or is it the content well the way i to think about the phone is the way that we have been engaging with the phone and the lap top for that matter in staring into the small visual aperture each day is sort of walking this all day long right we have this amazing ability to shuffle our feet and take small steps or to take big strides to run to move think that is the sagittal plain for movement i know it for the rainout always mes the its ore vicious people on line by the way the its and neuturcian people have learned to just not not say anything abut that ism not a p t and ism not physical therapist and the they do incredible work but their it is a very spirited crowd and the neuturcian thing is really weird how there i ms just incredible you areyou that people are either throwing liver at you or they're throwing celery at you or there is their fasting or there not fasting it is not in any case the social media and staring at a small visual aperture is changing our brains here is one way i know in which it is changing our brains and then it'll ellyou how to fix it if you stare or look at something to within two feet of you for a certain umber of hours each day your eyeball actually gets longer and the visual image then is focus in front of your neral retina not on to your nerd retina and you are becoming myopic near sighted and if you look at things in the distance enough guess what your eyeball changes shape and your lens will focus appropriately the image on to your retina take some work kids that look at things up close too much and adults to look at things up close much become near sighted and there is a beautiful set of clinical trials now where mainly in kids if kids get outside for two hours a day getting a lot of this u v b and blue light that we are told us terrible for us but they get it from sunlight they actually can reverse my open reduced the incidents of my open maybe even glaucoma although that is a big many how much staring into a small visual aperture is too much i do not know but what we do know is that we are literally becoming myopic in terms of our vision and we are becoming myopic and terms of our cognition and then there is the whole business of what is actually contained in those tweets and those social media feeds and those new stories which frankly i feel you lose either way whether or not your one political camp or another political camp your upset about half of the information out there i feel i ut i and ism not a not some one who knows how to talk about politics without stumbling i did not do well in social studies ism n this sort of thing it just never make sense to me just felt the the the prize goes to the person who can shout the loudest and the most coherently for a moment but i encourage of course people to be politically active and i vote but but the the content is tricky to navigate and i cannot really speak to that except that it seems to be bothering everybody on one side or the other or in the middle and the format is something that we really understand and again i do not know of many people that are talking about this narrow visual window format thing it came up ordering the lock downs when we were all inside a lot and not looking out at a distance the the data say really to try and get at least ten minutes of long distance viewing longer than ten feet away from us for every thirty minutes of close up viewing and not a lot of us ore doing that if you are walking to your car looking at your phone yore definitely losing an opportunity what new piece of neurological research are you most excite about mytalmen o i think the the piece of neurologic research that i the weird stuff i got this am colly et stamford tony wise's sorry and the really into taking literally taking proteins from young blood and young spinal cord a cerebral spinal fluid and putting it in to older people an animals and they get younger that is tut pretty wild the legal transplant stuff is pretty wild right you take the microbial from one person and as it sounds you transplant it to somebody else and they take on the physical characteristics of the downer crazy until i talk to my can there some shouts for legal transplant is i have never read the method sections of those papers ism actually afraid to read the method sections i i would say this is not a neurological but at the work from cries gardener and just soninburg also at stamford it make us to i just staffer stambrsere but the are the people ism closest to ingrown aby there excellent places everywhere of course including o i just see what ism not just saying that cops ism here actual close colleagues here and friends here at i each just you also amazing although that tram thing freaks me out it i i always just have alleys ideas about what's can happen if that thing breaks but the the the microfilm date are really interesting i never understood why getting your got microbial was important and it turns out it is because you are got actually makes many of the narrow transmitter precursors that your brain uses that is pretty cool and i was thought it would be a complicated thing to get you got microfilm right but it turns out that it is fermented foods that seem o have the biggest of fact there is all this argument about fiber in yes fibers important and here i am getting nervous talkingabout nutrition cause the people can come at me with fiber but the but it is very clear from just and chess data that people who are getting four servings to day of these of fermented foods whether not its fishy or sour crow or combuchall it that stuff actually seems to encourage a health the got microfilm and people feel better in the men system works better and i this because it actually a it resolves in issue which is that hide robotics these very expensive i need to be refrigerated things those actually can create brain fog and other issues there for real severe cases of disposes always an instance where one can look to foods which are good cause i to eat in order to resolve these issues in terms of other a neurologic issues i think that frankly i chink the stuff on dopamine is is is fundamentally important much addiction that is a severe case but also much waxing and waning of of motivation and once you understand the dope men system you say what activities o my engaging in or farmacollogy my engaging in what am i doing to spite dopamine you start oh i get it the waves in this wavepool are too high and that is why i cannot do this consistently and then you do the the counter intuitive thing of approaching things with a little less excitement but then you are able to do them more consistently ah and maybe with some luck all and finishing this book having working on for four and a half years are the consequence cause i cannot seem to thinking about the whimhoff method do you believe it how is it really working what process is happening in his brain o boy am malison camera everyone here brolly familiar with wimhoff whose a occupation on wiccapedia used to be dare devil daiscool a evil can evil add and whim hat i a story about whim actually en twenty sixteen i heard about the sky whim of and i got a hold of him actual his a children and i had one vacation that year and i flew to spain and i spent some time mountaineering with whim which was absolutely terrifying i almost lost a leg legitimately i tied in wrong on a bridge sling he told me it was good for me he told me to stare into the liters es and i armed into the lizard eyes that jumped backwards off this home made bridge sling thing and i had the rope wrapped through my leg in it i came back with basically the tending on the back of my knee exposed and sitting next to me on the plain was our vice dean of research at stamford and i had to explain to him what i was doing and why it was very embarrassing what did we do on that trip while a couple of things that will hep me answer your question first of all when i arrived i suffer terribly from jet lag but the moment i got their whim did not say hello he literally told me to get into the ice bath and i did ten minutes in the ice bath not because ism toff but because he held me down in the ice bath he is indeed one of the strongest human beings you reminds me of the bus driver on the siphons or the janitor excuse me no a auto is the bus driver right that the janitor on the siphons a use i that is whim incredibly physically strongly what do i thinks going on with whimhof a stuff well whim off whether not he understands it or not i was think he sort of the bond million of breath work everything he says seems to have some intuitive since we do not really understand what in the world he saying skin a come after me now we have had we have had a good but complicated relationship it'll just confess may we some they will resolve that a no big scandal story there just we communicate very differently am whim has a couple methods one is to deliberately hyper ventilate there is also all tumor breathing my lab actually studies this we have a paper the am happy to share with you the result though they are not publish yet where people do deliberate sickly my preventilation which as the name suggest you just breathe really deeply in and really deeply out twenty five times or if your whim you say you no not enol just tell you here is out works you go you gat twenty five times and you heat up and you feel really agitated and that is because of a adrenalin if you throw yourself into an ice bath or cold shower a adrenalin if somebody upsets you ore you get a triggering text a adrenalin a adrenalin sounds a terrible thing except when you deliberately induce it as my collie avid eagle says there is a big difference between going into a state and you controlling you are entry into a state it is not just about the state you are in it is about how you got there and whether not you had anything to do with it states of high drennalind our very powerful when you self induce a adrenalin by cold shower sickly hyperventilation a c a whimhoff breathing or tumor breathing you then have an opportunity to create a very distinct mind body relationship we all here that in terrorseption and the mind body relationship an torreception just your ability to sends your heart beats and what is going on your body powerful right terrible if how you feel socks an terriception is wonderful but when you are anxious it actually is it more adapted to be able to maintain your thinking and get yourself out of that anxious state if you are trembling in your body's freaking out and your cheeks are flushing and your and your brain is following your bodily state well that is not good and if you are somebody and sadly this happens a lot where you have experienced a lot of from or typically this a people have been boarded with extreme criticism or physical abuse or other kinds of abuse during development the action can seem very calm but internally they're freaking out in their head in they are just think you just get me through this and they just go into a state where no one knows their upset have known people this and it is ere to me because have never had that response to stress but it is very common and we should learn and be careful about deciding that people are in one state or another based on their bodily or their mental response whim off breathing cold showers et camera or a great practice in my opinion because they allow you to spike cure a adrenaline and you can do that for instance by making the water colder if you want more a adrenaline staying in longer if you want more a adrenaline moving your limbs around in the water will give you more or adrenaline cause it breaks up that thumb layer it makes it a lot colder or doing fifty deep in has and exams that is very useful because then you have the opportunity to use that prefrontal quartan and to stop and sense all that a adrenaline in your body and yet maintain clarity of mind and that is and absolutely powerful tool i would even call a power tool and whim figure this out i do not know if this but the way that whim discovered all this was he was in deep grief about the tragic death of his wife she committed suicide jumped off and ate story building it just truly tragic that and he was and situation yet four children at the time now he as five and he was in a state of depression and he ended up going into the canal in amsterdam and it was very cold and t shocked his system and in that shock to system which is caused by a adrenaline he somehow was able to anchor his thinking and in a kind of genius of sorts whim well i can intervene in my physiology with this strange activity and they realize that breathing would do it as well you did not have to get into cold water and then years later we discovered not we meaning my lab but other labs that when you get into cold water even just sixty degree water that there is a very long lasting increase in doomed that is two point five ex above base line which is on par with some prescription drugs for increasing dopomean when people laugh at me o this cold water thing i at tease a lot on the internet have heard on the internet that i that i eat sticks of butter which i never said i said i i said i butter have been told have been told all sorts of things have been told i eat sticks of butter i do not inn why have been told that ism dead that was an interesting one that is one of the cooler ones the but when i was going out there is a serious scientist and saying using deliberate comics pot you can use all sorts of things or i you coif you come to my lab be be happy to put you in via and expose you all sorts of scarystufor we can inject you with a adrenaline or you can inject yourself with a adrenaline and titrate that it just the levels of that it's a very powerful tool and i think that whim and others deserve credit for really tapping into that and as a last point there is a beautiful study in the proseengs in the national academy a sciences years ago using this deliberate cyclic i preventilation thing twenty five breath and then another group meditates and then they inject them both with e coal eye and the people injected with the goalie who meditate get nauseous vomit diarrhoea and they get a fever and the people who first far fewer symptoms if any why because a adrenaline actually suppresses a lot of these innate immune responses in a way that is healthy in the short from this is why you can workworkworkwork work where you can study for finals you can take care of a loved one and then you finally stop and rest and go on vacation and then you get sick stress activates your nervous system and in doing it activates your runs as to makes perfect sense when you think about it how would we ever go through famine if you are just getting flues whenever you are stress we can deal with a lot might suggestion is if your coming off a period of high stress to do some sort of a adrenalin spiking behavior as you taper out of that stressful period not going strictly to message vacation and gander all day long as i would reflectively do can red light there i be help street exercise in tolerance and fatigue and mite control disease malison i ism glad you've brought the sup there t this is another case where i thought on this red light stuff is crazy and then i gent into the literature and turns out that in nineteen o eight the about prize was actually given for phototherapy there we go again and here have the slide i chose not you slides to nigh but i have the slide that shows a can key in the magic boss and stuff from the nineteen thirties and psychedelics and people getting into cold water and then here we are twenty nineteen twenty twenty have got win off and mat johns giving people macrocosms of suicide and we are right back where we were and one of my major goals is to really trying create some scientific discussion around these things the stuff is crazy on the face of it but there are mechanisms that are real that underweight red light because it is long wave length light longer literally as supposed o shortwavelingth light can penetrate through things skin and can indeed change might ocondria one of the more impressive results on red light comes from my good friend glen jeffrey's lab at the universe college onion now glen for years a few years o was he basic vision scientists and a few years ago he stare to using red light you would have people look at red light at a distance of about two feet in the mornings is long wave length light and sometimes even just take a flashlight a torch as they call it in inland and cover it with a red film and they would look at the stuff for a few minutes each morning and it can reverse some forms of age related vision loss and macula degeneration how we now know it can prove mytoconreal function in photoreceptor by reducing what are called react of oxygen species here is what is interesting it only seems to work in people older than forty and it seems to only work if you do it within the first three hours awaking and the incredible thing as you can do this for one or two minutes a week and some of the positive effects last as long as three weeks and it is effecting a very specific form of visual improvement which is a city con find detail stuff in my particular wave lengths o particular color is an objects and things pretty impressive yes red light can improve my tocondural function to the photo receptors if you are in a trying do this stuff do not put it to close i do not have any affiliation any red light parole company i cannot say anything there they are rather expensive nowadays people are putting red light everywhere and i do mean everywhere people bring red light on their stomach for improving a very function whether i can penetrate is in clear to me clothe we down their people are trying to do this ah ah eve a friend i will not name him recently to me is really into the red light therapy is putting it on his testicles to trying increased testosterone but he told me that after he handed me the red light trust my tam noses is it is non on my t miginisisi ah that is the superinteresting i act you do not think you want a contact the red lights directly to your skin red light is powerful i do not think we have aside from the vision protocol i do not think that it is clear which protocols are best i will say your into red light in for red sand typically those do not get hot enough typically if you want to get the benefits of sand you want to get between eighty and a hundred degrees sexiest which is hundred seventy six to a to ten your to eight ferenheight and not i do not actually do the conversion on my head i memorize it you mention the consequences of lasting a in with too much dope o me is a possible to overdo ice swell falling the same line of thinking we experience extreme low an dope om you too many iceboat luck uni thank you for the question any behavior that spikes o diurnal and you will eventually get better at tolerating it you will become cold adapted and you will become comfortable at hie adrenalin states and you just have to ask yourself this it is just lifting weights in the him are running you need to leave some space for improvement if you run as people do and you do your half merit your five tan your ten k than your half marathon maybe a ten is a half marathon i i do not know but anyway then your doing your marathon than you are doing ultras that are fifty miles and hundred miles i mean eventually you are on start doing damage right and eventually you'll gat every ultra runner and typically these are people who are very much of the do omen pursuit system i man i do not think that he would mind my my good friend and a postmaster y have tremendous respect for is you n a rich roll amazing human being and also as a amazing story about a diction it was an alcoholic ism not sharing anything that he has an already shared it is amazing book finding ultra he got really into running running running all the time and there is a dope of mean history there for him some of us can house ice was consistently and making it cold and doing them longer and longer that indeed your playing with the dooming system is it bad well depends on what your trading that in for you might the expense of what as a giving up cocaine yet great stick with the ice bath but can only make it cold and toucan only stay in there long before you become whim off right and it worked out for whim but there is really only one whim off and in general that is that speaks to a larger theme which as i love the idea of people using tools and understanding mechanism i mean of course i love that it is what i talk about an think about much of my my life but for most of us we do not make a living doing those things and i do think that the ideal situation is to have behaviors in tools that you intersperse throughout your day and throughout the week for instance i think three times a week is fine for the ice bath no one said you had to do it every day but you should see sunlight every morning if you can just because it if you miss a day your system will be fine just spend twice as long outside the next day seriously cause it is a slow integrating system but for most of these high intensity things the less often you do them the more powerful they are in fact if you get into a very hot sand for for excuse me thirty minute sessions on one days you go thirty minutes get out for five minutes thirty minutes get out for visited three minutes get out for two hours a day in then that is a lot of sand but the growthhormon release from that type of protocol is a sixteen as import increase in growthhormwhen this has been measured inhuman or as if you do it every day or three or four times a week you get diminishing returns on that i actually a big fan of doing really intent stuff only every once in a while this is also i only take one long run per week ere one long height first of all didn't have time for it ism not an ultra runner i got other things to do and second of all it is a strong stimulus ism sore until tuesday or i do not want a run until tuesday anyway i actually think that is fine and i actually en courage and of more healthy rational schedules of these kinds of behaviors there is no rule that says you have to do something every day even if you are trying to engage mineral plasticity you can learn french or an instrument by practising three times a week as long as your practise is very focused i daily perhaps would be better but very few of us have the opportunity to do things every day consistently and have really ontencourage of more balanced approach before working through trash or what is the base o coldness graces the skateboarders are always in the house my first anon biological family was escapeboarding community when i i have great relationship with my parents now but because there was a time when there was no one to go to soccer games or doing g that stuff the scape work community took me in cause therefore no parents involved it was great there are no refers or coaches as didn't authority and it was it was blossom and there was no nutritional plan you drank your slipping you sat on the curb and it was fantastic i do not do that any more but the scape working communities one that i have remained close with i did right for thrasher under a different name while i was appose of to make some extra cash you will not find those articles anywhere i hope they are not very good and i be scape your li was involved in it enough that it'd this only make sense three people in the audience but i decent heel flip i could knoll better than i could only and i was never very good and i just other more scalpers than of why well say though as yet to be very careful escape orders cause i do not want to claim that i was any good any any success i had was out of sympathy of others for letting me hang around it was is a great community and it gave me great appreciation for indeed communities of kids that do not have a structure and and sports leagues and teams and all that kind of stuff nowadays it is it is rashly a much different landscape and i have to also say what it is really amazing to see all the incredible girls and women scape orders also there were none it is a limbic sport now for women and girls and for and and it is only import for for boys men to it is it is awesome to see that community o k what are your favorite ransacks for doing horrid things ranging from cold exposure to getting through getting through selection hope darling thanks for the question ya who hard things well it'll it'll be honest i learned how to hack into my a adrenalin system a long time ago through the worst possible mechanism which is that i would set up battles in my mind i would i wouldn't into competition with people imagined or real or i would i get into states of fearing a shame and screwing up i would you can this is what a lot of people do i think you hand up scaring yourself into trying to do the hard thing and it works the problem is it it feels rather i a downward spiral because those negative states of mine work to liberate a adrenalin and get you in in through hard thing being you to as a kind of rebellious kid can resistance was if some one told me i could not do something yet try me this kind of thing and i is i mention before i was not crazy about authority and that was the method for a long time and then then i started reading liver saxes books and i started learning from people who seem to access things through this whole love thing and i tried that loving kindness meditation thing an that did not work and what i started doing is i actually it'll just tell you when i before i came out here to night and before i do anything challenging i had i just actually to imagine the people that have supported me it is it is a weird tool it only have ever shared ism actual slightly embarrassed to share this out cause hereon two things that make me cry and that is talking about my bull dog and talking about my graduate adviser and i if i talk about any longer i proudly crypt i think about them a lot because hewer kind of similar they were kind of o artery and they were hard on me and and i adored them both and i these days i try and think about people that ah that really that i love and i have been trying to do this whole doing things from a place of love thing and for me that is animals and people ah that i love has and how we now now i am better move on ah thank you looked they are telling me one more question ism going to answer one what do i fear how do you manage your fear came gosh this is on a turn into a known ton me satisfied until i cry i get it i get it i do cry but again about the things i mention before i realize something by the way we just record an episode on grief t has not come out yet a fascinating topic a i realize at one point by the way it'll just give this away that i thought i was really sad about losing them i thought i would tear up really easily because o sabayon them but then i realize this gash cant we woman do this but i realize that feeling that i was feeling is the exact same feeling of love that i had when they were alive grief is love and when you look at the literature's it is basically that but your brain is freaking out because that map of knowing where people are in space and time grief is basically a remapping of the space where are thy time when are they and then this a kind of abstract map representation that we call closeness and grief is this process of ripping ourselves off of that in any event what do i fear talking about things this what do i fear quite honestly the my biggest fear the thing that would just make me feel just horrible is i i fear letting down my friends i have an amazing i love my family and they are wonderful but i have this in incredible relationship to friendship and i just i adore my friends and i would sooner give up all my limbs and die before i would i would deliberately let them down there you go that is what i fear most i also fear have gone long and my team has shut this down i just wanted just briefly a two things a first of all i i of course want to thank everyone for coming here to night a i realize it is the middle of the week and to commit some hours of your life to thinking about these brain mechanism is but we out pretty nutty there for a minute and hopefully the tools i redeem those a who were only a interested ere mostly interested in practical tools but fully some of the insights about how you work were re useful as well i do want i just make brief mention of this posers that made this possible cause they did make this possible and we made every effort to try and keep the tickaprize is manageable for people and a thanks inside tractor momentous for making this possible and then of course i would be completely remiss if i did not say thank you for your interest in science that much ever be sure to get home sally t in

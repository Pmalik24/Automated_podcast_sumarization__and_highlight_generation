trailer i now on to the news of the day in nineteen ninety after seldom whose invaded hate president gorge sh b bush was considering the america response he was torn on the one hand he saw the necessity of passing seldom out of the oil rich state maintaining the impression of america strength in the region on the other hand he did one to avoid conflict while three weeks after the invasion bush had still not made a decision that is when he famously accepted a phone call from brutish prime minister magnet tractor remember gorge she said this is no time to go wally but should not go wobbly the united states expelled sodomy from quit that was the last outright military victory in america history well to day the united states faces down threats on all sides the wages of appeasement of america most vicious enemies from cutting awful deals with the on to appeasing russia a hessian in crime from bowing before chines expansionism to abandoning afghanistan to the tarlatan to sending over aid two homes in palcinian authority america foreign policy particularly under barokobama in jobidon has read aggressiveness among our enemies that aggressiveness culminated last week in the worst single terror attack on the west since nine eleven in the form of a murderous rampage through southern israel that left one thousand three hundred people dead and two hundred kidnaped america enemies ore betting on us going wally their betting on a morally blind media to press israel to stop profusive into the gaze strip in order to depose the evil terrorist group commas their betting on an activated left to intervene to press jobidon to pressure israel to stop and if that that pays off the west will be far less safe here is why let us assume for a second that israel leaves commas in place in the gaze strip which would be the end result of a cease fire at this point camps would quickly consolidated support not only in goa but among palstingan grabs in the west bank creating another massive terror thread for israel from its east that territhreat is already materializing talking in terrors have already attempted to infiltrate multiple areas of the called west bank judge and maria on fridge night most around israel played a messing call expressing solidarity with comas and calling for palstinians to join the islands that will only grow worse if commas survives meanwhile casually in the north which is anaranian proxy will now that israel is surrounded on all sides and may choose to launch a massive offensive against israel that would end with tens of thousands of juesdead and israel itself existentially endangered again that possibility is quite real israel is apparently holding off right now on its ground offensive in order to retain enough troops in the north to prevent a massive casbalamove if castle jumps in israel correspond with everything in his arsenal as it would have to iron then presumably with russia and chines backing could enter the conflict at that point nuclear conflict would certainly not be off the table israel will not allow a second loco s to take place without using everything in itarsonal in fact in baronial attack on israel could turn into a next stage sunecia war thanks to irons increased regional power at some point in the chain of events america wood inevitably be dragged directly into such a war meanwhile the world's oil supply it would be radically decreased crashing the global economy that is what one pathlooksliht the other path looks america standing tall and here is america'srall it is a simplerael it does not require america use of force it does not require america soldiers first america must provide israel the material and moral support to destrikams israel will shed extraordinary levels of blood of its own citizens in order to protect coviliansan gaze and t killterras but israel will require rearmament and america should provided in israel wounded bahamas is an invitation to broader regional and possibly global conflict second america must use ore diplomatic it to push to alleviate the situation on the arabside we ought to be pushing egypt to open its border to refuges to minimize civilian casualties we should be pushing turkey to accept refugees after all they accept ted three point five million of them from syria americaaht to leverage cottar into turning overcoat's leadership to an international body or to america itself and pushcotzar to get comas release america and other hostages held by camass third america must detour other actors from escalating this conflict presumably that is why jobidon himself is visiting israel and why america currently has aircraft carriers station in the mediterranean an counts of prevention will be worth kilotons of cure all of this is durable without expending significant amounts of america tressure or any america blood but that can only happen if the misadministration does not goodly if it does not start parting the dangerous moral equivalents of the media or the absurd perversity's of international judo humanitarian organizations that make no demands of the terra group comas which is colonelcy holding two hundred hostages including babies but makes many demands on israel america can fleet hermuscles without using america force in fact we should a world without america is the durian vatic place a more dangerous place for america and america all that can be avoided at virtuallyserael cost long as america does not t actually goodly now the situation on the ground continues to be ugly according to the waster journal russia and china are softly intervening on the side of comas that is not a shock is are two the most nefarious actors in the world right now according to the waster journal the war between israel cams is not just risking t h regional conflagration is also affecting the goal balance to power stretching america an european resources while re living pressie on russia and providing new opportunities to china according to former finish prime minister oleander stub what we are seeing is part of the shifting and moving world order when you just leaves power values someone is going to vile those vacuums russia is the clearest beneficiary of the spreading up people pointing at the mounting palestinian deaths mascot revels what it calls the cuornquot hypocrisy of the western governments which have roundly condemned russia masers of civiliansinucrane but offer only mild criticism of his daily actions in gowan of course that is not even remotely a comparable russia invaded u crane in order to destroy the country israel is invading g aka in order to stop come which just killed thirteen hundred of at citizens in fact israel had given the gozestrip to the palsinians into that five to coast over they been in charge eversions two thousand five but the ruffians in the chines are tempting to create in anti america aliens in the middle east if a america were to go wobbly there things who get significantly worse for america interest in the e delasan forget all of the talk the happy talk about technology making oil no longer a relevant factor in the world economy that obviously is untrue and is going to remain untrue meanwhile cams continues to ratchet up the noise compass has a couple of rolls here bull number one is to survive the best way for them to survive is to release all the hostages to day if they release all the hostages they are currently holding there will be significant pressure on israel to stop its offensive and everyone will just pretend that thirteen hundred dead news around the gossiboard do not exist the is likely the the calculus that is being put in place by pretty much everybody is that if compass releases the hostages then they will call for everybody go back to stasqual any that is not acceptable for israel if compass is leadership survives intact in the gosestrip if they are continuing to leave the gosestrip after killing thirteen hundred news with virtually no consequences for them all the consequence is being felt by the civilians they keep in in a cage effectively and on top of their own rockets the will be a big victory for come everyone knows it israel'sgolls are tofu get back toe hostages destroy comas compass is gulls are twofold humiliate israel retain power and there really one gold y that is that is really what they are talking about right here to that end yesterday comes released it is first hostage video of one the hostages it is holding is avidin of a twenty one your old woman a me a sheep she is a duel citizen the french is daily woman she is taken hostage obviously she's being forced to say these things not yet everything that that she is saying here you have t understand she literally has a gun pointed at her head during this video here she was talking about a about her status as a hostage right now you can see in the video that they are bandaging up harmed look out lit what good care they are taken she saying id been prisoner in fossa they treated me and per formed a surge around me the to three hours everything's fine i only ask the return me home as soon as possible return me to my family please get us out of here as soon as possible pagan that is propaganda by compass comas is currently asking for thousands of comas terrors to be released back into the gossip and for israel to pull every one out in return for the hostages they e just took now comas just release them all the humanitarian stuff that is happening re now is on compass cams coo just i love that the release hostage idiot were ti look how nicely retreating the woman that we to and likely raped but we will look out nice were being to her these people are absolute monsters of course comas is monstrous an any attempt to present them as some sort of human right to protector is absurd on its face how bad is comasright now all right now egypt is refusing to open the sofa crossing to palsinian refuges in not allowing anybody out from goa right now compasses supreme leader actually praised egypt for clos sing the border not getting you they want is real that they want egypt to close the boarder they want the palistinians trapped in gaze why because they need them is human shields here is small kinda rest from cottar again pressers should be on cottar to turn honey another rest of the comas leadership over to an international court or to the america here is a here is is my o cone one of the ring leaders of compass the technical leader of compass broad who he lis by the wayinto fiesta hotel while everybody and gazasuffers because this is what all terrors groups do their leaders get rich and everybody else suffers here he is talking about wonderful it is that egypt is closing the boarder a the w the y the oldness is the people of gaze are rooted in their land and cling to their homeland when have you opening hoduminthen they will not leave gaze they will not emigrate no matter what the murderers and criminals do are you are you ookiwhwaga hey have only one path which is to re turn to our land to homes he land of our fathers and grandfathers by that he means tell of you and hiya by the way he does not mean gaze there is no emigration from grand no emigration from less paying no emigration from gas to egypt then they want to keep those people there they can use them as human shields remember no one was calling for going to leave the gasps strip until compass decided to murder thirteen hundred is rely citizens and canna to hundred others leading to the milter conflagration until two weeks ago compasses in full control of the gas trip and palstinians we are living there unhappily under their rule but again thy not care about the falsifies they've never cared about passing this is openly i mantis the part the amazing as they continue shay the sort of stuff openly can just the second will talk about iron threatening to expand the conflict and and then the western response to all of this first on talk to you about daily wares most trusted privacy partner and from me sponsor of the show express a van going along without express vipiana using your

up the reason there doing that is because there trying to redirect his rally resources from the southern boarder to the northern boarder whole people have ben wondering why it has not israel start of the ground in version already mean everyone knows it is coming and there couple possible reasons one is that they are first at tempting to internationally broke or along with the america some sort of post camps future in gaze that they are going to egypt jordan study attar and there trying to create in international coalition that will govern the gazistrip after mamas is removed from the map and they need time to actually make that happen beforetime going that is one possbleries in the other possible reason is that herbal is threatening israel northern boarder now again menfolks who do not know much about this region left understand that israel again being a very very tiny country is bordered on all sides by countries that either have a cold piece with it or have threatened openly to annihilated the gazistrip which is in the south western corner of the state of israel the gazistrip was occupied by hams and control bahamas e genisitaleterras group the southern border of israel is a border with egypt that is a cold piece with the egypt ever since the period between anear avatar and manahabagan in nineteen eighty under nineteen seventyeight nineteen seventy nine under the auspices of gimicater the campdavigors the the what the eastern border of israel is a a sort of weird conglomeration of gordanian border which is a cold piece with the with the kingdom of jordan and the palsinian authority areas which are honey combed with terra supporters camps is long chid in pausing authority all three terrace groups passing an authority literally pays the families of of terrace the northern bearer for israel is in the goon heights bordering syria which is in cranial proxy and on its pure northern border a strait northern border that is a border with lebanon which is occupied and control by by cabala husband is a derris group that is significantly more powerful than mamas bit by leagues of league order orders of magnitude they have some two hundred thousand rockets pointed apparently at the state o israel they've they have entrenched themselves on the northern border of israel israel has had to fight work there before in order to dislodge them from certain areas most famously in two thousand seven most recently that ended with israel for creating a demilitrizeown butt there has been antitankfire that has been crossing that boarder terete been people trying to sinful traits terra trying to infiltrate from the herbal areas into israel israel is deeply afraid that if cabala gets into the war twill be now stretched on two separate borders they may be holding off on a ground incursion into gaze until they feel that that northern boarder is solidified german of course is trying to rath it up the game by saying that if israel goes into the gazistrip then they might flesh cabala or they might instead poor resources into syria which would then be used in a proxy war with israel according to the times of israel iron on monkeys that time was running out to reach a political solution to the israel comic conflict warning of the possibility of expanding the scope of war and the conflict to other fronts apparently cranial president ebrahimranecei quit warned against the continuation of crimes by the pianist at regime and he warned of a possibility of expanding the scope of war and conflict to other fronts he further the uranium for minister further suggested the possibility of a preemptive action against israel in the coming hours as israel were are as israel prepared the possibility of in in invasion into the gossip trip in order to clean out the terrorists iron is obviously attempting to ratchet up the threat for it is part america is attempting to do some of the things that i talked about at the opening the so america has move aircraft carries into the region that would be to push cabala off the ball to say to them if you try to fire rocks into israel then we will strike you with our rats and in you will be no more because the combine power of america met america n need israel tell obviously but the combined power of america in israel or israel in a lead position with america a support position cusbelodoes not exist any more do not get involved ran is what trobidan keeps ant ienkepsting do not get involved a also the united states has been rearming israel to this point as israel need to be rearm but there is the third point which is will america let israel do what it needs to do in the gossips trip and here is where things are starting to get quite dick for the bine administration do they have the intestinal fortitude to allow israel to do what it needs to do in the gossips trip where maintaining the isolation of that conflict which is in everybody's interest by the waits in the interest of on is well every one's interest are a linger nobody wants this conflict spreading north to cabala in to iron the on may pretend that it dance that conflict spreading north but if that happens the most probably are not in power at the end of this chain of dominos mosepolydad see prowl do not want that but they have to threaten because they do not threaten than they are watching one of their owns comose being taken off the board by the rallies which is the next thing that is going to happen we will get to this in just one second first it is hard to stay energized these days it is ism not getting ton asleep

the ground invasion is not can i happen until after biding leaves this pretty obvious to everybody's this is partially a delay tactic by the united states to buy time for future negotiations on hostages perhaps to buy time for some negotiation over who is going to take commssiss place or perhaps it is just to the lay tactic by the united states s that israel will not actually go in at all maybe the gold here is to is to prevent israel from taking out comose totally now that is the great fear the great are is that this thing ends with some of the hostages released many of the hostages that remember many of them are really military commands nock an release thosepeople tonging kill them maybe the idea here is that everyone wants things to go back to statusqoanti if things go back to status any israel an existential danger why again compass will remain on the southern boarder and they will continue to be in intrenched powerful terror group that murder's news wherever it can find them castellan wile embolden iron willie em golden syry'll be embolden not only that egypt cordon are going to be alienated from the take of israel es gan power is the only coin of the realm an middileast whoever is most powerful winds that is the way that it works over there its not about moral suasion in a aria filled with dictators the the other countries thathave joined the graham a cords for example to try and creed an antieronian bulwark those countries are going be skittish after commands able to kill thirteen hundred news and get away with it say arabia is likely not to get into a pistil israel needs to re establish its military capability and it inability to push off its enemies if it hopes to sign any sort of long lasting piece agreements for example with the sure states againstoron the the situation could go really bad here if compass is not removed and every one basically knows that except maybe the america except maybe job mics gain jobidon has a very bad habit of going wobbly this the same ad ministration that was signing checks to the aronians about five seconds ago bison is supposed to visit israel that is a good sign of solidarity from from jobidon but the question is going to be what exactly the effect of that is now again none of that seems to be putting off compass anchovy blincon the united state secretary state was in tell of eve the grad siverants went off while blincoln was in tell over for meetings therefore literally firing missiles at blincoln men this is one of the things that comas was doing meanwhile the united states apparently trying to know are they trying push israel to ti did not go in intowhat they need to do in in the gosistrip that would be ridiculous here is some video from tell of eve his from yesterday were the sirens going off this is the exact area were blincon is meanwhile jobidon is am and blincoln are making some pray wobbly noises the mean some pretty wobbly noises jobidon his his in goes far has been good obviously is can den compasses barbarians because they are barbarians there there as better worse than the noises they wish not only destroy every u but to do publicly and i and to humiliate the news in he process at least the nates again phrases have never said before at least the noses attempted to hide their crimes it the end of world wore too commons brags about them on gobo meanwhile jobidon he yesterday he suggested it to mistake to occupy gosh now listen if you think israel wants along from occupation gosh your wrong i meant lick i rely know why any one would think is israel literally turned over the place to we a terrorist group rather than quote quit occupying it they do not want it but what d exactly you expect i mean sure what you expect what o you think the alcoves is is the idea that israel is supposed to according to jobidon is well see jobidon and anti blincon israel is supposed to not hit presumably enough military targets because here to any signs in the way in densely packed areas the cannot to it from the air there not pose to occupy gaze they cannot to it from the ground and thy are supposed toast will we from wanton blinking letting corn duo humanity name even if it goes to commas what exactly is the plan for israel to destroy common then now lis it i hope ism reading that wrong i hope that when jobidon says this all he really means that he does not want israel to and acts the gazastrip again if you think israel is desperate to annex two million palistonians living in the gozastrip i do not know what you are you are hin your own supply no one in these rally governments talking about that but in any case here is jobidon talking about occupying goa would you supporters rely occupation of goa at this point i think you bi big mistake do you believe that commas must be o wiminater the entirely yes i do but there means to be apaliston authority there need to be an pass to piston testate well if he is got any ideas having every one's open to them than get ism ism sick of hearing about their needs to be a palistonian state when literally the only leaders in the palistonian community our dedicate is the extermination o israel could have happened after ho thousand five up men super easy after two thousand five let israel walked out the apostates could rapport billions of dollars in to gaze to builds it up into a glowing hong hong of the middies o they do that known said they aloud romantic continue making it into a pothole that is that what they did by the way lots hundreds millions building dollars poured into goa it all went for building extraordinary terror tunnels underneath the soil for poisoning the queller apparently and for building rockets it is its i in a never ending source of astonishment to me when people jobidon or any one else in the commentaries or political fierce as there needs to be a two state solution yet well it would be nice if unicorns if unicorns provided new clear energy as well but at it certain point you are gingko have to recognize that the palistnian cause has not been and is not about setting up a working functional palistonian state it is about destroying the state of israel that is what it is it is a weapon aimed at the hart of israel it has been since nineteen forty eight every one knows this the palistinians know this comas knows this the pianos this is coma good knows this that's why they've walked away from every single piece negotiation ever held it is why they have turned down every single deal ever offered them because again the palatine liberation organizatiowhih became the p was found et in nineteen sixty four when israel was not in control of either the gazastrip or the let bank they worn even in control of the old city of jerusalem and yet that is when the piano was form the palatine liberation organization the free palestine crowd when they were saying that in nineteen sixty four they did not mean free remora they don't the they they didn't mean we need you a free goa city and they do not mean that right now they mean from the river to the sea palestine shall have no jaws that is what they actually mean they talk two state solutiously i know your talking about yah that be great that sure it again if you think israel is desperate to govern given you are to your mind is a literally tried to hand over the arms to jordan don was a no way we managing this is it's is ridiculous nonsense that is that passes for foreign policy wisdom in a second will get to antonym blinking absurd statements yesterday the secretary estate again listen i would love for the administration provides of the s it is not hard contain the conflict let israel finish that enemies that is it that is keep that is lake that is that is all and it is not harden and does not require america blood or tressure in any serious mount certainly no america blood and does not require america tressure in any serious amounts it does it contain the conflict and allows israel to eliminate air enemy not only of visrelbit of the world ma down requirigyou not mattrall spine will get to that momentarily first and not getting lot of sleep these days but

long with he looks better sleep starts right now catch out yesterday antonym blinking held eight hours of meetings with the scaly government and then he emerge to to give a message and hearts what arson blinkonhad to say on wednesday president bide was it israel he is coming here at a critical moment for israel for the region and for the world and his coming here to do the follow first the president will reaffirm the united states solidarity with israel and our iron clad commitment to its security president bine will again make clear as he is done unequivocally since the moss is slaughter of more than fourteen hundred people including at least thirty america that israel has the right an indeed the duty to defends people from he moss and other terra and her then future attacks president all hear from israel what it needs to thefendice people as we continue to work with congress to meet those needs second president bid will underscore our crystal clear message to any actor state or non state trying to take advantage of this crisis to attack israel do not to that end he is deployed two or craft carrier groups and other military assets to the region third the president will continue to coordinate closely without his really partners to thesauri the release the postage is taken by a moss including men women small children holly coss survive rs an america citizens sent indispensable humanitarian effort forth present bide will receive a comprehensive brief on is rails warmed and strategy fifth the president will here from israel how it will conduct its operations in a way that minimize civilian cases and enables humanitoring assistance to plot civilians and gas in a way that does not benefit mamas to that end to day and at our request united states an israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanity an aide from done nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians and gaze and them alone including the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way it is critical that aid begin flowing into gazes soon as possible we sure is a aster's line assai sees we are destroy ad entering gaze or otherwise preventing it from reaching the people who need it if ambos in anyway blocks humanitarian assistance from reaching civilians including by seizing the aid itself we will be the first to concernment and we will work to prevent it from happening again we am on that last part is the part of its can having stop it there everything he says up to that point if ski that masseuse that is a declare ism talking bat right contain the conflict say do not to the foreign actors who want to get in make sure that israel has the wherewithal to take out comas all of that then he gets to the very end and he says we need humanitarian are to going to gaze take everybody would love for the civilians of gaze to have humanitarian aid this is why israel turn back on the water and power in southern goa the entire idea is turn it off up north to push everybody down south all the civilians because the only people in the north who still have water an power the people living under ground the terrace that is the entire idea here but then when he says well if if that humanitarian aid is then used for terrorism we will condemn it o thanks o thanks or maybe you should not put aid into an area where terrors are likely to seize it may maybe thou t maybe you should pressure egypt into letting civilians out of the gosestrip into egypt m maybe that would be good maybe egypt should being control the foster but egypt does not want it again eat your providing problems with toe solutions when you say things we will be the first to condemn it of comma seizes human by the way compass did not sense humanitarianade literally yesterday you and our w way the you an refugees administration which is a in agency that specially dedicated only to the palsinians remain it is a garbage administration run internationally that allows for full in indoctrination in u trade at you and our way schools and the hiding of weaponry beneath you and our w way resources that admitted yesterday ans were briefly that commons was literally stealing aid and then they to leaded it because they were afraid the commas my command at them is it likely that hat's going it is not only likely it is it is certain that commas is going to steal that aid and then use it in its war against the news that obviously going to happen how only is the united states get were not sure yet but the pressure is certainly being brought hers the media have done the moral equivalency game that continued to do the moral equivalence game this it this notion that its incumbent on israel not to achieve its military objectives in order to prevent civilian casualties caused by comes absurd on its face no one talked this after nine eleven no one talked this tearing world wore to no one has talked lie this during any war that i am aware of borakobama was nailing people with drones and killing civilians by the score and no one seem to bat and i about any of that and that was not a matter of existential america security israel right now is attempting to kill the people who killed thirteen hundred jaws and would kill all of them and are currently holding two hundred hostages and we are getting talk from marabout always you would be careful bout the civilian casualties you really do yo remember any of that conversation the afhemathenin elevon any the answers no it did not exist remember any of that conversation about sis someone between one thousand and ten thousand civilians were killed in the america warn sis this any one care they one talk about that the answer is no one talked about that why because the military objectives were clear instead you take tavern signal who yesterday was it was questioning a formers daily official and he said how how dare you take take military measures that are hurting civilians and the answer is it would not be hurting civilians if camps we are not using the civilians is human shield they want them there they say publicly certainly taking ahamasas leadership i understand the the point of that tat the is an the aphasia in earthman is been gas says twenty eight hundred pasinians have been killed a and a some ere between a quarter and a third of them are a children a that is not harass leadership can ps o for a wood of cushion no i know that there is real suffering in last this a wo going on and and in innocent people that getting quart up in a very difficult situation i do not cinemas that that you have to get take with the grain of fault any information that cans but of the mamas controlled insist of health in gas that has to be said that amass not a democracy this not an independent health you okay that is trying to do its be every duct to speak to every hospital direct you speak to woks and that the gun of mamas that of course is exactly right that is exactly rightness exactly true in fact the journalists in the gas'strip have admitted as much they have admitted they cannot report except what comas wants them to report the goodness for comas is that they are bunch of sympathizers in the media forms in fact to b b c had to fire seven seven reports yesterday seven for expressing open solidary with comas seven its if you were id that the journalistic enterprise is a is corrupt that is because it is by the way jordan is also saying no refugees they are also saying no refugees in fact king up dull he he says it is a red line is is no refuge hes in

one signatory to this disgusting letter ton hossycots of torso person who els should have known was moral cretin when he wrote an entire book talking bath evil america was how evil medicals in hawker watch nine eleven happen from the top of the building while smoking post an felt m thing we shouldhave known that from tinahosicots but we are suppose to take in very seriously as a pseudo intellectual because he called for slavery reparations because he a very wealthy black man has been victimized by the united states of america cops a fool then and he is a fool now are all the people who signed this disgusting letter an again it is some of the most eminent intellectuals in america who signed this ridiculous piece of garbage here is what the letters has quote we are writers an artist who have been too palestine participate in the palestine at festival of literature it is the first shall we don't we start righter where was the palestine festival of literature is in hypha is in hypha hypha is in israel they are immediately going from the river to see palestine will be free they're immediately calling for eventually the destruction of the state israel because he cannot call it we have been to pout if you went to if you went to hypha wouldn't go to palestine went t israel we now call for the international communities to commit to ending that catastrophe in folding in gaze and wo finally pursuing at comprehensive an just political solution an passion outright no efforts have ever been expended at some sort of piece plain in israel and and between the put and no one has ever tried anything that wow genius idea you you you absolute geniuses you we have exercised our privilege as international visitors to move around his tor palestine in ways the most palestonians a unable to why why are not warmth able to why why who runs those places hum interesting why why say you we have met with and been hosted by palestonian artist humanities workers writers historians en actives we have good on stage with them many of those people including the festal organizers bast in palestine are in fear for their lives right now one festal organizers lowdown with their child and kamala sharing updates about the people killed by arm settlers last night one partner in gaze again editor is no longer answering messages it is the first all i should point out at this point i know people who are located in israel areas around gaze and israellies who are located in in areas around royal mean calls i mentioned at the top the shot wean calls it is what happens on fridge nights you have heard the tapes of it as these limit called the prayer the calls to prayer being sent from the top mas from the loudspeakers calling for solidary comas and violent uprising against us job in a lot of these areas are living in fear that people ne going to come down from royal and kill them in their families in any case these these moral and these moral morons they quote israel has it posed what all he complete siege and told one pone one million people in gusto evacuate within twenty four hours to wear oh i do not know maybes to the places where they dray map to maybe that by the way when when they stay to war i just comatose don't want them to evacuate at all coma telling hm not to move comes killing people who are attempting to leave after six days o bombing that if already killed two thalsan to in or fifteen people seventies twenty four of them children in the fourth major agree bombardment in the sixteenth year of closure the question to wear rings unanswerable around the world hell i mean it it does not considering that refugees have been leaving north africa for italy by the boat load for years on and also again why i what is a making about this at this idiotic letter is they never bothered to acts the question why because they did they might actually have to come confront the truth which is the comes and evil terrorist group why is israel boy adding the gosistrip li the answer is because of terrorist attacks because of rocket attacks from civilian areas by thewy we are now fully two paragraphs into this pathetic exercise in moral idiocy and they have still not mention the news were murdered well when israel top general were first to palistinians as human animals that is not what he said your for to mamas as human animals and what people who rape women and then kidnap them or mure of them with their babies those are human animals sorry you do not that tough when the us state department t lead to statement calling for a cease fire well rabbits the cult for sense fire before israelyed even done anything we fear we are watch ethnic cleansing on a scale unseen in decades as a hell v anthrax cleansing again i will point out that at the time of the nineteen forty eight war they ware apparently one point some wore between one point three at one point five million palistinian grabs living in the area to day they are two million palistinian grabs living in the goscistrip there are another two to three million palistinian grabs living in judo and solaria and their one point six million palestinian arab star is daily living inside israel that is a hell ofanathnat cleansing anyway these dolts continued the governments of medusa u cave france and others are participating in this crime by camping up military support for israel as it wages a war that it is officials have plainly stated names to turn gaze into city of ten or even worse empty of its people a population of over two million mostly from families the were made refuges in nineteen forty eight half of your children have been living under in is railway egyptian blockade since two thousand seven hand's many of them being told to leave again is not an option on sturdy this is the restart on sturdy after sixteen years of siege hams millions broke out of goa we that is at that is a hell of a characterization they broke out after sixteen years dislike prison break you see they it was not comas runs the damned place they broke out you see they broke out and more than thirteen hundred as rallies were subsequently killed was look at lot the passive voice right there not the commosterroris went and murdered and beheaded and burn no what and raped not and kidnap none of that all that happened something happened to some people as thohano mar might say commas millions broke out of gaze and more than thirteen hundred as rallies were subsequently killed well what visit cars did they die of influenza was it covin in how did that happen shut i see thistle the worst people in america disgusting human beings more than thirteen hundred as relies weretese are coma sympathizers period more than thirteen hundred as relies were subsequently killed with over one hundred more taken hostage some of them friends an family or signatories to this letter we deplore the loss of all innocent life and now as who write this letter israel is executing the largest expulsion of palistinian since nineteen forty eight as a boys goons without i discrimination that is a lie it is an up it is an abject lie the reason gammas hides it is weapons be hind civilians is to just shade israel from hitting them that in an of itself admits the lie they israel if israel one to kills tailings infra could do not tell any one to move not try to kit military targets is not doing any of those things only compass is doing those things our words feel small in this terrifying exculpation after many years in many dust we must all together save this has to end and it can only on with a free pallet and remember the thing started by doe clean hypo part of gallstone that is from your great intellectuals that is tonahossy cots we should be summarily thrown out of any intellect usual en to prize ever he is a joke but do not work he is not the only joke weave professors at america stop universities doing the same thing therefor example is ta cornel university professor and bruises rickford cheering the terrors attacks the other day thesexhilara his exhilarating hots energizer ye si by the murder of just a a warrant exhilarating by this challenge the monopoly of violence by this shifting of the balance of power then they would not be human i was exhilarated he says the is a professor is a professor at i cornel university our intellectual class meanwhile a colombia university professor has a has call colossus terroratacks against israel possum his i is josh posties professor posies in history colombia has no comment of course because why would they why would they colonel wuss says they cannot have hm remove now i would need to see more of what he see bet everyone is in tidied to their opinion well i mean a i feel if you express support for a commosterror attack at tat point you can lose your do a caught cambia cancel alter maniac but it seems to me the if you supporting open terrors screw murdering civilians doling babies and burning hem then at that point i feel it don't need a job i feel today don't have job ism impact with that i can i can leave with that and just one second we will get to the rest of the auto intellectual class in the united

cote chipiro get our intellectual class is filled with absolute jokes of of human beings that obviously also applies to many of the students a huge number of students at our top level universities are moral fools and they have been moral fools for quite a while video has amour s from around the country not only of these giant rallies in favor of comas but of and why you student for example literally tearing down posters of the people cannot by comas this is em two such people at tishhal and and why you and there is a a line of posters of the these are the faces of the kidnaped and this is three young people wore going around pulling us off and throwing them the garbage can lest lest god forbid people actually see the faces of the people who are being held in bondage by commas derris do not worry these are probably wonderful people they are probably there publican be good for america they are probably a net ad for the united we need them here we need them here just we need obviously huge protests in deerborn on to have comes here is somvidio from zeerborn is yesterday ah thesis a lot of people who are again they have giant tines its a d colonization and resistance the first line in this lines as resistance a a resistance is solidarity with compass that is what they are talking country now that is why they are doing this and thy'renot calling for compass to be exposed and for a peaceful palistinian state to be created they are not calling facts that is not what they want what they want is israel destroyed clearly obviously nochustin unborn also in dallies there som here som thicko of a giant procomas rally and delsingan this is a process rally it is it is not a propalistinian rally it is not a rally calling for the not one person at these rallies called for the release of hostages not one zero not one of them will condemn what comas actually did not one zero not one of them will suggest that palisinian leadership need to be replaced in the gassistrip as to forward and foment piece not one zero it is very obvious exactly what is happening at these rallies and question is i if you are a sympathize or with an actual terror group see its it is politically correct for these its easier on the left to say i support compass than is to say a man as a man an woman's woman on the left these days it is easier because you get to pretend thatyou are on the side of the displease con dispossessed colonized people get's pretend the news are white and the herbs are brown and therefore the news are the oppressors and the brown people are the oppressed for get about the fact that racially speaking the sis abject and silly nonsense that a huge number of his rallies are not in fact from european countries that a huge huge number of his rallies are from places morocco and rock and egypt i mean my wife entire family is sugary but t does not none of that matters to these people it all has to fit inside this peculiar left interjectional framework that is perfectly fine with antisemitism because it absolutely crosses streams wit a around er left when concept that if you are successful if you help ut successful state the males must because you are some sort of colonial oppressor meanwhile you do not let the again the sort of stuff is throughout the united states thee say the video from two thousand twenty tooth their kids for singing allegiance to cossemsily money you've member sold monk hots the leader of the agrarian terror regime is one of the leaders of the large see the running revolutionary hardcore and responsiblefor the each of thousands of america these are on these are school kids for singing allegiance to cosset sollymony in two thousand twenty two shear tiny little kids than hunters there is all the'reall wearing they are wearing head bands the plenchallegian for on here also the says as for the idiots and tum this is in sexton by the way is in stop is is not in not it is not in on this none and cuter is in custom sieve question is this seem a good practice to it'll tell you a it probably is not particularly good practise again this not the fault to these kids hes heres there their small children it is the fault of their parents and the organizations that dismount or them that is terrible it is awful and an their parents do not belong in the united states if you if you support cusemsilly on you do not belong in the united states you support compass us not belong in the united states be ad draw the line somewhere i seems to me supporting open terror groups is a pretty good place to draw the line ill feel that is two restrictive is it you can still be in favor of a palistonian state you can still be in favor of two state solution but it seems to me that if you support the full scale murder of news full stop qualms that you support come ass if yo support herbal if you support these groups i feel you can find some place all to live and'll tell you wat happens when countries do not find other places for terrsonvisers to live the terrsamvisers go and do terrorist kinds of things for example yesterday two people were shot had in bruises the shot tad in bruises in a in in by by a person who declares his allegiance to sis a man claims an imide on dial media who was the assailant in today's attack an that ho is from sis they're that this this person is claiming that he shot two random people in bruises in retaliation for a six neural musleboy who is killed an illinois over the week now the difference between this guy and the guy in illinois is that every one condemns the guynellinois we all want e that that piece of get the death penalty the guy who kill the palisinian kid an illinois every one wants that meanwhile they're millions of people all over the worlds we will cheer this this particular human who just murder two people for no reason in bruises he claimed his inspired by the illogic states bruises has now raised the terror let to its operating a fur meeting the threat is extremely serious this is again if you import tens of thousands of people who will growth compass you should not be particular surprised when they a grew common the do things that commons might meanwhile theroid news is that when we have of the compass cacao in our congress as well the squad has now put out a letter the letter is signs it is at it is a house resolution they are attempting to to push it is been pushed by as you would guess prshuted to leave only carbon et camera quarry bush calling for an immediate escalation and sense fire in israel and occupied palestine where is all human life is precious they say and the targeting of civilians no matter heir faith at nthecity is a violation of international humanitarian law where is between october seventh an october sixteenth armed violence has claim the livre twenty seven hundred palistinians never fourteen hundred is rallies got love that there it is see you we them moral quill an trick there the just lump everybodygether tall just a cycle of islands gang come ass running into peaceful is really villages and murdering everyone insight is exactly the same as israel trying to kill members of compass and come ass hiding behind this millions exactly the same the of the the only way you can ever get to the point that israel is possibly the baggie in this conflict is if you just pretend if just pretend a way the entiriconflict if you pretend the history does not exist that the situation on the ground dos not exist if you pretend that come ass is a equivalent to the idea it is an absurdity obviously is the by administration in a cave to these type of fools if they do they are going to make a america much weaker the into put america and the west en a much more dangerous place because but derris love more than anything they will one hope andtheyof the weakness of their opposition it is the thing that drives them weakness of the west is the driving motivating factor for terrors groups sure they love to kill anybody but when they when they are scared they kill for people and the reality is what exactly they've to be scared of in the west when the west is deeply worried about cleanliness of arms that it will not allow commons to be taken off the board if that in fact is what happens here in we meanwhile closer to home him jordan has been inching closer to the speakership they are supposed to be a vote to day toe determine whether he is in fact going to come speaker of the house here is here is him jordan saying we are going to elect to speaker his a saying that they're going to do that to day you the before you want at turned seventeen first well i i do think that that is i deal be we mi college went they roll a bout o the if there is any way the ever get that in the room ill a love that but i think they will o i to do this is the way the fosters intended is you you have to both to morrow oh we have set it for twelve o'clock and i they look it about we we have wore tho one bow if you do not get the two seventeen w that that what i tins tat was he he is suggesting that that he is can get two seventeen right now it appears as though jordan is in fact inching closer to seventeen som of the hold outs are ism are still that that they are moving over in to his camp i think everybody in the republican caucus is tired of this nonsense a huge majority the republican caucus does not even understand my my earthy was ousted in the first place tad the perfectly fine with jordan being the guy they munch people in swing districts or little nervous about jordan being the guy because jordan is a hard charging dude and what they are worried about is the jordan because of his own political priors is going to not be a conciliator in the republican cacao he is not on t be willing to cut the sorts of deals that they would have caught in the pass even with each other and that nothing will get don or that they are going o be saddled with what whatever him jordan was caution and trump be as don a trump right now is the likeliest hominy the the the sort of is our situation in which the republican cauls find selves if they do not go with jordan who do they go with democrats of course are very excited about him jordan the reason the democrats are excited is because they are going to try to attack all o the moderate republican legislators and and left wing re publican legislators by by saddling them with organ's record mega dodgers who is of the house armed services at committed he a he now has not dosed jordan and wager of bistoury who is a s college backer said that she would not for jordan there is some other notes out there thotutd include for example milk wallet of new york carlesomennas of florid mood teas bailout of florist's on bacon of nebraska can buck of colorado there is still saying that they oppose jordan hope force are indicating there is a high possibility tho jornactually has his high water mark on the first votes if he does not get in on the first vote can he starts to lose support a get guys pickaspeaker does not honest to got it does not actually matter all that much the reason i does not matter that much is beau the incentive structure is what matters in congress i know that everybody's tens to believe about america politics that if he just put the right tie in the right place at the right time it makes a world of different is not about the right guy much as it is the intensive structure the makes the wrong guy do the right thing right now therepublicans have n incredibly narrow majority if they have to go to left in legislators in the publican caucus to get to that majority that is wat there in have to do and if they go right lingers to get that majority that is what they can to have to do this idea that that what is going to emerge from a jordan led caucus is going to be significantly better than what emerge from maccarthlood caucus i gain if that is the case i love to see that materialize i just do not know what exactly that looks hung meanwhile must comment on the fact that he judge his now imposed a pathetic gag order on dona trump this ridiculous now i thing the does trumpet spent he last week can a mouthing off to to ineffectively particularly the middle of the world crisis where his opinion really does matter don from is most pro israel present america history bar non his voice of this time could be really powerful instead he as basically been distracted with other issues again this my rob with his candida the i think he will be distracted with other issues alltheway up through the election dos been he cannot win does mean makes i more difficult for him to win meanwhile on to mantis has been using the power of his governorship in florid safshuld get things done he is beenallowing flights to ship out to israel with material aid he is also been allowing floridians to get home yafshe charter to flight from israel to get floridians home here he was greeting them on the tarmac the otherday a a a er e a a a lot of he o are aha getup goodford deans is meanwhile trump is obvious the occupied with other things this part of the problem to trump is obviously faraway the whole leader at the point during the third period trumps campaign raise some twenty five million dollars he has a lot of cash available on hand obviously right now because he spent verbally no cash he just got hit wit the gag order in decease the democrats obviously doing their best to elevate trump in the primaries by hitting him with the kitchen sank yesterday a federal judge bard trump from attacking witnesses prosecutors and quarterstaff involved in his washington d see criminal case the imposed a gag or to be judge tony chucking who has taken every possible anti true position just first men on protections yield to the administration of justice in the protection of witnesses his presidential bandits does not give him cart blanched to vilify public servants are simply doing their job an she is threatening to a to arrest him and put him in jail if he were to use his social medium megaphone to attacksate the prosecutor in this case jack smith or you are to go after the judge in this case chucking acknowledge trumps right to win on public policy issues but said the trump could not launch a pretrial smear campaign against those who might testify against him which again this is this is real violation a first merman kinderstuff your trump yesterday commenting on it but dash kiva ego young to we goods to don't speak badly about her opponent but this is weapon roll being done because jo by is losing the election in losing very very badly to all of us in the pop he is losing badly but what they do not understand is that i am willing to go to jail if that is what it takes for a country to win and become i democracy again and he is is willing good gel we may find out if if chucking decides to take this all the way she is declining to restrict trump's claim that the prosecution is part of a political vandetis she says he instil rip on jack smith as part of a political vendetta butt he is not allowed to attack the court staff or any of the rest of this sort of stuff ism meanwhile apparently the meeting a the he sort of hearing was bazar one of the attorneys for trump is getting john lure laugh found himself alternating between forceful defenses of the former present first men at rights and acknowledgements that he would tell trump not to do some of this sort of stuff lure heatedly described the prosecutions against trump at a sign of a nation wearing into totalitarianism in tyranny aura said gorge war would have a field do wit what we hearing from these prosecutors and of the judge mattered gorge work ill definitely have a field day som a again this is all going to benefit trump in the end because any time trump a pure to be restricted republican's rally to his cause all of it is a a very large shall distraction in a very serious world and a second will be joined by an if reservist ho actually took on comes terrace in the middle of the october seventh terrace attack with just a pistol the our conversation y aft to be a member become member used cool ho pro check after to man's final angel plans quick that lion the description and join us

cot out of this tons was e cannot talk about this is behind the need also we switch the subject he goes away e journalist is in this camp flat confirmed that he was a cartage how much violence is against people in the camp is not clear the nerve hell em parry as here bout people being kidnap from the camp but that is hard to confirm in told me this story when i first heard up in the camp a woman came up to me an ask me if we would be bringing in condoms because when she got actually assaulted again she wanted to be able to ask her a tacker to where conducts ta she would not get pregnant in a relief wore hell's been depots of places were my grants refuges are stranded this but the security us sis here the lack of predictable food and water sanitation five toilets were the should be a hundred twenty my no proper tense for people when i first saw it i was literally jest don founded because the seen refugees such ovations this have ben to banquet sieve seen cops pas are have been to a rock have seen the mighty pe camps have seen the refuge camps from serial i take us the worse i we definitely state this this tors if a a bearing in them for a lock of humanitarian accountability for what is happening to these people you mean that that nobody's keeping account of whose here an who is and who goes in in who goes out who goes in who goes out who goes in a thing the properifug camp she says the united nations camp they would have that a big tall fence some a keeping track of who comes in and out when we ask medical officials about conditions in this camp they said they are not helping the twenty five hundred people here cause the soft want a permanent ten city in this spot they won't people to move to government shelters and the united nation said they will not step in let the me in government invites them step in in id states whose policies landed people here in the first place as also do not it five million dollars to house in mexico the next is not go to ten camps this one but to the official medical government shelters it is enough money to shelter eight thousand people but we sent wan more people than that back across the border over fifty seven thousand under the remaining lexica policy pas another twenty one thousand we e migration officials have not even begun to process we have told them he systems backed up should sit on waiting lest stay in mexico will get tog your cases in a few months these are mostly people who in the past before president trump would have been lout into the united states wait for the resin court dates here it many people r pushing back across the border resorting refuge camps that we do not call refuge camps serin our country storestep toe day we try to understand what this new policy means for the people we send across the border we assayer from you officials to sent them there were not feeling great about t themselves e b easy chico sics medicaid life or our last s the with us guan good by stranger like i said to the top the program to day show was first broadcast in nonmember and we are rerunning it today because a just on the polite surprize this is one of the spotswhere i jumping into the original broadcast to say a the president's policies at the border have only intensified since we first broughtcasta hell since cover nineteen in march the administration shut down the border to all asylum seekers sit ism hearings are not going to resume until late tune though seems possible that even that date is going to get pushed back we first broadcast a this program one of t thing that we were specially interested in was the guess officials on the front lines who job under remain in mexico is to send people back lot's of them were resigning sing now that is actually not my job osantials times reporter mali tool talk to a bunch of them and here is the vision of the story that we ran in the fall before the remain in mexico policy began and up ended the asylum system and completely change what it is to be an asylum officer here is all the of used to work when a central america showed up at the us match border and said let me in ism afraid of going back to my country that is where the asylum officer came in the officer did something called a credible fierce screening to check if the person was likely to face harm or death if the us sent them back home if there is even a chance that they would the asylum officer would let them into the united states to wait for a court date were an emigration judge would make the filum call dug sevens says people do not understand how hard the job is at the time all this started he was an asylum officer in say for disco sild have people come to my office and we job a sensually is tell me the worst things that have happen to you have an hour go and that all the did of to time of the truth and all these of you justice you are expected to be or really to do the job well need to be an expert an the political cultural natural and economic situations in he neural countries around the world and your expected to be a human i detector all at once present trumptokspot asylum itself as if it is fraud he says it is a hoax a big fat convoy the people come in with fake asylum claims that asylum officers just let everyone through and then asylum sewers never show up for their day in court that it is a border wide two thousand mile loophole and it is true then most people do pass that for a stop with an asylum officer and enter the united states but terms a good reason for that it is building do u s asylum law a common sense humanitarian idea we do not want to send people back to situations where they would get tortured or kill the legal term as non refluent and u s law set the bar law if there basically any chance an asylum sewer could get killed or harmed the officers pas to let them into the us and does not need a lot of proof or evidence at that point later when they get before an emigration judge and by the way the majority do so a there they need proof and most of them get rejected even before president true took office less than fifteen per cent per year got asylum that is because most people do not meet the specific criteria in the law or do not have enough evidence or it does not check out all the asylum officers have ever spoken with see it as their job to what out the fakers the people who do not really need protection the one whore just trying to gain the system oh mi god heres where ism going to be real with you this is an asylum officer were calling result this is not her voice she is afraid of getting fired we had an actor copy what she said as closely as possible the rid hap is happening on a sealed that that is huge we are talking hundreds of people a month i interviewed three asylum officers for this story and all three said the groups that have been the primary target of president trumps emigration policies they actually are not the main ones committing fraud it is not the central america it is not the middle eastern people it is the india people and the chines people they all have the same bullshit is story about getting beaten with hay sticks three times because their part of is seek party and the police told them they are going to jail them if they ever badmouth the ruling party ever again bullshit just hap they all just happen to do the s me thing and suffer the same fate even though there's absolutely no confirmation in any media that any of this persecution is happening and studies done by our our department in it a counterparts in the country a straight up this is not a real thing the chines our running as similar scam with christian claims in the fall of twenty eighteen asylum officers started hearing about these big changes coming the policy that was first called remain in mexico and then later might protection protocols m p p but the asylum officers who were going to have to implement this thing they did not know any of the details of how they were supposed to do it it was all shrouded in much secrecy this is another asylum officer we are calling her and we used an actor here too to protect her identity or the next few weeks and starts picking up around the office that some of her colleagues were being called in quietly and ask to go to the border in santdiego and instead of the credible feer screenings they would always done they seemed to be doing something entirely different under m p p a whole new kind of interview with different rules she knew she is going to have to start doing them too she pulled aside a to worker who would already been sent to the border i was asking her hey what is what is the training what is this and she was ism not allowed to talk to about it another asylum off a is one who you consider a friend ere a sorter professional colleague good colleague a good colleague some one that we had mutual trust for sure and then was told was brought in by a supervisor for a special brief about about it before i was going to start doing these interviews and was told here is the skinny on it and do not tell anyone why because i think they knew that it was legally dubious and suspect and they wanted to keep teethe the leak to minimum the leak being a major policy roll out that was can a change asylum yet that is the leave that is the leak yet two months go by before they do a formal training session with the full asylum corn and it is just a power point here is air easily again hands were going up and being we how is this legal or how are we going to be doing this and how do we know how this works all three of theasylum officers i take to said that the presentation left them with lots of questions including the biggest on how was this legal these officers knew better than almost any one how dangerous mexico is and this policy seemed design to send tons of people back to mexico it seems to be in direct contra diction with you was asylum law which says that at the very least we cannot send people back to a situation where they would get harmed or killed we cannot violate the principal of non repayment and the response was ism just the messenger bringing this down from h new and this is the power point they gave us i was well if you do not even care about double checking that this is legal and you are just the messenger as you say you are afuckan show all three officers say they raised concerns and got roughly the same response just get out there and do your job but they found out soon enough was just how radical a change the new em p p interviews were from the old credible fire screenings for starters not everyone would get an interview only the people who volunteered that they were scared to go back to mexico would if they got an interview under m p p asylum seekers would have to prove that they would be harmed in mexico not their home country and not just any harm they cannot just be threatened by gangs or the police they have to be threatened by gangs or police or whoever because of some very specific reasons laid out in slaw because of their nationality race religion politics or being part of a particular social group it'll g b trio and they would have to show that the medical government a cop or an official was unable or unwilling to protect them and the asylum sewer could not just say all this happened they could under credible fear screenings now they need to prove it it is as asylum seekers were travelling through mexico flying for their lives they should have been gathering evidence of all the screwed up things happening to them there making a paper trail and they should have had all this evidence on the right then right after crossing the border which of course his next impossible especially because they had no idea any of this was required dug saw all this happening and wanted nothing to do with id s we tried to keep his head down to try and avoid having to do these interviews hoping the courts would kill am p p but they did not by tune m p p returns had sky rocketed and it was all hands on deck for the asylum core dug could not dodge it any more and i do not memo it said your doing em p p interviews to say i had a father and son son i thickness retains eleven or twelve the fleeing on under because of violence another problems did not talk about that much cause it does not matter for the purpose of em up and forest only in why they afraid to go back to mexico of course the guy and his son do not understand why there even talking about mexico they do not understand any of this at all the interview continued he had tried to find a place to live there had tried tore a work permit in mexico and was essentially denied and as their canoeing his talking about ye are encountering cartels and witness saying other my francs being murdered tortured in front of is son and fleeing and barely getting away shall at that are being shote this and talk him out his son having fighters for weeks because of this and then they get stop by the police and the place take all their money herselfans and because i cannot get them to say these magic words flak yet they threaten me because ism under but that is all they had tout they don't know that a the cause ism thundering those would be the magic words that would put them in a protected category they were targeted because of their nationality though even if the father had said because ism thundering they probably still would have been sent back to mexico because gods a he did not have any evidence proving that any of this happened dug he did what the pause told him to do he sent them back to mexico the old credible fire screenings usually took an hour or less these temp p interviews can last four five six hours when i asked these asylum officers to describe what these interviews are for them for the against in front of them ursilike gave the most vivid picture she told me about the very first and p p interview she did a family from alsavador two parents in to kids she had script she had to stick to the family was exhausted and aromatized and totally unprepared you're putt into a sell you are separated from your kids and your wife you have no idea what is going on because you thought to day you were going to be interviewed about a salvador and you were going to get to enter the united states couple hours later they lead you into this reason cold cell where they can your hands to a table in handcuffs and some one is sitting across from you who does not speak your language and starts talking to some one in the phone who starts translating to you that you are going to talk about mexico you smell shit because you have been living in a shelter without any running water for a month and a half best you have travelled all the way across central america to get there and you do not understand why someone is talking to you about mexico this interview goes on for an hour and a half and the person keeps pausing it they can talk to some one on the computer which they say is there supervisor and another hard leads your wife in that you have not seen in the last twelve hours into the interview room and you can brush her hand as she passes by your happy to see her because you have been separated you have no idea what is going on where are my children i do not know sir ism sure they will be fine your wife goes through a similar interview on but she keeps being confronted about the answer she is giving because they're different from yours and the officer can understand why this story very differently between two people who experienced it half an hour passes before her children are brought into the room and then the officer has to talk to a ten year old boy about whatever his parents said and then confront the ten year old boy on inconsistencies between his story and his parents story and then the wife is when am i going to see my husband again the officers i have no idea let them know if you need to use the bathroom usual made the case of the family should not get sent back to mexico and to her shock her supervisor agreed in fact she happened to walk outside the moment the family got released they have got their back packs on their holding hands she thought maybe this will not be bad but that was the last time the very next interview a woman told her over and over she was afraid of being raped and killed in mexico usual believe shews going back to a place her that was very possible but because the woman could not am a specific person who to fault her usual had to send her back since then it is essentially been no after no after now asylum officers told me that even when they find one of those unicorn cases they check off all the boxes and recommend not returning to mexico their supervisors overrule them and told me and mi producer naughty rayon about one asylum seeker's case were there attacker even spelled out their motive and it still did not fly it was basically a situation where there was a really clear connection to the nationality the persecutor head really said i am harming you because of this nationality you are nationality and the harm was really really severe it was lye definitely torture and h it was really clear that the police were not going do a thing about it did not care at all and the supervisor rejected it why lidelitawy they said ah we cannot show that if this individual went back to mexico the persecutor would be able to locate them the standard to day's upside down from what it used to be intercredible fear instead of let us ere on the side of letting people in because we do not want any one to be tortured or die under empty p the standard is almost impossibly hot almost nobody gets in the department of homeland security says only about nine hundred and sixty people interviewed have not been sent back to mexico ultimately of a little more than forty seven thousand m p p cases registered as of october with about thirty seven thousand of those still pending of those only eleven people have been granted asylum or some other kind of relief according to works university which tracks all this using government sitistixs eleven and that of the policy was meant to do the administration credits and p p for a sharp drop in the numbers coming to the border mark organ the acting had of customs and border protection calls it a game changer and absolutely successful it only took dog two days and five interviews to go home after work and pull out the law boy he is a lawyer he actually own a beat up copy of the immigration and nationality act the law hundreds of pages long that makes up the foundation of view as immigration system he robbed hat off his bedroom shelf along with a few of his other books from lawful he printed out a bunch of court cases and supreme court decisions with more cases pulled up on his competerscreen in the middle of all this was his pen and white legal pat as an attorney he wanted to get his feelings about temp p how much worse had felt compared to everything else they did down in writing he worked for hours and he wrote down seven bullet points the main ways he thought m p p was a legal once he saw the list laid out there on the lined white paper dug knew what to do the next day he went to tell his supervisor he was not going to do any more i p p interviews his response we i know these interviews are hard were all required to do then its turn spread it out it is rolling basis it camera at camera and an he not that point there is this this moment we could i could have just said you right an ow the sax and gone back and a pas and i told hin he would understand i not doing this inters an a isn't what e you are not down his enemies most now say i can thirlegal to defy moral and ism that at his boss was tuned he did not really seem to know what to say eventually he told him he was probably going to have to write him up somehow to start disciplinary proceedings dug went home that night and decided to escalate he went back to his legal pat i a sente rat a legal memo explaining all of the reasons that of that it was legal and why s refusing to do it and than on that money i he now that to all of the administration an sanfance scow hand a the two supervisors that were involved in the spin perspire and then nothing nothing happened instead of sparking some kind of rebellion or at least forcing a confutation it is crickets he took it as step further he sent his memo to has senator's office then he dropped at his good by hemal attached his metal and sent it out office we to all of san fracisco asylum about eighty people and to a representative of the union for asylum officers across the country and with that dot shut down his work compete and walked out he quiet they make one change and everyone f the officers o this is terrible but well figure it out and they make another change you is terrible but but i mean mi jab i man a do it even if i don wont you a complain about it it complain about the work an to complain about the hours the and of the day i mean a do it and the more i do it the gastritis to do and that is terrified me that is how all the awful things in the world at happen that is how you get many good people doing really bad things and that is what is happening and it is heifer you are likely from my people back courage an gilt that is what this is the three officers i spoke with are not alone a union representing the asylum officers and u says employes file do brief in a lawsuit against the administration arguing that m p p was illegal and a ton of officers are quitting have heard this from a bunch of people in the asylum sort and that citizenship an emigration services the parent agency several use the word axciduss and if officers cannot quit they are calling in sect anything they can do to avoid an p p interviews we tried to get some numbers from the government they would not tell us how many people had left they did say that by the end of the year they hope to have seven hundred seventy one asylum officers but as of a month ago they had something five fifty meaning there roughly two hundred people short i tried to get an interview with the acting head of u c i s can cuchinalli to talk about all this he sense been named deputy homelandscurity secretary he did not give us one but i did get one questioning it was at a press breakfast this audio was recorded on my for i ti molly to s how you to the concerns from some of them you are asylum officers there concerns that many these policies being handed down by the trump administration particularly targeting asylum rain fact a legal it this they are ben ordered to implement policies that are i direct contradiction with t emigration off their pass by contras of a eeonyou waste mats e people of yes ire expected to just we agree to all this a but i you expect that o eyes the professional employes tat you s s for n policies an plays they are for they are part of the executive branch he said and long as we are in the position of putting in place but we believe to be legal policies that have not been found to be otherwise we fully expect them to implement those faithfully and sincerely and vigorously now we are jo shy a p ps first birthday after chaotic start it is thousands returned each week it is expanded all the way east a cross the es border from californium to taxes is cold coast and it is not just central america being pushed back now it is humans then asylums pregnant woman it'll g b p cut asylum at least at the southern border has essentially ground to a halt here is and it'll say this the administrations been successful what do you mean they want negative decisions they do not want asylum seekers in this country they do not want people to get positive decisions or determinations for asylum they have felt that the standards for screening interviews we to low and they wanted those standards changed and those standards raised to end they have succeeded what do you think the administrations end goal is no more people from chitholl countries anna throws up in the shower almost every day she has recurring nightmares she says she cannot focus cannot sleep she thinks about the people she is returned to mexico all the time it is nearly a hunt exit but there's one family in particular that she cannot stop thinking about a father and son why do you think that case sticks with you kid was really young what happened to how did is git get kidnap he get murdered happening happening a lot wat was content what is my moral culpability in not i interviewed that case in my signatures on that paper work and that is something now that i live with ye i feel i feeling some is that this administrations made me humanerates piece the irony of this policy is that under our asylum law to qualify for asylum you have to have been harmed because you are part of a particular group a certain class of people and the way that the asylum officers have implemented an p p they have created exactly that ut huge group of people in need of protection about sixty thousand migrant forced by the you ask back to mexico to be preyed upon there as they wait on their request for safety in e ass it is exactly the sort of situation that our law was supposed to prevent one asylum officer told me it is the first time that we have been asked to affirmatively do harm to people you are not just saying i do not think you are eligible your literally saying i believe what you are saying i think you are in danger go back to that danger malyotoo covers immigration for the lot angels times sure a print version of the story also is that their outside by thewy in the wake of her story u s a stout o a hunt to figure but who talk to her and to us and issued warnings to asylum agents not to speak with the press about what is happening inside the agency coming out what sound when the cartels get on the phone and bargain with your family for your life we have recordings that is in a minute in ocagobobagridio wen our programmed continues this medical life my r class to day a program the out crowd stories about the people the tens of thousands of them who a been pushed into mexico by the presidents remain in mexico policy another policies but dicing about what happens to this people as they wait in mexico for months were we running this upside today because it just when the first polite are ever given for audio journalism and the polisher's hundred plus year history and we have arrived at at two of our program at two is about the danger that these asylum seekers face when the sent back to mexico a two take the long way home if you are to take which border city in mexico is the most dangerous wavelareto get across the border from hereto texts would be a good contender the state apartment classifies that is level for threat that is the same threat level as a rack and

couple of document in them and none of them had shoe laces yours emigration take shoelaces from anyone the detain most of them were men many of them with her heads down and one par stands out to me a father and son in machine polo shirts both of them sweating in the heat there chubby soft faces dad has his arm around son they seemed the talk to me the man it'll call him divide quickly tells me a story do o e the e e the a the o e the the a a lady tat get tea a be a redo he says he is not a criminal he is a person who is always made a living but he cannot live in his country any more they are from hundred divide was a business man he ran a little clothing store the gangs there demand money they call it a war tax the tax gappitting higher and higher and told divide's family could not pay it any more one night the cartel broke into his house threatened to rape his daughter and they fa have don lots of interview with people avid migrants and really difficult situations this one felt especially hard i think just seeing a father fall o part in front of his eleven year old son in won the me we we o e e e o e e the bet e in the on the he tat we we soon the board davit says he wanted to ask for asylum in the us but the agents did not listen to him they just gave him documents to come back to a court date in remember he cannot go back to hundreds he says o then e the e the e o e the y o the o e e the the a we e the o t o o e the the e e we the e the a the e the e the i don have anywhere to go i do not have anything i do not have money he says they say that here we were being sent a lot of people get kid napped and i do not know what to do we only talked for ten minutes i anted up lending him my phone he called his sister new jersey and explained what happened then he made it to the united states only to be sent back to mexico it was getting dark out and it'd been told not to stay in not e let lo past dusk i crossed back into the us to go to dinner probably not a mile away from where i last seen divide and my phone rang it was divide's sister it'll call her laud she had my number because it was my phone he called her from earlier to day she was crying hard i struggle to understand what she was saying she tells me divide in a son of in kidnap just hours after i left them she would got in a call from a cartel demanding ransom o a a i o o e e e e o laud says that the cartel told her the ransom was nine thousand dollars for divide and another nine thousand for has son eighteen thousand total they put divide on the phone briefly she knew he was alive and then the kidnappers got on e to o do my and i told them where in the ward are we going to get this money the man on the other and told her she had to get the money he said he would call back to morrow i asked laud to record the phone calls a en and she did when they called the next day she put them on speaker and used her relative's phone to shoot bid of it e in looking on no e ben o on a t nontmonin a matin amen yet eating o men then an may tell her i need you to deposit the money as sooner passible be a hate the ahutha means old lady laud is thirty eight she tells them again that she has no money that she is sick from anxiety in her conversations with me laud is scared crying but when she talk to the kidnappers she holds it together she ask if saved in a son array they cannapers tell her they have food that they can bathe for now each call and we last a few minutes o o are to by the third day the cartel has lowered the price to five thousand dollars each for saved in his son laud works the nightshirt at a printing factory and new jersey hardly makes twenty thousand dollars in a year plus she is a single mam and all o these calls the canneppers talk super fast ism guessing because they have other ransom calls to make canneppings a big business a volume business with a whole in for structure catnapping migrant has been common an mexico for a long time what is different now is that the us is making i as bestial easy for the cartels to identify an snatched victims they are sending asylum secret back in big groups all at once same time each day and there easy to identify with heir plastic bags and missing shoelaces homeland security did not respond to my request for common on the kidnapping situation but this week the acting head of customs an boarder protection say the guess is quote sending a message to the criminal organizations to stop exploiting these migrants in noevoladeo the most dangerous part of these has asylum sects journey is probably that hours rite after they been sent back to mexico after walking across the bridge their transported to the medical emigration office by van landside the office men in fordo trucks monitor whose coming and going locals call them losmalos the badguises one migrant told me about getting chase as he walked to a shelter from there but by far the most dangerous place as a best station it is a place they go to escape navel level but it is a place sand of getting call canneppbing is routine the cartels refer to it as passing through the office on the extortion calls you can tell its a well oiled machine it is methodical they sound the negotiating the price of a a they do this all the time i loud turns to everyone she can think of she goes to hour local police department an her her mayor's office to ask for help they reach out to the office of sender cry booked but by the time to get back to her about a week later it is too late laud eventually scrapes together money from her madman sister but just a fraction of what the cartel is asking for et jato the yo the tin minoring anti she tells them look have already pulled together twelve hundred dollars tell me what were going to do and give me time to get the rest the man says of confer with his ball in the meantime he says she should wire the money laud asked to talk to her brother and they put hem on ta onto anta she asked have how are you brother worried he says she tells the do not worry that she is pulled together some money the next day the cartels release saved in his son i talk to saved on the phone three days after his release he is distressed it is hard for him to finish the sentence vespid beside cuspid greed i tell him i wanted to help him that is not something a reporter spoke to say but back when there final their lives were an immediate danger and i helped in small ways i connected laud with an into in mexico city that advocates for migrant since divide in hi son were released have suggested safe bassoptions the family they always knew that i was a reporter during a story on them but they came to see me as one of the few people they could trust that they could rely on laud called me almost every day with that dates she still does a few weeks ago i went to meet tacit in his family in monthodey an northern mexico when they were hold up they were staying with an acquaintance of laud's an exchange for grocery money and hoped with construction divide did not want us to interviewing him there he feels his welcome has run out we do the interview at our hotel it divide his eleven year old son and his nightenural daughter he is also been sent back to mexico under my p yes is poticatic ism here with my producer line we figure we talked to divide in one room while the kids watched the we in the other i but the kid sit by their at on the bed they will not leave one another side i wanted to know what happened when i left him that day on the bridge and what he described were all these details of how the cartels kidnapping bus in this actually works wont your victim on theanside details that were routine and also terrifying here is what happen he said he and the other hundred people who were sent back to mexico that day were taking from the bridge to the local emigration office for processing after that he says the man wearing a medical emigration officer uniform agreed to take him in a see to the best station they can go to a safer city but as soon as they got to the station he got a bad feeling gentle ti me o ill me me wen i wanting wit my son this god grad me was a told on strong fool of the use he grot me an he said i want a talk to you and i said id have nothing of to you most and he said you on not gain to the care means is comequersions an i it do not and he since you can gain to the car these who were r the hard won no a we ma let them most them he says that least a dozen migrants also arrived at the best station that night and the cartel hustled them into different trucks all the trucks were brand knew he says he remembers that the one he got in to was a grained sin and there were four or five other migrants in their with him he says the emigration officer who drove him to the best station sat in his car and watched them all being carted off we cannot confirm this but there is a long history of long force went in the cartels working hand in hand for example an two thousand eleven seven to officials hat lexicons emigration agency were fired a mid allegations at the agency was involved in the kidnapping at migrants and it squares with what his sister in new jersey told me she wired money to that emigration officer for divide's best ticket and when she got the ransom call they cannapfirs told her to wire the money to that same account the one the emigration officer used she said something is not that the emigration officers account and they hung up i asked the medical emigration agency to respond they told me they have no knowledge of recent complaints of emigration officers turning migraine over to the cartels e er and the true divide held on to a son the cannappers did not speak i lot nigledio goatee molagavithe gid just told us to keep er hance ton it is a stop looking at the sides and the gat who was driving us was keeping any on us and he was making sure we were not crying they had the windows sol told at a also they talked over round for a while but divide suspects they were just going in circles that they did not actually travel very far they pulled up to a normal looking house with the big gate inside the cannot presume air self ones to take pictures of divide his son in the rest they interrogated divide about where hes from his line of work how he got to the best and most importantly what family members he as there it was patient an take at a house chance except for by cartel we talked about the cartellsas organized crime but i never imagine the book keeping they keep records in forces of the migrants i kidnap and also who they release divide says there were more than twenty migrants at the house the men an women supped in separate rooms during the day the cannappers hit any the men who tried to look at the women the room avid in his son sultan had one mattress every one else leapt on the floor at night davit pul lay on the ground holding hi son lokaasiis comagosagon in you and gone salt la anal a would lay don we him in a corner and that would hack my son the you an for his could not see you crying but my hes were almost falling out i one leave they what heard we the most telly one that when the to arrive the ball he would always tell me that my sons organs were good for seeing that he was in a good age that he was only even years old they a he had on we go bate and my son once head the guy the say that he kids that he pagans were good for selling and he was almost crying and i told him tons crime but i was this be i hid ben havoc as divide tells me the story his two kids are sitting on the bed beside him neither of them is looking at anything in particular they're just sitting there blankly divide also seems devoid of emotion he does not at all resemble that divide from a few weeks ago the were i talked to rite after his release now his affect is completely flat ms on the fourth day of his kidnapping when the bosses woke davit up and told him they would reached ta deal with his sister they make how and he said to me get up with your son fad my this to they an gonna release you gas because yous we the already paid made a the pulsing solo socomocael the man told divide if he talked to any one police reporters the cartel would come for him take his son and killed aside the same man who kid nap them in the first place drove them back to the bust station and bought them he chum ticket cavie does not know what happened to the dozens of other people on the house most migrant were a kidnapped in released the cartel gives them a key word it is a past cote that indicates the migrant has paid off the cartel they are not kidnapped again bet avid is not given one maybe because he has not paid a high in a ransom when we met avid in montage he did not know what he was going to do on dey one of the kidnapping the cartel had taken divide in his sons emigration paper work and they did not give it back without that paper work he does not even know which day he suppose just show up in court but even if he could figure it out he told us he is too scared to return to nowavelavelo under i p p he have to assure the same port ofvintry to get to his hearing what if we get kidnapped again he asked last week i get a ponecov from divide the family they been staying with an montero wants them gone and he is lost hope in the asylum process he thinks they will not be listened to that the hearing processes alive and in fact he is right about how escapes likely to come out under this administration it is virtually impossible to gain asylum based on going violence davits decided to tape his family back to under us the country they try escaping in the first place according to home land purity his own statistics thousands of other families are making the same choice family green laser reported on to vide for vice tot cam little up dates his refers ran this story dad return to honors and then his family

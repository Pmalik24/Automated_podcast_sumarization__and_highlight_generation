welcome to the superman science science pace to i mandrhubermen and on a professor of neurobiology and entomology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor peter area his second time on the podcast doctor peteratea is a medical doctor who did his training at stamford school of medicine john's hoping school of medicine and the national institutes of health he is a world expert in all things related to health spin vitality and longevity in this episode we focused on many topics focusing mainly however on health spin and longevity and mental health healthspin and longevity of course relate to how long one lives and doctor area goes systematically through the seven major causes of death world wide beginning with cardiovascular disease and cerebral vascular disease also cancer also accident related deaths de geisha deaths of despair and in every case explains the three or four major levers that one can employ in order to offset that is to prevent those major causes of death what follows is an incredibly informative and actionable set of tools for anyone male female young or old he explains the behavioral nutritional supplementation based and prescription drug based approaches that one can use in order to extend healthspin and longevity doctor ate explains the key tests and markers that we should all pay attention to if our goal is to extend our healthspan and how to do while maximizing our vitality this is something that not a lot of people think about when they think about healthspin and longevity but as doctor at illustrates for us emotional health has everything to do with our physical health and vice verse and he shares quite openly about his own experiences in pursuing ways to improve emotional health and thereby healthspin life spin and vitality doctor area is quite open about his own experiences exploring different practices to improve emotional health as ways not just to improve healthspan longevity and vitality but of course also to derive the most meaning and satisfaction from life throughout today's discussion we also discuss doctor area's newly released book which is entitled outlive the science and art of longevity this is a phenomenal book i have read it cover to cover now three times i have extensive notes written throughout and the book of course focuses on longevity and healthspan and also has and extensive section on emotional health gets quite detailed into doctor tea's personal experiences with emotional health and tools to improve emotional health that are very actionable for anybody to use think the best way for me to summarize my feelings about the book would simply be to read the pachalic quote which i provided i read quote finally there is a modern thorough clear end actionable manual for how to maximize our immediate and longer health firmly grounded in data and real life conditions this is the most accurate and come defensive healthguide publish to date outlive is not just in formative it is important and indeed outlive is an important book as is the discussion that doctor tie graciously provided us in to day's episode outlive is released on march twenty eighth twenty twenty three and is available for reorder prior to that date you can find a link to were it sold in the shownote captions before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science bactrolectorolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doctor slash superman and now for my discussion with doctor peter a tea doctor at peter welcome back talisman you to be back and sounding better this time looking forward to talking about in number of important topics with you that you covering your book maybe could start off by trying to set the frame for what people should be thinking about in terms of vitality and especially longevity i mean i think you i have to be mindful how you define these terms and ism not get a suggest that the way i define them is the only way rneserly the best way but i think from a clinical perspective it is the way that makes the most sens to me having thought about this for the better part of a decade it involves some bifurcation between life spend and health span lifespan is very easy for people to understand is binary you are alive were you are not alive and a clearly part of longevity is about how long you live i think for a lot of people that tends to be where the discussion ends that tends to be the focus of it righted sort of win longevity somehow implies living for an a hundred years hundred twenty or some something like that intone we talk a lot about maximum lifespan ism even in laboratory experiments with mice that sort of one of the metrics that is that is discussed is what is what is maximal life span of the animals ism but there is an equally if not slightly i think potentially more important partalongevity which is healthspan and healthspan is squishier and i think it requires some definition now the the medical definition of healthspan is the period of time by which you are free from disability and disease ai find that to be a not particularly healthful definition because by that definition you and i have the same healthspan to day that we did thirty years ago but i know you pretty well me pretty well thirty years ago we were twice the men we are now based on what we believe our healthspan is right interns of our cognitive function our physical performance anythings that have clearly experience the deterioration of my physical function as immature you have going back to when you were attend a or lateen age early twenties and i think that needs to be captured somehow in healthspan the way i think of healthspan really is along these three dimensions physical cognitive an emotional can not necessarily suggesting that that is the only way to do it but i do think that clinically it makes the most sense and therefore any thing that really becomes a question of longevity has to address all of these issues life span physical health beyond that of just straight up disability and disease cognitive health independent of and separate from pathology such as dimension an emotional health which of course is by far the most complicated of all of these because we have no bookmarkers for it we have now is not you can get a scan on somebody and determine the state of this ism but nevertheless it is its important get and it dramatically factors into quality of life with all f that in mind what are the major exit points for people along the life span mouth start with the the binary one dead a alive yet i i think most every one healthy would to be alive rather than dead what are the typical ways that people exit from alive to dead and a how can people stay on the a free way of life to speak this is again a great analysis we internally a in our practice call this the death bar analysis and it is the surprisingly trivial analysis that ism just surprised the death bars are not plastered front in center on every doctor's office i if you simply just look at actuarial date which are readily available through the s d sea and do a little bit of data manipulation in a a lysis you can pretty quickly realize what the horsemen of death are cause there is largely speaking can a four horsemen of death a the first and most a consequential in terms of the numbers is the diseases of others across that is a cardiac vascular disease being the lions share of that but also cerebrovascular disease anything that has to do with others sorosis rises to the top now that is that is true in reunited states but it is even more true outside of the unitedsites is even more true glowbely son o the words when you look at the relative difference between the number one cause of death in the u s and number too which is cancer a the gap is actually smaller in the u s than gloomily global it is enormous we are talking about eighteen to nineteen million people a year that are dying of there carotid card yo of vascular disease in the world where is number to is cancer out about eleven million how does the number change when you include a sleep of vascular disease yet it adds it adds a bit to it a strip of ascot disease has there is largely speaking you can die sort of through embolic events which are the majority of them tho we claimed for people at what embolic of thence are yes taking a step back it what what is the brain need more than anything it needs bloodflow anything that interrupts blood flow to the brain that results in ischemia is a devastating and it is devastating in a more red you now readily apparent fashion than virally any other organ a one way that that can happen is if a clot or disruption of blood flow occurs through obstruction of bloodfin sop that con cur through cloth for examples presents atrial serrulation and a blood clot gets festering in the right atrium and they happen to have a whole in between the you know atria of their hearts called it paten men of valley and a clot goes from right to left it can make its way up into the a arterial circulation and an happen that way where typically blufdflow the much more common way it occurs is the same way it occurs in the heart which is you have place build up and that place becomes unstable that place ruptures and the rupture of that place results in an immediate attempt by the body to fix the problem but in doing it walls off the artery meaning the blood fly distal to that point that now blood is acutely being robbed of that however there are other ways that people can a have this problem and you have the whole hemorrhagic side of this you can have blood vessels that you now small blood vessels in the brain that will rupture as a result of hi blood pressure for example hypertension factors both into both sides of this occasion a both in the hart and in the brain a the majority of these are embolic however do not quote me on this exactly but call it four five to one strokes result from an embolic phenomenon as opposed to a a remora gig phenomenon a bleeding phenomenon i do not want take us too far off on a tango but as long as we are here talking about bleeds of prison clots whatever some of the major risks for bleeds i mean i know some people out there have at it predisposition for being a bleeders as there sometimes called or clovers nothings a factor five lion mutations h which can be exacerbated in women for incense by taking certain or contraceptives a in it and there is useless if people arc in the they can look up the what are the factors a controlling a bleeding and a predispose people to be in clatter but for the typical person out there who feels healthy but might do well to know whether not they are predisposed to be a leader or a clatter shall what sorts of things rise to the top of that list and that people might want a check well mean there might be sorter two different things going on in that question but i think if your question is when we look at the subset of people who ware at highest risk for hemorrhagic strokes the far more german question is not underlying coagulopathy the far more german question really comes down to blood pressure blood pressure would be the first second and third driver of that high pretension is hands down the leading driver of hemorrhagic stroke phenomenon o case it'll just a briefly interrupting as am since sometimes your recommendations deviate from the the standards that one would find on liner in the typical doctor's office and what point do you get concerned well i i actually find myself a quite in line with the most recent available data on blood pressure and this has been am obviously is a topic that is of high concern to any doctor who taken variations who even pays a fraction of attention to the available literature which is that basically with each subsequent blood pressure trial the data are becoming clear and clearer that the more aggressively you manage blood pressure to be within the one twenty over eighty range the better et others a recent study that even looked at going from what used to be considered acceptable which was one thirty to one thirty five over eighty eighty five we use to basically say that is kind of the first level of high pretension and we would say well do you really need to be better than that and the answer turns out to be yes you do if you want to reduce hartatacxs an strokes be it is better to be one twenty over eighty than one thirty five over eighty five now this is a whole other habit all that we do not need to go down butt is a total obsession of mine which is how do you measure of person's blood pressure i think this is potentially i have to give a thought but honesty i could say top three under diagnosed fixable problems in the united states to day and probably global another were there are too many people walking around with high blood pressure who do not know it and i think part of the problem is it is something that is mostly done in the doctor's office and the readings that you get in the doctor's office can be often misleading you you have heard this phenomenon of white high pretension to you go tote doctor your blood pressures virtually never measured correctly in the doctor's office the cuff they put on in the yes squeezebull yes not you i you look at the rigor with which you me to measure person's blood pressure the right way to do it is the person has to be sitting this for five minutes doing nothing o folk when u go to the doctors now do not let the do not let the lit cress ut pressure again sitting for fivementes and that does not include in the waiting room cause it men lifinma had i hae an walk over right it is to make them stand there you you onto be sitting there this ism a manual cuff is better than an automated cuff but not enough people use manual blood pressure a manual blood pressure means that put a cuff on you and they she put a stethoscope on the breaking artery and there using the human ear to listen which believe or not you would think a machine is better but it is not the machine can be misled by different sounds no i do not want to suggest that automated cuffs are useless there not but when an automated cuff gives you an answer that is potentially suspect always back it up with a manual ism pretty relentless about checking my blood pressure and i it'll do side topside manual verses automated every day and there is easily a ten to fifteen point difference between them if is the silly lesson but can people check their own blood pressure a meaning manually yet just could it could i get get a come madman and learn how to do it yet i thinks o man i can do it but on sea u a my wife do it she is a nurse ism but it is not rocket science to check blood pressure ism ism guarantee there is a great city on you you tit explains the physiology of it and if you are willing to splurge on a good enough stethoscope and cuff the the cuff i have is really easy to use it is once you put it on you know it is in a single thing ism squeezing the bulb and looking at the pressure gauge while have got the i a stethoscope on my artery given the importance of blood pressure and this a is claros is being at the top of the list of a risks rim dying ism it seems to me it might be worth the expense what words that typical range of cops for or quality i i i do not get's not it is not an ordinates i feel my blood pressure cuff is forty box ism and the stethoscope is a couple hundred box if you are getting a good one and ism you know good automated cuff there is i i i have no affiliation with any these companies i use a i use two automated cuffs one's called within's the other one's made by company called moron o m are and ism there both decent but again they tend to run my and i have yet to find a credible explanation from cardiologist as to why everybody acknowledges that the manual one when done correctly is the answer but have heard monkey assures about why automated ones are sometimes in correct and again its just made me realize we are not checking good pressure often enough on people were overly relying on blood pressures in the doctor's office which are not being done correctly o we basically have our patience do this relentlessly how often a let say one bruise this cause i think for two hundred forty dollars an if i realize that is prohibited for some people but even the cosses some the other things there discussed on this in many other a a i would just ow people start with an automated cuff to begin with in start we'd there we generally have people do it for two weeks you no we we give our patients a little spread sheet that automatically calculates averages and stuff that tells them what to record and wear and we just say look for two weeks we want see two recordings a day and you know do in morning and an afternoon slash p m recording twice a day for two weeks and let us see those numbers and we'll scrutinize them further and if those numbers come in fine let us re visit in a year we will the day ever come when a a watch were i island can do this really well i hope and ism investigating it i ism actually on to be trying one out yin a couple of weeks with a company that i tried two years ago two years ago when i try that i was not impressed i count of punted on it the company which i guess all not share the name of the company u see at but they they claim that it is significantly better ism n to put it to the last again and it is basically a continuous monitor it it is a risk device that about every fifteen minutes throughout the course of the day will check your blood pressure to me this would be i honestly probably more import how much emphasis i place on c g m as a great thing to beagle to gasclycosman right i i would argue this would be more important when the day comes that we can continuously assess people's blood pressure m it would be an integral part of a persons healthcheck up once a years do two weeks of continues blood pressure monitoring right now to do that which have done as well is cumbersome that it borders on absurd you actually have to wear a blood pressure cuff that is attached to a clumsy device that goes through the whole inflation exercise every fifteen minutes including while you are sleeping you ow it provides some in sight but it is disruptive that it is not what we really want what we the dream would be a patch that you could put i do not know over your chest that can somehow impute changes in blood flow or something that and regulate but we will see o between optical censors and things that i hope that we are getting closer to having something i do not want a stroke i do not want a bleed in the brain i want a cook u as long as were at this number one on the list ruler claros is being the number one killer what are the major ways to prevent it yes there is three big ones that stand out top and center and then there is cunt of a fourth one that i think is the the foundational piece the three big ones we have talked about one blood pressure if your blood pressures one twenty over eighty or better that is important the second is not smoking turns out that smoking and blood pressure are both devastating for arteries a but for different reasons right smoking is devastating from a chemical perspective it is completely irritating to the endothelium to the endothelium as is the single cell lining that is the innermost part of the arterial and arterial wall this a pretty special organ ism again it is it is it is a bit naive but understandable that people just think of arteries as tubes i they are much more complicated than that they have many layers to them but this particular layer is unusually important it has an outsized importance because it is the one that is in contact with the luminal side right where the blood is flowing in the tube and anything that injures that has significant consequences smoking is irritating to that in chemical way and blood pressure is irritating to that in a mechanical way though those two things basic we you just want it but that is the lowhanging fruit in my world great you just do not not o have those things causing irritation to the endothelium because that renders you now susceptible to the third factor which is ago be bearing like approtines i want a talk about ago be ism in depth but as long as do not smoke is the second recommendation on the list i can we better define i smoking and what is being smoked it some nicotine for ism right what about canabuts and what about raping of nicatinin cannabis because raping has become much more common got it is a great question and it is sadly something we do not have a great answer for i can certainly tell you that there is no reason to believe that smoking anabas is somehow better than smoking cigarettes but the dose seems to be significantly lower in other words let us consider a person who smokes a pack a day for twenty years we call that a twenty pack year smoker some one who smokes two packs a day for fifteen years is a thirty pack yer smoker that is a person whose dramatically increased their risk of a many cancers including lung cancer and also their risk of cardiovascular and fibrovascular disease again ism not a ism not a t h s a i do not i cannot miserly speak for the habits of people that are smoking marina i cannot imagine there smoking that much probably not yet while on a on a joint to cigarette basis they are probably equivalent in terms of harm it i do not know lets say a person smokes a joint a day that would be smoking a cigarette a day it is a twentieth of a pack again i do not want to say that there is no downside to that but it is is probably significantly less i do not i do not think the risk fully tracks i think the same is probably true for raping and i i might be clear i do not think savings a good idea i might my you don't the last time i looked at the data on this it was surprisingly sparse but to me the only advantage i could see to raping was if it was the only way a person would stop smoking there was you i sort of looked at it as it was the definitely the lesser of two evils but tho but far the better sharia was not to do any of these things if if nicotine is what you are after there are better ways to get nicotine for example through oranges and gum and things that that you should not be turning to those things to to do it but but if it was if gum is here and cigarettes er here you do not raping was probably here but boy i do not know for those listening a a peter spaced his hands far apart for gum and smoking and put raping about a third of the way a from gum a told a smoking in other words raping is not good for you but it is not as bad as smoking that would be my that would be my do you have a you have probably looked into this as well would you never did not have sod on nicotine i did an episode on cannabis and that the discussion around anabas gets little contentious for reasons that are importance we have funny people the moment some one starts to confront cannabis as a potential health harm people say it is not as yearly's bad as alcohol which is a crazy argument right getting hit by a bosses in yearly's was getting hit by a mortar cycle in most cases but sometimes now that is this kind of silly it and clearly anabas has medical applications ye clear clearly and then it becomes an issue of the radio of t h c to c b d pic b d forms a shall being quite effective for the treementser informs of pilafs the a uncle charlottes web this itchy wants called very hightest we containing anabas clearly predisposes especially young males to later on at psychosis those tat re during to become clear clear enough to me anyway that people ought to be aware of them at least to may me make decisions on the business of those when it comes to the smoking verses bakings just very very apparent that the chemical constituents of the tape and what people are inhaling are terrible for people and are loved with carcinogens and a much o other stuff many of which cross the blood ring barrier that is what worries me the most nip say not cognition but any time i here about small molecules that small enercanic molecules getting across the blubbing baby and then being maintained in the on for many many years i worry because the experiments is on going mostly in young people away without going too far down that track i i think if people can avoid smoking and raping they should and as you mention there are other delivery devices for nicotine and anabas tinctures at patches and a gums and things that edibles that i if people choose to use those substances i i i think sometimes people would benefit to to imagine what the surface area of the lung is right if you took the alvialer airlocks of the lungs and spread them out you would easily cover a tennis court remarkable now just think about any time you inhale something you are exposing your body is adept an absorbing it i mean we have this unbelievable system for gas exchange that was designed for gas exchange and any time you are putting something else in that wag you are doing a really good job of getting it into your body be mindful of what that is i and in that look that applies to to pollution to i mean that the the am two point five at is pretty good i think once used particulates that lessthan two point five microns a are getting straight into the body i which is look a great argument for avoiding air pollution rightoman i i i was funded finding not to get off on this tangent but to me the most compelling arguments around cleaner energy have nothing to do with greenhouse gases they have to do with air pollution i promise you more people are dying from the particulate matters in air that result from burning coal then are ever going to die from see o to omissions that result from that it is not its and and i would argue that's king to be two orders magnitude it is not even n the same sip coat make sense during the fires would seem to follow me ah because when i was in ore colt were i a bunch of fires than constantly looking i ma wake up in the morning everything was covered with ash i ma dog was having trouble northing i was having trouble breathing ever n was suffering a but therefore websites that one can go ecu just at air pollution and we tend to only do this during fires than no when ideas southern calfornia that than to be fires here i mum it is correlation not causation but for sure i did not set those fires folks but it is clear that it dis drops your breathing for a very long period of time but it is the long tail of that that we are really talking it ear the very small particulate that we know fire fighters for instance and certain i industrial workers can end up with that stuff imbedded in their brain tissue for extremely long priests just not good i you make a really interesting point about em that the a the call for cleaner energy cane run that one up to to a washing a settle some of the debates about climate changes by getting straight right right a hell flags i pass all all the garbage that is i that is being spewed back and forth and just and easily get to the issue at hand right ye just just just make it better for people to not die from the direct consequence it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens it lentic greens now called a one is a vital in mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundation of nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast here's i start taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me i the probiatics that i need for got health i got is very important its populated by got mycrobioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probiatics enothleti greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains and number of adaptions vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste crime if you to truth lentic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash hubormen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they'll give you a year supply of item and three k too again that is thatleti green stock calm slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a item and the k to trying to avoid a sees c each such a difficult word to say especially for narrow scientists are trial sclerosis i get right while it is there which is easier casa atherosclerosis o there you have not making life more complicate for myself typical of me o k am blood pressure keeping it your one twenty high one twenty over et or better do not smoke let us just throw in do not the sir oman is plant my flag iddonaways wade those things in your system if you really want to get the catineor cannabis in your system ago b what is the story with ago b of to explain this you have to tolerate a little bit of chemistry ism everybody's herd of clesterall and a i i i certainly devote quite a bit of time in the book to explaining this because it is important a man it is definably one of those areas where i initially received a lot of bushbuck from the editor and there was a thought that a this is a bit more technical than it needs to be but i i think that sometimes you you need to resort to longer dissertations to dispel mythology colesterall is a lipid it is a molecule that the body synthesizes it is a molecule that is essential for life if you cannot synthesize cluster you cannot live you you'll die in uteri there are rare genetic conditions that prevent the successful synthesis of clesterall i you don embryos that have those mutations do not survive o k why do we need this stuff we need this stuff primarily for two reasons first it makes up a very important structural component of sell membranes as a cell is a sphere we look at them and think their circles but their spheres and their fluid right they they they are not just little perfect big bowling ball s or balloons they actually more and shape and move in these pats that this whatswhat allows cells to be next to each other and all sorts in these they also have channels across all of them and those channels are held in place by among other things klestrall and phospholipids the second thing that makes clesterall important it is the recur sir to some of the most important hormones in our body our sermons testosterone estrogen porjestron in addition to glucocorticoids if you look at them it is really funny in of people with your looking if you huge givemeg the structure of these things ore con father all basically the same they all look really similar and they are all pretty much just ten plates of central understandably when it is something that is that important the body would leave nothing to chance we make all of our own central the central that you eat in food largely relevant it is esterified central it means it has an estrade chain it is too bulky to absorb in the gut most clestrall that you eat in food just goes out your get tract so we have this superimportant molecule that every cell in the body makes but there is a bit of a problem is ice two probe the first prom is not every cell can make as much as it needs all the time you have this demand problem for example if you are sick you are going to need to make farmer glucacorticoids your body's response is going to be to ramp up cortoisall production to mobilize fuel and do a whole bunch of other things and certain cells the adrenal glands aegis to be called on to rise to a higher level of performance and they are not n beagle to make enough cortoisall they are going to have to born or take central from other cells in the body e crane things we use to notice in the ices you i never knew why it was happening i now know is the few times i would accidentally order the wrong set a labs on a nation in the ice you and also order a lipid test or something you would always notice their olestra levels were dropping serum central levels and i now realize why because they were basically just funneling klestrall to the adrenals to make more the cortical but they needed to combat whatever therein the ice you for which is usually the most severe form of you'll stress the body is under you have to be able to transport this stuff and then the second problem is as kestrel being lipid is not water soluble the the most dominant highway in the body is the circulatory system we we can use the lymphatic system in things that but for the most part we use our circulatory system as the highway to move stuff around and the highway is made up of water plasma which is whither is the liquid component of your blood is water and therefore things that are water soluble move easily glucose a sodium electrolytes all of those things are dissolvable in water and therefore they do not need a carrier you just dissolve them in the water and they can go that is why your liver can make glucose that your brain can easily get and there does not need to be a carrier or an intermediary or anything that but unfortunately with clestrall being lipid we cannot do that just as water and oil do not mix clestrall and plasma do not mix the body had to come up with a trick and the trick was designing a vehicle that was water soluble on the outside and fat soluble on the inside that you could baby the clestrall inside along with triglesterides and on the outside it was covered in proline which is water soluble and that is the that is the thing that moves around and that thing is called a like routine and as its name suggest its part lipid part proline limit on the inside proline on the outside and those lip approtines am come large in two different families a one family comes from a lineage called ago b the ago b family which is short for ago like approving b one hundred is a family that is derived from the liver and each of those like approtines has one and only one ago like approving b one hundred on it we shorten it and just call it ago b cause we do not really worry about police approving b forty eight which is a sat attached to kilo microns that are responsible for fat absorption in the gut there very short lived that don't really factor into throw gross sore just for the purest out there there is an ago b forty eight when i talk about it when i say ago b what ism talking about is a proline that raps around a subset of these like approtines there is another family of like prolines called ago a or ago like approving a this is a much more complicated family and i rant a talk about it here ictus were retake an our to just explain how the ago like approving a family works but it'll it'll it'll urge the punch line is there are many ago like atropine avers variable numbers of ago as on those prolines and they are all part of a family called high density like prolines back to the ago b gie they are of the lo density like approving lineage you have heard the term el dell an ah duel what as it referring to it is basically referring to the relative concentrations of proline and lipids in the like prolines and not surprisingly based on their names the h d ls are higher density more proline less lipid the el dos lo deny like prolines and el deals very density lie approtines and ideals entered intermediate densely lie routines are all lower density which means more lipid doprotine they're different sizes there is a all munch of other things going on most important fact in all of this is that the ago is are pathogenic what we are about to talk about n next is perpetuated by life ofprotines that have an ago b on them everything in the story right now is just about how do you get clesterall round the body and these m prolines that have lipid in the middle u less just take ago b for example many many billions of them flooding round in our body even in the healthiest of people e u and there being shuttled to tissues that need them em the adrenals muscle heart et camera what sets the demand for these things for instance could somebody have relatively high el do a maven higher than s from high end of chart or even above high and ago b but there is some sort of demand metabolic demand or or the their wait training a lot or there running marathons and they need a lot of ell the a he reason i ask us is because it is easy for the uninformed person which i include myself in that group just that here oh elder bad collesterall bad ago b bad when in fact you very graciously spelled out the fact that the these things chilly perform of functional role in the healthy body before we get into why they are or can be bad why would you want a lode's parroting what is that doing for somebody and is there any circumstance where the a people are exercising or thinking or not sleeping or sleeping too much its that a higher level lathi reflects a a healthy metabolic need we do not have any evidence of that to at em all of the functions that i described can be function can be done by the ah deal the hides prolines the ago as can do all of it ago b and lode's lipoproteins are just there just the necessary a we do not easily i mean now we do not understand why we have em under this is the part that is really interesting to me em most species do not even have ago b and is a result of that most species are chemically incapable of throw gross if some one could zero out there ago b in their el die we assume they would function just for we know they would because we have certain people who walk around with genetic mutations that render them that way well furthermore we also know that there is a bit of a with out there that collesterall the clesterall you measure in your blood is essential for brainhealth for example it is an understandable thing right you you can speak to this very eloquently the rule of colesterall in the brain the i r ate done when i was a stock at stamford shwas went out i was aren't stamford train ta stamper wheres upright diet stamford fully along our i now do tell me how long well we y the and early ready the charge monger thing and make sure that you never go back to stamford that you cannot either there exactly we cured already that when i was a stock i were to the giving ban arras o i know covey at ta different person then o for reasons that people can look up man's name anyway incredible scientist and but there was some one in his lab that discovered that colesterall is a critical component of the snap to genesis process the for the formation of connections between euros and the developing brain and then that what when on to it lead to the discovery of things a thrombospondence being important for snapped jess et camera but collestral citcentral in the brain development mechanisms to get you want collestrall around gaffer brain development in fact i think very low fat diets and very low central dietstring early development can really impair brain development as i understand ye it is not it is to entirely clear why but here is what we know when you are born your serum clesteral levels are very low children infants children have very low levels of clestrall they would have and i should explain one thing that is important not militated yet right have ben there they a aside intros by the a milia of course that the sheathing around a a her on neuronal a on it which excellencies the propagation of nerve signals and which is deficient in things multiples sclerosis is essential fat made up of fosphelip and requires central for senses but but young children are not very well smiling vain the spinal court is mil right o l ais a ants and this is of it is interesting right we would all agree that clesterall is more important to infants and children than to anybody else right it would be the most important substraiht for seines development and yet infants and children have virtually unmeasurable levels of clesterall it really starts to take off in your than age years rights o clesteral basically serum clesteral levels rise basically monotonically throughout life i women get a big bump at mananas it really goes up for them i but what is interesting is how is it how do we reconcile the fact that infants and children have really low levels of serum clesterall yet clearly undergo seines maturation without any problems and a easily comes down to to follow what you measure in the serum is but a fraction of the total body pool of clesterall we get a little bit of a the light under not wit is the e of the the street lamp under drunk under a drunk of his ran an a roteryijust because we are looking there we tend to think that that is what were seeing but i if you took the in hie circulatory pool of central it is about ten per cent of your total body celestial it is a tiny fraction of it it is what we measure that is what we have access to but it really represents virtually none of it i do want to say something cause you mentioned l d l i want to tie this fact to the reader it or the listener rather ago b refers to the lipoprotein the singular like approving rapped around an l d l particle if you happen to be lucky enough that your doctor measures an ago b level it is a blood test it says ago b ex number of epigram's pretest leader that is measuring the concentration of that proline it is a direct measurement of the concentration of l d l and v l d l particles when you have a blood test that says l d l it usually does not say l d l it usually says l d l c or l d l central because l d l is not a laboratory measurement l d l celestial is a laboratory measurement and it is just taking the total number of l d l particles breaking them apart and measuring how much celestial is in them l d l c measures the total concentration of central in the l d ls ago b measures the number of them and they are different but one of them is far superior at predicting risk and it is ago b the number of particles is much more predictive of risk than the amount of celestial contained within them fascinated first time have understood a t l l d l and these a lips routines in a way that make sense o thank you ism sure others feel the same way what ago b level is your red flag cut off i u i should have my ago be measured recently and ism defy above the his end i discussing this over dinner i and we and a just to tie this back m i hope that is a stake dinner and that should be fine given the fact that dietary collestral has no directing to ago b and loser but dietary saturated fact does ah o basil which is not that were not an a mistake or i will but nonasarily one in the father cuts although poly will be a for me what is what is the his end that you a hi and flag at what point you are say ah we need to do something an they will talk about what people can do yes this is a complicated question because it depends on many factors the first factor it depends on is what is your objective and i do pose this question directly to a nation right i say look we have got this disease that is the number one cause of death now you can die with it or you can die from it that these your choices statistically speaking more people will die from it than anything else but if you live long enough we will all die i the it to some extent if you are me and i come from a family history as i write about this in the book where basically every man in my family except one has died of throw gross and they have all done very prematurely a my dad lost brothers in their forties and fifties a by some miracle my at is toll alive at eighty six but that i think that is in large part because he at least had the good sense to listen to doctors and take medication to lower his cluster on blood pressure i if you are objective is to not die from hart disease and only to die with it then you want adobe as low as possible now how low you go depends on when you start because one way to think about this is it is an area under the curve problem the longer you wait to start doing something about this the more aggressively you need to do something about it i i think a better way to think about this though is to go back to what we talked about with smoking would you agree that smoking is easily related to run anger yes just to be clear drew you do not think that it is just an association that smokers get more lung answer no i do not you you wonders you believe that smoking causes lung answer then yes oh ament there a number of now n insteps in and it in i now somebody is really one get a to your drill into the log it they could say gets not a to the smoking its a momma a destruction of the indithelial alining that smoking triggers that that li triggers that i assumes and i agree with you by the way i think the date are very clem very relieved you but but ism going some place very important yer because if there is one topic that does not get enough attention in medicine its causality and causality is an obsession of mine most of the day on some level i sit around thinking about causality and i think the hardest part about studying medicine with respect to human beings is how difficult it is to infer causality for most things that we do if you believe that smoking is causal related to lung answer then smoking cessation reduces the probability of hung anger that is that is a logical equivalency there can be no debate about that what if i said to you drew this is going to be our new philosophy around smoking cessation you are your own anoint you the czar of so ki sensation if people pick up smoking no problem belong smoke but we are going to assess their risk for lung cant sir using a model that predicts when their ten year risk of lung cancer gets above a certain level we are going to recommend that they stop smoking were gong to look at their age their sex their family history som bookmarkers that might help us were gin to even do scans of their lungs and once we think they cross a threshold we are their risk of lung cancer is high enough let us just say it is twenty five per cent bum you make them stop you tell them it is time to stop is that a logical approach to treating smoking in lung cancer or would be better to say given that we know cigarettes are easily related to this how about you never start smoking and the minute you do we pull the cigarette out of your mouth and explain to you that you are doing something that is easily related of course it would be the latter not the former it would be idiotic to suggest that we indorse smoking until you cross a certain threshold well this now becomes the german question there is no ambiguity that ago b is busily related to others across own can i tell you that i can tell you that looking at all of the clinical trial literature all of the epidemic epidemiology literature and perhaps even most importantly the mandellian atomizations all of these things tell us because by medallion randomization meaning genetic me humans out there that make very little ago be or it is tat very likely exactly s we hale grates he can say if you make very little you are not going to die as a quickly not er life as if you make too much that is modelling randomization is such an elegant tool where you basically let genes do the randomization and as you said there is a gradation of elder concentration or ago be concentration that occurs from insanely low to insanely high and this is a wildly pollygetic jolly more fix set of conditions and we can look at the outcomes of those people based on the random sorting of those genes and there is no ambiguity elder is easily related aldol clasteraller ago be easily related to throw cross well if that is true and i have not seen a credible argument that it is not there are people who argue that it is not by the way but that you do not have credibility in their arguments then you have to say that what we are doing in medicine today is very backwards because we were doing medicine to day is the following we are saying ism him coming out this in a long way but your question is important that i want to answer this way we are answering your question today as follows we are saying drew let us do a ten year risk calculation of your risk of mace may stands for major adverse card agent it is the metric we use in medicine major adverse carded agent is a heart attack stroke you know or death basically resulting from these things and we have calculators they're pretty good at predicting your ten year event risk they will look at your olestra levels your blood pressure the will ask if you smoke the will ask some family history questions and they will spit out a number now we should do yours after the fact and i do not know if we did it for a person who's tuna year in year mid forties it would probably spit out less than five per cent risk for a major adverse carded agent in the next ten years in fact the models do not even work if age is below forty the first time i went to do one of these tests when i was in my mid thirties could not do it the olgrtm breaks let us or a like n does not work the the implication there is if you're if your mace risk is less than five per cent the thinking as you do not need to treat eldealarapobe i argue that that makes absolutely no sense it is just as idiotic as the analogy i used round smoking if a risk is call and it is modifiable it should be modified regardless of the ringtail in duration then the question becomes to what level and again the earlier you start the less aggressive you need to be the less damage that there already frexemple we do it angiograms on our patients if the city angiogram shows no evidence of calcification no evidence of soft place that means grossly their corner arteries are still normal histologically they're probably not because nobody probably makes it to our age with histologically perfect cornariarteries we might be satisfied with a person's ago b being at the fifth per gentile of the population which would be about sixty telegrams per desolator but if we have any other factors meaning were starting later in life young or a person already has gross evidence of disease calcification soft place family history is significant any other risk factors are present i mean we will we will treat ago be to thirty to forty telegrams perdesoleter which is in a probably the first per gentile and if somebody sitting up an the a low one thirties what where does that count a flag does that race for you and i realize it is highly contextual mac et camera no know it is a he dread flag again just because something is caudle does not mean its your your guarantee to get it there are smokers who do not get lungcancer your there can be somebody listening to this who says mike my grandmothers ninety five years old she sis herder clesterall is sky high and she is alive and well and i will say absolutely there are a lot of people walking around that way just as there are a lot of smokers walking around who do not yet lung cancer you you cannot you cannot impute these things on an individual basis you basically have to ask the question how do i make the best judgment about an individual from heterogeneous population data and based on what are caudle and non causal inferences around risk to me if a person has very high ago b and they do not want to be treated for it then the best we would do is say let us at least establish that there are no other risk factors present and let us at least do the most investigation we can around the existing damage and if that person has a perfect so t engine graham ism in a push less hard than if they have a devastating anti gram and by the ay devastating in my book is just any amount of calcification or soft place anything that shows up grossly that you can see on a s t skin means that you have got a decade plus of really bad histology building up to it this a issue causality i think now becomes very clear as why that is crucial and really appreciate the way you spell that out let us say somebody is ago b is eighty a hundred it say a hundred and thirty for example what sorts of things can they do to reduce that number is this always going to be prescription medication and if what are them were common forms of prescription medication that work best what a their side of protect profiles on o ye usually dance you want to start getting down into the thirty to sixty range your on to require farmicotherapy but know usually we want to see how far we can get with nutrition fixing insolent resistance in an insolent resistant person will will bring this down rites one of the hallmarks of icemen resistance as elevated triglycerides they have not we have not talked about triglisrides but they they warren's some attention because i mention it earlier but one of the other things that the like of prolines carry is triglisrides there you are carrying fat and clesteral and if you recall ago b represents the number of particles the purpose of them is to be carrying around mostly clesterall but if you have a high amount of triglyceride you are basically using up cargo space on the ships and you need more ships if a person has elevated triglycerides and i consider anything over a hundred to be elevated even the most laboratory tests would consider normal to be up to a hundred and fifty telegram's predesoleter we would want to fix their insolent resistance bring the tries way down ai i would want to see trig s no more than two times the h deal clestralso the ratio clestrall is sixty epigram's predesileader i con side one twenty to be through the roof high an ideally we want tries at or below h dell olestra the intraglisterstr and a and that is that a any loti lover watery that no actually it is most easily accomplished through carbohydrate restriction carbide triglistrides in some ways are kind of an intergroll of carbohydrate consumption a any energy restriction will get it for you a but it is most sensitive to a to restriction of o a even even under you colonic conditions carbohydrate restriction will lower try bestrides again energy restriction would be count of first order business a but within that carbohydrate restrictionwill probably gets you there quicker you hat you son o take the the low hanging fruit off the table and where does exercise am general ninimalrol for in having insolence's nonaomsory for improving a lipids in general yet but it can province a it can make i absolutely especially combinations of resistance training in warning laser yes are once it comes down to farmer therapy a you basically have several classes of drug the most obvious in the one that most people are wherever called station station's work a both directly and indirectly on the problem directly they work by targeting an enzyme a very high in the synthetic pathway of clestrall production ans one as called h m g come reductase and think it is the second committed step i mi i can be wrong on that it is i do not think it is the first committed step but you that that ends gets targeted con o ubiquitously throughout the body and in response to that the liver senses are reduction in the body's pool of clestrall and the liver really tries to regulate this the liver in response to that increases its expression of eldiell receptors the liver itself has deal receptors on its surface and as the bodies pool of clestrall goes down the liver senses this reduction and says i want to bring more clestrall in more elder receptors go up and more ago b particles are coming out of circulation that is really the dominant way that they work and i back that is kind of the dominant way that all of these drugs work another lass of drug is called ezetemide it works big blocking we can get as technical as you noon this it is called the demon pick we one one transporter in the enterasite a i to explain this i borrow this explanation from today spring but the enterasite is a is overly the luminal got side cell that is responsible for absorption of clestrall member said earlier most the bestride you eat you do not absorb the reason you cannot absorb it is an esterified central molecule cannot come in the demon picks one one transporter it is too its physically too large but the clusterall that you synthesize which once it makes its way back to the liver gets secreted in bile down the intestine that is esterified and readily fits into that transporter i cannot describe that guy as the ticket taker at the bar he let us everybody in as long as they fit through the door there is a check point inside the bar that basically says do we have too much cluster if spit it out and there is another door that acts more the bouncer and he is called the high t pe binding passed g five g eight and he spits excess clusterall out and if that system's working fine everything is great but in a lot of people that eight p binding case does not work very well and it cannot properly regulate the total body pool of clusterall there is a drug called etamine that simply blocks the ticket taker are there side effects to states in at et of i e etamine has virtually no side effects it is a you can think of it is a drug that is acting outside the body right it sort of acting on a a turnstile door in your got i have seen one patient get a sure loose stools from it that became enough of an issue that we discontinued it i would say that when etamine is combined with a station which is very commonly done m it is not unheard of i do not i cannot give you in number but it could be as high as ten per cent that you see an elevation in transaminases which are endives that are made by the liver in response to some irritation this is where i think it is unclear what the clinical significance of that is we tend to abort the strategy in the presence of elevated transaminases a even though the literature says you do not need to our view is we have other options why would we tolerate any inflammation if you do not need to states a do have side effects five per cent of people genuinely in legitimate legitimately get a muscle soreness a they can be debilitating it could feel count of the worst work out you have ever had thou know the day after you have i imagine you had not lifted weights and six months and then you came over and i made you do the most brutal work out of your life you you would fa i every time i commodertate well i work o often a but every time i come over your house you put me through the most g work a have ever through i i think you in campaigns are the duple they so put me through work out that get me sore for at least a two weeks after each visit that soreness that imagine you would have that persisting that five per cent of people get that response from a state an obviously that is just non it is anon it is anon it is anon do there is a narrower subset of people that am do do do get brain fog in to experience brain frog from states and wend we do not really understand the why there we have some theories estowhi you no maybe there maybe there getting too much of a reduction in central cluster synthesis am it get ins u subject of finding but given that we have many tools in the tool kit we do not have to tolerate side effects with these drugs any more there is a day when you now you had somebody who just had a hard attack and their basely looking down the barrel of being on a station for the rest of their life in the were two of them and they you know had tons of side effects and it did not matter to day while there are probably nine stations out there there are really only four that we even use and at least two of them have such a low side effect profile thought not as potent but they have a i mean potent a it of the potent the wrongword they do not have the same effect am but their very potent because you are at least one of them you are taken at such a logos am that we have got lots of statinoptions the third side effect stations which again not common but cannot be ignored is insolent resistance it really and this is one of i think one o the benefits of at least having periodic c g m tracking is we will see this you know what a nation who happen to be wearing c g m in general and then we started him on we know ten telegrams of mazuma station which is probably the workers station right now it is the that is generinerm for creator am and he pings us a couple weeks lanterns man my glucose is ten points up consistently from where it has normally been con command hod we trouble shooter a few things after two months re like let us just stop the creator and a see if that fixes it and at immediately fixed it there as you know we reintroduced the creator and it happened again there is no doubt in my mind that blow doubt in my mind that creator was responsible for that a and again you could say were maybe that's not that clinically significant but i would argue why bother i have other choices those are your two big ones am the next one it is really the big one or apices canine in hipsters you know am gosh come in up about twenty years ago maybe a woman named heller hobby a made a discovery to a group of people that had a disease called familial hyperclustralemia f h or familiar hyproclestrolemia is a very genetic heterogeneous condition going back to that mandellian ranmizations shady these are the people on the far end that show us how high lipid levels causathros gross these people have very high claustral levels tidally north of three hundred telegrams perdesoleader their deal cluster all alone is by definition at least a hundred ninety telegrams pedesoleader a very high incidents of throw gross in this people along with other sort of injuries they accuse they have much clusterall they accumulated in their tendons in their eyes buts it i it is really devastating condition if not managed correctly and she discovered this mutation in a a gene for piece s a nine that codes for a propene that degrades deal receptors these people had viper function in pa s canine genes their genes were just chomping down all the a dahl receptors in the liver these people were not clearing elder bout five years later another subset of the population were discover that were the exact opposite these people had hypo functioning pa s canine they had virtually unmeasurable these people had dial celestial levels of ten to twenty telegrams predesolater and not surprisingly they had no heart disease that led to the development of a couple of amazing drugs that are now used i take one of these drugs have been taken one these drugs for i i price certain twenty fifteen its an indictable drug take it every two weeks and it is a called a pa s canine inhibiter the drug blocks the proline and therefore gives me more deal receptors yanks more adobe to a circulation interesting when we were talking outside effects i i i was thinking are there any short term benefits bogus we call this positive side effects but let us think of it more directly line with the underlying biology let us say my ago be is hi mid range ta to his we all would say a hundred a you not eighty to a hundred am and i prove my insolent resistance the patrician but we decide you know it does not go down much an it continued a to try and knock this number down and and i take o any number of different drugs to reduce it do i immediately start to feel better o there is no nothing s of i think that is an important important point because of the causality issue that we are talk about e earlier because a lot of people are walking around out there feeling fine there adobe might be a bit high they either know it or do not know it but they think all ism feeling fine and you gave a very rational argument earlier as to i because of the causality involved it makes far more sense to intervene yet we do not want to rely on feeling when it comes to others sorosis just to put some prospective on this when i was in medical school we had a i i think i even write about this in the book we had a mythology lecture where the professor stands up there and says m what is the most common presentation of a hart attack and us keener first year me students hand shoot straight up chess pane no it is not the most common oh a shoulder pan are not radiating down the left arm note a nausea shortest a breath non we rattled this off for a few minutes goes death the single most common presentation for a mix cardiac in function is death more pop now i would say to day i was twenty five years ago to day it is probably not the most common because a advance carded life support is much better but it is still strikingly common bet you could say that i the the best predictor of a hard attack is still a hard attack i well e no thing that the best underlying predictor ye it and shall this its home when i was a stock i was living in seas is gone never forget the taking my coffee in a out on my porch in the morning this is right near the you've us a parnasus campus n the guise walking on the street is pry about my age and i said hollo and he said hollo he walked a few more steps and bone just hit the concrete died right in front of me it took i a minor to tod know that he was truly dead it'll never forget it because that is a ever free ones tin gets it it is an event right in the and i followed up on this and because his family the the whole thing i cause they want a report and no cocaine in his system no prior history of any kind of health is us a but he is just strolling along and his bone as if he would been hit by buss yes it is i mean again this is just one of those things were weren't wetness us men a lot of time talking about things that feel good and feel bad when you change them right a you take a person who is not sleeping well but who thinks their sleeping well and you asked them for a leap of faith which is hay give me a month to help you sleep really well yet you are gong to feel better you might not know it now because you do not know how bad your sleeping now you have become acclimated to this i but this is not one of those remains you don't exercise neutrician sleep all those things when you do those things better you feel better but i you i do not want to over promise on this were you are not going to feel better in the moment when you fix your lipids but you will feel better when you do not have a heart attack by all this logic everybody should get their ago be measured how early in lifeship people do that starting in there twenties i in their thirties certainly if you have a family history that is of any concern i can wrest if i could live my life over again knowing if i knew everything then that i know to day i would've had mind measured in my twenties i did not i did not get my ago be measured for the first time probably till i was in my forties because that is well maybe late thirties early forties right i i had my first calcium scared when i was thirty five and i had to begboro steel to get at done cause ever n was why does a thirty five fourfold one do this but i something i just felt something was wrong given my family history i and ism glad i did ism glad i did because i learn something that that completely change the direction my wife o can i know my a up be numbers and t i might be that guy who is up in the above a hundred when to get this treated a that is a promise to myself we covered i the three major is factors which were i blood pressure ism keeping that in check do not smoke m an ago b and we have now talked about the things to a just ago be levels we did not really talk about things to just blood pressure ism assuming exercise sit says one of the for is neutristhye i wait wait management is a huge one here you now you take a person who is but and and this is one of those things where we do not immediately jump on the pharmicautherabe train with be good pressure i because here there are side effects sometimes i and you do have to worry about overshooting don't really we worry about overshooting a person's lipids we do back off if we overshot but it does not cause as symptom there is not a there is not a short turn immediate risk from doing that if you overshoot somebody is blood pressure medication you trade one problem for another problem they become light headed when they get up to pea at night they fall in bang their head that is a devastated consequence totally unacceptable argal is to see how much we can lower blood pressure with out medication before we turn to medication and let us be clear the mess to day are much better than they used to be i get themes a day when the side effects of these medicines were miserable that is that is simply not the case to day i mean son hitters angutens in receptors be ockers an in these things are very well tolerated especially the a or bees i again almost anybody can be on these things but if we could get a person to lose ten pounds and exercise every day we see great effects with down to stuff rights cone of the low intensity cardie and your recommendation there o n talk about this in the book but were we have thrown out numbers about a under and fifty to under ad eighty months per week you go a bit higher ye go one eighty to two fifty to forty i to see three to four hours a we of own to ism that is an important piece and sleep is an important piece is get get the sleep right get the exercise right if you if your if you are over nourished let us correct that problem and if all of that does not work and by the way that works a lot of the time works most of the time if that does not work then we have got farmer cotheripy there is still a true phenomenon of essential high pretension which is in individuals for him all the fixable stuff has been fixed and they still have high blood pressure we still have to medicate those folks by the way there something that i want to mention here that does not get much attention but it is important which is the effect if his blood pressure on the kidney and also the brain itself we have talked about the brain without about the hart but the kidney does not get enough attention the the kidney is a remarkable organ and i think if you are really in this game of trying to live longer right if you if you think ay maybe we will live eighty eighty five years but if we can a start doing all these other things and and really optimizing our behaviors that can be ninety fife will you have to start thinking about the capacity the kidney and once the glamerial or filtration rat falls below a certain level you have to be very careful with how you live your life and unfortunately this is one of those things that is is another sort of mistake that is made and kind of modern medicine which is we do not pay enough attention to how to measure kidney function correctly we rely very heavily on something called am creatine as suppose to looking at another by a markrecalls the state sea which is far more accurate and we so tolerate too low of a kidney function for a person's age we look it you do not we might look at someone who is fifty who is kidney function is at sixty five per cent and say you are totally fine because it is true that at sixty five per cent there is no problem but you are not thinking where if this person has to live another forty years and this continues to go down they are going to potentially be staring down the barrel of needing dialysis the last five years of their life you begin you do not want you want to die with compromised kidney function but never from compromised kidney function in fact hazard race of all cosemortality associated with compromise kidney function is even greater than that of heart disease once once you cross that threshold i mean lights out once you are reading dialysis i mean you are risk of death is higher than that of some one with high blood pressure smoking even someone who has cancer you've a higher risk of death having estate real disease than you do have in cancer the kidney is sensitive to blood pressure this is a tiny organ that on every pump of your heart is getting twenty to twenty five per cent of your blood well just imagine how sensitive and susceptible it is to elevated blood pressure we have covered quite a few corners of avoiding the major killer rather sclerosis i let's talk about cancer nobody wants cancer everybody seems to know somebody who has had or as died of cancer and his we no surprise given that it is number two on the list what are the numbers and what can people do to offset cancer i and of course cant there are huge number different types of cancer i an inside of this conversation i just wanting m you remark that might be good to have a conversation about it'll call i which we did not talk about in the in the last um last discussion but if alcohol is involved or is a risk factor rather for a cartyofascular disease or three rofascular disease now would probably be time to to mention it ya this has been looked at in a number of ways i and si if you if you look at sort of top line epidemiology and you you have heard of these things called the french paradox which is a common the eat all this fatty stuff and drink all this wine and they have slightly lower risk of card love ask disease house have to con to throw that stuff out the window cause there is many confounder there that it is kind of useless epidemiology if you really look at the data clearly and the is lecture really elegant analysis that included some genetic studies that came out an mama about a year ago it is actually pretty clear that there is no dose of eternal that is healthy so there is no racer it used to there used to be kind of this literature that said there is a ja curve associated with ethane meaning at at total abstinence there is a slightly i risk of death then if you are drinking one drink a day and then if you go beyond one drink a day the wrath the the rate of death starts to climb the problem with that an all is there just been a lot of consternation around that but the problem of those analysis are multiple but the most important of these are that the abstainers have a reason for abstaining typically and those reasons cannot be extracted statistically from these analyses it'll leave it at that without met have written many blog posts about this if people are really interested i they can the can go and talk about that i also do talk about this a little bit in the book by the way i but the the short answer is there is no dose of et an all that is healthy i would argue that it is not a straight line of risk but it probably goes i think from zero to one there is probably no measurable harm for most people one per day or one per week probably one per day up to one per day it is probably very difficult to discern the harm but i man have put a can at on that that it'll come back to and then i think the risk starts to clime pretty steeply after that and i think it climes non linearly after that that that is my reading of the literature look et then how do you decide if you arguing to have up to one drink a day and better that is not the same as seven a week because that does not mean seven in a day right which we know is is really detrimental right for especially for the brain right but also the cascades that result from i destructed sleep not just for that one night multiple nights you yet that the literature have seen on call enothat the most now again this is an emerging literature because ism what you are describing exactly right that people are now some more conservative folks are trying to place it at two drinks per week total beyond which you start running into issues especially for women and terms of rest cants or risk which as on i may we can the can circle to have in look at my view is if you can not drink at all you are better off not drinking at all and people always say to met hell peter what is your view on this and my view is i do drink i it'll go weeks at a time without having a drink i have not had a drink have had one drink since i saw you last couple weeks ago because have been six or thinking well corklike the deck is stacked against me ring now why would i do anything to stack in more i but my philosophy which is half tongue in cheek but is is true is i just do not drink bat alcohol i i sort of my wife saw me do this you to day we opened up a bottle of wine and it was a very expensive bottle wine and i took a spin was i just don't my glass was just not taste rites me and it taste it fine to hero i do not think it was that the in it spoiled it was just i did not the taste of it enough to justify drinking it as like can not eel i drinking atman have fortune that there ware times in life yes certainly college and portions average t schoolmen i drank but have never really enjoyed the we am taste or experience abalcol i all the all call the planet dis appear out when even notice but it'll have one everyone in the while ism serve of that of that mine set but am great to hear that zero is better than any am cause i think everyone agrees on that a it does not appear that i'lcall can be directly link to cardiovascular disease and soup of vascular disease although well he is indirect effects or insolent yes ring in tan since that if resin into slip i think i think the the impact of sleep on cardyovascosr marasca disease is profound and i do think that the impact of thereon sleep is under appreciated an and here i i think we should ism doit i a not to mat walker the great mat walker because ten years ago if i some one had a conversation about sleep in how critical it is and how we not getting enough quality sleep is dangerous of people would con to shake their heads and say what is the evidence for that i think mat really deserves am most of the credit for alerting people to these issues around not getting enough sleep it is this remarkable what is happened in the last decade thanks to mat and and water on that topic youknow we have the other next horseman a at the nard general diseases i think those ware also heavily impacted especially on the dimenshaside i by ethanol again i wont to be careful when i say this stuff right i do not believe in fear mongers right know just set a moment gall say it again i i drink alconaman kit need in alcohol but i think that one has to make the trade offs which is if i really do love the taste of certain punish wines i really do love the taste of certain to keels certain mescal really do lovely the taste of certain weird esoteric begin beers and it really does give me pleasure to consume those things in the same way it gives me pleasure to concern uncertain foods that are quite vapid right there no upside in consuming a brown that my kid just made except tor h fat t my kid just made it and it is fun to eat the back brownie with them right come back to this thing about longevity is also about healhspan and part of healthspan is quality of life and you i write about this in the book that i think there is a day when my approach to this was purely an engineering approach which was we are going to optimize every mollacul of my being for this and if you if if you go far down that rabbit hold that the quality of your life interior rates what is the point that is why i think for somebody you who says you could take all the a'lcolf the face the earth would not even notice then that is a great reason not to bother drinking i would not put myself at the opposite end of that spectrum but ism probably further to the spectrum where if you told me i could never drink alcohol again i would be fine with it but it'd be giving something up that i enjoy imbue at the same time i know if i have two drinks with dinner my sleep sucks and therefore that is that is just a threshold i rarely rarely cross i certainly have my vices it'll call just was n to be one of them what about cancer again nobody wants cancer i we all known people ha died of cancer i or have had cancer what can be done to reduce one's risk of cancer will you asked earlier about the numbers let us throw some numbers out there right global were talking about eleven twelve million deaths per year about half the number of a a s v d still a staggering number i at the individual level put it this way somewhere between one and three and one and for chance anyone listening to this or watching as getting a cancer n their lifetime but what is the probably they will i from the ha can tat bout one and six chance of dying o case is it true that every male gets prostate cancer most in other words have brother and that every man will die with prostate cancer and some will die form a you and i have prostate cancer right now thank you for informing h i hopefully we will not die of it we should not die of it crossing anger clan cancer are cancers that no one should ever die from because they are easy to screen for they are easy to treat when they are in their infancy m that it is totally unacceptable that people are dying from this therearother cancers for which i cannot really say that breast cancer much more complicated pancreatic cancer much more complicated glow best only multifoliate much more complicated that is you said a second ago cancer is not a disease it is a category of diseases each it is not just that each organ is different and breast differs from pancreatic it is that within breast cancer e r p re positive or two new positive is a totally different disease from the triple negative breast cancers those with brackamutations or nonbook commutation well even putting that aside just looking at the the hormone profile of the individual breast cancers they are totally different diseases it is not just that breast cancers different from prostate cancer it is that all breastcancers are quite different maybe i should frame the questionable differently then given the vast number of different types of cancers and category l o on else yo your question is still affair when i dare not to throw that cave out out there an now it's your question o case what do we know it turns out that we can very comfortably speak tom several things one is the role that genes play i maybe it'll just spend one second on get one o one thing for for the for the viewer we want a differentiate between what are called germ line mutations and sematic imputations i your germ line and my germ line are set when we w ere born our gremlins mutations any mutations we have in gremlins genes are inherited from our parents it turn on gosh not egos yon yo you got those things question one is how much of cancer results from those types of genetic mutations and the answer is very little less than five per cent very now you mention one i moment ago brake locates o mutations in brake are germ line mutations a woman will get a braccimutation from one of her parents and we will often have a cense of that just from the family history when mam and sister and aunt and grandmother had breast cancer you have got a bees cancer gene now it might be brake it might be another gene that is not brake but there is no ambiguity and we test for these genes mostly just for insurance purposes frankly but there is no ambiguity that that was a germ line transmission of a gene that is driving cancer but ninety five plus per cent of dancers are not arising from gremlins mutations they are arising from sematic mutations or acquired mutations the question then becomes what is driving sematic mutation and the to clearest invitations of drivers of somatic mutation our smoking and obesity smoking we have talked about let us put that aside for a moment ism surprised about obesity i do not know why ism surrisebut have am never heard this unproligeous naive to the literature yo obesity is now the decent most prevalent environ mental driver of cancer now i will argue and i think i argue this in the book hopefully pretty convincingly i do not think it is obesity jersey i think obesity is just a masquerading proxy what is obese obesity simply is defined by bodymass and necks well first of all i do not think ism o beast but ism ism way over weight on beam you probably our two let us just it no clinically diagnosable as ones are you o no well not la well lei lei a he am i over thirty at is r probably there no but if i if you bi measure my wait by hi year now i be a mice party twenty seven or twenty eight cant's bingo wallsince i checked i i can i only know by if at for say i is not thinks that solos basically beam is a far from perfect proxy but at the population level it is what we use i wish we would get off it by the way i think it is really crap cause it does not take into account lean verses see not i if ye could i think we could get better data if we looked at waste to height ratio that is a way better matrix this is just a quick test for everybody it is i i ism to argue your beam is less relevant to me than your i color but if you r waste circumference is more than fifty per cent of your height you should be concur can well there mock yet your find by that fabric right that is important of your six feet tall your waste better be under thirty six inches and if it is over i would argue that is the definition of obesity not your be am i being over thirty i back to this issue because we are using such a crude measurement it basically is catching a whole bunch of stuff but the question is what is driving it and think if you really look at the physiology of cancer i do not think it is obesity i think it is two things that come with obesity insolent resistance which is two thirds to three quarters of jobs individuals are insolent resistant an inflammation and i think those two things with the inflammation in the imundisfunction with the insolent resistance and the viper basically tonic growth stimulus that is coming that is what is driving cancer again is it because a person is storing extra fat and their love handles that that is driving the risk of cancer now that that is those are just two things that are coming along for the right beyond those two things and along with certain what we thermals certain environmental toxins we absolutely know or doing this right to we understand that people who have exposure to us bests have a much hire risk of certain types along cancer somethings that but for the most part am those are our big risks beyond that we talk about alcohol in certain cases absolutely a alcohol is a carcinogen a it is the dose part still is not clear to me do not know is one drink a day moving the needle much on cant her risk jersey it is not clear and might depend on those a genetic predisposition yes yet if step one is do not get cancer you have no control over your genes you have control over smoking you have control over insolent sensitivity i wish i could sit here and tell you that there is a proven anti cancer diet or that if you do eximount of exercise our we you are going to not get cancer we just do not have a fraction of the control over cancer that we have with cart of vascular dotes we we do not understand the disease well enough we do not understand kind of the initiation process and the propagation process i and we we we have to rely much more screening are there good whole body screens for cancer in other words can i walk into a tube and dumb or cylinder rather and get screened for the presence of tumors any and everywhere in the body outside the bring cause the brains all harder to get torn i believe here not the brain is actually pretty easy to screen for zoa is fatty in floating in water well and also the head when you put the head into an em our eye caner there is no movement h it is the least motion art o fact is in the brain when you use something called diffusion way to imaging with background subtraction in an em or e the technology the was actually pioneered in the brain for stroke identification am it is also really good at looking for tumors as well let me make the argument for we screening matters cause this is again find of and areaway i go far down a rabbit goal in a way that i think traditional medicine would argue against my argument for screening is an argument at the individual level and it goes as follows to my knowledge there is not a single example of a cancer that is more effectively treated when the burden of cancer cells in the body as higher than when it is lower so the two examples if bannock about on the book are clan cancer and breast cancer when you take an individual with stage four clan cancer that means that the cancer has left the clan and is now outside of the can it is usually in the liver at a minimum potentially the lungs or in the bring that person's five year survival is very low their ten your survival is zero we will treat them with a very aggressive regiment of multiple drugs hand again you will get a five year survival of you do not maybe ten to twenty per cent and by ten years nobody's alive if you take a person with stage three clan cancer the clan anger is big and it is even in the limp notes around the coal but at least grossly you cannot see clan cancer cell you cannot see those cells in the liver microscopically of course we know they are there because if you do not treat those patients they still die of clan caner but you wack them with the same memo regimen that you were going to give the metastatic patients eighty per cent of those people are alive in five years night and day difference in survival what is the difference in the person with metastatic cancer you are treating a person with hundreds of billions of cells in the agent setting which is what we we call we call at given when you treat people who have only microscopic disease you are you are treating billions of cells the same is true with breast cancers we have the clinical trial dato to put them side by side rule omer one is do not get cancer rule or two is catch cancer as early as possible if you can to get it which brings us to your question of how you screen for it we basically screen the first line of screening is is imaging is is is is as it sort of visualization you have cancers that occur outside the body that you can look at directly skin cancer you can look directly at the skin a spatial gastric clan cancer are those are outside the body right mouth to anis embreologically is outsidethe body you can put a scope in and you can look directly at the cancer but for all other cancers that are inside the body i you have to rely on some sort of imaging modality a although now we are starting to look at things things called liquid biopsy blood tests that are looking for self radiant eh and the selfrediane gives us a sense a base on the epigenesis signature of what your looking at hey is there a cancer in the body and if what tissue is potentially coming from based on these epileptic signatures the problem with relying on any one modality is a is a problem of sensitivity in specificity optimization now with m our i scanners which a in some way's the best way to do this because they not have radiation you soft one to be incurring damage as you do this the irony of doing a whole body s t scan street for cancer is your in a whole body we t scan would be close to you o thirty to it fifty silly reverts of radiation staggering some a radiation s i mean that people should a sir tell you off this but ai was going to ask about this anyway a awaiting going through the whole body scanner at the airport a noise lo you not goingthrogh a whole body scanner at the airport even getting a decks o scan i mean these a trivial amounts of radiation about flying you i here that lightly i get more a get more was lie if you are a pilot who is flying over the north pole back and forth and back and forth you are probably getting in o five to ten silly servers a year the enter c suggests that nobody should get more than fifty silly reverts a year a you an i both travel a fair amount a but typical travel for the busy person to let us ay a two round trip flights a a more than two hours per month and an international trip every three months a probably still less than a silly sever to year a living at sea level one silly severe a year living at a mile elevation if you live in denser you are a two silly reverts a year i have to ask standing in front of the dichroic i just we have got friends they the they ask and with or without testes on the counter that is an inside yoga that a unfortunately and fortunately deserves no description a and peters not referring to me a but people worry about other sources of radiation does not i the micro isn't concern a what are the other major sources of radiation a i mean outside of cart a new clear stuff workings go yo holy ruin near a planter there is been a yet but it it is obey it is mostly at the hands of medical professionals right it is the s t scanner in the petscanner are hands down the big a source r dilation about the arrays of the dentist when they we very it scary behind the wall ye under the rathe blanketed they are very low i relatively speaking a fluoroscopy is very high i they tend to try to cover up all of you that example if you if they were doing a fluoroscopic study of your kid me because you a stone or if you were getting an injection into if they were doing a fluoroscopic guided injection of one of your disks in your back that would be a locally pretty high dose but there cannot cover the hell out of you elsewhere i and again if if y if you get one f the things is not the end of the world but why i would not want to be getting one a month and an back to the point about screening a chest abdomen pelvis c t scan is probably i mean look is probably a scanner out there now that is moving fast enough that it is much lower but it'll give an example member how talked about we do c t angiograms on all of our patients for corneryartery disease an off the shelf scanner for this is twenty silly cs of radiation its o calibrate celebrate me it because forty per cent of your annual lotion oh well the medical a preachers really are the a the major culprits here that's right what what we say is and i think most doctors are now realizing this is no know it behooves you to pay a little bit more to go to a really good place that can do that scan for two silly reverts meaning they have a much faster c t scanner much better soft were and they are better engineer they have better engineering that they can do on the scanner to get that done i if some one listening to this here is my take do not get a c t scan or any imaging study without asking how much radiation mi seeing and if a person cannot tell you how many silly reverts of radiation you are being exposed to than just slam went a wait a minute until somebody can tell me that i i realize tit and keep in mind fifty if you know if fifty is the most you should ever be exposed to in a year there better be a damn good reason why i on to gat twenty five an a day now there are some people who have to do this if you are cans a nation and they are scanning you as a part of your treatment i mean you have to pickax choose between those two those two opportunities i do not want o i soft also do not want to crate some fear mongering with i got if you hit fifty in a year your hose no it is just i would not want o it fifty a year every year for my whole life and i certainly would not one to be hitting hundreds a year for any prime i think you were to try to raise awarinus and and also celebrate people to what the sources are and and they make can make good choices not am to place them into his chronic state of fear or even an acute states one here that reason we prefer m our i scanners cause there is no radiation i realize this might sound a specialized circumstance but it'll just start off ism with my own which is yen when i was graduates do i i worked with fixity into power for alive hero man l hi excuse me ism glider all we know that these are mutagens they mutate selves not good a use o magical banging lav used mana in percolating by those little bands and jells the reason the labels can they get between the dean a not good the fort to get into your own a done a and that is a very specialized circumstance it'll injected treaty radio a of prowling into the animals and thinks that sort again very specialized and yet most people i think a will be exposed to pastdecides they will pit stuff on their lawn we they will have u paint thinners and things that sort is there any sense of what the average if one can average risk is encourage in terms of a causing once just through interaction with we would killers a paint thinner resurgence around the house that we know know there is major losses en a successful against the the manufactures of these things and what is the real cancer risk a created by having those kinds of solvency and pesticides and things around i do not i do not think i know truthfully i think it is very complicated to calculates such things when the when there ubiquity is high am solo one one argument is look its kind of baked in to the baseline prevalence of cancer to day because these things are you quit us they asbestos a incalifornia for whatever reason it seems that there is in its best us warning on preymuch every building if you look carefully enough except maybe the ones built in the last five years i only have every work in the building where the elevator was updated in terms of the inspection was always a ten ears back you see it wileure in the elevator know one seems to what worry bout those were where there was not in is bestow warning were a led warning seems it is just kind of everywhere and and they are noting it in these little flags i do not walk round worried about i unloose sleep over it but it sounds a real rest rely the would not bother right clearly they are just trying to cover their yer man egg massy why heathen anything of this point of man i i do not know how much of a risk as betas poses when it is not being agitated another words i do not know that the es bests in the sealing four layers up is really a problem but if they had to come in here and rip this sealing a part i do not let it want to be in here either i was post nine eleven blow the work er sun word trade center pits case that is what was left ism sadly were a developed cancer die proudly from exposure in those kinds of well mean i would argue its also get i fuel us just the unbelievable amount of pollution micropolutioner was in the air following those things mat's devastating stuffs yet those a those are fortunately the outlier events that are that re dramatic but again my my focus is basic we look i could hermetically seal myself somewhere in the world maybe and maybe that would reduce my risk by one per cent but ism in a focus my energy on what i control as that is really hard for me to control i focusing my things on like focus om energeonthings i can control what i can control is the timing and frequency of my screening that is i cannot control my genes any more a they're what they are i got whatever predisposing cancergenes ism going to path a i might be lucky in this regard and that i seem to get all these horrible heart disease genes and may be not as much but it you also argue i got there are cancerbadgenes in me that we do not really know about because everybody was dying of heart disease young i but boy am i going to control the screening thing what source of genetic screening to you recommend to your patience cause they're a lot of them there is you it went three on either holden o seen seem place you available now in variety of format were this is actually one of the questions our research teem is working on as we speak i were we are trying to decide who we do genetic screening for certain things ago e s a gene we want o know in everybody i for it is role in nurse gene dos e street specifically in all timers disease awe are selectively using cancer screening in some patience but in our practice it is less important because we are generally aggressive anyway that it turns out to be a little bit moot we do not learn a lot in the genetic screening that is changing our screening practices because we are thorough in our family history and we are aggressive in everybody regardless of family history but i think there is a place for these things for example if you are looking for reimbursement on certain tests a give an example right clan cancer am historically was not covered by acoonoskype screen for con cancer was not covenant of your fifty that is been bump to forty five we still think everybody should be screened no later than forty haven't had ones i suppression yet i mean luck ism fifty and have had three already again why because clan cancer is not just the third leading cause of cancer death it is a hundred per cent preventable why because every clan cancer comes from a poop and every poop can be seen on a colonoskopy there is simply no reason do not know that and that has to be weighed against the cost of the coonoskopy both the financial cost and the risks which er very low but not zero a others a risk that comes from electrolyte abnormalities and hypotension from the balprap there is a risk from the sedation and there is obviously a risk of bleeding or perforation that comes from the colonoskopy itself again in in a in a generally healthy person those risks are low that they are almost difficult to quantify is evidence by a resent doing the journal medicine paper that was a very antidotal in copy paper which i will not get indocause it is it is it is am probably a little bit of a tank not but what is interesting is despite being a very anticolonoskopy paper this paper does a better job demonstrating the safety of colonoskopy than anything else it just was a oddly designed experiment the biggest challenge with aggressive screening posture is the specificity problem which is when you stack more and more modalities around these things you are gong to start finding things that are cancer m a i has a very high sensitivity an english that just means if a cancer is present and m our e is very likely to see it a but has a very low specificity which means in english it will see a bunch of things and think they are cancer when they are not and it is most troubled by glangeler tissue glangeler tissue is the akhilles heel of m a i and therefore when you use as we do whole body m a i for cancer screening we tell our patients going in look a twenty five per cent canceler on to find something that is not cancer but will require us to do further investigation if you're not cool with that which is totally find we probe should not do this and again most people are okay with that but it helps to set that expectation going in that you are gong to probably be chasing your talk looking at some stupid fironodul that is absolutely nothing may i cannot tell you how many useless thirty nodes we have had to get ultrasounds on that prove to be absolute nothing and you but gift to follow them for couple of years to make sure the nothing what is the typical cost of the whole body m a i and for people who are not your patients how would they go about getting those because i think most people's general practitioners not going to script the out for them correct i do not know the short anger because i do not know how many different places are doing it i can tell you that we use a couple of different facilities and i should disclose that ism a founder of one of them but we use a scanner that probably we send our patient to any anywhere they want to go but within a certain company that we am that is not a company i have an affiliation with and ism believe they are charging about twenty five hundred dollars can you since you do not have an affiliation can you mention that cause french its you are not my physician sadly for me and luckily for you u but it'd love to get a whole body m a i what were can i what is this company that that company that that makes the m a i that that we are using right now is called prenuvo i i interviewed the chief technology officer in the head radiologist a of that company on one of my podcast to superinteresting technology based out of vancouver and for a long time that was the only scanner in the world i had my first s can back in two thousand fifteen i went up to vancouver to get it done a probed my first too up there they've now open locations allover the country they have got they have got one in the briar they have probably got one here an all mi know they have one endows they hive got them all of the place great i and then the company that ism affiliated with is a different type company that does all sorts of diagnostics but among them is we have a prenuvo scanter in that company that company's called biography in that in the bear biography photography spelled as one months a back yet now that is very helpful in terms of understanding the a general risk and ism was to offset cancer to the tent that one can i and certainly what that what the consideration should be number three on the list of was to die shoe just title this waste to die what we shuttle that is how not to die a too early courage general disease this is an arm ism somewhat familiar with a not because of my own experience thankfully but i because of my relationship to the narrow science community and last time i checked i the was told that every one experiences some age related cogent have decline we all get less a proficient hat focus memory complex context dependent task twitching all that stuff as we get older but it is the slope of that line that really can be controlled to some extent and that alheimers dementia represents just a steep acceleration downward a acceleration of of all that that was a what i was told ism guessing that even though i have reside in the not kind of but ism residing that community that some of that is being revised especially with respect to the underlying causes of claimers cause ears a lot of controversy even scandal around this whole a p p a to b am amyloid play tangle stuff which is the stuff of tax books a medical students and nauru science students what is the story with nauru gene disease allhimers in particular how can we offset it and perhaps as importantly how can we all slow our own connive decline irrespective of whether or not we get what is called claimers dimension allhimers disease is both the most prevalent form of dimension and the most prevalent nauru degenerative disease it occupies that unique spot a we are talking about roughly six million people in the united states have all timers disease that is one an a let us the i mean she should per sent of the total pulsation but that does not include those with mild cognitive impairment or are dimension or other forms of dimension and of course the right metric is not what present a a population which of course includes children in i that it is thee function of age sis age the major risk factor for randan claimers ale rest taxi glaucoma the disease a much more familiar with his madam worked on it for many years the biggest rest factor or getting glaucoma is age the greatest ristfactor for are nonvascular disease is age the great respect for cancer is age am we tend to not spend a lot of time talking about that because it is not a modifiable risk we tendefolk is on modifiable risk factors what else can we tell you just to give you kind of lay of the land the second most prevail and neuradegenerive disease would probable louis body dimension followed by parkinson's disease although the rate of growth of parkinson's disease is the highest i thinking we proof be most you ow we those three diseases we want ta really be paying a lot of attention to as there a lot of other narratygenet give diseases every one of these things is devastating uncle at hultlescorosis a alas huntington disease see are awful awful diseases there are also other kinds of dimension vascular dimension is not all timers dimes but it is it produces comparable symptoms each of these things by the very slightly different louis body is a dimension it is a cementing disease but it also has a movement component it sort of sits on a spectrum that is sort of you mean loosely half way between all timers disease and parkinson's disease we talked obviously about age being the number one risk factor find of not that interesting cause cannot do anything about it the real goal is as we age what are we doing to reduce risk well let us start with an important gene the gene that everybody's heard of certainly a came up a lot on the limitless special where chis hamsworth was am you have made the decision to reveal something that none of us expected when we started that whole series which was that he and hit a being homes is for the ago e for ice of form am maybe folks understand we have two copies of every gene for gene x you have copy that you got from your woman copy that you got from your dad and the ago e gene is cut of a unique gene and that at really it has three different ice o forms that are all considered normal none of them are mutations you have the e two ice of form the e three ice of form and the e for ice of form the e four ice of form is the o g ice of form that is the one that we have historically had is as far back as we can go which you think the e four ice of form offered a lot of advantages back in ta day it is a bit of a pro inflammatory am ice form and at certainly offered protection against infections especially parasitic infections in the i ans which would have been a really important thing to select four two hundred thousand years ago parasites get into the cans me blood brain bury a thick skull i man no coma i not calling i not sea yell the skill but say weeing it just seems parasites in other tissues o be a issue let cause about retied by hear brain disease ye an we we l i i also to album it also the to predicted the it probably offered some protection outside of the brain as well anyway the the e three ice form i think showed up i think fifty thousand years ago and the e two ice forms showed up very recently about ten thousand years ago now to day we realize that there is a clear stratification of risk when it comes to all timers disease that tracks with those ice forms because you have two copies you basely have six combinations of how you can combine those genes you you be two two two three two fou or three three three four four four am the prevalence of them is basically as follows three threes now the most common three is the most common double three is fifty five is per cent of the population the next most common is the three four which about twenty five percent of the population and then after that most things are fund of a rounding air a two threes and two fours i would be the net most common four fours are very rare and two twos are the rarest of them all two twos are less than one per cent four fours are about one to two per cent very important point here is that the e four genes are not deterministic there highly associated wit the risk wait her not the deterministic there are at least three deterministic genes in all timers disease a one is e called p c and one other ones called p c an two and another most called a p p those genes collectively make up about one per cent of cases of people with all timers disease there fortunately very rare genes but sadly they are deterministic meaning if you have those genes you do get all timers disease and what is perhaps most devastating about those eyes is how early the onset is of the disease these are people that are usually getting all timers disease in their fifties am we do of a patient in our practice actual she spoken about this very openly am whose whose mom had one of these genes am and she got all timers disease in her early fifties was i i think she might have made it into her sixties before she died but you not absolute devastating consequences here why do people to all timers i because i know about the hippocampus degeneration n hippocampus of course being airy a the brain import for learning in memory a but is there brainstemdygeneration do they lose breathing center is or party bout oh know usually what happens is it sort of failure to thrive aspiration things that a it is usually they just stop eating a or they cannot control secretions they aspirate the get pneumonia or they really lose the ability to even sense pain in their body and therefore thou get an alter and they do not realize it and it all become soluletic and ell develop a horrible infection and response to it i see said a body inability the repass is ever once while a news report will come out and based on a legitimate am case study where i they will do a scan on some person and discover that their missing literally half their cerebral quartan huge chunks of brain and their functioning relatively normally and here wore timing about a nurse get disease of relatively it is widespread but there few hotspots odors in the pain the degenerate more a profoundly than others and and the people dying that may sets it it extends to lack of prefer marines or control and then some some acute interior induction i you mentioned earlier some of the controversy right what what would we talking about here well it it it is than big i do write about this it it at length in the chapter on all timers disease because i think this is a very important point right which is the index case for all timers disease here is always an index case right others it the unit is the the quoting quotation zero i the index case was a woman who a hundred years later we realized had an a p p mutation i w these are a p p r p s and one but she had one of these deterministic genes that led to a very early onset of disease which by the way without which we may not have come up with the diagnosis because had she just got all timers disease in her seventies it would have just been referred to a senility which is was not interesting enough to pay attention to i but i think it probably set the field on the path towards an over emphasis on amyloid data i and it is not really clear how important amyloid is which is not to say it is not important it is important and there is no ambiguity that amyloid is responsible for the a the changes that we see in the brain but it is not crystal clear because there are lots of but autopsies that are done on people that are completely healthy and have died with no cognitive impairment and their chalk full of amyloid what we do not fully understand is the exactly what does removing amyloid do am the other thing that complicates the story is there has been no shortage of drugs that target amyloid that have seemed unsuccessful and i i s to clarify when you say amyloid you mean people have died with their brains examine in autopsy and see that their tons of called amyloid places correct i different then a arterial places of course but within the brains of that the two hall marks of claimers a histopathologically would be place and tangles i and at even that now is course coming under undercuestion i but for it is what we teach every nor since we dragnets soon it what we teach every undergraduates also what we each every medical student i and notjust tat staffer everywhere a i have heard that that the link between a p p and whether not one develops i genes for early a p p and whether notes cleaved at one side or another is us what you were describing and and risk for else yes it space simply a quest in it is a crevice question r ans o a p p people with the p p mutation i think have one extraclevitge sit i that the the the they result in one extra cleavage of amyloid and then it infolds and the infolding is is what the place as it is being created that also been predisposes them to the narrow februlary tangles and i again wet all his is under question right well i in this is what i was told and and when i look it sounds there were some early there ere some papers early in the chain of discovery i an the resection allsimers that i were either wrong because there were falsify intentional your else there is on intentionally falsified paper on one particular amyloid i variant and that clearly set the field back a decade because a lot o people went down that rabbit hole based on deliberately falsified data i an what happened that gloms anoas who is to guy but what what happened that a was a good question i i think i wrote one piece about it when it happened i actually reached out to the person who broke the storicaus i wanted to have them on my podcast and i forget why he did not do it i forget why he he would not commit to it or something that tat that is a little odd cause i but this would be a great way to talk about this i i do not know what came of that scandal another wards i i have not paid attention to it for robbing nine months i do not know you korea the papers probably been recalled but i do not know what disciplinary action was taken m the field is i don't know i don't wat to speak ism in the field because ism not i do not only be careful what i say but i think the field is probably an in a bit of a crisis because there is thereat been many bats placed on anti amyloid therapies and amyloid markers and amyloid everything and we just have not seen efficacy right contrast the with cardiovascular disease where you now you have this ago b bookmarker you you understand the path of physiology of how it works you have drugs that t target it you have a bookmarker you give somebody a drug that lowers ago b you can measure to b that is a really important and obvious thing to be able to do and then you have clinical outcomes which is oh hen you take a bunch of people in primary prevention it takes this long before you see an effect in secondary prevention it only takes this long to see an effect right different risk stratification all these of things wed not have any of that for all timer's disease we do use there are now serum amyloid bookmarkers that we use and we do tract these in our highest risk patients but only because we believe d i do not know for right by the way that lower is better and therefore if we make these changes to you and your serum amyloid levels come down that that tells us something about what is happening your brain that is favorable but i mean i would hate to represent that we are practicing nearly the level of precision medicine there that we are in cardiovascular media inewhen it comes to all timers disease maybe take step back when it comes to brain health i think they are a handful of things that seem unequivocally true and there is a lot of stuff that is signal to noise radio that is really low be unequivocally true things for brain health are sleep matters another unequivocally true thing for brain health is that lower el feel collateral and ago b is better than hire another thing that is unequivocally true is not having type to diobedees matters having really being ins tat by my insolent sensing stolen e sensitive matters sleeping adequately matters having lower lipids maters those three things are clear and the fourth one that is unequivocally clear is exercise matters more exyisic form of exercise a very i it to tried to answer this question on a recent a m a that i did cause the answer is more is always better but if you if i i tried to have one of our analysts look at it through the lends of if you could only exercise three hours a week what would be the highest use case and our interpretation the literature as if you could only spend three hours a week exercising you would be best off doing one hour of low intensity cardie one hour of strength and one hour of interval training some one said i only want the minium effective dose you arguing to get a pretty good bang for your buck doing that but i would argue if your brain really matters to you do more one hour of interval trainings no joke no cause you are in a spread that out over probably at least two workouts with but under those four things are basically the only thing where there is there is no ambiguity about the benefit what a not head hits do not get do not hate your head seems almost assured y true in susceptible individual for sure i put that ymaymaybe we could include that as well why just mengionit one the things have been learning recently as i know you box i for a number of years when you were the younger i boxed a little bit him i had number of times keyboarding but you know we think about sport injuries es the major cause of had injuries but then have got collets oft rs an tear or car accent by bike accident have got many collets and children of collets growing up in around campus that were hit by cars on would side road or a mere small objects surrounded by you three was a car way three thousand pounds or something that more it it is unbelievable that the number of head injures and then construction sides to those ridiculous little hard has which do not protect against anything except into maybe u windblown hair that they they basically predispose the whole situation predisposed people to had injuries very common on construction season and say nothing of military et camera i think that i was told that the the best thing to do if you get a head injury is to nock it another one in other words if you can stop doing the activity that leads to more head injury ye had the other thing that i think is emerging and i hope it is studied rigorously is the use of hyperbaric oxygen immediately following a tibia dramatic be n injury rethought to do dagustine a a little while ago to count of cause he knows a lot about this lit to say is there anything out there that is really can a turn key convincing any said not yet they are still doing it right i would do this if i if i was in a car accident to morrow and sustained a concussion and by the ay ism not a proponent of hyperbaric oxygen i we have an internal white paper that we wrote inside quite recently where i examined when i say i examined you do not be annalist teem examined and i pushed back and reviewed and i i came away very can of parish on hyperbaric oxygen i do not think ism nothing it is harmful but i think all of the claims are nonsense tealammour extension is totally irrelevant the you actually look at the studies there the worst done studies of ever seen in my life ism sure you have seen some of these words you put these people on hyberbery chamber and then watch them do cognitive tasks act after in there much better well the fine print is that not you have placebo groups here i can you imagine doing a study without a placebo group or your placebo group does not go into a sham chamber i mean one of the big cams of a the proliferation of all these pay to play journals mean girls it will basely publish a paper wit minimal poor pure view because they charge in order to publish and then a offer free access yo ever access sounds great but when it is pay to playtime drinks the there is been a huge proliferation of papers most which you find on twitter in which the study design is is beyond tat they get look at ninth grater who woke up late for school and was parting all we can to design a better study then most of these studies stand there is some excellent studies out there as well of course have presume o and eventually on hyperbaric chamber to shall not pick on hyperbaric chamber per say but the the proliferation of a truly terrible science that is published in purerevew journals is is just overwhelming i it is in saying and all that is to say i think the replaces where hyperbaric oxygen make sense clearly in wound healing it does it is it is a miracle a treatment for wound healing and i would absolutely you use hyperbaric oxygen if i suffered a concussion a but you do not beyond that thing its pretty prettytough to make the case where do people go for that eking that it there cleaned yateround ex you basically go to and protocols have to be very precise come your it is not something to cowboy at home no no no into you have to go into a real chamber i i think the t b i photo call tit is most commonly used is god i want to say it is pretty intense it is five sixty minute sessions a week at two atmospheres on it is not it is no joke from a cost and time perspective it is enormous and in the time and cost are reasons why i think when i see people doing hyperbaric oxygen just because they think it can help them live longer am do what you could do with five hours a week plus the commuting time that you put into that it is put that into exercise and i promise you you will get a bigger benefit than you are getting out of hyperbaric oxen but there is a lot of other stuff that i just think is maybe helpful there is tons of supplements that i think about when it comes to brain health what about thericuman what about magnesium with three and eight the transporter am what about methylated by vitamins that lower home insisting what about e p an d h and we have gone through all the literature on that stuff and many these things we still are recommending through a kind of basically the potential benefits out weigh the potential costs but the evidence is really unimpressive for most of those other interventions when you think about the big four or big five if you include not getting head injury everything else is probably a rounding air compared to those big ones maybe just for sake of of thrown less we just list off those four again exercise exercise sleep insolent sensitivity a and lipid management well long lines of head injuries we shrine me to the next category of u how not to die as to avoid accidental death a how common is accidental death and what are these accidental death because we are separating this out from automotive death this people falling well liking self self's gone bad no what are we talking about here ism not chuckling because the is just owning that seems regular is an in your infinite a wasn't ways to a to die accidentally a n when used the two is a kind of look at this i in in here i kind of merge to categories i would call it there there that overlap in the way that they are characterized by the c d we but i would sort of what w all will talk about them separately and bring them together if you talk about true accidental deaths automotive a and falls and overdose is are the are the three that is basically what it comes down to in our death bar analysis we kind of list all this if fit in felt i think that is actually one of the figures in the book is i have the accidental death a figure that we have put together where we have adjusted by population and you will see a couple of things if you look at it in absolute terms it is basically a pretty constant regardless of what decade of life here and once you are above twenty accidental deaths are pretty sizable number of of dates now car accidents seem to be pretty conctenthroughout life little more common if you are under sixty than over sixty but they never go away i was told that in teen age in pain in a was not there in the early twenties alcohol in spate a automatic fatalities place them it it in is gastronomic risk is that just not true it is not true any more compared to overdose at be as young people now are not getting their drivers licenses on alloyed well i think it is also because we are seeing such an uptick in the deaths that come from final got retinal related deaths have basically squashed all other deaths below sixty five on the accidental front really it it it is not even close because of the number of different substances that dentin a is being long finding its way in to everything a all counterfeit drugs all e listen drugs and look most of the time you are not getting a lethal dose it is it is it is but but you are getting lethal doses often now that well you i did a little analysis actually the other day when it'd look death how are deaths of despair increasing over the last five years what dad i define as a death of despair suicide alcohol related death or overdose accidental overdose that we different shit that from suicide were suicide is obviously deliberate and accidental is not if you just look at those three things accidental overdoses suicides and alcohol use or aldol related death not including driving by the way this is serosas of the liver that comes from that number is going up at almost twenty per cent per year since twenty nineteen the i could not get twenty twenty two numbers yet with the time of the time i did this analysis which is last week the t went twenty one numbers was about two hundred ten thousand america goodness up from a hundred eighty thousand in twenty twenty up from a hundred and fifty thousand twenty nineteen is this and that is driven almost entirely by dentinal use ism trying get a sense of howls would happen at while back there was an article in the her times that some photographs of people that i on died of dentinal overdose they and said they they went out to buy cocaine an badland and i thought to myself is there really count of odd social of biological phenomenon wright because i mean here they are they are not demonizing these cocaine user i mean they went out to buy cocaine rats is not i know cocaine has at one narrow identical use as a prescription drug but in general on feel by cone there they are going a parting with it are using it to work longer hours or something that am the whole nature of the article was a bit strange to me but it clearly point the fact that people are using cone i get that is no surprise but people are going out buying cocaine they are presume buying gallium they're presuming buy this is where it is really killing kids i mean that it is on line this is he aversion i ma the reason ism not o baffled by this is let lemme a contextualize at what would have would have said far about this question i was surprised that the times would write a paper about the tragedy of cocaine users dying of dentinal and i think they did it to highlight this dentinal problem am because people been using course for a long time an typically those are not that members of the population that were really focus on since the middies the call kick cocaine and cracking o ceramic basically tells me that people you said elicit drugs of cocaine but also what other sorts and to a l bin tan majority of people are dying from dentinal poisoning and i had to got on my podcast recently in anchovy hippolido and if anybody's interested in this topic they really need to go listen to that h notch that the out rear this and your podcast a are excellence o people if you are interest in this i think everyone should be interested in if if you have is child or know somebody who has a child you just got to get this podcast into their hands because it is the most important public service announcement it'll probably ever do in terms of saving more lives potentially we are the majority of this is making its way into the into the accidental poisonings is through illicit counterfeit pills it is when kids are out there buying ox they want ox but they cannot o the cannot get real ox right cause then i can to go a doctor and get real ox began buy a through snap chat or they can a buy it through some drug dealers that the finding on social media i they are buying sleeping pills they are buying all sorts of counterfeit stuff at er all i any of these things are being ace with retinal lateral absolutely well i some mental an again the reasons are it is insanely cheap to use synthetic retinal and secondly and again but the effects of dentinal or nothing i now i a after a it cosine a does not make sense for that re gas it make sense either and yet it is still showing up in cocaine again i i do not think that is the dominant place it is showing up i would i would guess that the dominant place it is showing up is in counter fit opioid any opioid barbie you at any said e present only telly what ism telling my daughter right cause this to me ts a front line prom i a fourteen year l daughter ism listen i do not care which friend o ours it is i do not care how much she is amazing if she tells you to try this sleeping pill because she took it the night before and it was really helpful or this ill hep you study better or this will help you do anything ism just come to us we got a better pill for you right another it i you cannot trust anything cause you soft know where she got it she has the best of intentions ism sure when she is given it you and by the way she probably took ut the night before and was just fine but the people who are making these pills are not exactly up to go pe standards you just have no idea which pill is getting what dose of retinal one thing that anchovy hipoleto told me that i simply could not believe i had to ask him six times was that some of these pills have one milligram of sentinel in them now i made the point on the podcast that a hundred milligrams of retinal for most people is a hit they have had sentinel before been in the hospital and the and have had fennel a hundred milligrams is while that is such a trip i why are people dying from one telegram intact respiratory in edition you cannot breathe that shit's the brain stem we i do not think we can ignite this enough i adulator dying kids or dying ad that is one is a earlier the sweet who told me her thirty five year old undine of a accidental sentinel overdeson i he was not at least by her description a druganict or anything in that sort of y this is this is were token about a different game now right it is these are kids that have anxiety these are kids that are r or our sort of addressing another issue with these with these pills and that is what i think this this whole concept of deaths of despairs is is is a really important one but back to your question what it would o accidental deaths primarily amount to for for the aging population again it is clear that it is fall related this is where i once you hit sixty sixty five the the risk of a fall that results either immediately in death you hit your head and die going back too cerebral leverage or it is the straw that basically leads you down the path to death with the next twelve months is astonishingly high it is high that it is sort of hard to wrap your head around but if you are oversee sty five and you fall and break your feeder or hip you either crack the ephemeral neck or the fever itself your twelve month mortality the probability you will be dead in twelve months after that break if you are sixty five or older depending on the study is about fifteen to thirty per cent well well in terms of offsetting the probability of falls ism you talked a little bit about this i before but a a you and i have talked a orbit about this before but and we could go a obit deeper people's ability to jump and land seems to be highly correlated with one's ability to not fall or at least fall and control the fall in a way that a leads to no or less we were entry yes and galloping talked about this on your pat hast y talked about it on my pod cast what is the hall mark of aging on the muscle it is atrophy of the type two muscle fiber that is the hallmark that is twitch fast which muscle fiber if you want understand what looks different in fifty year old peter verses eighteen year old peter it is not my type one fibers it is my type to fibers it is my fast which fibers is my explosive fibers me when i was eighteen years old i could vertical jump over thirty inches to day ism lucky if i can vertical jump twenty four inches and in what ism sixty why it is my goal is to be old a vertical jump sixty a twenty inches when ism sixty and i do not a finale to do it have seen some vidiosos om a eighty year old sprinters that are pretty impressive and certainly eight year old dimness theatre impressive have not seen very many videos a eight year old a dunking basketballs one it was not woe who are not a taller than six t five inches ism when we lose are solo again if you just think about size strength speed we lose speed first we lose speed then strength and the last thing you loses size again size is agnostic to fiber right you you have big type one fibers and still have lots of size can i can to be that strong and there certainly not can o be fast what met to you go through we could spend hours on this particular topic but i think the most important thing the people they do understand is you cannot age well if you are not doing the type of training that is there two strengthen and delay or minimize the hypertripheve our type two fires everything matters right you have to be doing years own to you have to be doing all these other things but some component of your training needs to be stressing the type to fibers you have to be doing strength training that takes those fibers you have to be doing reactivity training you have to be doing explosive training an ideal some training that involves jumping and landing well jumping is a very big part of it and landing is a very big part of a other one of what i cone o think of as my four pillars of strength training one of the pillars of strength raining is eccentric strength which is breaks am you are going to hurt yourself ten times more likely i making that number up by the way i do not of it is ten times but experientially it seems to be you are ten times more likely to hurt yourself stepping off something than stepping on to something right stepping down very is stepping up am because when you step up onto something you are concentrically controlling muscle when you step down you have to apply the breaks and that is where most people falter much harder to walk down hill than up hill up hill is taxing your carry muscular system but if you slow down enough your fine but a lot of people do not have the ability to slow themselves down when they are walking down hill and when an older person steps off a curb and cannot fully stop themselves and that results in a fault i doing things a broad jump broad jumps o fun little tests sat i to do every once in a while i was one to make star like an broad jump six feet that is cone of my arbitrary number that have chosen and the reason is on the take off that is a very explosive movement but the landing is just as important if i cannot stick that landing it means it don't of the breaks those are kind of some of the tests in am able to o do to make sure that ism ism utilizing that system because i do think look have watch have watch my mom my mum fell give been about four months ago just fell in a typical way that people fall a by the way it could have happened anybody it is not my mam walks round moves round just find but antis particular day so just tripped on a on a uneven stone and fell and landed and broke her hand an she really lucky should not break our hip when i told er that nous you w going armed seventies and i said luck if that was your fever i it'd give you a thirty per cent chance of dying in the next year man it is just an unto are such difficult to recover from injuries because first all your dealing with the immobility o the hospitalization and immobility that follows that and the amount of muscle loss that occurs a could easily be four five pounds of lean tissue lost that for most people that age becomes almost impossible to get back tattoo says nothing about sort of the acute causes of death a fat embolism that results from a broken fever a blood clot from laying in bed those things are also catastrophic but what happens is a lot these patients just never get back to the same level of mobility and now i think in many ways were con a pivoting from what kills you to what ruins your quality of life and were spend much time talking about what kills you but i think you might as well be dead in some ways if you cannot do the things you want to do and if playing with your grand kids or gardening or playing golf or going for a walk with your spouse or think of any of the things we all do today and take for granted if you cannot do those things i know you sort of lose the the reason to to be round and oftentimes a the inability to do those things is associate with pain thou know which is a psychologically n ovary physiologically distressing am you mention the four pillars of health they be just list those off for of lifting a though well the four pillars of of long cavity through physical a at oh yes si site exercise pieces of them yo less o strength stability a robin efficiency and a aerobic peak output it is a robin peak would be ivy to maniacs not in is own to that is in my analogy that is the your yours own too is the is how wide the base of your pyramid is and your view o two mamas how tall the peak of the pyramid is the best pyramid has a wide base and a high peak you could have a reasonably wide base and a shallow peak if you just its own two training you are you are now you are going to get a reasonable peak but its not onto be the high you have to do some of that specific training if you just focus on high intensity you might drive up that view woman but your eat you can have a relatively we a narrow erotic base you think about just maximizing the area of that triangle widest tallest stability and strength ability of course encompasses everything we are talking about in terms of reactivity am i i dedicate a chapter in the book to this concept because it is foreign to most people am and i then for understand will reasons it is just it is not sexy it is not it is the hardest one to train it is the hardest one to understand but it is important because it is the thing that i think differentiates people who age well and and people who do not age well and i should m perhaps throw in there please crib me for rum but also most of the machines that are in typical commercial aims the allow people who are not a her experience to star going some resistance training do not really tap into the stability factor terribly much were there is value to legs extensions and like curls and jest presses and shoulder presses done with machines certainly a for a number reasons and can often be save for the freeways especially for people are approaching in a leader time or knew the whole thing they do not really lend themselves to a real life stability walking down as you mention walking downstairs a the in the absence of a hand rail or am or movements in am a kind of a odd plains having to step aside to avoid a bicycle am at an angle as a post tools moving linearly a yet and by the way a lot of things that do not involve a machines still do not give you that right i mean doing a dead lift you have to be stable to lift a heavy weight a you would a dead left without hurting yourself that requires in unbelievable capacity to harness interobdominal pressure and to be connected it is but you you are going to lift five hundred pounds off the ground your stable but that still does not prepare you for what you just described stability is musty faceted and it involves doing a lot of things you today for example give finished my that it was a a cautious on two day did my cardies own to and i you knowhow i extort ten minutes before i needed to can i get moving and all i did was step ups for ten minutes i just did single leg very slow step up and insanely slow step downs off a box in a gem two second up four second down two second up for second down with and would do them with ipsolateral loads contralateral loads all sorts of different things and basically that is just as stability game for me it is ism building that concentric strange and ism in a movement where it is easy to cheat i but can i do it without cheating this terrific and its terrific that you cover all that in the book addition to these other topics several times during our conversation to day you eluded to quality of life and one of my favorite segments in your book indeed the segment in your book that i believe could be it is own entire book of tremendous value is the section on emotional health you count just share with us a bit of what inspired you to include that section was this of for instance i based on communication with your patience to what extend o was based on your on life experience and then i if we can drill i bit deeper into what is contained in those chapters and what really constitutes emotional health well may i think that that chapter of the book which is prolong chapter it is a final chapter as well i is certainly different from all of the others and that there is no there is no confusion about expertise right i think in the other chapters i at least try to come across as having some knowledge on the subject matter and ism ism writing them most often as you connote the doctor right were i think that last chapter it is as much more about and experiential side of my knowledge acquisition and and if for really it comes a cross more as a patient i and i think you are right i think that that is a chapter that initially was resisted by all other parties involved in the book my coauthor i my editor everybody else sort of felt this is interesting but it is a it is a separate topic if you want to writeabout this you should write another book about it but it does not really belong in this book i i disagreed for two reasons and ultimately i guess my opinion prevailed a the first is i did not want o wite another book it just that not including this in this book to then wite about of another book was not something i was interested in doing but i think more importantly i do think that this book is about much more than how long you live and while we have talked about and we will talk about in the book that is how cognitive and physical health are just as german to quality of life as they are to length of life this other piece of emotional health you don't it is potentially the most important of them all it is also the hardest the define but without it none of this other stuff matters right there is infinite life span if if if if your miserable means nothing ay the worse tit is that would be a curse right you could argue how could you punish somebody the most allow them to live for ever and be miserable s there the others a greet god tithonus now to thongs owe was granted immortality hit is a bit different he was granted immortality but without e healthspan basically he aged for ever dreadful and this would be dreadful to right and i i feel why did i need to wite about this well i think that this is probably my greatest struggle i think a you in a way at the outside of the podgiest you asked me kind of what are the obstacles to longevity and that got us down a path of some very a black and white things but when i look at a patient i create a dashboard and the dashboard is what are all the things that are a threat to every component of your longevity both lifespan and healthsman we talked abut a much those thing how what is what is your risk for aphorist cross and what are we doing about it what is your risk for cancer what are we doing about it what is your risk for narc degeneration what are e doing about it what is your risk for accidental death what are we doing about it what is your risk for physical decline what are we doing about it and one of the things is what is your risk of emotional health or poor emotional health and what are we doing about it i when i do that exercise for me which have i do m i i can i have that spread sheet laid out for me and i know where my factors line up and interestingly despite my family history being horrible for athoroscarosis it is sixth on my list because i mean basically i intervened early i have a clear understanding of the path of physiology and ism doing everything to the maximum ism actually very confident i will die with and not from athoroscarosis but the top thing on my list is actually emotional health that is the one that is the hardest for me to manage and it is it is the easiest to get out of balance and it creates the most pain in my life that is that is a long answer to why i felt this needed to be in here it in the book you go into very honest detail about some of your journeys thug and challenges with emotional health and has to overcoming this may we will get into those a bit but before we do how should we define emotional health i this to me seems one of the most difficult areas to calibrate oneself i even just measuring emotion as trick a languages the direction tool for i psychologist psychiatric and indeed for all of us in a dowry doing to day great or a miserable or ism depressed i mean means such different things to different people obviously suicide being the far end of of a we presume misery there are instances of manic suicide but i depressive misery but at setting that aside how should we valuate think about and communicate emotional health to ourselves and to to the relevant people they count potentially help us you've you right it is it is it is it is it is it is very difficult right and and much of what goes into this book is about things that are much easier to quantify it is very n i could sit here an talk for days about all the ways we quantify from the histologic to the gross of each of these diseases genetically all these other things i with emotional health it is it is far more vague and i do not i even attempt to come up with a definition right i can tell you things that make up components of it connectivity with others just seems to be an inescapable part of this the ability to maintain healthy relationships and attachments to other people having by the these are no particular were having a sense of purpose a being able to regulate your emotions experiencing fulfillment experiencing satisfaction i all of these things matter and i think that for many of us if we are taking and honest a phrasal of ourselves we will notice that we have deficits in these areas i being present by the way that is something that may have been less of in issue a hundred years ago than it is to day i think your for certainly for me being present is very difficult it is not my default state i do not know the it is the default state for most people truthfully i but ism very often predisposed with thoughts about the future occasionally thoughts about the past but it is much more often turn thoughts about the future and planning and thinking about what i need to do and what o i want to do next and never really being satisfied with anything it is happening the moment ism i have to work hard to cine of overcome those things and ism sure you can appreciate this but when you are present you generally earn a much better frame of mine ye there is a interesting study i thing is initially published by can gilbert slab one the long term hae happiness studies i twas publishing science magazine ism a that pinked people for their level of happiness unhappiness presents or lack of presents mental times throughout the day this was in the early years of smart phones this is round twenty ten twenty eleven the tachknowledg was not as good as is now but it was good enough to do this in a very large number of people forget how many but is certainly more than ten thousand and that numbers ism stating it intentionally low and what they found was regardless of whether not people were doing something they enjoyed or not boring to them or not the degree of presents to what they were doing was a stronger predictor of their happiness in that moment and over all than was anything else ism and also a pretty fairly rare feature frost people seems lie get something that we do need to work at perhaps nowadays as you point out more than ism we perhaps that do in are and ancestral past aim a little but surprise that ism a you say that you find it hard to be present because he strike me as somebody that ism is not just willing but has at a strong ism almost relax toward t you nor drilling in the observing that the contour something and then really drilling into it and and really getting to the the the got of of most everything that that interests you you strike me as somebody whose very present and i guess t maybe this gets back to this i they are novagially exclusive risen and i think its for example it'll notice that sometimes if ism playing with my kids especially my boys cause they are younger right and and playing with them is really being in their world if ism with my daughter we can be doing things that are kind of mutually like you you will do things together that i would probably do by myself for she would do myself but with my boys it is general doing something i would not otherwise be doing and ism if ism paying attention to it ism constantly amazed an how after five minutes of searching through a been for just the right legs piece that we want to do to build this one little thing my mind will start thinking about something else o i got like i got to go hi did not male that do back and i got do this and i got do this and i i got do this and i it to this and i just get into i got to do i got t do i got to do that is i do you have only been here for five minutes why do not you just find the legs piece that you need to finish building that thing over there that is this beautiful moment that you are not on to have many o but there is a very finite number of these moments you are going to have you want to savor every one of them i gan i do not think ism alone in that i think a lot of parents for example can relate to that and that that that that literally just one of many different things and bother i would not have said that that was my greatest challenge either but it is something that requires i think deliberate attention what your alluding to is a a challenge with am holding a single time perception or perception of time i one of the most re remarkable things to me about the the human brain as our ability to be present or think about the pasts or the future or the present in the future and we can occupy different time mind and in a recent am non recorded conversation of ours a you showed me something that give seen before but for some reason this time it had a profoulened in pact on me which has that you have a chart of the number of weeks that you are going to live and you mark them off one week at a time we talk about this in the contacts of a major life decisions and it illustrates the fact that we need a a chart such a chart that we cannot really move through our day being present to the the beauty of working on a legs with our kid well also paying attention the fact that while this is week number whatever six hundred in the er ex number of weeks of one's life that that am ability to i contract and dilate our time perception is is marvelous but it is also am a double tat sort cause it is it is that takes us out of what is meaning full in the moment one have has to wonder than whether not our am challenges in being present am you not guess that the psychoanalyst may we need at at were psychatress man we ask a apalkanti am wo and i know in respect greatly whether not this is am subconscious a refusal of of our own mortality or something right that if we were to really contemplate our mortality on a regular basis not just when we are marking off the weeks supposed were would not be able to be present because it iscantof overwhelming i i do not know i mean does not feel the literature says that people who spend more time contemplating their own mortality are actually more at peace a kind of a little bit of the exposure therapy idea and ism not sure it is an unhealthy thing to be aware of your mortality i suspect it is it is it is helpful ins much as you except at right and you and you film you have some agency over parts of it right i i do not think i have nearly enough agent over the length of my life i think have got five to ten years of wiggle room that i can extract if i do if i do all of the thing s that have written about in that book i i i bet i can stretch my life out ten to fifteen years at the maximum call it ten over what would have happened if i did not do those things gybe it is more but but it you do not hat it depends on what were comparing it to write from being reasonable to maybe being a little bit in a hyper functioning maybe it is ten years but where i know i have a much greater agency is on is quality and for me now a big part of that is in terms of quality of relationships i think that is a big thing and i i think for most people that is that is that is what i hope this chapter does is it it is it sort of allows more people to fund of taken a phrasal of that and ask that question which is before it is too late am i living my life more for my resume virtues or for my eulogy virtues to borrow from a avid brook's work the road to character which i i i talk about as being can of one of the many ahamoments that i had during this journey now and there again thank you you recommended the road to curator to me i i do in annual solo a wilderness trip and i listen to it during the drive to that trip and on that trip and it is a am it is of i would just say it is it is a truly important book for everyone to listen to tarts really quite a quite impressive what are the things that you do on a regular let us say on a daily basis to trying in force i forgive the word but in force and emotional well being in health in terms of relationships because as you point out it is not reflective for it for everybody and that does not make them bad people it i think it does have to do with this am challenge in balancing expectations of work and other things and and for some people a more inherent selfishness and for some people am they are not selfish enough i did know plenty of people are running round than to serve everybody and than their health is crashing or their mental health is crashing it can cut any which way or always what what sorts of practices do you in corporate or just even thoughts within your own mind you use charts and less i man your very regiments at about your work outs i building grip strain the eccentric uptown to center trainings own to it camera why would not we also ism script out the things to pay attention to each morning and day as a list of to use well it i i have done those things right certainly in a i at i write about in the book have gone away a couple of times right i i two thousand seventeen i spent two weeks at a facility in kentucky in twenty twenty i spent three weeks at a facility in arizona i an on the back end of that facility three years ago when i got out i mean i had a had a very clear list of daily things i needed to do and at that point for about six months following getting out of hasten of rehab i mean i was i mean god the list of behaviors i was doing every single day i mean twice o day standing in front of the mirror reading my list of affirmations writing in my journal every single day i had therapy every single day i mean all of that stuff was highly regimented to day i would say there is no one single behavior that is quotonquote mandated as part of my recovery but perhaps the most important thing that does come up every day is ism being mindful of an acting on as quickly as possible every time i a do something damaging to a relationship ism i would say that if you compare formula one when my my favorite wore by far you compare formula one forty years ago to formula one to day the difference is not in the number of accidents that takes place the difference is in the fatality of those accidents there are just as many if not more accidents in formula one to day the difference is nobody dies in those accidents the cars are much safer their engineered first for safety second for performance used to be the reverse and that is why there was a day when every second or third week end a driver was killed it is catastrophic to imagine what took place between the mid sixties and about the sedatives and formula one and similarly i would say that the frequency with which i have an interaction with a person who matters to me that is not the best interaction at could be is only slightly less than what it was five years ago the difference is the severity of that is much lower and more importantly and most importantly the length of time between when i screw up and when i make amends is infinitely shorter right went from being i would never make amends to if ism a dick to my wife i usually am trying to rectify it within a few minutes or at most a couple of hours and that and it is it is really in one thing i learned throughout this journey was if if you hold yourself up to this goal if i have to be perfect it to be the perfect dad have to be the perfect husband i have to be the perfect friend you gin to set yourself up for failure cause you knock can be perfect but if instead you can say what ism going to be perfect about is repairing damage when i cause it that is what matters the other day ism i yelled at my son for something it is a while you actually before i lost my voice the was just doing something and he was wrong it was la he ho did something i told him a hundred and fifty times not to do and i yelled it him and punished i but i was way too harsh is basically i basically the first twenty seven times he did it i did not respond and then when i finally did it is i be a gas et right but when i realized is ye i you could say what may bit hurts a child to do that but i think it hurts them way was if you can immediately go and prepare and say anybody that he was little harsh in that ism sorry i did not been to yell you that but which you did is wrong and you are not going to get to go out and play right now as a result of it but i love you very much and i want us to do better i want it i want you to do better and not doing this thing and i want to do better and not yelling at you wen you do this thing something it is not it is toes not rocket science right but i just think i used to live my life in a way where all i did was brakshit and never fix it you are living in a house where everything is broken where is now i still break things but now i clean up the mass and oh lie it'll send the house is better what is your process for when there is a need for repair but i you feel that it was not you it was somebody ease's i error but or potential air you i very humbly i express how you go about repairing i your your errors i but what about situations where i i loved one a to worker you feel screwed up ere wronged you right as many people do we all do from time time feel this way i do you approach them i and trying repair that the situation i cause there is a we bit less or far less control when you don't then the situation you described and by the way the situation you describe thing is a perfect one because i i think a we all screw up and the answer to the second question sort of the answer to the first which as if everyone did what you were doing the world would be truly a far better place but not everyone is doing what you are doing if somebody if you feel wronged i assuming that wrong was it was not o associate pathicaly motivated what is your process for going about repairing a relationship fracture that agannis assumes that this relationship that matters right in every interaction you are you are only really able to optimize around one thing and you have to decide is this one thing that ism optimizing around the relationship or is at the outcome were other things optimize around but you understand that those are different right and maybe yo could elaborate on the lea i think i get it but i to flat it out of if i met the if i met the market and ism dryer f m it that ism turn u by a new car and ism sitting air talking to the carsalesman a that is a relationship that is an interaction now i want to buy this car for as little as possible and he wants to sell ta car for as much as possible well in that interaction my relationship with him means nothing let us us whole i do not know this kind he is not my best friend ism optimizing everything around the outcome everything i do in negotiating and interacting with him personally is based on getting the best outcome for me it is very selfish nothing wrong with that bite whathoes he doing the tame ti was that but now for example pretend that you are the carsalesmn you are one of my closest friends and it is your dealership it is your money it is you cannot sell this thing to me at a loss i do not want you to do that because i i want you to be able to make money and similarly you care about me and you do not want me to overpay for this now we are negotiating and we are both trying to optimize for an outcome but there are relationship also matters is a very different negotiation of that point and i think i always try to ask myself this question when ism having some interpersonal conflict which is what am i optimizing for if if ism having a quarrel with my wife i have to remind myself that the outcome is the objective were outcome is not necessarily the top priority you do not being wright all the time which is my default state it is just to be a bull in a china shop it is to be a authoritarian instead of authoritative and that is that does not work if the relationship matters to answer your question the first thing ism gin to ask myself if ism trying if i feel slighted is what is the nature of the relationship is it even worth trying to do something about this and presumably you are asking the question cause the lens is yes this is some one who you you care about more than in just a transactional way usually what have realized is i cannot try to approach the situation without fully understanding myself and that takes a while generally and this is where i still one to two times a week ism still working with a therapist i have to kind of try to finger it out of my own and tend usually bounce it off a therapist and say well i think this is why ism upset about this think that when this person did this or said this have felt this first fall am i the am i correct in what i felt because remember sometimes you might at least for me this was the case i would just feel anger in response to every interaction but what i did not realize was that anger was really just in other emotion that was superimposed on top of hurt er superimposed on top of fear er superimposed on top of shame er superimposed on top of something else but i did not know how to articulate any of those other emotions the only thing i could really articulate was anger if anger is the only thing i know and anger is the only response i see it is not very helpful it is not very inciteful that is that is a big part of it is being able to deconstruct what ism feeling oh what i really feel is lost or what i really feel is abandonment right now and that sometimes takes a while to figure out at least for me like ism still ism only a few years into this journey and maybe other people figured these things out when they were in their twenties and the veterans they can do this more more naturally but that step one if i do not really understand what is going on i cannot even begin to try to approach this person to say this is how i feel ism this is how do you feel and an an what are we optimizing for in this interaction i certainly know you are not alone in this this senses the process and it takes a lot of time and and on a case by case basis can take a lot of time to figure out will exactly what one is feeling i think it really goes back to the the coarseness of languages a way to sort one's feelings it was actually or other because we meant sure paulconti who is one of your tampered medical school am i class mates but a another previous guests on this pockets who is also at o one of your medical school class mates the doctor called croon it psychiatric by engineer a phenomenon um stature and doing amazing things in the world who said most of the time we have no idea how other people feel even though we think we do and most the time we do not even know how we feel ism in our ability to really know what were really feeling is terrible and yet we recognize the the broad the broad bins it's pistol ism superhappy ism relaxed ism tired i mean to thing about you course that a that language is for that for all the new aunts and all the underlying things conscious and subconscious that cut be driving in emotional stay it is really it is really quite unbelievable beyond the vigilance that your positive verses negative that was about the extent of my emotional language until in a somewhat recently well strikes me you come a very long way maybe you could share with us a little bit about what you learned on these what you called retreat for e find the bookshafter you describe deliberately going off to a a treatment center a multifid treatment centers over time to really drill into this process of understanding oneself chatter and how one's current state of emotional processing an emotional stability or influencing relationships and to importance of that what was there any and of overriding am them for you for instance could you trace back to specific evince or themes of childhood that need a lot of it take sense or is it far more in new ones than that well you the firstling would say as i wish i could tell you that this was a very deliberate and wonderful choice that i just decided i man to go on a little you nonself heeling journey but unfortunately that was not the case in both cases en twenty seventeen and an twenty twenty i very i was as close to having no choice in the matter as one can have a both of these experiences represented total rock bottom moments in my life the these would have been the two lowest points in my life a for different reasons but but they were nevertheless the two absolute low points in my life and i would say in the first instance i i guess i could have chosen not to go but i would have lost everything that mattered in my life at that point and i had our good friend paulconti basically telling me that i needed to do this but i really need to do this and in the second situation though completely different circumstances you might think how can one person in just span of three years find themselves in in a situation were they almost without having any choice in the matter have to go away a to a place where your your basically locked up without a one for three weeks and your doing twelve to thirteen hours of therapy a day i stain nothing about this was was something i wanted to do nothing about this was pleasant m i would describe these is the most difficult things of ever done in my life baron and have done some difficult things in my life but they have always been physically difficult i love doing physically difficult things a but this was emotionally the equivalent of for me am yo climbing hate to and suing the english channel in the same month something that just i could you could not fathom with that said yes i learned a lot and i learned that people me can be overly analytical and that that viper analytical nature and lead you a stray when you think that your intellect is giving you a fact based explanation for a set of circumstances and you rationalize than my way well this happened to me when i was ski id but li i get it and it is not really a problem and as a result of that it is it is it these rectory some positive things that came out out experience and and and i think the real ahamoment in my journey which occurred on on a day that i remember very well was the day i finally dropped that i dropped that i that rationalization and i allowed myself to experience what a child would experience in that moment and then understood what the implications are for a child going through these things and i think that was here us rally the first time in my life i ever accepted emotionally something that i had intellectually always said i does not not matter me it is just what is just life and those things happen and lots of worst things happened to lots of people and and that is so ism and i think it it is not that once i emotionally accepted this i became a victim an it was not at all it just finally allowed me to realize oh i can let that go now i do not have to i i do not have to i do not have to be a slave to the adaptations that came from that i can i can i can surrender a si beautiful and i an inspiring to me i think that i ye there's this i incredible ability that human brain has to script a story and to compare t other people circumstances and as you sad o you do not rationalize what or essentially emotional dramas were physical aromas i from the perspective of the adult but ism if i know one thing for sure and make you very clear ism not a cognition but is that the brain does not ism discard of any circuitry we re purpose the same circuitry we used as children as as adults and the ability to go back to that and it and to pars it but as yet as you point out not from a i from an intellectual standby standpoint but from an emotional standpoint seems to be the really hard work do you do that on a regular basis no not not at all ism it is been done at a handful of times i it is been exhausting it is it is very difficult it is it is it is i not this is the right i would almost describe it as emotionally violent i and it is it is it is not something i need to revisit often truthfully i think that the now it is ism it is it is been done a finite number of times a and i think have captured much much value from it that t there are lots of other things i continue to do men run i i i use a system called dialectical behavior therapy that is a regular part of the therapy that i do ism but i do not have to go back to my childhood i do not have to go back to uncovering and an exploring a lot of that stuff ism i i i have have learned the lessons and now it is really about practicing the skills i know i know what i want now and i and i know i a now you tug about plastic it'll share one example which i know i wrote about in the book but but just for for folks listening that you will appreciate i just one of the one of the hallmarks of my existence has always been just a a a an insane amount of anger and rage it is it is been there as long as have known i do not have a conscious memory of not having rage i earliest memories of life when ism five years old i have rage you cannot believe and it is it is a problem all my life is a than age if i go more than two weeks without punching a whole in the wall of our house it is a miracle i mean i am good at dry wall you cannot believe how good i am for all the stuff i have to repair around our house ism breaking windows ism breaking it just don't id just and and n a way and of course i rationalized how much boxing saved my life because i had this amazing outlet for my rage right if you i got to basically exercise six hours a day ism hitting punching bags and people all day long and it is just a beautiful outlet that keeps me out of jail ism and a big part of that rage was inward right it is it is not rocket science to understand that a person who has that much hatred for every one has an enormous amount for themselves and one of the things i did not realize was happening was what my inner monologue was because it is you can appreciate your inner monologue is frequent and you ubiquitous and present that it is easy to almost forget that it is there mean that is the that is that that is the sort of a dangerous part about it right is kind of the that avid foster walls this is water thing the fish are swimming through water i the waters everywhere that even realized there in water you do not unrealized you do not realize the subconscious stream of thoughts that constantly flow but eventually i became aware of just what that self talk was and it is it was no longer the case it was the angriest the most violent self talk you can imagine i mean it was there is no mistake that i could make that was anything other than my perfect perfect standard that did not result in what i would call my inner bobby night going holistic it just did not matter it it's sound silly under it did not matter if i did not perfectly cook stake if i did not perfectly nail something i was doing if if if i did not do anything that was perfect at what i described as match grad perfect i mean i would want to beat myself to a pulp and i would scream at myself i mean it just it is is again it is hard to describe and i i hope that most people listening to this do not understand what that feels well it became very clear that that had to change because when you were when you ere that when you hate yourself that much by definition you ere going to be an insufferable prick to everybody else cause you are you are just that is good to spill into how you interact with the world i you n was working with a therapist who was one of the people who was sending me to this place in arizona and basically it became clear that t the the the they hey proposed that i could shed this trait if i was willing to do certain amount of work an i was there is no chance ism forty seven years old this is the only way have ever interact it myself how in the world could this be undone it would take another forty years to undo this and there gonna here is this exercise you are going to do the exercise was every single time i did some thing where i would have that self talk i would have to immediately stop myself and pretend that it was not me that just did that but it was one of my closest friends and instead i would audibly speak to that person there is nobody else there but speak to that person as though they are the one that made the mistake and i were i was to record that on my phone ism out there shout my bow and arrow and i do not get a bull's eye instead of screaming it myself i have to say oh imagine it is my body ja are who just missed that shot what would i say to him pick up the phone your poetophone and say of course something different and of course what i would say in that situation was much kinder an infinitely kinder s from saying it to my closest friend ism say it in a very kind way and i had to take a a copy of that audio and text it to my therapist oh well talk about win you a i was all on board this practice until you mention that at which on inland i trust my therapist i unto very deep level but a t well that that is a that is a mountain well this in i is poor person got a lot of tax messages a lot of lot of audiophiles but here is the part that just blows my mind it only took i do not know i i cannot remember exactly i have to go back to look at my journals en took about four months to get rid of bobby night li you now again t t we we had kind of a mental model for what this look which was bobby night was the chairman of the board he sat in the board room and nobody else got to talk and for those that don't a bobby night had a terrible temper the worst right this the guide it was throwing chairs across the basketball level eleven yet out of ten and and all of a sudden we got to the point where bobby night is not even in the board room any more in fact i as i say this to day i do not really remember what he sounded it is it is amazing to me and and have had some really amazing opportunities to bring him back it is not ism making fewer mistakes right it is not ice better today than i was three years ago at all the things that i do ism not ism actually probably worse tan many regards i but the difference is ye i can communicate with myself i think i can say this i think i can say lovingly right and and may be not as lovingly as some people can i still think ism probably a me just a little higher standard with myself than maybe i need to be at times but but ism just not beating myself up i used to and i think by extension ism beating other people up a at lass well i do not know the extent to which you are internal narrative reflects the o narrative that others have about you but for i want to thank you for sharing ism what you just shared i think as a practical stop it it i first wants one have never heard of before ism but certainly represents the incredible phenomenon of corollas to see because four months sounds a bit of time and yet is you were forty seven or sell that is forty seven years of accumulated ism just absolutely berating self talk is what it sounds ism it is something that people can can think about for their own for their own purposes ism in their own challenges also you've read the book twice now and and love it at as as i put it in my am endorsement of it ism i think it is not just informative but it is indeed important because it centers on many of that he actionable items related to i helipad and life span vitality longevity whatever people want to call these things that are essential but also this the section on emotional health is was am absolutely profound for me it inspired a huge number of changes ism and the book as a whole represents it a very important contribution to everybody the the numerous points in i would say every chapter is applicable to everybody and there very few books out there that ism one to thank you for that and especially for including the section on emotional health and especially for sharing what you did to day because i think it does not just take a a bit of vulnerability but at a too vulnerability and humility to be able to share what you just shared and my only request your wish is that you also holy internalized it the tremendous gift that you are giving everybody through coming on podcast this doing your own pod casts writing the book i look out on the landscape of i front facing public facing i health out there and you sit i not alone but in a unique stance as that the medical doctor that i do believe that ism people trust the very most because of the fact that you have that intense rigor your i would don't say your desire your ism absolute obsession with measurement and and precision i many of the things i a moment ago your pointing to as as potentially in a hazards for your emotional life but that is sir all of us the general public i preciously and we with it just incalculable value i hope that internalizes as well maybe i it will even even to yourself that maybe i need to send you a script every day but in all serious also one to thank you for taking the time to day and ism even tough it is a personal thing i i really want to thank you for your ism being a amazing colleague to me in the podcast pase in the in the health and medicine space whatever that is and also am just in it an incredible friend you have been a tremendous source of support and guidance in every one of the domains that we talked about to day and many more and again i just want to say that this emotional health component i i agree with you i think it is ism it is not just vital i think it is it is the the most final of all of them am you have just made numerous important contributions and ism just one to thank you for sharing you clearly put everything you have into everything you do thank you peter and i think you i really appreciate you a making a time for us to godown talk in a long

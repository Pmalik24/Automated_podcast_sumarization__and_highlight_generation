welcome to the superman ladpodcas the a science science pace to for m indrewhubermen and ism a professor of neurology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day i have the pleasure of introducing doctor matter walker as our guest on the superman ladpodcast doctor walker is a professor of negro science and psychology at the universe of californium barkeep there his laboratory studies sleep they study why we sleep what occurs during sleep such as dreams and why we dream learning during sleep as well as the consequences of getting insufficient or poor quality sleep on waking states doctor walker is also the author of the international bestselling book why we sleep our discussion to day is an absolutely fascinating one for any one that is interested in sleep learning or human performance of any kind doctor walker teaches us how to get better at sleeping he also discusses naps whether or not we should or should not nap whether or not we can compensate for lost sleep and if how to best do that we discuss behavioral protocols and interactions with light temperature supplementation food exercise secs all the variables that can impact this incredible state of mind an body that we call sleep during my scientific career have read many papers about sleep and attended many seminars about sleep yet my discussion with doctor walker to day reveal to me more about sleep sleep science and how to get better at sleeping than all of those papers and seminars combined ism also delighted to share that doctor walker has started a podcast that podcast entitled the mat walker podcast releases its first episode this month and is going to teach all about sleep and how to get better at sleeping be sure to check out the mat walker podcast on apple notify or wherever you listen to podcast before we begin it'd to mention that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and since related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve son delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might hast in addition it has robotics which are vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called gut microfilm and the ways in which the micro bi am interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and especially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i see and the promises to support my microbic if you would to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstone calm slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of sidemen d three k too thrave ton of data ow showing that vitemand three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if were getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone cam slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolier for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have soda magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimize if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that you are getting the preparations of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element do calm slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do cam slash superman and now my discussion with doctor mat walker great to finally meet you in person wonderful to connect m i mean its being too long but i suspect it would havebeenisios to time before we have met lest the pandemic no thank you nowmyou a ism delighted that we are finally being down faces to face have been tracking your work both in the internet sphere and i read your book and loved it and also from the perspective of science you achy came to stamford couple of years ago and gave a lecture a for braining o ya see and there of course you talked about sleep in its utility and its challenges and how to a and how to conquer it to speak let us start off very basic what is sleep sleep is probably the singlemost effective thing you can do to reset your brain buy health that is a functional answer items of now what is sleep intemsof its benefits sleep is a process though is an infrangibly complex physiological ball and if you to recognize o see what happens to your brain and your body at night during sleep you would be blown away and the paradox is that most of us and i would think this too if i was not to sleep scientist we go to bed we lose consciousness for seven to nine hours and then we set of wake up in the morning and we generally feel better and in some ways that denies the physiological and biological beauty of sleep upstairs in your brain when you are going through these different stages of sleep the the changes in railway of activity are far more dramatic than those that we see when we are awake and we can speak about deep sleep on what happens the remsleep is a fascinating time which is another stage of sleep often called dream sleep which is rapid eye movement sleep that stage of sleep some part of your brain are up to thirty per cent more active than when you are awake again it is can had violating this idea that are mind is dormant and our body is just simply quiescent and and resting i would happy to best of double click on either one of those and also what changes in the body as well but it is an intense evolutionary adaptive benefit a and system that said though i would almost push back against a and evolved system when we think about the question of sleep and what sleep is our assumption has always been that we evolved to sleep and have achy question that and i have no water get in a time capture and go back and prove this but what if we started off sleeping and it was from sleep that wakefulness emerged why do we assume that it is the other way around and i think this probably some really good evidence that sleep may have been the photo state that it was the basic fundamental living state and when we became awake as it were we always had to return to sleep in some ways at that point sleep was the price that we paid for wakefulness and that is another way of describing what sleep is but again i think it sat of denies that the active state of sleep it is not a passive state of sleep either and and then find you can say what what is sleep across different species and in us human beings and in ormemalian species and avian species as well sleep is broadly separated into these two main types and we have got non rapid eye movement sleep on the one hand and then we have got rapid ye movement sleep on the other and we can speak about how they unfold across the night and their architecture beers it is not just intellectually interesting from the perspective of what sleep is it is also practically impactful for our daily lives and id love to sit o go down that root too but you navigate you dow me i on let us devil end go down that root o you mention how i t of the brain is during certain phases of sleep when i was coming up in science remslee rapid i moment sleep was referred to as paradoxical sleep was that still a good way to think about it paradoxical because the brain is active and yet we are essentially paralyzed carrot yet it really is a paradox and where that came from was simply the brainwave recordings that if all i measuring about you is your brainwave activity it is very difficult for me sitting outside of the sleep laboratory room to figure out are you awake worry you in remsleep because those two pans of brain activity are close to one another you cannot discriminate between them yet he paradox is that when you are awake i go in there and your set of sitting up your clearly conscious in awake but yet when you go interred sleep you are completely paralyzed and that is one of the i think that is part of the paradox but the paradox really just comes down to two dramatically different conscious states yet brain activity is dramatically more similar than different and the way i can figure out which of the two you are in is by measuring two other signals the activity from your eyes and the activity from your muscles when were awake we will occasionally have these blinks and we will have cart of scads but during red sleep you have these really bazaar horizontal shuttling eye movements that occur and that is where the name comes from rapid i movements they always horizontal mostly they are horizontals and that is one of the ways that we can differentiate them from other waking i movement activity cause it is not always let can be sometimes horizontal but can also have diagonal and also vertical in that plane but then the muscle activity is the real dead give away just before you and to red sleep your brainstorm which is were the dynamics of none and ram are essentially played out and then expressed upstairs in the quarters and downstairs in the body and when we go into red sleep and just a few seconds before that happens the brainstorm sends a signal all the way down the spinal cord and it communicates with what are called the alphamotonurons in the spinal cord which control of voluntary scleral muscles and it is a signal of paralysis and when you go into dream sleep you are locked into a physical incarceration of your own body amen you why why would mother nature do such a thing and it is in some ways very simple the brain paralyzes the body that the mind can dream safely because think about how quickly we would have all been popped out of the ampul fund if i think ism one of the best sky divers who can just simply fly and have had some times those dreams too and i get up on my apartment window and i leap out you do not you are done that is one of the sort of that part of the paradox of ram sleep both it is brain activity similarity despite the behavioral state being different and this bazaar lock down of the the sit of brain of the body itself now of course the involuntary muscles thankfully aunt a paralyzed see you keep breathing your heart keeps beating is this why men have erections during asleep and women have vaginal obligation during sleep that is one of the reason part of the other reason though there is because of the autonomic activity there is nervous a part of our nervous system called the autonomic nervous system and it controls many of the automatic behaviors and some of those re aspects f are reproductive facilities during remsleep what we later discovered is that you go through these bazaar what we call autonomic storms which sounds dramatic but it actually is when you measure them that you will go through periods where your heart rate decelerates and drops and your blood pressure goes down and then utterly randomly your heart rate accelerate dramatically and what we call the fight or flight branch of the autonomic nervous system or the sympathetic nervous system badly name cause it is anything but sympathetic its very aggravating an that all the sudden fires up and then it shuts down again and it is not in any regular way and it is when you get those autonomic storms you get very activated from a physiological perspective that you can have these erections and you have national discharges o you are total paralyzed but you are still paralyzed there are only am two voluntary so at two voluntary muscle groups that are spurred from the paralysis bazaar one your extra ocular muscles because if they were paralyzed you would not be able to have rapid eye movements and the other that we later discovered was the inner ear muscle and we have got no good understanding as to why those two muscles groups are spurred from the paralysis it may have something to do with cranial nerve but i a i do not think it is that i think it is perhaps something more sensory related some people of argued that the reason the eyeballs are spurred from the paralysis is because if your tells are left for long periods of time inactive you may get things such as oxygen sort of issues in the am aqueous orvitorious humor and the bills have to keen the training sending of the anterior i are i made require movement exactly pimeliclarcoma have date said in and drainage through the endure chamber but there am speculating ism also speculating when i ask this am i would imagine that there are states in waking that also resemble slowwave she were rather that her states that slow wave sleep also resembles waking states you have beautifully illustrated how ram sleep can mimic some of the more act of brain states that we achieving waking what sort of waking state that i might have experienced or experience on a daily basis mix look similar to slow wave sleep norm sleep if any it is genius way of thinking about it turns the table i lev it ism we almost never see anything the the true strut slow waves of deep none sleep ism we spoke about these two stages nonagon ram ism norm is further subdivided into four separate stages ism stages on through for increasing in the depth of sleep stages three and for that is what we typically called deep norm sleep stages one and two i man take me through the ark of a night just they i u i i put my head down i well for you wat what is ism you normally go to sleep ism usually sit of around about ten thirty p m my and usually it'll naturally wake up said of a little bit before seven sometimes before six forty five or seven i haven alarm set for ism seven o for ism a m your here folks ma a an as seen alarm a i really an really ism usually e iron and it but he does use it yet usuallusualy leman after a oh i am human i and and have have my sleepfishes and it'd left to speak about that too but ism it is only just in the event that ism cause i to keep regularity to you have got to keep those two things in balance and seven o for just because why not be atiosincractic i do not know why we always set things on these a hod numbers yep when you mi sleep round ten thirty losing you is an example i as i imagine a number of people go to sleep at different times with ten theories about when i go slew eleven as for me but ism you go to sleep at ten thirty over that first ism let us say three hours of sleep what is the architecture of that sleep look as compared to the last three hours of your sleep a before morning ye i should note that that is if ten thirty to seven that is just based on mi iron a type an my preferential it is different for different people ism not suggesting that that is the perfect sleeps but for humanities sleep it is just my but imagine most people probably go to sleep somewhere between ten an p m an midnight its o about li night and mi night give a m and seven a m were or five thirty and seven thirty ye ye ism at least in if you look at the first welt nations that is that is a typical sleep profile i when i first full asleep it'll go into the light stages of none sleep stages one and two of none in then it'll start to descend down into the deep e stages of none sleep after about maybe twenty minutes an starting to head down into stage three none and then into stage for none sleep and as ism starting to fall asleep as have cast off from the and usually with me murky waters of wakefulness am and ism in the shallows of sleep stages one and two my heart rate starts to drop a little bit and then my railway pattern activity starts to slow down normally when ism awake it is going up and down may be twenty thirty forty fifty times er second am as ism going in to light none sleep it will slow down to maybe fifteen twenty and then really starts to slow down down to about at o ten or eight cycles per second eight csch or waves per second then as ism starting to move in two ism stages three and four none sleep several remarkable things happen all of a sudden my heartbeat really does start to drop oh and it'll come back to temperature ism going to write temperature downcast i always forget these things and now ism hardly in the foothills of middle age an as ism starting to go into those deeper stages of none sleep all of a sudden hundreds of thousands of cells in my quarter all decide to fire together and then they all go silent together and it is this remarkable physiological coordination of the likes that we just do not see at boring any other brain state anstrillientually having recorded from the brains of of animals and allorbit from humans an nothing have ever seen the entire orders or even entire regions of groans light up that it is it is stunning it is it is almost this mutreful sort of mantrechand an all this sure of to slow in had and then a meditative exhale in had exhale and these waves are just enormous in their size an the body is capable of movement at this time there is not paralysis there is no paralysis but for the most part muscle tone has also dropped significantly merest at that point and then you will or i will then stay there for about another twenty or thirty minutes now ism may be sixty or seventy minutes into my first sleep cycle and then it'll start to rise back up back up into stage two none sleep and then after about eighty or minutes it'll pop up and it'll have a short red sleep period and then back down i go again down into none up into red and you do that reliably repeatedly and i will be doing that and i do do that every nighty minutes at least that the average for most adults it is different in different species what changes to your question is the ratio of none to red within that ninety minutes cycle as you move across the night and what i mean by this is in the first half of the night the majority of those ninety minute cycles are comprised of lots of deep none sleep that is when i get my stage three and four of deep none sleep once i push through to the second half of the big get now that easeful balance changes and instead the majority of those ninety minute cycles a comprised either of this light form of none sleep state too none sleep it's much more and increasingly more rapid i movement sleep and the implication that i was t of speaking about pragmatically is let us see that ism i have to and i usually never to ally morning flights or red eyes ism just because ism a mass if that happens ism not suggesting up of the people should not ism suggesting is all not do that a i have taken a red eyer have done that two or three days later i get some sort of general feeling always my brain does not work as well i i think red i should be abolished i for the pilots too i you know and oh an we can for the about those and errs theinergency remembering long shifts have been shown to lead to you know physician induced a errors that i lead to lot of fatalities ism in their lot of reasons why staying up too long or being up at the wrong times if you are not adapted to is just terrible the datrinoll of those cases ism particular physicians too there was some recent day to looking at suicide amity ism the rates of suicide in training physicians a you though far above the nous and i do not suspect that the chetahs o helping them i suspect that sleep is a missing thought of that explanatory equation but i teach medical students and and they there phenomenal but they father under extremely challenged conditions it is i should not put them undo it's not it is not optimizing performings i have one sorry i us sir no no this is is importanthese it is an important digression i have one question which is your saying that as across the night a greater percentage of these ninety minute cycles are going to be occupied by red sleep as you progress through the night ism aware that there a based on work that you have done an and i and from your public education efforts and others i that we have called circadian forces and we have other forces that are driving when we sleep and when we want to sleep et camera without going into the details of those of a simple question the experiment is the fallowing let us say god forbid you are prevented from going to sleep at your normal time and you stay up for the four hours or five hours that normally you would be in predominantly slowly of sleep ye if let say you finally get to lie down at three a m a time when normally your sleep would be occupied mostly by rapid i movement sleep ye will you experience a greater percentage of rapid i movement sleep because of these called circadian forces meaning that is what is appropriate for that time or will your system need to start at the beginning of the race that were was is ism referring to it i calling sleep if for if that is not cleared anybody was on to masking as if you are force to skip the slowwave sleep part of the night will your system we p into habit i moment sleeper does it have to start at the beginning and get slowwave sleep first in other words does one sleep state drive in angry to the next sleep state great question there is some degree of reciprocity between the sleep states i should note that when we drive one of those up we often but not always see a a change in the other there are some pharmacologic that have shown an independence to that and we have also playroom with things temperature and sometimes you can nudge one and not seem to upset or perturb the other but to your ism i think lovely point the answer is it is a mix but it is most sleep the latter meaning you will mostly go into your red sleep phase is and be significantly deficient in your deep sleep just because i start my sleep cycle at three a m rather than at ten thirty p m it does not mean that my brain just as well have got a program and ism just going to run the program and the way the program runs is that we always start with first couple of hours of deep sleep we just got a begin at number one seen one it does not do that now i will get some deep sleep to begin with and part of that is just because of how sleep works based on how long have been awake longer ism awake there is a significantly great a pressure for deep sleep but we actually use exactly what you just described as an experimental technique to selectively deprive people of one of those stages of sleep or the other we will do first half of the night deprivation and then let you sleep the second half that means that you will be most sleep deep sleep deprived and you will still get most sleep all of your red sleep and then we switch it you only get your first four hours which means you will mostly get deep non red sleep but you will get almost no red sleep in both of those groups they have both had four hours of sleep the difference between them in terms of an experimental outcome is not the sleep time because they have both slept for the same amount it is the contribution of those different stages now we actually have more elegant methods for sot of selectively going in there and scooping out different stages of sleep but that is the way we used to do at old school was just using this timing difference and who suffers more o those that lack the early phase old were those that lack the later phase of the night sleep in other words if i have to sleep only four hours for whatever reason on my better off getting the early part of the night sleep or the second half of the nights depends on what the out come measure is i that gets right to the differences between slowwave sleep and red ray i i was a probably misinformed but my understanding a very true understanding i should i should say before i i much a old contra wit some of at you how with is that the very as of you but that the the first part of the night the slave sleep is restorative to the musculature to motor learning and that the dream content ends to be less emotional the second half of the night be more emotional dreams and sort of the unbarring of the emotional load of our previous day and other experiences another words if i were to degree myself deprive myself use me of red i would be hiperemotion all night maybe night as settled with the kind of experiences of my life whereas of did myself of slave sleep i would ism feel of o more physical always s that corrector is that far to sand won and if it is too simple please i tell me where ism wrong no i think much of that is correct and it is sit of that plus for example during deep none sleep that is where we get this it is almost a form of natural blood pressure medication and when i take that away from you the next day were usually going to see autonomic dysfunction were usually going to see abnormalities and tartrate blood pressure we also know that during deep none sleep that there is a certain control of specific hormones for example we know that the insolent regulation of sort of metabolism a meaning how will you luck from a regulated blood shook a perspective versus deregulated prediabetic luck of profile that is where deep sleep seemstemativ we selectively deprive you of that e close on him growth formers different actually that is that is a beautiful demonstration were growth hormone seems to be more remsleep dependent and that is why we can come on to the effects of alcohol in the the surreally impressive frightening patron on alcohol in its disruption of am of sleep but then we also know testosterone pique levels of testosterone happened during remsleep the second half of the night it as say a second half of the night it really just means that the your profile of mental and physical dysfunction we will be different under both of those conditions which one would you prefer i would prefer neither of them and it really depends on what your trying to promise for it is it is just complement of sleep is just pylori potent it is physiologically systemic that it is almost impossible not to undergo one of those two things just deep sleep deprivation or just red sleep deprivation and not show a profile that you would really prefer to avoid and that is that that is the reason from an evolutionary standpoint that weave preserve those stages of sleep i mean sleep is just idiotic from an evolutionary perspective or maybe waking as it can of wait e hers i e ye i the on your preview li talking to come in is very pacific to me i yet i am normally have always in idiot when waking but i think this this idea that sleep is profoundly debt to mental to us if you to take it at face value you are not finding a mate you are not re producing you aren't foraging for food you not caring for you young and worst of all you have ponderable depredation on any one of those grounds sleep probably should have been selected against but it was not sleep has foot its way through heroically every step along the evolutionary path and the for every sleep stage has also survive just best we can tell what that means is that those are non negotiable if mother nature had found away to even just set of thin sly some of that sleep from us there would have been fast ism sure evolutionary benefits but looks at though she has not and ism usually in favor of her wisdom after three point six million years that's it is incredible i want i introduce another a godonkan ex prom another thought experiment in this art of the night i always sleep predominates early in the night and then red sleep there is a snare that many people including myself experience on a regular basis which is they go to sleep seeming just fine three four hours innit they wake up they wake up for whatever reason man there is a noise may be the temperature is not right we will certainly talk about sleep hygiene et camera they get up they go to the restroom they might flip on the nights they might not they will get back in bed hopefully they are not picking up their phone and starting to rouse and wake up the brain through various mechanisms light an cognize stimulation et camera they go back to sleep let us say after about ten fifty menses they are able to fall back a sleep then they sleep till their more typical hate time e how detrimental is that wake up episode or or i event in terms of longevity learning et camera i would love to sleep the entire night through every night but most nights i do not and yet i feel pretty good throughout the day some days better than others e if you were to at have a value ate that waking ape sod in compare it to sleeping the whole night through what are your were your thoughts on that i think if you are waking up frequently as your describing i would probably get your estate in order because my guess is within the next year be gin to be you can to be done for no ism kitting absolutely kitting you it is perfectly natural an normal particularly as we progress with age your children tend to have ism typically more continuous sleep now it is not that they ain't waking up for brief periods of time they are and in fact we all do when we come out the other end of our sleep cycle at the end of our red sleep period of the ninth minute cycle almost every b my wakes up and we make a postural movement we turn over because we have been paralyze for long and the body will also to shift if we are a look around we re open our rs position you somesometimes people will open their eyes but usually it is only for a brief period of time and they usually never commit those awakenings to memory your situation and it is my situation as well i usually now at the sage of life i do not sleep through the night it'll usually have a bathroom a break and hen it'll come back that is perfectly normal we tend to forget that in sleep science we think of sleep efficiency of the total amount of time that you are in bed how much of that per cent time is spent asleep and we usually look two numbers that are above eighty five per cent or more as a healthy sleep efficiency if you to think bow me going to bed and i spend let us say eight and a quartet eight and a half hours of time in bed with a normal healthy sleep efficiency i still may be only sleeping a total of seven and a half hours or seven and three quarter hours meaning that ism going to be awake in total not in one long bod but ism going to be awake for upwards of thirty minutes not some time some times that can be after a ten minute dalliance after having gone to the bath room and ism just gradually drifting back off again or the times it will just be for a couple of minutes and most of those you do not commit i think we need to stop we do not need to get too worried about you know periods of time awake just because when not sleeping throughout the night i would love to do that ton i remember when i that used to happen in it still happens youeveryat only your great my ad to it is lovely things was surprise right and you not go now a rise the hall night yonder it is a surprise but for the most part i think we can be more relaxed about that where we have to be a bit more attentive tho is if you are spending long periods of time not being able to get back to sleep and usually we to fine that by saying if it is been twenty twenty five minutes normally that is a time when we would really say it'll gay let let us explore this what is going on let us see what is happening the other thing is if it is happening very frequently even if you are am not awake for twenty five minutes stretches but your finding yourself waking up and being consciously were that you have woken up for may be six seven or eight times throughout the night and your sleep is very what we call fragmented the great science of sleep in the past five or ten years has has been yes quantity is important but quality is just as important and you cannot ha have one without the other in times of a good beneficial next day out come you cannot just get four hours of sleep but brilliant quality of sleep and be unimpat nor can you get eight hours of sleep but have very pool quality of sleep and be unimpat the next day that is why i just sot of one to asterisk this idea of let us not get too worried about waking up and having some time awake that is perfectly normal and natural but if it is happening very frequently throughout the night all those periods of the a long stretches of time upwards of twenty five minutes then let us look into it i can assure you just helped a lot of people i feel better about this waking up episode that i and many other people experiences i i am because i cause i think it is a really important that we i think have been desperately guilty of perhaps also being too puritanical about sleep and and have have retrospected and have tried to explore why this was the case you know it was almost sleep or else dot dot dot and at the time when i was stunting to write the book which was back in too thousand and sixteen you sleep was still a neglected step sister in the health conversation of to day and i c discern old gan the and it is changing and not because it to my effects y i will say holly i will say well i it is a great that you give an attribution to your the other people involved in of course it is a big field but i think you have done a great service by cuing people to the importance of this state not just for avoiding troublesome out comes but also for optimizing their waking state it is really i i new sleep as this here that feels good but were not aware of how it feels when we are in it necessarily ye i has tremendous benefits when your doing it well to speak and has tremendous deposits when when were not and i think i think it was an important thing for you to do to cut people to this issue and i would say mission accomplished that people are aware of the need for sleep i think that knowing that waking up in the middle the night is normal provided it's not too frequent is is great and will also help people who may have been overly concerned about that i i do one uses as an opportunity raise something about the called supermen scandal not have you anifyounet with the superman as call i fortunately known i has confused those yet i some years ago there was a discussion about the called supermen soul meaning the superman schedule that supermen without an each which i have nothing to do with yo read your nice this w this will have a subtext but regardless m the ubermenscadule as i understand is one in which the person place to sleep in ninety men it bouts spread throughout the day and night in an attempt to get more productivity am and or reduce they are over all sleep need there was a paper publish recently that explored whether or not this is good or bad for us maybe just it give us the taco message on that yes of these semen a schedules and the lots of different forms of that they tried to essentially pi shot the twenty for our period into short bouts of sleep with some short o or no well slightly longer periods one wakefulness than short bouts of sleep than wakefulness your i said have made i think equip it is almost your sleeping a baby in cause that is the way that be night in ninety in all times that they all have these brief naps then they're awake then they're a sleep then there wake and to the chagrin of parents across the night it is basically the same they're awake they are sleep they are awake to sleep and that is more the the schedule that these types of protocols have i have suggested and there was a really great comprehensive review that found not only that they went necessarily helpful but they were actually rely quite detrimental anon almost every performance met trick whether it be task performance whether it be physiological out come measures whether it even be the quality of the sleep that they were having when they were trying to get it all of those were in a danced direction and it is not surprising if you look at your the way that your physiology is programmed if you look at the way your circadian rhythm is programmed none of that screams to us that we should be sleeping in that way why chuckling because we always here sleep a baby this is our baby sleep and a i would say do not sleep a baby sleep an adult be i means the get get your solar eight hours to the a crystals line whose a a long standing suffering a in some access i sleep a baby am awake every twenty minutes and i think this is another one of those demonstrations that when you fight biology you normally lose and the way you have lost is disease sickness and impediment and i think if you sleep in accordance with the natural biological edict that we have all been given life tends to be both of a her quality and along a duration i agree along those lines am i as a vision scientists have been very excited by the work on these anon image forming cells in the eye the call molonops and cells that an n the brain about tie circadian time of day and ism a big proposing of people getting a some sunlight ideally sunlight but other forms of bright light in their eyes early in the day and when they want to be awake you essential during the phase of their twenty four hour circadian cychael when temperature is rising and then starting n get less light in their eyes as our temperatures going down and turn it later in the day and in the evening are there any adjustments to that general theme that you to add or is a in anyway now i think that is exactly a we recommend right now which is try to get at least thirty to forty minutes of exposure to some kind of natural daylight now there may be parts of the world were it is from your from a a rather cloudy part of i am from ye a liverpool inland a and a the north west of inland is not known for its a beach results and fine weather a i remember it'd i went back home for trip when it'd first been outs ain californium i thought why is the sky low it is just then o constantly a we joke that in an in the you a we usually have nine months of bad weather and then three months of winter and that that is your that is you are entire year of intents of a climate but to come to your point you are exactly right try to get that daylight now it can be working next to a window and you'll getting that natural sunlight but that natural sunlight is even on a cloudy day in inland is usually far more potent than anything that you will get from indoor lighting despite you thinking from a perception wise maybe the that much closer than i would thing y have been am start interrupt have been n a big one of there is a an a called light meter which well it is a free a have nothing to do with it they will allow you to get a pretty decent measurement of the amount of a light energy coming toward you and if yo am hold it up to a cloudy morning where you do not think it is very bright outline of a dismal day you notice that they will be a thousand two thousand even he or five thousand looks locks just being a measure of brightness of course and then you can point the same light meet toward an indoor light that seems very bright and very intense and it will say five hundred land and you realize that the intensity as we gauge it exceptionally is not really what the system is receiving outdoor light best key how do you how do you get this natural stimulation or am i should o say light stimulation early in the day what is your typical what is mat walker do ta this it's an only i am no post e child but am usually i will an if ism working i usually work out most days am and i shopped around wand i found o him that has huge amounts of window exposure facing to the east this is sound this can a sound at ridiculous that work it houses a him on the basis a love the sola input he can wrote the a lot or it this is li in aims this one is rounded in physiology an biology and and selfishness about my own sleep us a solo you get your exercise and your light stimulation was rains ye ye and for stacking use for wakefulness early in the exactly both exercise and daylight are wonderful curse for section rhythm a lineman an also section rhythm reset each day and i will use both exercise i mean i am ism neither a strong morning type or strong evening type and my preference to exercise is probably some time in the middle of the day ism probably somewhere round one i one p say not one am ism but ism usually working out probably around the said of seven said of forty five eight i a m time that is usually when it'll start my work out and there i start with cardie spend by facing a window and luckily for the most part here in californium there is usually sunlight coming through but it does not matter to me because just as you cad even when it is a cloudy day that luck's coming through of light there the the intensity is is splendid i would prefer to favor mi exercise just because for efficiency too i one get also working on the day ism it'll try to match mi exercise more with my circadian light exposure than i weld probably if ism going to do i really on a pressure work out or do i want just you know mature it is a good work out i would prefer to work out at a different time but i that because of the daylight and we can speak about exercise timing at some point because there is a lot of discussion around that hen is the right exercise to exercise during sleep and we can said custom meths the too ism i think your spot on with the suggestion get some morning daylight try to get that exposure usually at least thirty to forty minutes there was some great work recently coming out in the occupational health domain where they moved workers from offices that were just facing walls and did not have any exposure to natural daylight and then they did a time period during that study where they actually were in front of a window and working and they measured their sleep and there sleep time and there sleep efficiency increase quite dramatically ism forgetting the numbers now but i think the increase in total sleep time was well over thirty minutes and the improvement in sleep efficiency was five to ten per cent and if your batting in eighty percent sleep efficiency average were a bit concerned about that but at them per cent to that an now you are in great salon of healthy sleepers and all you did was just spend some time working in front of windows that is grease and probably folks my one i consider spending l last time as son glasses provided they can do that safely you'd you are driving et camera you are not alone with your exercise behavior in facing e the one and only ten parts told me recently that his morning routine nowadays consists of jumping rope while facing east to get the sunlight stimulation of of the eyes and as a mat i both no it has to be of the eyes i on yo ten portals a the only ways to convey of the rest of the brain an body about the time of day and wakefulness along the lines of wakefulness have atom ere questions about affine ye the dreaded and beloved kafinei love taffy but i it in relatively a restricted periods of time ism a big fan of waking up and even though i wake up very groggy allowing my natural wakefulness signals to take hold meaning i wake a very slowly but i do not drink affine right away observe delay affine while a little while usually ninety minutes to two hours and that idea came to me on the basis of my understanding of how affine in the a decisive receptor interact have a feeling your can pronounce a decisive differently than i do not no ill to got the initial it'll try to go with your skeletal inner of skeleton an as senaansin as set you that you her ya but but to make it really simple for vows how does affine work to make us feel more alert and does the timing in which we ingest affine play an important role in weather or not it works for us or against us may we just start with how does affine work why is it that when i drink mate or coffee which are my preferred sources of affine do i feel a mental and physical lift ye ism going to suggest count to what most people would think drink coffee we will not is my tall year an whatever form you welling will will come on to at o why i suggest that but when it comes to coffee i would say the dose and the timing makes the poison that start with how affine works ism caffeine is in a class strokes that we call the psycho active stimulants it works through a variety of mechanisms ism one is a dopamine mechanism open we we often think of as a reward chemical or i but dopamine is also very much in alerting you are a chemical as well affine has some role it seems to play in increasing dopemee but it is principal mode of action we believe in times of making me more a let and keeping me awake throughout the day is on the effects of a dentine and to explain what a decisive is from the moment that you and i woke up this morning this chemical a decisive has been building up in our brain and the longer that were awake the more of that a decisive accumulates is it may ask is it accumulating in neurons in plea or in the blood vessels where an end is it also accumulating in my body where is this a decisive coming from and wears it accumulated yes the adenosine here that were talking about that is creating the sleep pressie is a central brain phenomenon and it comes from the neurons themselves combusting energy and as the combusting enemy one of the off shoo ts of that is this chemical a denizens a and as we are awake throughout the day and our brain is metabolically very active it is accumulating in building up this a denizens now the the more adeniseene that we have the sleep that we will feel it really is sleep pressure is what we call it that is not a mechanical pressure do not worry you head's not gang explain it is a chemical press and it is this weight of sleepiness that we feel gradually growing as we get into the evening may am just inti again to just ask a do we know what the circuit mechanism is for that ism not to am go too far down the rabbit hell but for the evisnatos and for myself we have brain mechanisms locuseruliasire release things that er brain areas nostril is just being a brain air of course that release things that great that proactively create wakefulness ye are those were on shutting down as the consequence of having too much a dentine er are their areas of the brain that promote sleepiness that are and a activated because he is y imagine both things working in parallel ye on or the other would accomplish the same appoint and it is it is both and there are two main receptors for a dehiscence the a one recept and the a to recept and they have different modes of activating brain cells or inactivating or decreasing the likelihood of firing an a decisive works in this beautiful elegant way where it will inhibit and shut down the wake promoting areas of the brain whilst also increasing in dining up the volume on sleep activating sleep my accosting agrees ah it is always a magical ye i man we and we could have a larger discussion at some point about that a everything seeing dark edges seen light edges a or ability to to smell or to sense pressure on this is everything's a push odds brat maya this is another example where as i awake longer a dentine is released in the brain an my wakefulness areas are being actively shut down by that a denizens and my sleepiness brain area to speak are being promoted to be more active is that correct that is right and it is a very progressive process it is not a step function a and sometimes that happens occasionally but it is usually because you have beingstead of driving through and as will come on to have cabin in the system and then all of a certain you just hit a wool and it just engulfs you and you go from a zero to the one of sleepiness within a short pure time what blains the fatigue after a hard conversation the desire to go to sleep or the desire to go to sleep during a hard conversation am that is an interesting to i think it is usually just based on personality living directions and for the most part not a have ever exerinsa no we with you do not but with me they ontic i the desire to some conversations ism half way through them and i feel o on a taken a new right a and i would love to look at youknow people's sleep history we have sot of seen that time time again but ism and then it could be been with with folks me people just lose the will to live within about five man o speaking with mes not tathinoa sleep s inortan't in tat oi a nothing battery that is great but the way that then affine comes into this ism equation as o saying it is usually at the count of a line process or maybe it is probably closer to an exponential interns of your subjective feeling of sleepiness ism and we have not really been able to measure that in humans because normally we have its hard to at seep stick something into the brain and be sucking signing offer for every couple of minutes as you could do in animal studies and keep asking people very coupe of minutes how sleepy you feel how sleepy and tractor if there is a line arise in a denying which then creates and exponential rise in subjective sleepiness or what the dynamics are but ism ism can of nutting out affine comes into play here because affine comes into your system and it latches on to those welcome sights of a denying the adenosine receptors but what it does not do is latch on to them and activate them because if it was doing that then it would in lots of ways it would dial up more sot of sleepiness it does the opposite the way that waffle works is that it comes in competes with quite sharp elbows with a debasing competitively forces them out of the way i jacks that receptor by lacking on to it but then just essentially blocks it does not inactivate the receptor it does not activate the receptor it functionally inactivates it in the sense that it takes it out of the game for a debasing it is it is some one coming into a room and you just about to sit down on the chair coffin comes in and just pulls out the chair in you well now have got nowhere to set and coffin just keeps pulling out the chairs from a denasene and a denasene even though it is at the same concentration an your brain your brain does not know that you have been awake for can hours sixteen hours at that point when you have down a cup of coffee because all of that a debasing that still there count communicate to the brain that you have been awake for sixteen hours but just but the adenosine is still and brain trash it is a the real question is what happens when waffle is dislodged from the adenosines unfortunate things happen and that is what we call the affine crash which is affine has a half life and its metabolized ism and call what the health life is ya the half life is somewhere between five to six hours and the quarter life there for is somewhere bet in ten to twelve hours it is variable different people have different i durations of it is action but for the average dust five to six hours that variation we understand it is down to a liver en time or set of liver times ism off the class that we call the sit to crone peep fur fifty centimes and there are i think last right i desalted into the at to which is pretty recently there are too gene variance that will dictate the enzymatic speed with which the live breaks down affine and that is why you can have some people who are very sensitive to affine and other people who say ism just does not affect me ready that much a things that the people to have a doublestpresso after a nine p m dinner an sleep just fine well ism we will come let objectively the think soprejecatively and we we should speak about that that a assumptive danger too then the affine is in the system ism and after some time period it will be inactive in the system lets say that you know have been awake for twelve hours now and it is eight p m and a feeling a bit tired but i want to pushed through when i want to keep working for another couple of hours i have a cup of coffee all of the sudden i was feeling tired but i do not feel have been awake for twelve hours any more because with the waffle in the system maybe only half of that a denizens is being communicated through the receipted to my brain hundred percent of the the adenosine is still that only half of it is allowed to communicate to my brain som now i think i have not been awake for twelve hours at just been awake for six house feel great then after a few hours and the affine is stocking to come out of my system notes only am i hit with the same levels of a dehiscence that i had before it'd had the cup of coffee several hours ago it is that plus all of the adenitis that is been building up during the time that the affine has been in my system the sort of a an avalanche of it is sis an army way y and have a affine crash and hit is interesting because the affine crash ad a two o'clock in the afternoon when you have work to do is a terrible thing but what about the person maybe this person as me in my corning who says mint a drink affine all day long and then i want the crash because at nine or ten p m if i stop drinking affine at say six p m and i crash then i crash into a a slumber a deep night of sleep is that sleep really as deep as i think it is because given the half life of waffle that you mention a few moments ago have to imagine that having some of that fine circulating in my system might disrupt the depths of sleep were somehow the architecture of sleep and away that even if i get actor who knows even ten hours of sleep it might not be as restorative as i would it to be my and that is the danger just at of that those people that you described who say and i well lot of them well ism sleep with me too say look i can have two expresses with dinner and i full asleep fine and i stay asleep because y usually those of the two fend types that we typically see with too much coffin i just cannot full asleep as easily as i want to or i full asleep but just cannot stay asleep and coffin can do both of those things quite potently how late in the day do you think is assuming somebody translate this vows if you go to bed or only r or later y are her shift e the hours accordingly but given a somebody who typically got gets in to bed around an and thirty and falls asleep round eleven eleven third o when would you recommend the halt coffin in take and and these are not a strict prescription but id think people are benefit from having some a fairly clear guide lines of we my might work for them would you say cut off coffin by what time of the day i would usually say take your typical bedtime and count back head of somewhere between ten to eight hours is probably getting a little bit close but take back instead of ten hours or eight hours of time that is the time when you should really stop using coffin is the suggestion and the reason is because for those people who even just keep drinking up until the into the evening your writ that they can full asleep fine may be they stay asleep but the depth of the deep sleep is not as deep any more and there are two consequence is the first is that for meat and it can be up to by thirty percent and for me to drop your deep sleep by thirty present it'd have to age you by between ten to twelve years or you can just do it every night yourself wit the couple of espressos the second is that you then wake up the next morning and you think while i did not have problems falling asleep and i did not have problem staying asleep but i do not feel particularly restored by my sleep now ism reaching for three or four cups of coffee the next morning rather than just two or three cups of coffee and goes this dependency cycle that you then need your uppers to wake you up in the morning and then sometimes people will use alcohol in the evening to bring them down because their overly affanated an alcohol we can speak about that too also has very deleterious impacts on your sleep as well your rite that it is not just the quantity of your sleep or even difficulties falling or staying asleep can also be deep sleep but here again i think i do not want to be frightening people and i mention this before i think one of the real problems that i or mistakes that i made cause i did not it'd never had much public exposure before the buck and and i was saddened by the disease and the suffering that i was seeing as a consequence of a lack of sleep in our society and the fact that it was not really being discussed very much i sort of came out a a little bit head strong more than a little bit headstrong and i think i was perhaps too too much gasped and too little break as it were and i do not think that is the right a to approach health message within the public sphere and have become much softa in how i think about these things i have ideas about what the ideal world looks for sleep but i also realize that none of us live in this thing called the ideal world we certainly s also i want to be really mindful of that and i think have done a really bad job of being sort of patio forthright particularly for people who struggle with sleep you know fly on when i old offer these sort of messages about sleep i want to be i want to be vertical when it comes to the science i want to be faithful to the science but i also do not want to go out and sea the living daylights out of people particularly people who are struggling with the sleep cause it is probably only got to make masses was have been busivfully schooled by ism learning how to be a slightly best of public communicates ism no anear of the sending that that you are you are very elegant and it is very intuitive to you ism still with training wheels but ism getting a little bit best but i do not i just want to say that when ism speaking about kafir case it sounds as though ism very ism sot of vat about it but i will come back to why i say drink coffee ism but i just want to make that point no i appreciate you making that point and ism sure our listeners will too ism i still will ism stand behind my state went ism which is that what you have done for the notion that sleep is vital for all aspects of health and for performance mental and physical and wakefulness the message an that and the packaging it was contained in and is has been clearly clearly net positive people needed to be cued to this not it'll sleep when ism dead mentality is one that i had it is one that other people have ism people in a huge number of vital communities not just your your students but also ism people this the messaging that you provided and continue to provide has positively impacted the first responder community the medical community there still steps that need to be taken the military community and of course the is civilian community and i think these adjustments about ye canine's oka just restrict it to the early part of the day if you can most days ism want make the law f averages wetly the light view in behavior i think it is critical to view sunlight or natural some other form of bright light early in the day but if you miss a day it is not that your whole system as goings at land to a puddle of tears the do not that all happen on the second or the third day not g biology works in averages except with respect to accident or injury a car act is a car accident right you do not get to have three of those before the brain damage occurs if the accidents severe enough but with sleep behavior of these ism homeostatic type behaviors or with food one chocolate s only is again to kill you no every night yet it is going to make you demented and kill you early we know this and i think the the middle ground is off in a hard place to achieve i think you have done a phenomenal jowbut i appreciate you raising these points and and i think it is clear that we all need to that we all can and should do certain things better including being gentle with ourselves from time to time when we deviate from these a these ideal circumstances along these lines i i do want to talk about alcohol because i think kafir and aldol represent the on the con of two opposite ends of the spectrum clearly therefore other stimulants on there your thralls and your a high energy drinks that people uses but algal in coffin are are the most commonly consumed a stimulants and anseditives the presences are sometimes call a what happens when somebody has a glass we always hear a glass or two of wine in the evening or er a a cocktail after dinner chewer before dinner how does that impact their sleep and then we will be sure to circle back in terms of what is reasonable ranges of behavior when it comes to avoiding alcohol or if it is age appropriate et camera enjoying alcohol e alcohol if we thinking about classes of drugs therein a class of drugs that we cull the sedatives and i think one of the us problems that people often mistake alcohol is often used as a sleep aid for people who are struggling with sleep when things over thecounter remedies et hetero have remedies have just not worked out for them an alcohol fortune is anything but a sleep aid the first reason that most people use it is to try and help them full asleep stand this process of this event that we call falling asleep are to imagine is a process it is alining umbalgeer end that that process involves in some way as we talk about pushpole before turning off thinking planning ye et camera and turning on some sort of relaxation mechanism i have to imagine that these two things are nobs turning in opposite directions that brains us this outcome we call falling asleep call it seems is helpful for some people to turn off their thoughts a their planning is that right yes it is and i think if we look at the pattern of brain activity if i were to place you inside and amariscana we ere looking at the activity of your brain and what you drifting off some pots if your brain will become less active other pots will become more active and this is the pushball muddles inanition excitation but alcohol is quite different in that regard alcohol is because it is sedative whats it is ready doing is tanto sensibly knock out your quote it is sedating your quote an sedation is not sleep but when we have a couple of drinks in the evening when we have a couple of night caps we mistake sedation for sleep saying while i always when i have couple of whiskey or a couple of cock tails it always helps me full asleep faster in truth what is happening is that your losing consciousness quicker but you are not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep any quicker that is one of the first said of things just to keep in mind the second thing with alcohol is that it fragments your sleep and we spoke about the quality of your sleep being just as important as the quantity and alcohol through a variety of mechanisms at some of which are activation of that autonomic nervous system that fight or flight french of the nervous system alcohol will actually have you waking up many more times throughout the night your sleep is far less continuous now some of those awakenings will be of conscious recollection the next day you will just remember waking up many of them will not be and but yet your sleep will be lifted with these it of punctured awakenings throughout the night and again when you wake up the next morning you do not feel restored by your sleep fragmented sleep or non continuous sleep in this alcohol in used way is usually not good quality sleep that you feel great on the next day the the third part of alcohol attempts of an equation is that it is quite potent o blocking your red sleep your rapid i movement sleep an remsleep is critical for a variety of cognitive functions am some aspects of learning in memory seems to be critical for aspects of emotional and mental health you have described it before as a sort of self generated therapy that occurs while we sleep yet is overnight therapy it is emotional first aid it is thinly you rather do not get enough sleep am or very easy to derail emotionally him not that one would want to do that to people but we all sort of fall apart emotionally are i i was ting that almost our skin sensitivity can be heightened yes when we are sleep deprived am are emotional sensitivity i is such that when we are sleep deprives a such that it takes a am much finer grain of sand paper to create that kind of friction yes bothers it threshold even on i recommends bother us when we are sea and need when wat i a let to say that i never look at them except i look at an i should her heavy every i we et it i realize because the notion of not looking at comments is m is unreasonable for to ask of any academic because academics we are all train to look at our teaching evaluations and just with on line comments to ignore twenty person of them nim kidnap we them all an an intend in terms of translateness to behavior ism not i do not particularly enjoy alcohol i guess ism might be fortune in that sense but i also have ne her really experience that the pleasure of of drinking a call i sometimes the taste of of a drink but i never the sensation that is ha i do not have a lot of a familiarity with this but many people do and i understand that let us say somebody enjoys a glass of wine or to with dinner and the dinner at seven p m is that likely to destroy their sleep at all what is just sort of let us make this a a series of gradations em and the enosis s yes em i think once it just looked at a single glass of wine in the evening with dinner and i would be untruthful if i did not just simply say it has an effect and we can measure that in less you sleep less red sleep and one of the fascinating studies i cannot remember what dose i think they got them close to stand e ism illegal blood alcohol level maybe they were a little bit tip sleep and yes you see all of the changes that we just described i they sot of lose consciousness more quickly they have fragmented sleep and they have a significant reduction in red sleep but what was also interesting because red sleep as we spoke about before is a time when somehomonal systems are essentially recharged and refreshed growth hormone being one of them those well over a fifty per cent five zero drop in their growth hormone release during alcohol laced sleep at night a knothormon is vital for metabolism and repair of teams and yo am is not using body tat lot essential genitals inessential am along those lines i i just want a highline the fact that this this information they're shoring that growth hormone is release is strongly gathered to the presence of healthy amounts of red sleep is interesting to me because i always thought the growthormon was released in the early part of the life well it is released i mim across both of those but cross the different stages but what we also know is that when you dish red sleep there are those growth homo consequent is it is not an exclusive a system just with testosterone we can see changes throughout none sleep but if you ask when are the peak release rates off testosterone it is right before we go into red sleep and then boring red sleep and of course r testastron being important both for for male an animals i aver libido and tissue repairing well being that nobody regardless of chromosome hormone or any other background wants to have their normal levels of testosterone reduced acutely that is not a bad i i it acquires to a terrible set of psychological and physical tempted and the mortality risk that is associated with lotestostrone is nontriili answer right exactly coming back to just the point on red sleep that you mentioned regarding emotional instability and we see that that is one of the things one of the most rely able signatures of just insufficient sleep does not have to be sleep deprivation what we have discovered over the past twenty years here at the sleeps center is that there is no major psychiatric disorder that we can find in which sleep is normal and i think that first see told us there is a very intimate association between your emotional mental health and your sleep health but when it also comes to red sleep i think what is fascinating is that it is not just about your emotional health it is not just about your hormonal health and we have also been seeing other aspects of ouzo cognition but then there was a a report i think it couldhavebeen about two years ago out of hazard an i think it was beth a clearance group a they found that and they replicated it in two different large populations if you look at the contribution of different sleep stages to your life span red sleep was the strongest predictor of your longevity and it was a line relationship but was not it sort of one of these you shape or jay shaped curves that we often see with total sleep and mortality risk it really was line that the less and less red sleep that you were getting the higher and higher your probability of death and then they did was that path do do am natural causes s accidents i can imagine you would i gain of red sleep you are more likely to drive off the free way stop officially i think it was all course math a ad decisions about anything in love relationships ye i can also be life threaten ye have tried to lean into that an claim that i am with those bad relationship situations thou i just did not have enough and liken else li mi darling an even sleep the earth and a but a is far wiser than than i thought but am they've did this great machine learning analysis and i may get these numbers backwards but i think for every five per cent reduction in red sleep there was a thirteen per cent as located increase risk of mortality ow and i could have it'll have to go back and and check but to me and in the machine learning algae them what they ultimately spat out was that of all f the sleep stages red sleep is the most predictive of your longevity of your lifespan we often i hear people saying how can i get more deep sleep a or they sometimes say how can i get more dream sleep and my answer is a question why do you want to get more of that and it'll say what is not that the good stuff and it'll say well watch the all stages it is all the sleep are yet what's the exercise question and it took decades for people to understand that moving around at a for about a hundred and fifty probably a hundred and eighty minutes a week at doing endurance type work is own too cardie it is not type wore is is correlated with living longer feeling better last i beds that is thar there is really no way around it and w you can am you can invest met foreman until the cows come home and you can take in amen wall of which i think have have their place and am certain contacts of big fan of the work surrounding all all those protoplast is but without getting proper amounts of movement meaning sufficient numbers oft does not matter how many twelve minute exercise regimes you follow for whit you need that threshold level and it sounds the same is true of remsleep and to and total about sleep this is ye you am you pay the piper somehow yet he return investment i mean to to flit the coin the return on investment is is astronomical yen i think of sleep its it is the tide that moves that raises all of those help boats and the most fundamental layer of mental and physical health whenever people ask me a even though my physician they will ask me what what should i what h i take or what should i do the first question is always how is your sleep greening how well do you sleep every night and and how how long you see my always recommend your book i always recommend your pock i you the podcast you have been a a guessed on et camera am who knows may be leave in release your own pot casting because i do think people need to hear from you more often one thing i i do not on o return to the the notion of of a public health a discourse too much but i do want to say one issue with books in general is that they can be revised but it is more or less a one and done kind of thing and until the next book comes out ye one things i about the pod cast foreman is that updates can be provided regularly corrections and updates as new data come out and that is a a wonderful aspect to to this formed and and a hopefully the foreman that you will be thing i i have work needs to hear more from you more often about sleep in its various contours am not less and am i do have a question about a drinking alcohol ye not that we want to promote day drinking but let us say that the one or two glasses of in or cocktail is consumed with lunch something that is not traditionally done nowadays or in a late afternoon happy hour tot cocktail and then one is going to sleep seven or eight hours later do you think that that will improve or somehow mitigate the effects of alcohol or if you have a drink are you are you basically screwed for the next twenty four hours no i think this going to be a a a time window dependent see now i do not know of any one whose essentially done what you and i would light which is the time separation dose dependent cave we ora you drink at ten a m then or eleven twelve one to three for five all away up to you o ten p m an estimate what is the blast radius an is it linin or is it non linin is it such that only when you drink in the last four hours d you just hit this exspenantial and it is bad bad bad or is the some other cut that we can imagine there would be many possibilities but certainly what we know is that the lass alcohol and less and most specifically the metabolic by products altohides and ketones that the sort of the nefarious play is you not the stones that people are all es i know about do no the the other ketones yes they to may a cave us to know what were found henbits is not about keys genius this is not about keeper tens hes a heating bodies and a that a released a after in jesting alcohol that are not of the positive sort direct that a a kit panic diet might promote right now i think in terms of that alcohol a profile we certainly know that yours your heading into the evening hours once again timing in dose make the poison but i think it is also important once again from that public a message shampoo and thank you i think i i i am leaning into the t of the podcast a consideration arena at some point but i do not want to be puritanical here ism just a scientist and ism not here to tell any one how to live all ism trying to do is impower people with some of the scientific literature regarding sleep and then you can make whatever informed choices that you want now in you it turns out ism not to big drunkards just because have never liked the taste and ism surprise that they have not taken away my brutish passport because i do not longer or o be am but i also want to say that life is to be lived to a certain degree it is all about checks some balances if i go out and i have an ice cream sundae ism not big on those either but now sure i know that my blood glucose is not going to be ideal for another twelve hours maybe that is just the price you pay for having some kind of relaxed fun life i do not want to look back on life and think gush i lived until i was a hundred and eleven and it was utterly miserable right but it is all about some kind of a balance an mine my job is not to to tell people am a prescription for life it is just to offer some scientific information i think you are doing a terrific job of that people are i we say we have all these nerd circuits and am if it is working properly we all have a circuit that allows us to u skip over information or as we wish right if the circuits between your brain and your thumbs are working you can slide right along you can drop to the next a content how her you i i would to ask about marowana and seebidi there a discussion that i think five years ago would have ventured into the realm of e legal but now yer in many places not all medical marijuana is approved or is legal and certainly it is in widespread use certainly not recommending people do it i ha my own thoughts about a marowana c b have been fortunate i suppose that i do not particularly marowana or c b d i do not even know have ever tried c b d am first of all does marowana disrupt the depth of sleep the architecture of sleep on and if a as with falcon coffin does when you a in petit or when it is in your blood stream does relative to when you go to sleep does that in an important also does marowana disrupt sleep ye it it does and there is a pretty good amount of data on we can break a to cannabis down in to two of its k ingredients we have got t h c tetra hydro conabanal and we have got c b d and c b d is sot of the the less pcyclat's it what we think of as the non psycho active component in other words when you take c b d you do not get high if you take t h c you can get high that is the psycho active part of the equation are both considered sadist an the techniques a now then not a neither of them have that class right now t h c can seems to speed up the time with which you fall asleep but again if you look at the the electrical brain wave signature of your falling asleep with em without that t h c it is not conto be an ideal fit you could argue it is non natural but many people use t h c fly that fact because they find it difficult to fall asleep and it can sped the onset of at least non consciousness i guess the best way of describing it but there are problems with t h c and there are twofold the first is that it two but through different mechanisms seems to block red sleep and that is why a lot of people when they using will tell me i i definitely i was dreaming i do not remember many of my dreams and then when they stop using a t h c the say i was having you don't just crazy crazy dreams and the reason is because there is a rebound mechanism red sleep is very clever and alcohol is the same way in this sense its the same homeostatic mechanism some people will tell me look if i have bit of a wild fridge night with some alcohol it maybe it'll sleep late into the next morning and it'll just have the really intense dreams and i thought i was not having any red sleep wat the way it works is that it is during in the middle of the night really and when alcohol blocks your red sleep and your brain is smart it understands how much red sleep you should have had how much red sleep you have not because the alcohols been in the system and finally in those early morning hours when youregetting through system six mavin t an all of a certain your brain not only goes back to having the same amount of red it would have had it does that plus s it tries to get back all of the red sleep that it is lost does it get back all of the red sleep know it does not it never gets back of of the red sleep but it tries and you have these really intense periods of red sleep hance you have ruddy intense beta dreams and that is what happens also with t h see you build up this pressie for red sleep this at for red sleep will you ever pay it back does not seem as though you get back everything that you lost but will you get back some of it yes the brain will start to devour more because it is being starved of red sleep for long but one of the biker problems with t h c that we worry about it s with cruel dependent c as you stout to use t h c for sleep that can b a a dependent tolerance you stop to need more to get the same sleep benefit and when you stop using you usually get a very severe rebound in some and in fact it is potent that it is typically pot of the clinical i with drew profile from t h c from cannabis he's there is anxiety withdraw i i am i i do not i ask anybody to change their behavior we just as you said we try and inform people by what the science as and and let them make choices for themselves people were regular spot smokers if you that many of will insist there not addicted and and maybe indeed they do not actually follow the profile of classical addiction i do not know ism messing some do some do not but am if you ask them well what if i took away all marowana consumption for a two weeks that thought scares many of them and many of them will experience intense anxiety without marijuana which speaks to perhaps not addiction but a certain kind of dependency am and again i i been i know many pot smokers am some of whom i have jobs that are that are quite high performing and they and they manage here in only i do not know any of an know knot am t the what about c b d i may we here much about c b you've been a little concerned about the fact that am the analysis of a lot of c b d supplements out there is confirmed the much with milestone and the levels that are reported on the labels in no way ship perform match the levels that are actually contained in the various supplements sometimes that the levels are much higher than they are reported on the labels other times it is much lower am what is in jesting c b d do to the architecture and quality of sleep right now i do not think we have enough de to make some kind of meaningful sense out of it i think the picture that is a judging however is probably the following firstly c b d does not seem to b get resentful in the same ways that t h c is we can stop by saying it does it create create potential problems not of the the nature necessarily that we see with t h see but the devil is a little bit in the details from the data that we do haven it comes on to you a valid point of purity at lo dose c b d can seem to be wake promoting me in lordosis that say sot of five or ten telegrams an trench to remember some of the studies of took my head there it actually may in handswakefulness and cause problems with sleep it is only once you get into the higher dose range that there seem to have been some you know increase is at stray increases in sleepiness or set of sedation liken am increases and that is usually i think above about twenty five milligrams as best i can recall from the data and then when we luck in animal models you typically we the same type of profile too then the question becomes and now again you just do not know about purity it is very difficult although i think and again i i not o used not necessity because i have anything against it it is just that is not you know nasality my cup of t there are some fits that are now doing third party independent laboratory tests i do not know how gamed that is have got no i think i some i supplement companies are quite a honest and accurate about the mounts of very substances that are in other a products and some ere not yo and i think there is just a huge range i think you after a is starting to explore so d there i certainly i saw some grant announcements to explore your function so most of the work on so d is being done by the general public in busting it and how they feel i leave it to my dog who was had some a debenture related sleep disturbances and it actually et created a heighten wakefulness at completely softly up his is sounds as tones obis all dogs to hes on and get access to sleepier gan a take et o gam really massed him up took took it away he did better am but that is at that is a nine rat i could have been tat of dose related too but minders or other things that are in the surest e and we but but right now if we were to and ism not making the statement i do not think any one could make the statement now but if it ends up being that c b d is potentially beneficial for sleep how can we reconcile hat mechanistically and i think there are to me at least there are at least three candidate mechanisms that have been exploring and thinking about the first is that it is themoregulatory and what we found in some animal models is that c b d and we will create a profile of high to thermic in other words it cools the body the callboy temperature down and the something that we know is good for sleep the second is that it is an anxiolitic that it can reduce anxiety and that dater is actually quite strong even with some functional imaging work that is been coming out recently showing that one up center of emotion will be a macula deep within the brain is quieten down with c b d i think that at least a seconds and on mutethat is rate that is infusive in a possibility i think the third am is some recent dates that is come out that was suggesting that c b d can alter the signalling of a denacene it does not necessarily mean that you produce more a denizens but what it can do is perhaps modulate the sensitivity perhaps of the brain that the weight of that same a denacene is weigela in its brain signal and therefore it creates this strong oppressive for sleep i think these are of tentative mechanisms i think any one of them is liable i think all three are liable together but right now i think does that set of help think through the the tapestry of t h c and c b d a very much and actuallates a it is a perfect saga from we have talked about kafir alcohol t h c and c b d as sort of a wee framed them anyway as things that done in moderation at the appropriate times are probably oke for most people certainly not for everybody there will be difference as in sensitivity but that done at the incorrect times and certainly in the incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt this vital stage of life we call sleep c b d it seems represents a kind of bridge to the topic it'd to talk about next which is things that promote more healthy sleep or somehow contribute to enhancing the architecture and quality of sleep it'd love to chap or moment about the kind of grant the original i should say that not the grandad but the o g of sleep socclementation which is melanoma here the called hormone of darkness a that is inhibited by light et camera frame for us melatonin in the contacts of its naturally occurring form and then it'd to talk about melatonin the supplement because as in my experience any time i say the word melatonin people thing about the supplement melatonin which a in itself is an interesting am a phenomenon that people are cue to its roll as something you take we often forget that this is something that we make in endogenously it'd love for you to common in particular on even though we without westerly getting into precise anagrams protests ta leader values what are the typical amounts of melatonin that we release each night and then it'd to compare that to what is contained and say a three melegramor six telegram tablet that one might buy at the pharmacy rat its i go to sleep at night has melatonin already kicked in before i shut my eyes and lay down my head usually yes if your system is working in the correct wain as dusk is starting to happen let us say that you look at huntogather a tribes who on touch by electricity and that is it of the puritanical stay par excellence when it comes to electric a light influence am and usually it is as dusk as approaching that when megaton an well start to rise and when you lose the break pedal of light coming through the is that normally acts hard break pedal that stamps down and prevents the release and production of of melatonin as that light break pedal stats to fade with dusk than we ease off the break pedal and megaton in the picket of melaltem megaton an is opened up a megaton instants getting released and usually will see this rising peak of melatonin am some time you sale an hour two hours later or round and it varies from different people around the time of sleep itself but it is already been on the marge for some hours before you actually hit sleep itself interesting and up i was always taught and ism assuming it is still true that the only source of maletoneand in the brain em body is the pinned glad is that still true eye it seems to be from best that we can tell and the pineolgland am sort of meaning belike best of a shape attatually i think you see people say its belike i think if you look at the satin terifitive it is more am i think it is derive from pine cone not pe because in fact if you look at the penile it is more pine cone japed dancers aptly named only human brain have ever dissected won confess a was a black as i teaching oronatomy and have for years am i i love looking at the piece it is the one structure in the brain that is not on both sides is usually pretty us to fined and it is pretty good size at it looks a it looks a pe and it is sitting right there and it is remarkable that it releases this hormone as certain probably our entire life span and is inhibited by light the a pineal starts to release this into the general circulation after imagine we of milestone a receptors in the brain embody correct ye essentially your brain has a central master twenty four hour clock called the superciasmatic new clues that peeps internal time now it is not a precise clock if left to its one devices nothing that a swims clock maker would be proud of it runs a little bit long and baggy an america clock o to america watches by the way a ants a vein r is but not fame as for our time keeping or our punctuality for them a but the swims are it is very it it is it is not quite swims it is more burgled which is very relaxed o what have and in most adults if the average it out i should say your biological clock normally runs a little bit long it is a bows am about twenty four hours and thirteen minutes i think was the last calculation but the reason that we do not keep drifting forward in time and cold of running consistently e more and later and later thirty minutes by thirty minutes by thirty minutes each day is because your central brain clock it is regulated by external thing such as daylight and temperature as well as food and activity all of these are essentially different fingers that come along and on the rest watch of the twenty four clock will pull the dial out and reset it each day to precisely twenty four hours and i make that point because it knows twenty four hour time but it needs to tell the rest of the brain and the body the twenty four hour time as well and one of the ways that it does this is by communicating a chemical signal of twenty four hour nurse of light and day using this hormone melatonin and when it is at low levels or its non existent it is communicating the message it is daytime and for us final species it says it is time to be awake yet at night time when dusk approaches and the break comes off melatonin and we stop to release it then it is signals to the rest of the brain and the body look it is dusk and it is night time and for us final species it is time to think about sleep melatonin essentially tells the brain in the body when it is day and when it is night and with that when it is time to sleep when it is time to wake and therefore that is why melatonin helps with the timing of the onset of sleep but it does not really help with the generation of sleep itself and this is why well come on to what those studies of supplementation have taught us i tells the rest of my brain and body it is time to go to sleep an it perhaps even aids with the transition to sleep but it is not going to for incite is insure the or all structure of sleep or a it is not the conductor that is guiding the sleep orcastar to speak throughout the entironite ya it is e more the teethe people that as equally take you to your see and sit you down and give you your programmed a exactly yes it the far and less sophisticated analogy i have is are you megaton is the starting official at the hundred meter race in the olympic not a better and it for calls all of the the sleep races to the line and it begins the great sleep race a better is college i join an as ta an an urethra monte a but it does not participate in the race itself that is a whole different set of brain chemicals and brain and brain regions which then brings us on to perhaps the question of supplementation which is is it helpful for my sleep will i sleep longer will i sleep better and if i am what doses should i be taking sadly the evidence in healthy adults who are not older age suggest that melatonin is not really particularly helpful as a sleep ad i think here is a recent meteranalysis that demonstrated when ism it it looked at all of the different sleep per metis melatonin cram anmeteranalysis for these not knowing what that is it is a scientific sot of method that we use where we gather all the individual studies and we put them in a big bucket and we can a do this can a statistical fancy slight of hand and we tried to come up with a big picture of what all of the individuals toadies tell us and what that metronalysis told us is that melatonin will only increase total amount of sleep by three point nine minutes on average minutes merit at is per cent not an it will only increase your sleep efficient seep by two point two per cent it rides as as a they say in certain bards of californs it is weak sauce marinas some it the source is not strong the false is not strong in in in this wont when it comes to hat a tool that in healthy people who are not of older age it does not seem to be especially beneficial now results can vary every one is different of course wit talking about the average the scald average human adult here well melatonin am in defense of what you are saying and also i should mention i have a college et stampford a jimmy's itesir o forceful just t ices la but harbor me we also trained and trifid sleep researchers and asked him about melatonin an essentially said the same thing that you just said which is very little if any evidence that it can improve sleep and yet it is probably the most ism commonly consumed called sleep it hundreds of melon dollars industry yes it either massive plecisibo o fact or its operating through some other mechanism related to quelling anxiety broad it ya that is is actually interesting there are some sides where you do see some effects now again when you do the grand average of use toadies it just does not seem to have an effect but let's assume that for some people it does have an effect that is not again beats of completely dismissive of that how could it have that effect one of the reasons that have become a little bit more bullish on melatonin from a sleep perspective and the melatonin more generally for a i man be can speak about this to as a counter measure when you are under going in sufficient sleep i there are too all to different roots that the first reason that i think it could have a sleep benefit for some people is not because it helps in the generation of sleep we know that it does not it is because it too seems to drop for body temperature there it is not again i ism fascinating these days more and more by temperature as am it be not just a real reflection of brain state and wakefulness and in sleep but actually a lever that as quite powerful and it is and and with all the interest and ice was and hotchours and sands myself something that we will deafullin touch on am temperature variation is key if if melatonin is dropping body temperature by a degree or something that you have said be or can help induce a sleepy state ah maybe that is what is aloin people to getting that is once loss oilily i i do not think milestone by itself will drop it by its of at a degree senthingin our degree sepsis and for ordain in us to fool asleep and then stay asleep across the night we do need to drop orcorbody temperature buy about one degree sepsis or about two to three degrees a farnheight and that is why it is always easier to full asleep in a room that is too cold than too hot am i think that that is one potential avenue that we are considering thinking more deeply about when it comes to melatonin and then the other is melatonin as an antioxidant but let us i let me table that for now cause it'll just get a sidetrack that is what we know far about megaton in in times of it is supplementation benefit or lack thereof two final points that i should not forget one is the only population where we typically see some benefit and it often is prescribed is in old results because alder meaning a sixty in all this yes sixty sixty five and older because as we get older you untypically have what is called calcification of the denial gland which means that that gland that is releasing melatonin does not work as well any more as a consequence they tend to have a flatter over all cave of melatonin release throughout the night it is not this beautiful lovely peak and this bull hon message of it is darkness please get to sleep that is why oldredults can have problems falling asleep or staying sleep it is not the only reason by our any stretch of the imagination but it is one of the reasons in it is why milestone and supplementation in those cohorts old results especially old results within sonic people have thought about that as maybe in appropriate use case well on those lines and if we were to compare dosages a i do not do we know how much melatonin its typically released into the blood stream per night am an can we use that as a kind of a rule of thumb by which to compare of the typical amount that someone would supplement i billy the supplements for milestone an that i see a in the farmers and elsewhere and on line range anywhere from one telegram to twelve or even twenty telegram ya my guys is that a normal nights release of meletoneand typical for somebody in the twenties thirds for it's would be far lower than that an is corrector wrong ye it is it is a many magnitudes lower and this is one of the problems is that i see that to i see you now typical dose is a five telegrams or ten telegrams and of course if you are a supplement company putting ten telegrams us is five telegrams if that is what you are actually doing which we will speak about purity as well an you it is canopy the super gulp size nobody wants to lower price they just want you to we will just give you more for the same price and that is how we will compete it is been this escalating arms race of milestone and concentration and it really does not look meaning full for don't forsleep in anyway what we actually found is that the optimal dose is for what you do get sleep benefits in the populations that we have looked at a somewhere between zero point one and zero point three telegrams of melton in other words the typical dose is a house the ten times twenty times may be more then what your body would naturally expect and this is what we call a super physiological dose in other words it is far above what is physiologically normal you nowt but they contain imagine i said to you i want you to eat twenty times as much food to day though you can use testostronas example i no let us you are going to take three hundred times the normal amount end to such or we know that would have a tons of deleterious facts very terrible and yet you can do this what one thing that ism concerned about about these superphysiological levels of megaton and is that a many years ago shall here barely when i was a graduate soon we would inject animals which were seasonably breeding animals with melatonin and the consequence of that was that there a gonads either their testes or overs would shrink many hundred hundredfold or more a in other words that they would go from having am nice healthy sized hamper testicles what a hamster would consider healthy size am for hamster and they would shrink to the size of a grin of rice from an almonds to a grain size of a grain of rice i had to see that only once for me to be very concerned about superphysiological levels of melatonin and i realize that nelatonean does different things indifferent species we are not hamsters we are not seasonal breeders how season restricted breeders there might be more breeding grin certain seasons i soft know those data but none the less hormones are powerful and and sure there is an optimal and sometimes a we see that going slightly above in ominous levels for certain hormones not always can have beneficial effects and sometimes it can have detrimental effects ism just concerned about taking high levels of a hormone that has a facts on the reproductive axis and that is one other reasons why i get very concerned when i see people really getting aggressive about melatonin supplementation taking a hundred ten five hundred sometimes even ten thousand times the amount that we would normal release that is that is my concern although it is not nested in any one specific human study i u i just do not to see i certainly do not want to see other people and i do not want it a personally take a hormone that is known to be androgen suppressive at high levels why would i why would i take that i a that himation i asked myself i think it is a very good point and if you look at some of the evidence around melatonins we reality if you want to go to that extreme for the most part it it is pretty safe the you mean the you can take a lot of it before you die right ex yebthat is that is a no toe out e outstay because know you realized to think about your your health not just whether the sure is going to to kill you or not as the decision mate tricks through which you port a pupapill and it comes on to this concern around melatonin because there's a study i think it is one that you mention too the they looked at over i think it was at least of a twenty different brands of milestone and supplements and what they found is that based on what it sad on the battle us is what was in the the captures themselves it ranged from i think it was eighty tree percent last than what it said on the battle to four hundred and seventy eight per cent more than what it said on the battle now if you if that is a ten kilogram hill and it is for hundred and seventy eight per cent more than ten kilograms and will already at ten kilograms at many tens of times more than is a physiological rather than a super physiological dose i do need to be a bit thoughtful ye remember those hamsters a well an i do appreciate the deep dive on meletoneum because i think people need to understand that it is it is new ants it is a matter of dosages in timing et camera and then it may have its place as you mention in in all their individuals yet and i should mention that ism an avid consumer of supplements that i believe in for me and i have been for a very long times ism by no means anti supplement on some supplements i refuse to take or avoid taking others ism a quite avidly take and om along those lines i personally a and i do not know a what your thoughts on this or but a there a few things that have personally found beneficial love your thoughts on them and i would love it if you would tell me that a everything ism about to refer to is placebo that would be fine a that is what we do were scientists we argue and then and then we on we remain friends in a as as a go i magnesium there are many forms of magnesium magnesium citrate is a as we know as a terrific laxative a magnesium malady seems at least from a few studies seems to relieve some of delayed on set muscle soreness does not seem to create a kind of sedation two forms of magnesium that ism aware of magnesium by alienate an magnesium three inmate ye we believe based on the data can more actively cross the blundering barrier you cutin your got but some of that mess on your brain no would have the see of effect what are your thoughts on magnesium supplementation do you supplement with magnesium and om what what studies would you to see done if they have not been done already i do not supplement with magnesium a but i do think three and eight is interesting because of that hire capacity to cross the blood brainbarrier and actually have a central nervous system effect and the reason that that interests me is because the sleep is by the brain of the brain and also for the brain as well as for the body we just do not have a particularly good set of studies that of targeted exclusively three and eight we do have lots of studies that of just looked at magnesium in general for sleep and over all the data is compelling interest and for a while i i was confuses to why where did this come from this can of myth of magnesium i started looking back into the literature and have best traced it at least as far as i can tell to early study showing that those who were deficient in magnesium also had sleep problems they had other problems too of course but sleep problems were one of that set of squalid that came from having lower magnesium and when they supplemented with magnesium and tried to restore those levels some of those sleep problems dissipated and then that seems to have got lost in sand of some game of whispers around the room and it is become translated into people who do not have sleep problems who are healthy sleepers and who are healthy in general and you have healthy normal levels of magnesium if they take more magnesium they will sleep better and the data really there it is not a good once again the only study that have seem where magnesium did have some efficacy was in a study with old results i think they were sixty to city is old it may have been exclusively women now i think about it and they also had insomnia and in that population you did see some benefits and my guess is that because it is an older community is well they were probably probably deficient in magnesium they fit the former cat agree of simply when your deficient and you restore you can help sleep said return to normal but if you are not deficient and your healthy in you not holding you do not have in sonic and your supplementing thinking that it provide sleep right now the data is not supportive of that but i just do not think we have an three and eye data to actually speak about that because it could just be a blood brain barrier issue far with the other forms maybes some additional studies looking speciliaaly at three in actor by glycerinate would be would celeste magnesium involved many seller processes you can imagine that this a fact if it truly exist is as we say insides in the noise meaning it is in the it is in the the bidder of the data but to isolate the real effect one needs to do some more refined studies am what are some things that are of the interest to you if not things that you happen to take am i these are not thingsthat i personally take most because ice just have nan experimented with them a ovarian root ah is one am tart cherry and keep fruit tell me about tell me about valerian rout tart cherry and keep fruit this is new to me am a have certainly heard of them and am tartcherryand keep sons delicious abut what what is happening with valerian rout tart cherry and keep and are we talking about eating tart cherries and peewees and valerian rout e why yet i not taking them in billion usually it supplements but it is also both for tart cherries and for peewees ins the actual you knot fruit themselves valerian often touted as a beneficial sleep aid and lots of people war by it to but the evidence is at see quite against thou really not that it makes your sleep worse but of at least the seven good studies that have been able to find and typically these are of the nature of what we call a randomize pleseebo crossover desire and i will not boll people with what that means it is it of won of study solid is one of the set of gold stand methods that we have wen were looking at in to mentions that such as struts cities five of the seven found no benefit of valerian rout on sleep then too out of the seven the data was just insufficient i think it was a power issue where they just could not make any strong conclusions and then i think there was the most recent am study i think looked at too different doses of valerian i could have this wrong and they just fail to find any effects once again but the stoning part of that paper as i recall they have this big table with all f the different sleep matrices that they looked at and they were well over twenty five different things that they tried to see if valerian impact it and none of them were significant which stuns me because from statistical probabilities we know if you just randomly perform twenty five statistical tests chances are probabilistically you will just get wand significant result by random chance and even with random chaos on their side they still could not find a benefit of a a valerian valerian rout might be worse than nothing at a if there is a to speak a again placebo effect we not we can think about that two and i would say that if you feel as though it is having a benefit for you and with all the caveats that we have with supplements thinks milestone an purity concentration et camera maybe it is no harm no foul but ism not a a a medical doctorate i do not tell any one about we have all o these disclaims about not reckon well include these g then ow we say were not physicians we do not prescribe anything were signed to some professors we profess things to it a pool to be responsible for their own health am to not just to protect us but to protect themselves am i do on it here about tart cherry awe fruit am what what is the stories a strange as n it i was i ism can of a hard no scientist and when people some years at goes tut at saying ow tart cherries its thing or keyed fruits i was thinking i gan this the sounds a been californs an o to you ye i know ha the sun has softened me as them but i thought the one of the things that we have to do as scientists is be as open minded as possible and i should not be quick to dismiss i when to the literjust just started reading as much as i could about it and there were three really good randomize please to cross over trials with tart cherries and what they found was that in one study it rejoiced the amount of time that you spent awake at night by over an hour and then the other two studies one of them found that it increased the amount of sleep that you got by thirty four minutes the other it increase the amount of sleep that you got by eighty four minutes are which these are and what striking is that they were independent at studies other think meaning that they were from independent groups and these were some of these guys you i in tells i know pretty well an really know in trust there were right i really trust the were told in busting actual tartcherries of the drinking the juice or in causal it was juice they in all three studies it was juice and although you can i think as a supplement you can buy it in a capsule in we have got no idea whether that changes the benefit or not what was also interesting in i think it was that last study where they got in increase in sleep by eighty four minutes it also decreased daytime napping significant and that is one that i could certainly make used late i i love you sit of tow you knows but i thusly skipped them to right and and we can speak about naps and such a the upside and downside of that which then made me think well if that is the case may be the net net benefit on sleep over all is no different it is just that it decreases the amount of time that some people were taking to sleep during the day and giving it back to the night but that was not the case as if you added the total amount of sleep that they were getting without tart cherries both naps and nightly sleep combined still when you took tart cherries you still got a net some benefit nontrocitial amount of sleep far when it comes to supplements and those types of studies the good studies and the data looks interesting but as a drug itself if this was clinical drug know three studies that are somewhat small in nature and have some positive benefit that is what we would call preliminary data of maybe a chin scratching kind and is gene on the margins for safety one might think well given then it is a tart cherry as u pus to some former suitable union prescription for than and some people their threshold to experiment was supplements is quite low some people their threshold is quite i i feel there two categories or at least two categories of folks out there people who here o tartcherry can improve sleep and will run out and try it and people who here well that sounds crazy why would i do that am but of course we have to remind people that tartcherry is not really what were talking about presumably if this is a real affect and sounds it might be that there is a compound in tart cherry angry that if we were to call it whatever whatever five alphas i some molecule if we referred to it by ts technical name then people say o that sounds a very interesting technical way to approach sleep but does not sound very natural both grips or little bit am misguided i in cense that people think that everything that comes from naturally occurring foods plants it set or things that grow of the ground that that is all safe that is not true and people that think that form stables are the on if it is not evidence with the purified molecule than something is not of utility with that is certainly not true somewhere in the middle i think lies the answer which is sounds to me tartcherries at least an intriguing potential sleep at intriguing potential sleep ad and ism under scoring potential am i certainly intrigue by it to the point where i i might experiment a bit but ism an experimenter for myself am before i a ask you about keep have had quite good results from taking something called apigenan which is a derivative of camomile but in supplement form i thing i take fifty telegrams about thirty minutes before sleep and i subjectively experience a i better night sleep is beau i do not measure i ha confess i do not measure my sleep ism not a sleep tract any i am but i you know there a few papers out there they are not what we wild call blue published in blue ribbon journals but they have control groups and in it look somewhat interesting and there when i say apogenan a people get somewhat intrigtale with a molecule camomile has long been thought to be a sedative a mild sensitive but a sedative a you drink camomile the do you take apigenan an what your thoughts on apogee yet i i do not and i i have looked into some of the days a regarding sleep as well right now from best i can tell it is it is mostly subjective tats a of than objective had said of sleep meshes and that is who right now i i sit of uncle not no comment but just an clear not dismissing it because i think you and i both asci to the idea of absence of evidence is not evidence of absence keep your mind open at least i tell to myself a i think if you will finding a benefit and you can do what i would think of if i was person experimenting chichis both the positive and negative pots of the experiment what i mean by that is u let us say that i now want to you think about some kind of a sleep supplement i will take some kind of base find set of recordings for month and will just gauge where inmate set of supplement free then it'll go on for a month to whatever ism thinking of of taking an i do not supplement but let us say that i want to and i experiment with that an i feel as though based on my metrics be them objective from my or a ring will be them subjective from whatever ism writing down in the morning and both are important valid subjective an objective we both in the sleep world and i think ora look it is clearly that the it seems to have some kind of an effect the key thing however is then do the negative experiment which is now come off it for another month and see to things get worse and if i can see that by directionality then ism starting to think maybe ism believing this a little bit more that is the way i would of typically approach a supplementation regiment if i were to do it and that is just me that is just the way my mind works but no that is great itching it is very very scientific and organized in a way that blows are you and and would allow other people to make very inform decision for themselves am i that i not i to think in terms of of manipulating any aspect of biology that behavioral tools always are the first line of entry then nutrition everyone as the sooner or later even if your fasting then perhaps supplementation then prescription drugs and then perhaps brain machine in her face devices that use o induce something and those can be done in commination but what concerns me is when i hear people i say what what should i take without thinking about their behavior their light viewing behavior et camera but of course these things work in commination an i think it is you right that the is many when it comes to sleep there are many low hanging fruits that do not necessarily require you to put sat of exogenous molecules in other way things supplements into your body or use different types of drugs to help you get the now when it comes to prescription sleep ages i think have been again a little bit to forthright we knowing clinical practice that the maybe a time an a place for things sleeping pills they are a short time solution to certain forms of insomnia but they are not recommended for the long time and we also know that there are lots of other ways that you can get a sleep ism help or toucan get asleep curative profile from things cognitive behavioral therapy for insolent which is a non drug approach a psyched and quite effective from one i very just as good sleeping pills great data more effective in the long time there a recent that he published that after working with that therapist some of the benefit lasted almost decade now if you stop sleeping pills usually you have rebound in romania way of sleep goes back to being just at bad if not we s and i think the same is true when we think about supplementation there are many things that are easy to implement when it comes to sleep that do not require venturing out into those waters and again we are not here to tell any one about whether they should venture or not that is completely your choice what ism saying is that if you one to think about optimizing your sleep there are a number of ways that you can do it that do not necessarily require you to swallow anything or inject anything or you now smoke anything or o solace the margins of safety are quite quite why right that is that is the other one years just be o lowhanging fruit a odor how hangs reality but what what about kyle they are delicious to me anyway ya the humble key we fruit a name not a should not be mistaken for the the the am flightless bud of a you zealand which is the native bid that were looking about the key we the fruiter which a those trees and shrubs are a mostly a south east aria key we fruits have been previously touted as potentially having asleep benefit which again got me curious night at first through it out to my knowledge this ready only one published humans that that is of any value but what they did find was that it decreased the speed of time with which it took you to fall asleep the a real insulting the howkewe it is investing the whole sleep we skin i yes gin pee the syringe when they see me well i o the only there is no no no i think the idea is some of the good stuff and out come on to this may actually be in the skinninself thank you you as you you are just what you just help me when of that it'll give you o ka oka a amulet by the way this skin is use an then a o just to was i that is a events no he did not a the skin seems to be part off this potential sleep equation and that is that yet the am you fell asleep faster and you stay to sleep for longer and you spent less time awake throughout the night and i just thought were that is once shady what can early do with that there is another stay however in an animal model which is a little bit more interesting and once again they found a very similar fend type that the rats i say they were mice the mice fell asleep faster and they also spent longer time in sleep the sleep duration also increase what was also interesting mechanistically and this is not the mechanism that i think tie together tart cherries key we fruit t and you nothings melatonin cause i think there could be one common binding a mechanism what they found in the animal study is that they could block those key we fruit sleep benefits using a gabby blocking agent now gabby a gabby at which is stands for gamma amnio numeric acid here is one of the major inhibitory your a transmitters of the brain it is cannot lake a a altering additive i a sort of gets it account of the red light on the traffic light signal i others are green light i gabber is red light by playing around with some sort of clever drugs tomaniculate the system they could prevent the benefit of the key we fruit by sit of buggering around with the gabby receptive meaning that perhaps part of the key we fruit benefit on sleep was mediated by the brains natural inhibitory your transmits a system called the gala just inside and i thought that that was that was and of that convince me a little before that maybe the something here to read into to be determined again here is the bank but taught cherries and eye fruits the days surprise me because in pat i was preoccupied wet being an a bit purishabat in a bit snobby thinking not come on that is defend no anorak well i was of carmounds i look for to a day when supplements are no longer called supplements because at the end of the day whether not something has an effect whether not it is a whole eye fruit or a drive of key fruit will depend on the molecular compound and as you mention this am potential mechanism via the gala system am that is i that we both as scientist get excited about mechanism cause when you can is a mechanism and pathway provides a rational grounding for why key wee of all things or archery of all things might help a increased total sleep time a it'd be remiss if i did not mention or ask about tryptophan and serotonin i can an totally say when have taken trip to fan the precursor to serotonin or sratonan itself i have a horandis night sleep i fall asleep very easily and i experience ridiculously vivid dreams neither pleasant nor unpleasant as kind of a mishmash and then i wake up and i experience several days of insomnia that and have done the the pas if control in the negative control at all the variations thereof to confirm that at least for me supplementing with seratonergic agents is a bad idea for me m and am tryptophan is a common sleep supplement and sleep aid that that is discussed the normal architecture of sleep involves the release of sacaton but in a very timed and regulated way what your thoughts about serotonin in sleep of ye ottoman a put that into a nutshell and then why supplementing sup with saratonan and or its precursor a trip to pan might be a good or a bad idea for somebody i think one of the potential danger is that based on what is going on in your body that can change the absorption of natural to of tryptophan and serotonin uptake within the brain itself ism always thoughtful when your playing ran with that mother nature dynamic as it were the data as you described as a little bit all over them a some people say that it knocks them out other people say just you do it has a terrible impact on my sleep and when i stop it is pretty bad for a couple of days and seems to have this lingering after e fact if think what could be happening here is we need serotonin to just as you described to be modulated in very specific ways during the different stages of sleep if you look at the firing of the am brain spy centers were serotonin in is release than there is a bunch of them in the brain stem what you find and the release of of of a serotonin too when we are awake it is usually in high concentrations as we start to drift off to sleep it lowers some but not necessarily dramatically as we going into none sleep but then when we go in to red sleep serotonin is shut off the other one of the other nor modulators nor adrenalin also shut off remsleep is the only time during the twenty for our period where we see noradrenalin and serotonin or norapineffran completely shut down when i say serotonin world are talking five each keep p strike five ah tea that is just its chemical a name here am whether it old speaking about keratose or five each teas the same thing nor apanefran noradrenalin both of those need to be shut down for you to produce red sleep the other one of the other your modulators that then ramps up to produce red sleep is active coly these three nouramodulators have this incredible reciprocal dams that they have for you to generate what is called and natural architecture of sleep throughout the night it is the pushball again it is a pushball again it is it is chest them back it is whatever you want to think of the that is why i think if you are trying to increase dramatically drive up your serotonin levels at night and that sustains throughout the night when you are trying to get into red sleep you could be artificially fragmenting remsleep now i do not know the data i do not think any one's really got now data ivedonit why i would be if you were to say mat two years time that is the dato help me understand the potential mechanism or let us design some experiments where would you go first i would say let us look at the destruction of red sleep none sleep reciprocal regulation because you need serotonin to be up at one time down at another ai i am agree with everything you said and ism am ism personally never taking trip to vena seratonand again unless there's some clinical reason for that i that non need to do that i want a ask about on some other pro sleep behaviors but before i do nap let us talk about naps i love naps i come from a long history of nappers my dad always took a nap in the afternoon i take a twenty or thirty minute nap or i do a practices which i am took the liberty of hinting arrest a non sleep my brass some sort of just passive laying forty now there feet up elevated sometimes people do you were it'll do yoganedri'll do hypnosis or something that sort but twenty or thirty minutes of that has been very beneficial for me to get up from not nap or period of o windmill wakefulness will call it and go about my day quite well and also fall asleep just fine what er the date u on naps a do you nap and what are your thoughts about keeping nap short meaning twenty to thirty minutes verses getting out past ninety minutes two hours a for you personally naps ye nay or i do not nap am and have just never been a habitual papa is that because you do not feel sleepy in the afternoon or dick sleep do not feel asleep you are just hardier than ism i would not say handle i may be am less capable of fulling a sleep a but i not the a my afternoon no no i do not drag do not nap because you do not feel a a me to nap that is right yap now it is not that i am immune to what we call the postprandial dip in bluntness i definitely feel as though that can be this cannot asternal afternoon lull a you know ism not quite as on as i was at eleven o'clock in the morning and we know the physiology to that which brings us back to whether we would design to nap for naps we have done lots of different studies and the colleagues of done these that's two naps can have some ruddy great benefits we have found benefits for codyovescular health blopressia for example we found benefits for levels of courts us all were found benefits for learning in memory and also emotional regulation how long are the naps typically in those studies anywhere between twenty minutes to nighty minutes sometimes we to use a nighty minute window that the pots but can have a full cycle of sleep and therefore they get both none and red sleep within that time print than when we wake them up we usually wait a period of time to get them past what we call sleep in pasha which is that kind of window of grogginess way you say to you bet's ta off look young darling please do not speak to me for the i hour nothing i do not anything right now after no ta hour of waking up you o ism not just me just not the best version of mysalvr we wait for that time per and then we do some testing and we have done some testing before and after and we look at the change and that is how we measure what was the benefit of naps the reason why we sometimes do nighty minutes that they get all of those stages of sleep and then we correlate how much benefit did you get from the nap and how much of that benefit was explained by what remsleep you got what deep sleep you gat what light sleep you got that is the only reason that we use that as an experimental tool what we have also found is that naps of as little as seventeen minutes can have some quite potent effects on for example learning none of this is novel laser pioneer this back in the nineteen nighties and during the missions they were experimenting with naps for their astronauts and what they found was that naps of little as twenty six minutes improved am mission performance by thirty four per cent and improved daytime alertness by fifty percent and it birth what was then called the laser nap culture throughout all terrestrial laser snap during that time period it is long been known that naps can have a benefit naps however can have a double edge sword there is a dark side to naps and it comes back to our story of a demesne and sleep pressure the longer we are awake the more of that sleep pressure demesne that we build up but what i did not tell you is that when we sleep the brain gets the chance to essentially clear out that a demesne and after about sixteen hours of wakefulness and then after about eight hours of sleep eight hours of sleep seems to be able too allow the brain to see crease it is a demesne levels back too normal and actually we should start to wake up which also alines with your circadian withthm and those are too separate processes but with about eight hours of good quality sleep seven to nine hours of the average adult we are free of all of that a demesne we have evacuated it essentially out of the brain and we wake up naturally feeling refreshed the reason that naps can be potentially dangerous is that when you nap you are essentially opening the valve on the pressure cooker of sleep pressure stand some of that sleepiness is lost by way of the nap for some people and not all people and you are great example of this some people however if they are struggling with sleep at night and they nap during the day it makes their sleep problems even worse for people within sonic we typically advise against napping and the advices if you can nap regularly and you do not struggle with sleep at night then naps are just fine but if you do struggle with sleep stay away from naps if you are going to nap try to limit your naps try to cut them off a bit likes hat of caffeine maybe eight to twelve hours may be not that far off may be said of seven to six hours is a good rule of thumb try not to nap essentially late in the afternoon and if you do take a nap and you want to maintain you you do not want to have that groin as hang over that can happen after a full night of sleep for the first hour try to limit it to about twenty twenty five minutes and that way you do not go down into the very deepest stages of sleep which i if i reach you out off with an alarm then you just cannot feel you almost feel was for the first hour after the nap have defile externs that if i oversleep certainly if o the sun goes down during my nap and i wake up and light over all lighting conditions home changed i find it very hard to jolt myself back into the evening and it it can screw me up i trend keep those naps pretty brief and i should say i ism very happy to hear you mention individual differences and why some people might want a nap and other people might not want to nap a i have a colleague leech low ill be familiar to to many real just ewe is a absolute spectacular scientists o member the national academy hours he is investigator just o venom and a as a ton of energy but years ago i learned that he always takes a nap in the afternoon much that when he travels to give seminars at other universities he will tell his post lunch it persist whoever it is that he is pus to meet with may i have your office for thirty minutes of our sometimes thirty minute i discussion or sixty minute discussion cause i to take a nap and he does that and then gives is his talks are typically in the afternoon in academic culture and he describes the the effect of the nap for him these short naps in the afternoon being profound for his productivity that is i should what inspire me to start feeling o key about my desired nap and i think to for me that was great vindication for those that might feel guilty about wanting a nap but i i take to heart your note about avoiding naps if you have trouble falling in staying o sleep cause i think that i have family members who also if they nap they are reck they cannot sleep e i think it is just we have often being very pro sleep we as sit of sleep community i think it is good to always point out these potential doggies of of any aspect but you are absolutely right no one should feel guilty about getting the sleep that they need and i think that is being one of the big problems in society society a stigmatize sleep with these labs of being slothful of lazy and we are almost embarrassed to tell colleagues that we we take a nap i think sleep is a right of human beings and i the full think that sleep is a civil right of old human beings and no one should make you feel proud of getting the sleep that you need i i love that and it is an important point am i also feel that one of the best ways to beat your competition in any endeavor is to outlive them stand now that we know that an enhance a lunchevity and lack of sleep can shorten one's life that is all the justification i need any nay a can somebody sleep too much is a possible to get too much sleep it is a very good question and there are probably too things to say about it there is a condition that we call hyposomnia but that is a mixture of things it is where people have either a very high sleep need or they are very sleepy during the day and their typically falling asleep and these can happen in at a variety of different clinical contexts one of the places where we have often seen hyporsomnea believed to manifest is in depression but if you look at some of those studies it turns out it looks more as though those people are simply reporting being in bed longer but not necessarily sleeping longer and that fits very well with one of the profiles that we know of depression which is anaconda you do not get pleasure from normnwy pleasurable things you just do not want to go out into the world you do not want to interact because you depressed what you do you just stay in bed lion talks watching to you ray and that mitt looks as though when people say what time did you go to bed and what time did you get out of bed the mistake made in that question is okay that is how much time the sleeping when you should have said what time did you fall asleep and what time did you wake up and the answer could be very different that typosomnia from a clinical context can you sleep too much though one of the data points that argues was that is possible is when we look at all cause morality certainly what you find is that using the sweet spot of seventh nine hours when you start to drop below seven hours there is a relationship which suggest that the short your sleep the short to your life short sleep in that regard predicts all cause mortality but it is again not a line relationship the one that we have seem with red sleep once you get past nine hours the mortality curve stops going down and then wants you get further ten or even ours it bucks back up again it is almost a ja shape tilted over a little bit and reversed as this strange fuck what is going on here right now sleep science has at least too non mutually exclusive explanations for this the first is that if you look at some of those populations the idea is that the whatever was causing them illness and took their lives was just too much for sleep to deal with however we know that when we get sick one of the things that we do immediately in this a whole mechanism and in planetary mechanism cyticimediated when we get sick we want to sleep were we just want to kelly in bed and you sleep it up sleep it off the argument there is that it is not that sleep was killing people prematurely it was that these people were calling on the the help of sleep they were calling on the thing called the swims army knife of health that is sleep but whatever it is that they were facing was just too powerful for s keep to overcome it artificially looks as though more sleep leads to a high risk of death when sleep was atchlhe responding to the mortality risk and it lost the battle that is one argument the second is that we know that sleep quality and poor sleep efficiency is a very strong predictor of all cause mortality and when you look at people who often report sleeping long amounts ten or eleven hours they typically report having very poor quality sleep because their quality of sleep is poor they just try to sleep longer to try and get some of that back again here now it is poor quality sleep masking as too much sleep leading too this artificial fuck which looks mortality that is a second explanation a third which is more of a godunkan which is just cannot a thought experiment and ism of this mentality i do not know how many other people share this i actually think there could be a thing as too much sleep physiologically i think it is possible but the reason i think that is because it is no different than food water or oxygen can you over eat yes you can can you under eat of course or like light in their early wonder the day or throughout the day wonderful light late in the day night at night detrimental by directional for water can you over hydrate hype an extrema it can lead you know it happened in the ninety nineties and two thousand with the ecstasy craze were governments were saying your dehydrating you dancing all night please drink water and they drank too much water the blood electrolights when all over the place and they were having party actresses or stroke that people dine and they were dying because of excessive hydration can you get too much oxygen hyperon emit and it can cause free radical damage which can be profoundly harmful and kill brain cells can you sleep too much which is the fifth element of their life equation alongside food water oxygen a forth should say cannot even count clearly ism sleeping well an yes i think there could be that possibility a most people in danger of getting too much sleep o contrary if you look at the data e but i do not dismiss that idea i think it is it is possible it is it is a very thorough and very new artist and your very clear answers i i on it is interesting to think that a lot of the the the date o that out there that tog you out being in bed too long that it is just trying to compensate for the actual fragmentation of sleep the ut ism coming away with is that they are many pats to this and a both positive and things to avoid but the ideas to get most night ay similar amount probably seven an nine hour somewhere in there of his quality sleep that the not of sleep quality is going to become i would hope a a phrase that more people think about and learn about and cultivate as a practice a one ask about a a set of behaviors that ism at least ism aware of at least one company a starting to track in their sleep mongering device and that is am organism and sex orgasm and masturbation topics that are i are somewhat am sensitive am but from the prospective biology ad a a none of us would be here or we are not for a per mes egg in some fashion either in auditor or in vive am but what what are the data as as them to be or maybe lavs even doing this kind of a work and exploration about the roll that sex orgasm masturbation play in getting to sleep and stained is a sleep and sleep quality certainly those behaviors and those of physiological events have been part of our evolutionary history am what is the story there and what can we say about this in in terms of science and and there ais a practice ye a men it is almost that caricature of yen the movie a ye a couple makes lav and than all of a sun you just sit of hi snoring or you knew haves with the idea that somewhat somneganic that it is sleep promoting well the postorgasmic increase in polar well that is is here is is is interest ought to be a a set a naturally curing sedative there presumably has a function in an oxitoson has that also that benefit we you see a dissipation of the fights or fight french of the not system which has to happen feu to full asleep that is why we often see you know here at the sleep sense will see if phenomenon called what and tired whet people say look i am desperately tired i a i just am tired but i cannot full asleep because ism too wired your sleep drive your you are desperately tired it is that but because you are wired because you have got too much sympathetic activation too much courts us all as well you cannot full asleep it is a it is an impressive road block to anything good sleep and it is one of the principal mechanisms that we now believe stress and physiological activation that is the underlying cause of many forms of insomnia but coming back to sex the data is at taller quite compelling that both either subjectively assessed sleep quality or objective amounts of sleep sex that has resulted in of gas and i think it is the that last part that typically needs to happen i would imagine sit that between too mutual exclusive a individuals a we both a beneficial in times of receiving an organism i we ha day any discussion about sex we are referring to consensual age appropriate species appropriate context approbow i write and never eleven gone i we o we in there because i the entering et and people will come up with o ousiddea i i think that a a appropriate i think age appropriate consensual and context appropriating species appropriate covers all the bases i let any pic them in the comment section and and la sure to take note had nothing it is i that is really well said ism an important to say the dato is thawed you look at couples ho have orgasm we have also however found benefits of masturbation and it is not frequently spoken about but what it if you do some serves it tuns out that people will often use mastication as a sleep tool if the struggling with sleep and i know this it sounds almost a strange conversation or it is a tobucomosition but i i think we just need to be very open aba started off in science am one of the things i worked on a early my career not the very first topic was the topic of early influences of hormones estrogen into patron on sexual development of the brain and body and when you are wand in a laboratory that regardless of what era you look at see and it is behaviors and it is hormones and its physiologist as a scientist and sit that is to be clear what we are doing here were exploring these these behaviors from that from that perspective one thing is for certain every one is here because a sperm meaner either in kaddish or in veto as we said before and a at least in twenty twenty one there is there is no way around that fact herm and what preceded that is typically this act we call sac and sometimes hopefully a i to think orgasm is associate with that sexual activity laceration as one dimension of that is something that i think it can on should be discussed if in fact there data that relate it to sleep ye and both of those routes seem told to ism a sleep benefit now ism not saying that it is all about the orgasm i think as we spoke about with oxytocin there is some degree of pa bonding that if you have a gonna and you experience an intimate loving relationship that involves that than you can have hormonal benefits that a sleep promoting that may not necessarily be seen if you are just engaging in the solo singular act of masturbation ism what we gently known and i i am not some ones take any advice on when it comes to and i think relationship wise or sex use i divine episode yes certainly and that is not aroma series that ism going to be releasing any times saying to sing to be mostly about a sleep although i will touch on it'll release upon gest on sleep and sex but that is the dato that we have far we also know that it works both ways though and it is commonly this the same way with sleep a you now sleep an exercise sleep and diet how you eat can effect how you sleep how you sleep can effect how you eat same with exercise and it turns out it is the same way with sexual behavior too here were talking about whether sex can help with sleep can sleep help with your relationship and sex and the answer is yes it can firstly we know and we spoken a little bit about this that the reproductive hormones are under profound sleep regularly show estrogen and just actor estragons testastron is we here's or an was tars as well but women who or i should say any one who's interested in having higher levels of estrogen or or normal healthy levels of estrogen a i presume the day do show for estrogen what the date also show your molly for just tastosgon if you get too little or poor quality of sleep both sex tore in hormones as the referred to just strong grand estrogen which are present in both males and females and every variation thereof or going to be diminished belong normal healthy yes estrogen testosterone a effed h in women a key hormone in the regulation a for a see for conception of course all of these sex hormones seem to become significantly disrupted when sleep becomes of short quantity or for quality we also know that in women a sleep disruption can usually lead to menstrual psychic disruption we know this particularly from evidence in shift working women where they re night timeshift workers they struggle with sleep during the day often menstruation is destructed or even becomes mad but we also know it works this way not just for sex hormones but for sex itself for example we found that for every one hour of sleep extrasleep that a woman gets ha interest in becoming sex sleep intimate with her partner increases by fourteen percent which is and anonderirial amount and then the final part of i think this equation when it comes to sleep and sex is your your relationship itself and though some great work here from you see only by a professor serena can and what chief found was that restless nights mean for far more brutal fights in your relationship and they did this an invinumberous of different elegant ways and vice fibster as well am we not that have ever had conflict an relationship a me n big in a i just this us is days triter ad of never experience that it is all a and they found reliably that sleep would predict his likely herd of relationship conflict secondly if you got into that conflict the chances if you resulting it was significantly lea when the ponies ha not being sleeping well pat of the reason is because when you are not well slept your empathy goes down your not your taking more of an abrasive tents with yourpatna both than ego agreeable tents with you patina it almost every dimension of a human living relationship sleep can have a dramatic impact i think these are really important things to under score one of the most common questions i get because there seems to be a community of people on the internet that are obsessed with this am i do not know who they are because it is all all this internetstelf a shouting into a tone an and contents back and written romance a very bazaar conversation the i to speak am is whether or not sexual behavior itself lowers are increases testosterone and i went into the data which expands many decades actually both animal studies in human studies and it seems a just to underscore the as long as were talking about the subject that am it does seem that sexual activity sects between two people does seem to increase testosterone in both there is this question about orgasm or no orgasm ejaculation no ejaculation ana and indeed there do seem to be some effects of of am of restricting ejaculation in male has a form of further increasing testosterone of sex without ejaculation further increasing testosterone but the data are not clean a presumably because organizing these sorts of studies and getting truth in in self reporting is probably hard to get from from subjects but but it everything sort of points in the direction that provided that the relationship is a healthy one it is its consensualsage appropriate contacts appropriate species appropriate that see between two individuals does seem to increase the steroid harmony testosterone and estrogen toward healthy ranges and what ism hearing now the sort gestalt of of the discussion we just had is that that to can promote sleepiness restful states and quality sleep and i think this is an important conversation that just has not been held enough i man sooner or later am both in the you ass and elsewhere we are going to have to acknowledge that we are biological organisms of some sort and that we have choice in life about all these things from supplementation to sects or no sects et camera but that they have profound effects on our cardiology i mean it is fascinating to me that the areas of the hypothalamus the peptic area the superoptic areas those areas which the names might not mean anything to anybody besides a not in sitting here but those area sit cheek to jowl with each other in the hypothalamus and control sleep and sects the trigger of orgasm the appetite for food yo appetieoter for electro lights i mean i buthalmus is kind of a a festival of of morons with different booths for different i just for mewyhazes old nature in the brain but it is the orchestrator of the fast number of our behave is disproportion it some of its size us is a fact i do not think you can go to this hypothalamic festival without it is a at least seeing all the booths whether r not you decide in or not a am masternalogy am isn't ism glad that we have broach that conversation and i hope people will will think that we have approached to with the appropriate level sensitivity it is it is an imprint one that we are going to hear more about one way or the other people are certainly thinking about this if not engaging in in these sorts of behaviors or avoiding them i the more we can understand about the biology the better sum and thank you for bringing that topic up because for the record mat a tabled it for discussion we can to a cat ting outside thing said something about the erthativ sect an i our but we can go the that is lech interesting a absolutely i want a touch on just remaining topics one is are there any unconventional sleep tips or things about sleep that that we have overlooked if if we covered everything great but i here to keep the room cool we hear a because of this temperature phenomenon the light aspects the considerations about alcohol c b d marina i cognac behavior all archery to n was perhaps perhaps please do not put me on the etchers yetis just offering what i know noise eyes e considerations and and whether not people batch these things i i will not even list them off now because there too many jokes that one on c and i have no affiliation with any of these products ism avian take out a tout anything we company n a but the question i have is about any unconventional or lesser known things or maybe you do things or you think about things just in a purely a exploratory way as a scientist o that the the what if a kind of things that an what if it turns out that and i hear i just i we got a blank there for you to fill in i think you beyond the stand a fair that give dished out plenty of times of sleep high a regularity temperature dogies i alcohol caff an we have we have spoken about all of those what is some more unconventional tips i guess the first one which is unconventional along lines of naps if you have had a bad nights of sleep let us say that your stocking to image with in sonic and you have had a bat nights of sleep the advice and i land this for my wonderful call it michael palace do nothing what i mean by that is do not wake up any later do not sleep in the following day to try and make up for it do not nap during the day do not consume extra caffeine to wake you up to try to get you through the day and do not go to bed any earlier to think that you are going to compensate and i can explain all of those things but if you wake up later you are not going to be sleepy until latte the evening you gong to go to bed at your normal time and you will not be sleep in you will think while i just came off a bad night of sleep and now i i still am i cannot even get to sleep and it is my normal time because you slept in later than you would otherwise and you reduce the window of a menacing accumulation before your normal bed time do not go do not wake up any later do not use more caffeine for the reasons at that are obvious because that is only going to crank you it keep you awake the following night or decrease the probability of a good following night of recovery sleep i third ism i mention do not take naps because once again that will just take you don't naps particularly later in the afternoon i almost liken them to snacking before a main meal it just takes your appetite off the edge of that main meal of sleep do not do it and then finely do not go to bed any earlier resist and resist and go to bed at your normal time what i want to try and do is prevent you from thinking while i had such a bad night last night and i normally go to bed at ten thirty ism u going to get into bed at nine o'clock because last night was just bad but that is not your natural bed time and it is not a lined with your natural croon type because presumably you can give know something about that our morning time evening time you than ta sleep in harmony which is sleep or how you get best quality sleep but you go to bed at nine and my body is not ready to to sleep at nine o'clock but ism worried because i had a bad night of sleep last night i get into bed and now ism tossing in turning for the first hour and a half because it is not my natural sleep window but i just thought it was a good idea and if i did not know anything about sleep i would think all of these same things too as ism not finger wagging but after if i have a bad night of sleep and i am not immune just because i know a little bit about sleep does not mean i do not have my bad nights i do does not mean i have not had bouts of insomnia in my life i have but after a bad night of sleep i do nothing i do not do any of those for things i think the second tip ism i would offer in terms of unconventional its have a wind down routine many of us think of sleep as if it like a light switch that we just dump into bed and when we turn the light out sleep should arrive in that same way to the binary it is honor it is off sleep is a physiological process it is much more landing a plain it takes time to gradually to send down on to the terra farmer of what we call good solid sleep at night find out whatever works for you and it could be stretching i usually meditate an for about ten or fifty minutes a before bad some people reading try not to watch tell vision in bad that is ideally it dis it is you will not you are how much too activating no you can listen to relaxing podcast although we can speak about technology in the bedroom to but have some kind of a wine down routine it is i it is almost you would not race into your garbage and come to it screeching halt from sixty miles an hour you typically down shifty gears and you slow down as you come into the arrange this the same thing with with sleep to that is the second thing have some kind of a wine down routine find what works for you maybe it is taking a hot bath or a warm shower and then stick to it just we do this with kids all the time we find out what they're bedroom sorry their bed time regiment is and then we just stick to it faithfully but we humans are the same way to the third thing is a myth do not count sheep ifs a study done here it you see ugly i did not do this they i wish it did it is by my colleague professor out and garvey and they found that counting sheep actually made it harder to fall asleep made matters worse as a center a sorry counter a measure to that what they did find was that taking yourself on some kind of a mental walk think about an nice work that you take in nature or a walk on the beach or even a walk around and orbit is you iron and visualizing that that seem to be beneficial the other thing about am sot of that idea of shifting focus away from your mind itself get your mind off itself is a good piece of advice catharsis you can try to write down all f the concerns that you have and do this not write before bad but usually an hour or two before bad some people call call it a worry journal and to me it is a little bit closing down all of the emotional tabs on my browser because if i shut the computer down and all o those tabs are still open ism gong to come back in the morning the computers red heart the fans going because it did not go to sleep because it could not because there were too many tabs active and open i think it is the same way with sleep as well try to think about doing that just vomit on all your concerns on the page a give the dithery am waking as often associated with me riding down the lists of things that have regard to do that i need to do ye and in in once i eventually wake up from the later night a si can have of the night sleep thatstoft seems much more tractable and reasonable but a sure would be great to get that stuff out of the way before sleep well there is also something that i do not think people of spoken about a lot and it'd to research it which is difficulty and anxiety at night in the day all is not the same difficulty and anxiety in the light of day and when we have those thoughts at night it comes with a magnitude of rumination and catastrophic action that is disproportionate to that which you would describe when you are awake and i do not know what is going on about the brain and thought and in motion at the time have got a bunch of theories to why and that is why i the idea of closing up zipping up all of those different components just get them out on the page and it feel and i at first thought this just sounds who it sounds very buckle it is can not come by our we all hold hands and well come at the end of the day but then this the dates thoughts coming out ready gods that's from good people and they found that keeping one of those generals decrease the time it takes you to fall asleep by fifty per cent five hero it is well on can with any phomsuitical agent o absetuna ism convince that have long thought that the worries in concerns and ideas i have at three for i m have learned to not place any stock in them ye because ever something ism glad that you might am decide to eventually look at this in your laboratory because i you something is melted away or altered i suspect it in the a the regulation of the autonomic nervous system that it make sense why i concern at three for i m ought to evoke more of a panic sense than i concern chance and certainly that is my experience although not i fortune do not suffer from flyblown panic attacks but everything seems worse at three for i m y add your awake and we we need to to t look into that because if you look at suicide rates around the twenty for our clock face disproportionately higher rates in those middle s at of night hours now now i do not know if that is coursitive or not but something i could just be that that is the time when were mostly lonely and were by ourselves and that is the reasons has got nothing to do with sleep all the night time i do not know am that is the third thing i think the fourth sat of little tip i would give that is unconventional is remove old clock faces from your bedroom including your phone including your phone and resist checking it now i know and i can speak about the phone to that genie of technology is out the bottle and it is not going back in any time soon we have got to think of scientists and sleep scientist as to what we do with u phones in the better but i a years ago was a concert o summer camp i worked with arris kids and the am there was a phrase that comes to mine here its be a channel not a dam because we ma shy and damn certain kinds of behavior am physically damn certain kinds of behavior not morally dam am that to a it s dreams over the edge and you get and you get a a waterfall i see ha as gan of the phone and devices have to be worked with in negotiated notes right and d think about those mindfully to but clock faces remove all of those because if you are having a tough night knowing that it is three twenty two in the morning or it is full forty eight in the morning does not help you in the slightest and it is only going to make mattes worse than better try to remove old clock faces i think that is one of those o the tips that some people a found helpful but those would be said of some slightly union venational i guess more than your stock fare of here the five tips for sleep i gene to night and those are terrific sleep tips and um several of which if not all of which ism going to incorporate that this has been an amazing a deep dive on sleep and it is positive and negative regulators i hope it has not been too long and i i dos has been great cut it down shorten it too a have sine the minutes of mamsolalhat i a but absolutely not ever it it is chalk black full of valuable take always it is been a a tremendously fun for me to a direct out this incredible aspect of our lives that that we call sleep with a fellow scientist and a a fellow public educator i want to say mum several things first of all we should say where people can find you although i should not be that difficult these day as you're here a very present on the on the internet for for better for worse i think it is wonderful that you are out the look it is a public health service that your doing i know one requires you or any other scientist to get out and i share this information my sense of you knowing you a bit and from fall on your work very closely but your scientific work in detail and your public facing i educational work is that you very much want the best for people and it is it is an interesting thing as a scientist or cognition to a know that the that certain answers exist that we do not have all the answers but that there is a better path or our better ways and people can benefit in a myriad of ways i for that because i know that to be very genuine in you you want the best for people and your offering tremendous advice and and considerations and people can take it or love it and that is the way of you it i also on o think you for taking the time out of your day to a to sit with me here and

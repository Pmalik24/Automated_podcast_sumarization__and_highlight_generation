to day shows pons rob express we in thousands my lesser s already secured the outwit day to join them express giant cams lashes last night i visited oxford university in great brain my wife had some has not ins about me visiting the up at all given safety concerns after all on saturdays one hundred thousand people marched in support of compass as his escape crime is apparently up one thousand three hundred fifty percent in onion over the last few weeks the moms shout in nottingham wile muscle here is a new behind me kill him but we felt that it was important particularly at a time when the west seems unsure of its moral qualifications to condemn absolute evil in the form of mass to go to oxford after all oxford is a thousand year old institution one of the chief intellectual light to the less if we in the west lose oxford it is a good indicator the west as a whole is in trouble well ism here report the west is in trouble the university itself is gorgeous it is a monument s the greatness of mankind the architecture is magnificent the history speaks from the walls from church to we es louis from ten ninety sixth to nineteen forty five but the institution itself has been honeycombed with people who are in full support of his comic terrorism my opening remarks last night focused on the west shyness about its own values its failure to recognized that not everybody things westerners do and the consequent importation of people who believed that the west is actually deeply evil those remarks were borne out in the shall even when student after student approach the microphone to offer bevy of morally obfuscatory arguments in support of comas the most common was the clearly specious and horrible argument the compass burning babies alive in their cribs raping their mothers shooting them and torturing fathers was somehow morally equivalents two the is really defense forces targeting terrors while attempting to into my civilian casualties when pressed however student afferstuden admitted the real guy the destruction of the state of israel entirely the rest of it was all just hot air here's just one example n exchange i had with young muslin obviously shut muslemshous wearing teashop for those who cannot see the club here it is to leave your mousers old enemy where's her away s i your r a o e to we o the a a i not t i o air the in angry free r i s a e rsasrsord es is news that ha or we sea o a o e o e a does of er is saree aaoaao jo o one ears to oses o s ans as real we o ousts e er o ears o o e e i will went out here that just for the sake of the fact their is ate state in the middle east where news in non news have equal rights that hi state israel where twenty present of the population is air muslin also there i her news living that stop zero news living the palcinian areas of the western zero news living in even on zero jewsliving inborn zero yes live in sat arabia zero yes living in egypt zero news living in syria but israel is the promise the police for honesty when leash we s says s of the thing the state of israel should be destroy in here is the thing student after student said this this was not a rarity literally student after student just admitted full scale that israel should not exist to put it mildly the experience was somewhat discomfiting it is not all that easy emotional to stand across from student after student calling for the extermination of jaws between the river and the sea my literal friends in family a modern universities it is now considered erratiure to mention that men and women are different but it is considered perfectly acceptable to openly justify an excuse the murder of innocent jewfish men women and children radicalize muslin students the most important western institutions feel no qualms whatsoever about calling for the obliteration of the jewfish state anti feminism runs rife in these halls obviously and what's even more disturbing is the tolerance with which it is met there is little or no bushbuck there is certainly no feeling that such u hatred is out abounds and that is why the west is in trouble as i said last night in nineteen thirty three the oxford union society infamously voted two seventy five to one fifty three for the proposition quote this housewelf under no circumstances fight for its king and country that pathetic statement which became known as the called oxford oath gave it an comfort to the enemies o the west the reportedly led both hitter and mosoleny to the conclusion and the brutish were internally week and thus pray for aggression the modern version of the oxford oath is what we see to day in the west the belief that the values of can and country are not worth defending in the face of a muscular form of his lam that seeks the total obliteration of its enemies in just one second will gets the fact that the media and many of our politicians a parting the exact same line first on a to you about the daily wires most

extermination of israel the rest of the world is following sued with its moral equivalents amidst t israel attempts to rear commas from the got a trip come ass is now receiving a helping hand from the international community and the legacy media welcome o sits on vast stock piles of water food medicine the international community and legacy media are placing responsibility see for gases civilian population on wait for it israel according to no less in anti israel authority than the your times this week and quote as supplies to virtually every basic human necessity twinkle and gaze one group in the besieged conclave remains well stocked commas commas has hundreds of thousand of gallons of fuel for vehicles an rockets cashes of ammunition explosives materials to make more stockhaus of food water and medicine according senior officials a senior labanese official sat compass which is estimated to number between thirty five and forty falcon people had enough stock today to keep fighting for three to four months without any resupply with gases facing humanitarian catastrophe commands stock piles raise questions says the her times about what responsibility if any it has to the civilian population ah there it is that fabled never times objectivity compass steals billions of dollars from it citizens to fun its war machine and that quote raises questions about what responsibility if any it has to the civilian population now imagine the sends and any other context is there any question united states government has a responsibility for its civilian population that literally the purpose of a government or they israel government but being a genocidal jute and terra means your enough to take responsibility for the civilians you supposedly govern you might not have any responsibility for the citizens at all in fact gaze hospitals right now are complaining but lackofuel but comes currently has two hundred sixty cousin gallons of gases teasel on hand but no matters say t members the west people of to men commas has no responsibility which is why commands friends are able to lament the plight of civilians and gaze after having funded their impoverishment and the corn conflict created by compass eight dollars to plaid to gaze over the pastwenty years have been embezzled by commas and used for its murderous plans but now the international community and legsemedia say its up to israel to make humanitarian provision for gazes civilians this is of course is ingenuous zero of the countries that voted in favor of a yuan resolution pushing sense fire have offered to take in any gases civilians none have called for commas to surrender to israel far which would and the conflict immediately no they say israel has to stop its attempts to destroy commas the innocence are suffering this is the height of citizens this argument it is on pay with the old saw about the man who kills is parents then throws himself on he mercy of the court because he is orphan commas started this conflict commas is the governing body in the gas's trip commas has chief responsibility for the health and welfare of gaze palsinian arab civilians and they do here at all at all about those citizens in fact they want those citizens to i they say openly they say that their civilians are the responsibility of the people they just murdered on mass here is commas official must abumarzuk just yesterday baby at the the as many people are asking this of the enemy risen since your visit five hundred bolometers or tunnels me thaw haven't you built bomshelders yercivillins can hindering bombardments n he says we have built the tunnels because we have no other way of protecting ourselves from being targeted and killed ere the there those tunnels are went to protect us from t e our plans we are fighting from inside the tunnels everybody knows that seventy five per cent the people in the goes trick our refugees comsosebn ma e and it is the responsibility of united nations to protect them according to the geneva conventions is the responsibility of the occupation fetter to provide the with all the services as long as they are under occupation see get that by the way the gossip government is compass they literally elected them they provide public services but according to this it is amazing to here members of an actual honest to god genecitle terror is crupciting the geneva in mentions in the own fence truly amazing but here is the math apparently if a population elects o terrors leadership that terrace leadership consolidates its control by weeping out its political rivals that terrace leadership steals billions of dollars in aid and impoverishes its own citizens in the process and then the terrace leadership murders fifteen hundred chose and kidnaps another two hundred thirty the people then long as the terrace leadership hides in tunnels undertint villain populations the terra have to be left alone this is insanity total insanity it is insanity no other country on earth would be expected to weather or be concerned about not the united states not the aka not france not germany no one there cannot and should not be a seas fire in til commas surrenders this is very simple any one in the world calling for a sense fire but not calling on commas surrender in fact those who are calling for lengthening of the conflict by shipping in for re sources for commas to steel cannot pretend to care about human life either as rally or palistinian there is a reason that both compass and the united nations again one o the worst places on earth are calling for sense fire and has nothing to do with human rights and everything to do with stopping israel from protecting its own citizens the mass murder of whom created this conflict in the first place in just one second we will get to again the insane calls for a sense fire in the face of compasses continued barbarity first have been talking about my relics at sleep mattress for years i got to be ankle not seeping amazing on the road relic sleep is the dig nasalize me to sleep well when i am at home because they have a mattress they made just for me is firm but breathable which is what i need when i sleep if custom to get back pain if's not breathable intend to heat up an night relics made a mattress just for me they can do the exact something for you and now they have their newest

offering twenty per cent of all mattressortis plus two free pillows for my listeners go to help sleep dot come slashed it is their best offer yet it is nothing a last long with relics better sleep starts right now ay yester day w as as the rest the world calls for a cease fire with mamas which again is insane there was a sense fire with comas we should not it was established in gone of this year and then it was broke in by two thousand comosteris rushing into cevilianareas and murdering ever one they saw there report yesterday that came out from commas body camfootage that homes literally took a baby and put the baby in the oven and then baked h baby alive well raping the mother repeatedly this homes body cabotage and yet people are still cling phrases fire and pretending that because comas is hiding in a highly dense civilian area that means that they are now immune from attack the logic of which by the way completely defeats the purpose of having rules of war it completely defeats it if the idea of the rules of war is to minimize civilizing casualties then those rules of war have to persuade people from doing precisely what comas is doing come is use it the rules of war two but to apply to everyone else and not itself which seems an amazing way o fomenting terrorism the entire purpose of the geneva conventions was to get people who were perparticipating in violent action into military uniforms they could be separated from the civilian population come is doing precisely the reverse and then relying on the geneva conventions supposedly which of course is absolute nonsense again we all know that their headquarters are located under all sheaf hospital they are located under a hospital now for pair reasons israel will not boy that hospital i would imagine but if they did boy the hospitals be perfectly clear that is a military sight according to the red cross once you transform us cevilinsite into a military sit it is a military sight you cannot claim immunity at a sight simply because you choose to violate the laws o war otherwise what you are doing is insensivizing people to violate the loss of war that is the entire purpose of them violating the laws of war mean by the way this is directly from the red cross quote the laws of your prohibit direct attacks on civilian objects schools they also prohibit direct attacks against hospitals an medical staff which are specifically protected under international human rights law that is said a hospital or school may become a legitimate military target if it contributes to specific military operations of the enemy and if its destruction offers a definite military advantage for the attacking side if there is any doubt they cannot be attack hospitals only lose their protection in certain circumstances for example if a hospital is being used as a base from which too launch an attack as a weapons deep or to hide healthy soldiers and fighters that is according to the red cross but again the idea hears that comas is going to hide behind behind geneva conventions while barbarically slaughtering villain you remember there is a woman named shiny luck is a horrifying story obviously channilucu remember her body was broken she was choose murdered her body was clearly broken the first day of the conflict you could see the first day that the terratack you could see tape of her broken body essentially being stripped and thrown on to the back of a truck in gaze and were tongue broken body contorted in ways that no living human being be contorted and commosspologis then claim that choose alive in being given medical treatment in the gozistrip those clearly lie the time while now has ben confirmed that she is dead of course german chancthtr or off shoals lamented the terrible news that she had died he said the shows the full barbarity behind the homes attack who must be had a countable this is terror in israel has the right to defend itself well i mean that is true which is why it is absolutely absurd that germany voted to abstain for may you in resolution concerning a quoncuo sees fire meanwhile compass continues to hold hostages their effectively holding guns to not effectively the are probably literally holding guns to the head of people on tape and then releasing hostage of videos and getting those hostages if they hope to preserve their lives in primally not be repeatedly raped by commossterris to a to rip on the israel government as a piece of propaganda here is and all these people would not be hostages if cohosh surrendered and release them which common will not do obviously here is om of the hostage footage tease a necessary lean less nowhohello we have been detain for twenty three days and there should have been areas fire i promise to release us but instead we are still in captivity your position means you want to kill us if this is propaganda to put out by mama a people that the presumably they have raped in kidnap there is no one there to protect us the army was not their again n propaganda of idiot put out we don't have my thewhole thing propaganda of video put out by homes o people that they have presumably raped kidnapped tortured this is what they do and yet the rest of the world is still trying to draw a moral equivalence because again is not about the moral equivalence is not about the moral equivalence that the underlying position which i the state of israel is fundamentally illegitimate and that anything done two people in this area is apparently excusable and justifiable that is the underlying logic to this entire thing now in a miraculous event yesterday very rarely get pies good news in a situation this is rally tanks went into gas yesterday and in the process of going into gaze they actually ended up freeing one of the hostages which is pretty amazing an you have to assume in this position that the that the hostages are effectively dead because commons has no interest tin releasing them if they wanted to they could just release them but yesterday one of the hostages was in fact re taken by is daily forces which is in amazing achievement of the idea according to sky news the soldiers rescue during a ground operations announced by the idea f earlier on money the idol inshinbet say the is rallies will continue to make every effort to bring about the release of the obducties she was reunited with her family the ground operation of course is what is allowing hostages to possibly be rescued in the first place will called for a sense fire without release of hostages is a call for there continued captivity obviously unjust one second we will get to the insane media coverage of this conflict which again is and support to humans there is is no question about at first the menshup peas so is support by grand canyon university to portable private christian university with a vibrant camps an beautiful we nyserizoner that ran toptwenty in the country

your purpose grand canon university private christian affordable visit g c u dot end u to day ill get the media doing it there best to stand with homes it is pretty incredible the ya daily news yesterday for example actually issued a correction on october twenty fifth piece there is a piece by womanize sahartartac who had written in favor of israel civilians and in her pes she claimed correctly that compass raped women and beheaded men well comas raped women and beheaded men male then printed eight correction shastra traction quote this column has been edited o remove unsubstantiated claims that compass raped women an beheaded meats the male daily news the atrocities of course we are not unsubstantiated that is absurd the twitter editor is a persuaded a nipas w apparently thinks that done the reports of commons rape and murder are unsubstantiated not only they not unsubstantiated their substantial by actual video footage taken by comasterris but the goal of the media is to establish moral a moralequivlence that is the entire goal of the media in this conflict because they can establish moral equivalents it allow as this conflict go continue and puts israel an acestential danger make no mistake that how unit how many media pieces were written in world war to and that is the closest come a not just using world war to because it is a matter with which people are possibly nowledgible i musing wold war tho because it is the closest come compass has the exact same goal as the notes and they pursues strategies that are absolutely similar to those of the cozies when comes to the news there is no other real come the really is not what you can compare it the commas to the con the there there is no actual real comparison on a moral level except for the naris but the media have swivelled full into moral equivalent motive they went directly from guys getting slaughtered is is bad to palsinians village where dying as the result of israel targeting terrorist is the same thing which by the way again just a point this out seals complete air superiority in the goscisstrip if israel wished to do what it is to tractors say that it wants to do we would not be talking about a few thousand people did tragically we would be talking about hundreds of thousands of people dead in serial where no one seems to give as haw it is pretty incredible that israel is targeted as a human rights abuser on par with commas but again it is a de ingenuous argument just as you saw in that debate with that student at out university that is not the argument at all they not care about human rites the entire argument is israel does not have a right to defenditself because israel no have a right to exist that what this is about and that is why the washington post is now printing piece after piece about the situation in gaze yes the situation in gaze is ugly but if all you folks on in gaze is the fact that it is ugly in got without mentioning anywhere that it is coma's fault that its ugly that the governing party in that conflict could surrender tomorrow and and the bombing to morrow then all you are doing is providing justification for cops all you are doing is preventing commas from being busted piece after piece now about the cost of the the costs of war the cost of world out again you do not see this in virtually any other conflict covered by the legacy media you do not see it at all you do not see for example pieces about the great suffering of the russia people thanks to the destruction of their economy thanks to the grand war you do not see that ever right ever you never here piece bout the cost on the ground in russia from from the certainly not without the contact of ladmrpuan start end thenar by invading you crane when it comes to the gaze trip then we are treated to all of the images of the suffering on the ground well it is important the people are suffering but it's important mainly because the pressure should be on mamas to stop the suffering by surrendering to day but that is of to mediate doing the media are attempting to draw a moral equation between babies being slaughtered in krauts berg and civilians being killed because they are sitting a top terror tunnels and being forced to stay there commas is literally blocking roads commas is killing people at tempting to escape but the mere doing their best for example h washington post as an article to day called quote a waste land of rubbish and the bra it is piece by a person a ten abusayf and is called ism still alive gaze is no longer gaze a the abuse is the author of six novels and since twenty nineteen has breathe minister of culture for the palisinian authority in the wetback was i at this punish to point out that pain an authority in weeping pays actual honest to god terror stipend if you are a terrace and you kill a new the passing authority will pay your family ten thousand dollars and the washington posed without any contact puts this persons opinion of the terrible situation in gaze in it is newspaper again it is just remove from all context betas that is the point that is what we the idea for the medias you can neutralize the murder of civilians the absolute targeted murder of civilians in israel that requires the content of the entire is rally tapestry usually falsified and what does not require any context is the suffering an gaze at all quit i walk to elshif hospital to read the names lists of the dead are pinned up alias had a makeshift morgue i could barely approach the building thousands of goes had made the hospital their home it is gardens its always every empty space or sparecorner had a family in i gave up and headed toward hates an now again i i have searched for the work homes in this piece it does not exist the workman the re the governing party there are the government of the gaze strip there's not a single mention of them meanwhile amidst the washington post these are journalist in gazing please try to share our voices please shut up voices now here is the thing why do you think that journalist are dying in goal could it be because if your journalist and goa you are literally dictated to by mamas comes does not allow freedom of movement in in the goistrip if this is why see and reporters ware not in the gozistrip they are on the outskirts of the gozistrip give freedom of movement in israel if but we have hundreds of reporters in israel on the ground right now drinking and bars in tell eve and then going and covering the conflicts wherever they want inside the state o israel if you report from inside the gozistrip you are under the control of mass but now you have journalists and many of them are are just active is posing is journalists some of them ore freelancers who stay who are her big fans of hitters will get to in just one second gives a lot of these people who are now reporting the the the horrors that are in goa i am sure to horrible situation inside goal that is in fact the point of a war s to make a horrible situation for your enemy not for the enemy's civilians but if the villains are indistinguishable because the terrors refuse to allow them to be distinguished that is the fault of the terrorists but again the washington post strips away all context an we just gave idiot of journalists talking about the play of journalists in the gozistrip wit or again there is no freedom of speech in the gosistrip they cannot print freely tin the gozistrip if you print antihamos material an the outstrip they will kill you they will kill you but we are supposed to believe that the great threat to journalists is of course israel in general here istle washington post doing this nonsense new says hospitals in the bobbing of churches most women children ambulances all have been targeted as well as journalist in the homes of journalists gey that is a li ism sorry that a lie they did that israel is targeting ambulances is a lie there is no evidence to back this and the washington post just puts that up without any doubt without any sort of of attempt even hatcheck that sort of stuff i mean it really is in an amazing demonstration of the disgusting bias of the media by the way this particular lady who apparently has no posts on twitter or anywhere else prior to the outbreak of israel retaliation against comes she does sin letters the palestine solidarity open letter for the g s a students association calling for fulls vestment from the state of israel and blaming everything on israel without any went again that the idea the chusemsert of objective journalist just chronicling was going on and goa lots of suffering is going on in goa but why we should trust a person this activist to talk about israel wqutnit what targeting ambulance is bent but the washington possess prints the stuff in critically because this is exactly what they do this is literally what they do and it is not just that it is the nearer times they put out of idyl called war through the eyes of goes children now again war anywhere through the massive children is horrifying of course i mean naturally war is a horrifying thing it is horrifying and evil and terrible war in an of itself but what a greater evils is allowing terrorists to govern entire territories from which they create mass terror tacks against civilians but the times the whole ideas present tons of contact when it comes to actual terrorism context that justifies the terrorism when it comes to destroying terrorism remove all contacts and pretend that s actual terrorism s that is what the near times doing here is the young shouts in may boudoir houses and destroyed them the window's fell we got scared and came here they call my uncle and told us to evacuate await they called and told you to evacuate well i mean that something that commons does not do we found a careful of garbage and we wrote it here yes for is for is horrible also ism jest going to point out that even these student to but even these these young kids are admitting that israel calls and tells them to evacuate for sncommoss doesn't to that you car comossesn't do take any responsibility or its own goggling population this is the find up campaign buy the legacy media and people wish to destroy the state israel to pretend that israel is the moral equipment of commons and thus to come to some sort of sense fire arrangement allowing commons to live leading in that department is the idiotic homes freemen who but again i ism never going to get over the fact that the people who actively believe that tom as freedman and his ilk are intellectual homes freedman has the brains of a come quit that yes entire job consists of going round to firing countries and listening to tax drivers transcribing what they say if it is self flattering and then printing it and yet that guy is the foreign policy expert the were time fillet to more on this a second first you may he

got a just mention here that the near times is little concerned about actual morality that they legitimately her people organs of hitter like that that is i there there is a hitter loving reporter in gaze who is literally re hired by the nurtures literally rehired by the nurotimes and that's not the only person who the serotines is happy there tverywise points out a few days ago the paper published re story about the atmosphere in sadiarabia after the october see of massacre and they quoted a person in sultan lamer a gratitude in hazard center from tidy studies aliens presented as an expert by the serotines but ism he also tweeted literally the day of october seventh quote what a sweet day that is ta person quoted as i foreign policy expert by the nurotimes in twenty twenty one the centimes put published a flattering profile of a professor named at refit later praising him for his decision to teach is rally poets that's to publish an not bed by this person well ism yesterday he joked about whether or not in his rally baby burned alive and oven was quote quoted with or without baking powder the nurtimesis a garbage chap is been a garbage cheap for for debate to this point and homes freemen is of course the leading light of the nurotimes and and the garb ships out he has another piece yet another piece talking both really what israel should do here is nothing because after all it would would really ruin their moral suasion if news were to defend themselves instead of just dying have notice that all the people who are very upset it israel morally there perfectly happy with jugs dying they do not it when jet's actually defend themselvesthat is uncomfortable homes freedman has piece hired the is rally officials i speak with tell me they know two things for sure he says ism watching the israel commissar and thinking about one of the world leaders have most ad mired on moan sing he was indies prime minister in late nonmember two arsenate when ten packastandeaje lotus militant from lascar e tiro group widely believed to be linked to packastans military intelligence infiltrated india and killed more than a hundred sixty people in dumb what was sings it military response to india september eleventh he did nothing sing never riparian militarily against the nation of pakistan or lascar damson pakistan it was a remarkable act of restraint he is now calling for israel to do nothing now have noticed a few things one israel is a very small state india is gigantic two india is bartered by a newcleor power called pakistan and if india were to retaliate in significant fishing ins the packastanin military worldworth see would be iminentwere as israel is border by humans which is a terriers group which is hiding in tunnels but what exactly is homes freemen asking for from t is first of all he a test actively compare beeping inch nowt who the elected prime minister of the state of israel two compass he actively attempts to do that because he says that baby was not purely in favor of the two state solution tough by way i cannot emphasize enough the insane blindness of talking about a two state solution less than month less than a month after fifteen hundred news were murder by one of the groups governing in the palstinian arms compass who by the way have the same exact goes as thapalstin an authority anislomiccy hid where the other governing powers m this is crazy that is after a pearl harbor people going what really is not the real promise it the united states has not made peace with germany really that is that is the rail problem if if if the united states ad only been more forth coming with germany than this pro harbor thing never would've happened and that is the real solution here that is not the way any of this works but here is how insane homes freeman is quit a pass cold allow the people of goes take stock of what comes attacks on israel haves done to their lives families homes and businesses what exactly that comas think it would accomplish with this war for the people of goa thousands of whom were traveling to work in israel every day ore exploring agricultural products and other goods across the fossa israel word just a few weeks ago comas has gotten wait much understanding and not enough hard questions from the people of gaze oh you noticed oh you noticed by the way when he talks about the people who had at work profits many of the people an work profits into israel were in formers for comas they found on the bodies of the dead comas terra maps of each of these moshavin in the goa envelope these towns in the goa envelope insisted the exact locations of the houses the number of inhabitants of the houses hominy men women and children were in each house that's because there are people were being let through by israel to bolster the economy of the goes trip and they were immediately taking the information they gain in formation how many children are in a house and handing it over to comes wo cams could slaughter them there is that but homes freeman's idea here this is big idea his big idea is that if israel just stops the a comas will come out of its tunnels and then the people of goswelll holdthm accountable which makes perfect senses for twenty years they not held them accountable and they elected them and in the last available pole comas pretty copular and both the gosistrip and in judayan maria f the west bank but here is homes freeman's moronic idea because again this dude has am not sure he has to neurons true the other quote i want to see comes leaders come out from their tunnels under hospitals and look their people and the world's media in the eye and tell every one why they thought it was such a great idea to mutilating kidnap is really children and grandmothers and trigger this terrible blowback on their children and grandmothers of their gowan neighbors not to mention their own oh then moral suasion slow cat for homes for and when i say back to the oxford porn i say westerners do not understands people quart noon western this is what i mean the ultimate arrogance of people homes freedmen thinking man if only we could just tut tut if they w

from the north because israel than be perceived as week but this is what the n you times is is what our media are they need the moral equivalents because if there is one premise that drives the western medium more than any other is it the west is not morally superior that is the premise that drives of the western mediate tries western left it leads to the the imbibing from the marks playbook and the post colonial is playbook that all in a quality of outcome is attributable to western evils that all bad things happening on earth are attributable to the evils of the west an there for the west means to simply pretend that every one else thinks members the west and if come if we could just sit across the table homage explain to them how much the children of goals o they do care they

persuade the america people the thousand surrender the country of the atom to the venom that was it the the they knew they could count on the legacy media to do their duty work and nothing has change nothings in the media are just trash they are absolute sheer trash the only thing opera to themed an from of being trash would be places in china which are actively promoting this china by the way has obviously taken side the terrace there is a there is a fugal map come called do maps do maps is in china they have literally removed israel as the country on he map they less cities but they got rid

and doing nothing wit bit the money actually to anything he said he was going to do it risk kenosis back he literally had nothing to say of a man bendy about the murder of civilians an israel nothing but his now release o statement a ha statement that is that is put in beautiful graphic form quote according to the gosibase ministry of health which the you en considers credible the is really districts of kill tat my seven thousand phalsinians and goes including two thousand nine hundred and thirteen children s s october seventh this is not self defense building a border wall around gossip and confiding more than two million palcinians in this open air prison is not self defend by the way you know we usually call a place that is governed by a governing authority the receives billions of dollars in aid from america and other placeman had six miles beech front property we usually don call that n open or prison unless the people who are governing the territory decide to make it which is what compass is decided to do hes is long siege chagassi is not self defense violently seizing palcinian lands is not self defense these are crimes against humanity just as commons killing more than one thousand former people in israel and abducting two hundred others on october seventh was a crime against you ah the perfect moral equivalents where is this coming from what iran medical care about this because to be antiphrasis is to care about humanity it is the same coalition of the oppressed nonsense the constantly here from the international left and is it curable is not curable that perspective because once you are part of the oppressor class your always a member of the the oppressor class is not make clear by a professor named yabablad in the last forty eight hours she is

violent effort has not been watching very closely by the way yabablay has taught at the following faculties lee high university off at college and dream university where she was the director of the african studies program this is the perspective that you are seeing play out at our universities its the perspective that your seeing play out international as well you wonder why the west has decided to basically commit suicide the answer is the west does not have the stone o stand up for its own values and say that people who are effectively cultural scavengers people who who live off the benefits of the west hell condemning the west as a horrible terrible place that ought to be destroyed the west does not have the power or the capacity morally to say to those people you are wrong your wrong might be useful person for a change and the west is a unserious trouble ell i i do want end with a bit of humor here and ten thankfully that bit of humor has been provided by gavannusom the

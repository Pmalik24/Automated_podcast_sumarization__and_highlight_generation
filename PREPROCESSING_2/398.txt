welcome to the superman science scienceato i mandrel superman and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor less freedman doctor locks freedman is an expert in electrical in computer engineering artificial intelligence and robotics he as also the host of the less freedman podcast which initially started as a podcast focus on technology and science of various kinds including computer science and physics but rapidly evolved to include guess and other topics as a matter of focus including sport for instance doctor lets freedman is a blackest in brazilin jujitsu and he said numerous question who come from the fields of brazilin jujitsu from the coaching side and from the competitor side he also has shown an active interest in topics such as chess and essentially anything that involves intense activation and engagement of the mind and or body in fact elects freeman podcast has evolved to take on very difficult topics such as mental health he is had very psychiatrists and other guess on that relate to mental health and mental illness as well as guests focus on geopolitics and some of the more controversial issues that face our times he is had comedians he is had scientists he is had friends he is had enemies on his podcast locks has a phenomenal i would say a one in an eight billion ability to find these people make them comfortable and in that comfort both try to understand them and to confront them and to push them that we all learn all of which is to say that lets freedmen is no longer just an accomplish scientist he certainly is that but he as also become one of the more preeminent thought leaders on the planet and if there is anything that really captures the essence of let's freedman it is his love of learning his desire to share with us the human experiences and to broad in that experience that we all may benefit in many ways our discussion during to day's episode captures the many fascist of less freedmen although no conversation of course could capture them all we sit down to the conversation just days after lets return from crane where he deliberately placed himself into the tension of that environment in order to understand the geopolitics of the region and to understand exactly what was happening at the level of the ground and the people there you may notice that he carries quite a lot of both emotion and knowledge and understanding and yet in a very classic let's freedman way you will notice that he is able to fume out of his own experience around any number of different topics and view them through a variety of lenses that first of all everyone feel included but most of love that everyone learns something new that is to gain new perspective our discussion also ventures into the waters of social media and how that landscape is changing the way that science in technology are community it'd we also get into the topics of motivation drive and purpose both finding it and executing on that drive and purpose i should mention that this is episode one hundred of the superman lab podcast and i would be remiss if i did not tell you that there would be no hubereman lab podcast were it not for lets freedman i was a fan of the laces freedmen podcast long before i was ever invited on to the podcast as a guest and after our first recording less was the one that suggested that i start a podcast he only gave me two pieces of advice the first piece of advice was start a podcast and the second piece of advice was that i not just make it me blabbing in to the microphone and staring at the camera i can safely say that i at least followed half of his advice and that i am ever grateful for less both as a friend a colleague an science and now fellow podcast for making the suggestion that we start this podcast i already mentioned a few of the topics covered on to day's podcast but i can assure you that there is far more to the person that many of us know as elect's freedman if you are somebody interested in artificial intelligence engineering or robotics to day's discussion is most certainly for you and if you are not but you are somebody who is interested in world politics and more importantly the human experience both the individual and the collective human experience let shares what can only be described as incredible insisted into what he views as the human experience and what is optimal in order to derive from our time on this planet before you begin it'd to emphasize tat this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back electrolyte ratio of one thousand milligrams that one graham of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that element doc come slash superman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element el event dot come slash supermen and now for my discussion would doctor lets freedmen welcome back it is got to be bag in a bedroom this feels abhorrent set i apologize to open that way ill never been appoint as i should admit this our studio has been renovated here we are for the monumental recording of episode one hundred episode one hundred of the german ladpodcast which was inspired by the less freedmen podcast some people ray know this story but it'll repeat it again for those that do not there would not be a human ladpodcast were not for let freedmen because after recording as a guest on his podcast a few years ago he made the suggestion that i start podcast and he explained to me how it works and he said you start upcast but just make sure that it is not you laying the whole time drew and i only sore to follow the advice ye will you surprised surprised me surprised the world that you are able to talk for hours and sight some of the best science going on and be able to give people advice without many interruptions or edits a any of that i mean that takes an incredible mot of skill you probably borne with an some of it is developed i mean that the whole science communities as proud o you man standard is proud of you yes is a beautiful thing of really surprising was it is unclear how scientists can do a great podcast that is not just shooting the shade about rand himself but really is giving very structure good advice this boiling down the stay the art science into something that is actually useful for people that tels impressive is a holy ship ye she pulled thesoff and doing it every week on a different topic that i mean you do not ism usually positive especially for people love and support but dam i thought there is no ways can be able to pull this a week after week ins been only getting better and better and better had a whole rant on recent podcast i to get with who of how also you are with a dona a kalubishes a emotion recognition person a i person and then she did not know a who were and music all do me your image when this whole rant to how him years is carious l ism very gratified to hear this a ma it is i little uncomfortable for me to here but listen ism ism just really happy if people are getting information that they an can make actionable and it was inspired by you and look right back at you i am give followed a number of you are structural formats i a tire i do not wear a tie ism costly reminded about this by my father he says what it saw my pop stings i quay do not you dress properly your friend let he literally said that am and a to debate the got back an forth but none the less i how is a feel up wandered how does it feel i can imagine your your here you hear after many episodes done much i mean the number of hours which is just inlaying the amount of passion the on o work you put into this whats i feel am it feels great am and it feels very much the the horizon is still at the same distance in front of me every episode i dustryand get information there and the process if we talked about your podcast we will not go into it of am collecting information distilling it down to simp simple notes walking around listening to music trying to am figure out wat the motifs are and then as just you i do not use a teleprompter or anything that there is very menial notes feels great and i love it and again ism just grateful to you a for inspiring it and i just want to keep going and do more of it and i should say i am also relieved that we are sitting here because you recently went oversees to i very am intense war's own literally to you crane and am the entire time that you were there a i was genuinely concerned am the worlds a unpredictable place in general and a we do not always get the only vote and what happens to us first of all welcome back safely one piece one alive piece and am what was that i mean as at a broad level at a specific level a what drew you there what surprise o you and am how do you think it change you an in coming back here think there is a lot to say but first it is really good to be back one of the things that when you go to a difficult part of the world or part of the world has going tho something difficult you really appreciate how great it is to be an america everything the easy access to food despite what people think the a stable reliable rule of law the lack of corruption in that you can trust that if you started business or if you take on various pursuits in life that there is not going to be at scale manipulation of your efforts such that you cannot succeed that this can of you do not capitalism is in it is a the ideal of capitalism is really still bringing bright es country and it really makes to appreciate those aspects and all suggest the a a believe to have a home for generations across generations you can have a your grandfather live in ana kentucky in a certain city and a his children live there and you live there and you just continues on and on that is of the kind of thing you can have when you do not have war because war destroys entire communities it destroys the histories generations life stays that stretch across the generations ain't anyone think about that until you said just now but photographs a heard drives get destroyed or just abandon right libraries an me nowadays things exist in the cloud but there still lot of material goods that you know are irreplaceable even in rural parts of the united states that on exist in the cloud i a lot of people still well even in towns they still love the physical photoalblum of your family a lot of people still store their photographs of families in the sit tho a via just haves in all that nonstop had but i think there many things have learned and really felt the lessons one of which is nobody gives the damn when your photos are gone and all that kind of stop your house is gone the thing time and time again i saw for people that lost everything is how happy they are for the people they love the the friends the family that are still alive that the only thing they talk about that in fact they do not mention actually with much dramatic a sort of vigor about the promo of losing your home there just nonstop saying how lucky they are that person ex person we is still here and that makes you realize that when you lose everything its t it makes you realize what really matters which is the people in your life i are not a lot of people kind of realize that later in life when your face in mortality when you facing your death or you get a cancer diagnosis that cannostop i think people here in america in californium was outwith fires you are you can still lose your home you realized it does not really matter to paying ask but what matters as tho tithe the family the people and one i i think the most intense thing i talk to several hundred people some of which is recorded have really been struggling to put that out cause i to admit myself and it is your talking about thirty forty hours of footage and it is notemotionally struggling as extortion a struggles extremely difficult i talk t a lot of politicians the number two in the country number three it'll be back there to talk to the president to do a three hour conversation those are easy to at it there the really heart felt and thoughtful folks for from different perspectives on the geopolitics of the war but the ones that really hart to add it is grandmas that are in the middle of nowhere they lost everything they still have hope instead of love and some of them have some of them many of them unfortunately have now hate in their heart in february hen a russia invaded you crane this is the thing i realized about war one of the most painful one lessons is that work creates generational hate it you don't we sometimes think about wars a thing that kills people kill civilians kill soldiers takes away live s dangerous people but we do not directly think about the a the secondary tertiary effects of that which last decades which is anyone who is lost the father or mother or a daughter or a son they now hate the not just the individual soldiers of the leaders that invaded their country but the entirety of the people it is not that they hate a ladies queen or hate the russia military they hate russia people that tears the fabric of a thing that for me you do not my might have my families from you crane half my families from russia but there is e i remember the pain the triumph a world for two still resinates through my entire family try and you remember when the rushing in oucranins fought together against this not we invasion youyou remember a lot of that and not to see the fabric of this peoples torn apart completely with hate is very really really difficult for me just a realize that things will just never be the same on this particular cultural historical aspect but also there is many painful ways in which things will never be the same which is we have seen that is possible to have a major hot war in the twenty first century i think a lot of people are watching this china watching this indies watching this united states is watching this and thinking we can actually have a large scale war and i think the lessons learned from that mig be the kind that lead to a major world for three in the twenty first century one of the things i realized watching the whole scene is that we do not know sheet about was gin a happen in the twenty first century and it might we can have the intuition surely there is not to be another way will just coast yet the yependamic at a normal back organ that is but left to remember at the under world wore one in alias i would your willow called it the the war tent all was nobody in ironically in a dark way it was also the the wearing twenties when people believe this there will never be another world war and twenty years after that the the rise in noisy germany a the a charismatic leader the captivated the minds of millions and built up o military that can take on the the whole world and it makes you realize that this is still possible this is this possible and in the the tension you u see the this the media machine the propaganda machine that have gone to see every aspect of it is still sewing that division between america and china between russia an india and then africa has a complicated thing that is trying to figure out whore they wit whore the against and just this tension is building and building and i mes you realize we my the think that my shake human civilization may not be far off that that is a realization get really feel ta me there is m all kinds of clothe lessons and one of which is propaganda is the got to a i get a lot of letters females and o some of them are full of really intense language full of hate from every side toward me a what well the hate is towards me as representing side ex and ex stands as a variable for every side either on a kolinsky show or ism a prudent she or ism a dato show or ism an a america a america so in america empire show or i may a democrat or republican cause it is already been in this country politicized i think there is a sense of you crane is this place that is full of corruption why we are sending money there i think that is kind of the messaging n the o the republican side on the democratic side a living keeping a track of the actual messaging in the conspiracy theories and and the narratives but they are the tension is there and i get the feel it directly and would you get to really experiences there is a large number of narratives that all are extremely confided themselves that they know the truth people are convinced first of all that den not being lie to people in russia think there is no propaganda they think that yes yes there's state spots a propaganda be were all smart enough to ignore the the a the sort of lane propaganda that is everywhere they know we can think on our own were know the truth and everybody kind of speaks in this way every in the united states says well yes there is pastry media they are full of messaging and propaganda but we were smart we can think on our own of course we see through that ever everybody says this and in the conclusion of their thought is often hatred towards some group whatever that group is and the more you have lost the more intense the the feeling of hatred it is a really difficult a field to walk through calmly and with an open mind and and try to understand what is really going on t it superintends that is the only words they come to mind em as i hear this you mention something that it seems that hate generalizes it is against an entire group or n entire country a why do you think it is that hate generalizes and that love may or may not generalizes have had one of as you can imagine the kind of question i asked as d you have love or hate in your heart as a question i asked almost everybody and then i would dig into this exact question the you asking i think some of the most beautiful things have heard which is people that are full of hate are able to self introspect about it they they know they should not feel it but they cannot help it it is not they know that ultimately the thing that helps them and helps everyone is to feel love for fellow man but there they have they cannot help it they know it is a drug is alike hate a escalates it is a vicious spiral if just cannot help it and the question i also asked as do you think you will ever be able to forgive russia and after much thought almost it is a it is split but most people will say now i will never be able to forgive and because of the generalization you talk about early that could even include all right all that payments they mean all ruffians because a because if you do nothing that is as bad or worse than a than then being part of the army that invades the the people there just sitting there the good german the people there just quietly going on with their lives you are just as bad ifs not worse is there perspective earlier you said that a going over to the eucraness now a allowed you to realize just many of the positives of being here in the united states i have a good friend we both know i i will not name it by name but we communicated the three of us from there one special operations he spent years doing deployments really amazing individual and i remember when the pandemic hit he said on a ten thread america are not use to the government interfering with their plans yet around the world many people are familiar with governments dramatically interfering with their plans sometimes what even in a seemingly random way here we were not braced for that there i mother her we get speeding tokens and theirs lines to vote in things that but a i think the pandemic was one of the first times at least in my life that nonmember where it really seem the government was impeding what people naturally wanted to do and that was a shock for people here and a i have a an what might seem a somewhat won done question but it is something that i saw and sociamedia lot of people were asking me to ask you and a and i was curious about t too a what was a typical dislike over there were you sleeping in a bed were you sleeping on the ground everyone seems to want to know what were you eating were you reading once a day were you reading your stake or were you were you in fairly deprived conditions over there i saw a couple foots that you posted it out of doors in front of rubble pit helmet on in one case it a what what was that typical dislike over there there is there is two modes one of them i spend a lot of time in we of which is much safer than you may be obvious to stay but for people who do not know it is in the middle of the country in its much safer than the actual front that the word the battle is happening themuch much safe for the we of even is revive which is the western part of the country the times i spend key of or fundamentally different in the time i spent at the front and i went to the human region which is where a lot of really heated battle was happening there is several areas oh harkuve it is in north east of the country and en there is donnas region which the east of the country and then there is human region which a bathe ism not good a geography a is the south east of the country n that is where at least when i was there was a lot of really heated fighting happening when i was in the human region there is its what you would imagine the place i i stay to a hotel where all the lives have to s stay off to the entire town all the lights are of if the kind of navigate through the darkness and the leas your fall to shine and on this is terrible for the circadian system yet that is exact always this how can i do this where is my element and a fled greens human i function no i there is a i think it was balanced by the deep appreciation of being alive right coming this is the reason the i ask this the reason i ask is we we get used to all these creature comforts and we do not need them but we often come to depend on them in a way that makes us feel we need them yet but very quickly there something about the intensity of life they seen people's eyes because they living through ward that makes you forget all those creature comforts and it is it was actually i be not somebody who hates travelling an on i love the creature habits a i love i love a the comfort of the ritual i but all that was forgotten very quickly just the the intensity of feeling the intensity of love the people half to each other that was tells obvious it turns of food there is a cure you a depends on what part of the country but usually you basic could have to scammed home ilk nine p m the hard cure you in a lot of places eleven p m at night but by then you li you have to be home in some places tan s at nine piano start i going home which for me was was kind of wonderful also because i get to spend a i get to be forced to spend time alone as think for many hours an now wherever ism staying which which is belly nice an every dis a calmness in the quietness to the whole thing in terms of food wants a day just the food is n'tcredibly cheap and incredibly delicious people are still one of the things they can still take pride in is a making the best possible food they can meat but they do admire america meats o the meat is not as great as it could be in that country but i borsch every day all that konnistov mostly meat spend the entire day wake up in the morning with coffee spend the entire day talking of people which for me is very difficult because of the intensity of the stories one after the other after the other would just talk to regular people talk to soldiers talk to politicians a all kinds of soldiers i talk to people there cord do not resubmissions america i hung out with a him kenned i ye great him kenned the crates manned who a also within and many others reveal to me one of the many reasons ism proud to be in america is ho am trained and skilled and effective america soldiers are and i h guess the pap for listeners this podcast may should familiarize them with the timcennedy is can i realize that that number of them will now i day do that a how do you try to summarize a man the it in in a a butts we can be accurate but not exhaustive as we as any good at a good data or accurate when on exhausted a very skilled and accomplish him an may fighter very skilled in accomplish special former special operations area america patriot and a potcastor too r does he have on podcast maybe ki maybe we know any stump as his own pact yes gets amaze was yet is great yet a clearing hot podcast with in stones but also i canneries a the embodiment of america into the to the most beautiful in the most ridiculous degree he is a would you imagine what is the you america that a i just imagine him shirtless on a tank rolling into anima territory just screaming at the top of as long's is just his personality but not pestering that is at h yet he does the work as they a that as to thing he really embodies that now some of that is just is personality humor it'd to sort of comment on the humor of things not just with him it is very one other interesting thing of learn but i also when he is actually helping people the extremely good at what he does which is building teams that rescue that go into the most dangerous areas of yeucrane dangerous areas anywhere else and they get the job done and but one of the thingsthat heard time and time again which which really interesting to me that eucranian soldiers said that you do not compare in eucranian russia and america soldiers america soldiers are the bravest which was very interesting for me to hear given how high the morals for the crania soldiers but that just reveals that training enables you to be brave it is not just about how well trade they are in on it is how intense and ferocious they are in the fighting and they makes you realize this is america army not just to the technology especially the special special for guides they still is one of the most effective and terrifying armies in the world and ism listen just for context ism somebody who is for the most part aunt war a passivism but you get the see ait as some of the realities of work find a wake you up to what needs to get done to protect a sovereignty to protect some the values to protect e civilians and homes in all lie onistov sometimes the war has to happen and i show also mention o the russianside because well i have not got to experience the russia side yet i do fully planned to travel to russia as have told everybody else very upfront with everybody about this i i would to hear the story of ruffians but i do know from the eurnianside the grandmas i love grandmas they told me stories that the ruffians really the ones that entered their villages they really really believe there save me crane from nates from not the occupation they feel that there is the a crane is under control of not the organizations and their they believe their saving the country that is their brothers and sisters i think i think propaganda and i think a truth is a very difficult thing to rive is in in that warn i think in the twenty first century when i thinks you realize that much of war even more than in the past is an information war and a people they just used twitter for their source of information light be surprised to know how much misinformation there is twitter real a narratives being sold and is its really hard to know who to believe and through all that yet to try to keep in open mind and all ultimately in ore the powerful and listen to actual citizens actual people that is the other may be obvious lesson is that ta work waged by powerful rich people and that is the poor people that suffer and that is just visible time in time again you mention the fact that people still enjoy food or the pleasure of cooking or there is occasional humor or maybe frequent humor no jock willing as talked about this and in warfare and the that the all the elements of the human spirit and conditions still emerge at various times mindless amazing and yuan i have had conversations about this before but the the aperture of the mind i that classic story that comes to mind is a to the one of victor frankly or nelson mandala you know you put somebody into a small box of confinement and some people break under those conditions and other people find entire stories within us centimeter of concrete that can occupy them and it real stories and richness or humor or love or fascination and surprise and i find this stor interesting that the mind is adaptable we to aby creature comforts and the lack of creature comforts and the way that o we can adapt and and yet humans are always striving it seems or one would hope for these better conditions to better their conditions as you have come back and you have been here now beckon the in the states for hew long after your try i depends on this pocastalis but its a felt have nevertheless a practically speaking a compose end we will not be shy we recording this midseptember a but it we actually recorded this several years ago anger anticipating features in sushi is osimulatinyui'm sighing forgone out what that actually means it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve am delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there in i story taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiatics that i need for got health or god is very important as populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probation unathletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptegens vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes right if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car a plain et camera and the will give you a year supply of vote him in d three k too again that that letter green stop calm slat hubormen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply o vote him index three k to i know i speak for many people when i say that we are very happy that your back we know that is not can be the first and last trip that there will be others and that you will be going to russia as well and and presume the other places as well in order to explore and i have to say is a podcast and as your friend i was really inspired that yet your sense of adventure and your sense of not just adventure but thoughtful respectful adventure you understood what you ware doing you ware not just going there to get some wore time footage your something this was not a kick where a thrill this is really serious and remain serious m thank you for doing it and please a next time you go bring tom kenned o and again i i elect i penny gets you into what will take because he really lows going the most dangerous places and helping people i think you git me into more trouble in is wore than i should mention that i me there is many reasons i went but i s deafening to something i take lightly or want to do can ism som doing things that i do not want to do i just feel i have to compelled i do not think there is now it'll dating talk about it as we all should there's different areas of the world that are seeing a lot of suffering yet and otherwhere is many atrocities going on the world to day but this one is just a personal to me i want to i feel con qualified just because of the language most of the talking by the way a been was doing it was in russia and because the language because of the my history i fell i have to do this particular thing i think it is in many ways stupid and dangerous and that was mad clear to me but i do many things of this nature because the heart says pop a posts was that but also there is a there is a freedom to not ism afraid of death but i think there is a freedom to a it is almost o k if i die i want to take full advantage of not having a family currently i feel when you have a family ye there's responsibility for others you immediately become more conservative and careful i feel in i want to take full advantage of this particular moment in my life when you can be a little bit more accepting of risk we should definitely reproduce at some point am may be the before next time you should is free some sperm i a really a thing is that we do with the ice bath as at of that works it is interesting heres there is always an opportune to s a science protocols that there are products on the internet and the i shall a few decent manuscripts looking how cold exposure can increase testosterone levels but i t does not happen by the cold directly a good scientists as the authors of those papers wherein are realize that it is the vase of constriction and then the am these a dilation as that as people warn up again there is increase blood float of the testicles and in women it seems ta probably increase blood flow to the reproductive organs as well after people worn back up that seems to cause some sort of a hyper nourishment of the o the serious cells the sir tolan light cells of the testes that lead to increase output of tostosteronan and women a testosterone is well a the cold exposure in any case am is obviously a do you do the ice bath you an n have not as a russia i consider at a hot a y exactly a yet it is it is a nice thing to a have fun with every once in while a to warm up no have not done at been kind waiting to maybe do together with the yuitsome point great i get have not died that one were i into weed straight forward for you i always say that adrenalin comes in waves and save you to thing about it walls you are goingthrough a number of walls of a adrenaline as pussy going for time becomes rather trivial with the ergigets you bacon one a you immediately recognize the physiological sensation even though it it is cold specifically it is the adrenaline that makes you want to hop out of the thing and i you seen does a sir jo set up early nice a man cave or it is as name in cave was it is big it is a a network of man caves but it has a ice bath and sand next each other we have one of those here i batman sea swill have to get you in it when a one of these days means anatrable maybe to morrow no though there is a a a i do not know the underlying physiological basis but there does seem to be a a trend toward truth telling in the sea ism some people refer to them as truth barrels minds a barrel sand ship a barrel who knows why maybe under intense heat dearest people just a feel compelled to share they we i have a complicated relationship bananas because of all the way cutting a see which some of the deepest sufferings are t interrupt have done was in the sand that is verbs i may have gone to some dark places in son they may wrestle my whole live duty rights and those way cuts a can really test the mind you your in truth telling yes a certain kind of truths incase you are sitting there in the clock moves slower than it has ever moved in your life yes o i usually for the most part i would try to you know have a much sweats garbage bags nail the cannastuff and run it's easier cause you can distract the mine in the sand you cannot distract the mind is just you an all the excuses in all the the all the weaknesses in your minds is coming to the surface and you are just sitting there it is sweating or not wetting that is the worse and talk about is yuan capture you are in a small box it also inspires some closer cobia even if you are not closer comic am that is a absolutely true and the desire to just get out of the thing is were the address you get a pretty serious o dental in surge from from in the sands well it u now the san actually well it will not deplete tests from but it kills sperm for people that sermon a sixty day sperm cycle if you are tried o do not are not sperm er access will got us on to this or fertilize an egg were eggs in whatever format dish in vive as we say in science that which means a well you can look it up folks at the sixty day spermcyclesif you go into a really hot sand u or a hot bath or a hot tub your in sixty days those sperm are going to be am a significantly greater portion that will be dead will be non viable m there is a simple solutions be put ice pack down there or a jar not this jar but a jar of cold fluid know between their likes in i sit there and or they go back and forth between the ice path and the sand but yet you probably ifyouren to go back over there am you should free sperm we are going to do a couple episodes on fertility when it is get real of he inexpensive and your young pushup i do it now cause there is a a association with autism is mails get older it is not a strong one it is significant but it still a small contribution to dating foam your age do not sperm get wiser or is no as de bat the now but men can conceive healthy children and considerable age but in any case a but now they do not get wiser if the what happens is in mirin age that what it is a little it it the maturation of the brain in the sense that some of the sperm get much better hat swimming an then many of them yet yet less good motility's of is a strong corselet of the liana and the sperm this is probably good time to announce that ism selling my sperm as a anxieties i the o much that o i guess eating the a well your children your future children and my future children as was to do jujitsu tog ether since have only done the one you gets class ism strongly vested in a you having children es but only in the friendly kind of way well yes friendly competition kind of way yet prominent of the clan yet for sure a moving on to science but still with our minds in the crane did you encounter any scientists or see any universities or as we know in this country and in rope an in elsewhere you science takes in for structure you need buildings you need laboratories you need robots you need a lot of equipment and you need minis mighty freezers and you need incubators and you need money and you need technicians and typically it is been the wealthier countries that have ben able to do more research for sake of research and development of a improctization certainly the you crane had some marvelous universities and a marvelous scientists what is going on with science and scion scientists over there and a and gosh can we even calculate the loss of discovery that is a cursing as the consequence of this conflict science goes on the before the war you crane had a very vibrant tax sector that which means engineering in all the kanistov a key of has a lot of excellent universities and they still go on the the biggest hit i would say is not the inform structure of the sins but the fact because of the high moral everybody is joining the military everybody's going to the front to fight including you and your hubormen would be fighting and not because you have to but because you want to and everybody know would be really proud that your fighting even though everyone tries to convince drew hubormen you have much better ways to contribute a there is deep honor in fighting for your country yes but there better ways to contribute to your country than just picking up a on that you are not that trained with and going to the front still they do it a scientists engineers see of professors student men and writers men and women a obviously primarily men but men and women a much more than you would seen and other militaries women are everybody everybody wants to fight everybody's proud of fighting there is no discussion of of kind of passivism should we be fighting this this right is this it is everybody's really proud of fighting that that is a there is this kind of black hole that pulls everything all the resource into the war effort that is not just financial but also a psychological it is a if you're scientist it feels will it feels a a almost your dishonoring humanity by containing to do things you were doing before that's a lot of people that converted being soldiers they literally watch at you do video of how to shut a particular gun how to armor drop with a grenade if you're attack person how to work were drops you going to use that use whatever skills you got figure out whatever skills you got and how to use them o to help the effort on the front and that is a big hit but that said that you have talk to a lot of folks in key of a faculty primarily in the tececonomics space i did not get a chance toe interact with folks who are on the biology chemistry your a science side of things but that that that is still goes on one of the really impress of things about you crane is that they are able to maintain in for structure road food supply all that nonstop education while the wars going on especially key of the worse started we ere nobody knew whether key of is can be taken by the russia forces he was surrounded and om a lot of experts from outside were convinced that russia would take key of and and they did not in one of one of the really impress of things as a leader one of things i really experiences that a lot of people criticized kolinsky before the war he only had about thirty percent approval rate a lot of people did not selensky buts one of the great things he did as a leader which ism not sure many leaders would be able to do is when key of was clearly being invaded he chose to stay hes stay in the capital everybody all the a the america military the intelligence agencies dato his own staff advisers all told him to flee and he stayed and that is i think that was a beacon a simple for the rest for the universities for science for for the inform structure that we are staying to and a that kept the whole thing going there is an interesting social experiment that happened i think for folks for interesting sort of gun control in this country in particular is a one of the decisions they made early on is to give guns to everybody a semiautomatics early on in the world early on in the work i to everybody got a gun ah they also released the much of prisoners from from prison because there as no staff to o to to a on to keep the prisons running and there is a very interesting psychological experiment of how is this god a go everybody has a gun a dinging that robbing places tat they going to start taking advantage of a chaotic situation and what happened is that crime went to zero turned out that this as an experiment worked wonderfully that is a case were love generalized yes for at least hate did not we do not how it is lover it sort of lack of initiative herself you do not common culture directed e yea i do not i right it is we i i think that is a very correct to say that it was not hate that was unifying people it was love of country love of community it is the probably same thing tat all happening humans when aliens invade is wall it is it is a the common effort everybody puts everything else a to the side bless just i the sheeramount of guns it is much texts you realize well there is going to be a self correcting mechanism very quickly because the rule of law was also put aside right got basically the police force lost a lot of power because every ease's guns and the kind of taking the law into their own hands and that system at least in this particular case in this particular moment in human history worked said in resting lesson i no i did it is i had an interesting contrast that will share with you i as you mention texts not long ago i was in listen often visit you or others an busting as and am many doors that i walked past including a school said a no firearms pass this point you as a sticker on the door you see this on hospitals sometimes i saw this at bailer college medicine et camera a for relatively common to see in texts m not common in californium a and then i flew to the semmersescobaria was walking by an elementary school in my old neighborhood and saw similar sticker and looked at it it said a now peanuts or other orgy containing foods pass this point on the door of this elementary school quite a different contrasty n guns in peanuts am now penadologies obviously are very serious for some people altho there is great research out staffer showing that early exposure to peanuts am can prevent theology that is a but do not start rubbing yourself in pen butterfolks if you have a hematology that not the best way dead with it in any case the contrast of what is dangerous the contrast of am the familiarity with guns verses no familiarity non is real an elsewhere you see machine guns an the airport in germany frankfurt you see machine guns on the a but not common in the united states again there is i feel lie there is this aperture a vision there is this aperture of pleasures and great verses creature comforts and lack of a creature comforts and then there is this aperture of of danger right am people who were familiar with gummy ware familiarity people coming in setting their fire on the table and eating eating dinner but in you are not accustomed to that it is jawing i i she shall mention the people know this throw human history but the humanability to a get a assimilated a i get use to violence is incredible i a you could be living in a peaceful time were here now and there's be one explosions a nine eleventype of situation that be a huge shock it terrifying every freaks out the see one as a huge drop off in how y freaked out you get and would in the matter of day sometimes ours it becomes the not of the normal hive talked to many people in a harkave which is one of the times at seen a lot of heated battle you ask om is it safe there fact when i went to the closer and close to the wars on ask people is it safe and their answers usually e pretty safe it is all signal the noise yet it nobody is told me except western reporters sitting in the west side of you crane it is really dangerous here overalls i ye you don is good a my uncle's died yesterday you is shot butts pretty its pretty good the the farm still running that the they a how do i put it they folks on the positive that is one but it is there is a deeper truth at which just get used to difficult situations in the stuff they make you happy an tour they make you upset is relative to that new normal the u establish w i grew up in californium there area lot of earthquakes i remember the end in quake i remember they market ore are free we call pancaking on top of people in cards i remember a i move to southern californium this north richquake wherever i move there seem to be earthquakes i never worry about earthquakes ever i just do not in fact i do not the destruction they cause but ever once while an earthquake will roll through an is kind of exciting it is smiling a train coming touts like wile the earth is moving again i do not want any one to get harmed but i i enjoy a good rumble coming through none the less am this signal the noise but if i saw tornado free out in people from he modest are probably comfortable with youon't can gable the great result from the west of t and have never met but i have great respect for he is probably anus it see tornados o ya e maybe no i think signal the noises is real am before i neglect although i will not forget am speaking of signal the noise and environment you are returning to or have gone back to one of your original am natural habitats which is the massachusettes in its do of technology which is you habits is it usually difficult to pronounce in full m i tea right you have been spending some time their teaching am and doing other things tell us what you are up to with them i tea recently but it is ism ism really glad that you being on on the less coast know the differenceseeng a boss in new york i feline a lot it a east coast i it is a o different it is o gradually to tonincin york rs a oi on ye i i love it i get a gave a lectures there in front of a in person crowd well we talking at for the ay i different aspects of they i and you do not robotics machine learning machine learning for people who know the artificial intelligence field that youyou do not use the term may i the people from outside you say eyes the biggest break therms in the machine learning field wit some discussion of robotics and on yetis in person is is wonderful at ism a succor for that i really avoid to teaching or any kind of interaction at your bovid because a people put a lot of emphasis on but also go comfortable with remote teaching and i think nobody enjoyed it except sort of there is a notion that it is much easier to do because you don't to you know you have to travel you don't the you can do what i in your prejaimas kind of thing but when you actually get to do it you do not get the same kind of joy that you do when your teaching as a student you do not get the same kind of joy of learning it is not as effective and all that aims though to been person together with people to see their eyes to get their excitement to get the questions in all the interactions that was some and is ism still a a succor and a believer in the the idea of i my tee of the university i thinks at incredible place there is something in the air i still but you really hit e the pandemicate universities thought hard because and i can say this is not u saying is is me saying it a that administrations as in all cases where people criticized institutions the pandemic has given more power to the administration and taken away power from the faculty in the student and that is the from everybody involved including the administration that is a concern because the university is about the teachers in the students that is to be primary and whenever you have a pandemic there is an opportunity increase him on rules one of the things that really bothered me and it'll scream from the top of the a i mi to dome about this is have instituted in you a titmice system which is if your visitor to the campus that i my tee you have to register yet to first o ill show that your vaccinated but more importantly there is a process to visiting your unpin to get permission to visit one of the reasons that loved at my tea i some other stations a my tea just leaves the door open to any one classes you can roll in the ridiculous characters the students that are kind o usually doing business stull for economics can roll into physics class an just you cannon aloud but it is a gray arias youthayou let that happen and that creates a flourishing of e community thus beautiful and i think adding extra rules i puts a squeeze on in limits some of the of the flourishing and i hope some of that dissipates over time as we cut a let go of a the risk aversion that was created by the pandemic as we cannot enter than you the normal return back some of that flourishing can happen but when your actual in there with the students a was is magic i love it i love it what sol me your earliest of idiot on your outdo chant were were of you in the class room wright is tell this all started yet he's all you to putting stuff on a on to was as terrifying i like well s for she at the time when you did it again you are a pioneer in that sense and you did that your in person did that putting up lectures am is idea would i teach still every every winter i teach i direct or course and all it'll be doing even more teaching going forward but am the idea of those idiot being on the web is is a ye that spikes my corners altho but less terrifying as you get the and everybody has ha different experience that for me being a junior give recur sine to s the the kind of natural concerns i who my when i was given this lectures i do not deserve any lo your humility coming through and think the humility ion the part of an structure is good because that those that think that they are entitled and who else who else could this lecture then i worry more t i think it is i once heard i do not know if it is still true that the a at attack ring the great californium instituted acknowledge not far from here that many the faculty your actually afraid of the students i not physically afraid but they are intellectually afraid because the students are smart and teaching there can be downright frightening have heard but that is great keeps everybody on their toes and i think and yo i have been corrected in lecture before at standard and elsewhere what when my live was a you see sanding where sone will say it a last lecture you said this and i you said that it were on the podcast and and i think it is that moment where you sometimes feel that that urged to defend o you are you are right and i think depends on how one was train my grate advisor was wonderful at saying i do not know all the time and she went to a hazard radcliff a you see a salmon called in brilliant woman and had no promising a i do not have that promise sit to guise that somebody speaks o grab drag mot of never seem again everybody is really supporter i one you understand that that the amount of love an support i get especially when the last few students are there and everybody seems to e nodding as ye i think that am it'd love to site on one o your lectures i know very little about a i machine learning or robotics am but gave talk that i might yo have you ever like a given lecture o ya in when i went on the job market from as a faculty member my final to choices were between a my t p cower i handed an on paper offer wonderful place wonderful place to do nor science and you see sanding which is a wonderful sorry science program in the end it made sense from me be on the west coast for personal reasons but this am amazing narial science going on there goodness and that is always been true and is going to continue it been a long time since have been invited back there oddly enough when i star doing more podcasting and i still run a lab but i i drunk my lab considerably when i was doing as a donemore podcasting receive fewer academic lecture invites which makes sense but now their sort of coming back and when people invite now i ways say to yo do you want me to a talk about the ventral falemiss and its rolling a anxiety and aggression or to you i want me talk by the podcast and my big fear is omen to go back to give a lecture about the rat n a something it'll start off with an athletic greens read or something legist reflectively i just getting that would not happen but isn't i think it is great to continue to put keep afoot in both place that i was happy to hear that your teaching it i mig tea because podcasting is one thing teaching is another and there is overlapped there in the vendiagram but am listen he students they get to sit in on one your lectures and you may see me sitting the in the audience soon when i creep into your class a some glasses youths right wearing a red shirt a you will not recognize me ah will are certainly a receiving a great gift i have watched your lectures on you to even early once and a listen a i i know you to be a phenomenal teacher yet there is something about some also doing milk they sit a pretty late last night a working for a did can on a paper one of the things that i hope to do for popery the rest of my life is is to continue publishing and i think its realize important to do that even if a you continue the pokes because you want to be just on your own intellectual and scientific journey as you do potgassing as a at least for me and especially on the engineering sic as i want to build stuff and i think that i keeps your seagoing check keeps you humble because i think if you talk too much on h mikufon you star getting a you might loose track of a o the grounding that comes from engineering from science in the scientific process in the criticisms that you get all that cost and how slow and iterative is we have two papers right now theatre in the revision stage that's been a very long road and i was as this recently because i met with my chairman he said you want to continue run a laborious just into potful time on the podcast and standard has been very supportive i must say as i know an myth has been of you of you ah and i said ow i absolutely want to continue to be involved in research into research and we star time at these papers wand were looking over my this was my yearly review an looking back like goodness these papers have been in play for a very long time it is a long road but you you learn more and more and the more time you spend my optically looking in at the bunch of data that the more you learn in the more you think i i tolly agree you a talking into these devices for potassic wonderful was a it is fond it relieves a certain itch that we both have and ism holy it land some important in formation out there for people but doing research is is the and i ended you guess if there is that the the the unfeeling of the onion knowing that there could be something there there just nothing it ant you do especially with the pandemic and but but for me both twitter and the pots have made me much more impatient about the slowness of the review process because a witder'll do that the twist the but even with pots you you have a cool you will find something cool and you have ideas and all and you'll just say them and it'll be out pretty quickly there we o w host right now about something tat we both found interest and its out in the world ye and you can write up something a there is a culturing computer science of posting stuff arrive and a reprice that do not get in your review and somethings that do not open go to the w process ever because i people just tart using them with its code and sike what with wit was the point end this it works the self evident that it works because people are using it and that that i think applies more change engineering feels potence an actual tool at works it of a matter of you might to scientifically prove that it works it works is using for lot of people what serge interrupt it a just it it for point of reference the famous paper describing the double heels which are and wagon in crib the about prize and am should have earned slim franklin noble price too of course but they got it am for the structure of dona of course that paper was never reviewed at nature they published it because it is importance was self evident or whatever a o senator the editors it was that purely editorial decision i believe i mean that is what i was told by some one whose currently an federate nature am if that turns out to not be correct some one will tell us in the comments for sure or think have a pretty interesting i have is perhaps the most significant discovery and biology and by engineering it would leading to by engineering is was well of course of the last century was not pure reviewed yet but the a quite tine but many others of have talked about this which is m every people understand how poor the pure of o processes si just the amount of cause you think pure review means all the best peers get together and they review yourself but that is unpaid work as usual a small number of people and a very they've a very select perspective they may not be the best personspeci of i supernova work and is who has time to do it a man a bunch of editorial words still why i do not know but i enjoy he pure review process and and papers out oftentimes the best scientists are very busy and do not have time to review and oftentimes a the more proper journals will select from a and of a unique kit of very good scientists who are very close to the work sometimes to be hear very far from the work they really dm both have negatives right if your very close to the work there is jealousy in all those basic human things very far from the work you may not appreciate the the new ants contribution all that wins tell and their psychologist are to interrupt again but a good friend of mine who extremely successful nor a scientist toward he is investigator et camera always told me that a they i will not event say whether or not a who they are they select the reviewers on the basis of who has been a publishing very well recently cause they assume that person is t to be more benevolent because their they have been doing well that the a the love expands a point to that actually a but the the ideas that editors might actually be the best reviewers that that was the traditional that is that is the thing slang to mention the air why sin talks about that back a several decades o go editors had much more power and there is something to be made for that key editors are the ones who are responsible for crafting the journal they really are invested in this and it and they're also often experts right t make sense for an edit to have a bit of power in this case sike usually if a ideas truly novel you could see it and ha it is it makes sense for an editor to have more power in that regard of course for me i i think pure view should be done the way treats a done which is a crowd source or amazon of you let the crowd o i the crowd decide and let let the crowd ad depth and breaths in in context before the contribution am you do not if the paper overstates the degree of contribution the crowd will check you on that a if there is not enough support or the conclusions are not supported by the evidence the crowd will check you on that i the our there could be of course a political bickering that enters the picture as pigeon very controversial topics but i think i trust the intelligence of human beings to figure that out and i think most of sit a trying to figure this whole process out i just wish was happening much faster because on the important topics the review psycho could be could be faster and we learn that the covet that twitter was actual pretty effective it doing since communication is really interesting some some of the best scientists took to twitter to communicate their own work and other people's work and always putting into the cannot that's not on the per o viewed and on but it is it is all out there and the at has just moves fast and if you want stuff to move fasts twitter is the best meaning of communication for that is cool to say ism now on tits or more regularly initially was just in serum and i remember we you and i use to have these a over over dinner drink conversations were it'd say i do not understand twitter and you would say i do not understand in stria of course we understand how it worked and how to work each respective platform but i think we were both trying to figure out a what is driving the psychology of these different vanusecause they are quite distinct psychologies am for whatever reason i think ism finally trying to understand twitter and enjoy it a little bit initially i was not a prepared for the level of kind of a reflective scrutiny an that i sounds little i bit oxygen more sonic but that people can lie pick up on one small thing and then you drive it down that that trajectory did not seem to be happening quite as much on instergram but i love your treats i i do have a question about your your your twitter a account and how you do you have serve internal filters of what you will put up and will not put up i because sometimes you will put up things that about life and reflections other times you will put up am things what you excited about in ah i or of course you know on point to very spot casts including your own but but others as well now what do how do you approach social media not how to you regulate your behavior on there in terms of how much time at camera i know love talked about that before but what is your mind set around social media when you go on there to i either a post or forage or respondent information i think i try to add some not to sound cricket but some love i there into the world into as odious siphon calls it told a world a i think there is this viral negativity that can take hold and i try to find the right language to add no good vibes out there and its ecru really really tricky because it there is something about positivity that sounds fake and'not i cannot quite put my finger on it but whenever i talk about love and an positive and almost child in my curiosity and positivity people are start to think surely he as skeletons in the closet there is dead bodies in his basement this must be a agnatic it is the attic the attic i keep mine in the basements a details already your at don't nave a attic for abasement o nor a dead bodies it is do not be very clear yet i do have a fanatic and a i shul have not been up maybe there is bodies up there but yes i full i prefer the basements folded down there i it a no but there is an sumption that this is not genuine or not a its is disingenuous in some kind of way and i ta try to find the right language for that con stop u to i got to be positive some of it i was really inspired by a moon's approach for twitter not all of it but the a when he just is silly i found that a silliness i think it is a german has i said a is something to to paraphrase that on my favorite writers sics es i think in steponof as said ta learn o what is to be taken seriously and a laugh at the rest i think i try to be silly laugh at myself laugh at the absurdity of life and an impart when ism serious tried to just be positive i just we a positive perspective but and also a as you said people pick out certain words and on in the attack each other attack me over certain usage of words in a particular the i think the think i try to do is think positively towards them like do not isolate whenever somebody is criticizing me and on i i just smile its there's a lesson to be learned o i learn it and ten i just send good vibes their way do not respond and just hopefully sort of a through karma and to kind of the ripple effect of a positivity have a piano an impact on on them in the rest of twitter and you find is that builds your actions create the community how i behave gives me surrounded by certain people but lately especially you cranes one topic this i also thought about talking to somebody rest to mes drew take who is extremely controversial all if from the prospect of a lot of peoples a misogynist and i have heard his name and i know that there's a lot of controversy around and maybe you could familiarize me have been prey nose down in podcast break and i try to do this vacation thing for about three four weeks i thought about the ye and am it is sort of work i did get some time in the colored o wilderness but i myself which was great am i did get m some downtime but in any event it i meant mainly consist of reading and a was nature it a reading an nature n a i path working out am good food a elextrasleep these kinds of things i really felt i need it but i am pretty naive when it comes to the kind of current controversies but have heard his name and am i think he is been see platformed on a couple of platforms to i have that right has been i should also admit that while i might know more than you it is not by much it is it is a five year old talking to four year old right now is he an athlete a podcast a basic summary he he used to be a fighter kick box i believe i was pretty successful and an a si during that and after the i think hi was in a reality show and he had all these programs at a basically pick up artist advice he is the i community of people where he gives advice and how to pick up women ho a how to be successful relationships how to make a lot of money and there is a it costs money to enter the those programs a lot of the criticism that he gets is can a it is a appearamend seem where you convinced people to joins that they can make more money and they can since others to join that kanistov but that is not why ism interested in talking to him ism ism interested because one of the guest maybe should mention who but i one of the female guess i had really a big scientist said that her a two kids that r thirteen and twelve really look up to drew a is a a man children may o chant man and i hear this time on time again take he is somebody that a lot of teens young teens look up to i have not done serious research i is try to avoid doing research until i agree to talk and then i go deep but there is an aspect to the way he talks about women that while i understand i understand certain dynamics and relationships work for people and he is want of such person but i think him being really disrespectful towards women is not what i a it is not how i see what he means to be a good man the conversational one to have with him is about masculinity what is masculinity mean in the twenty first century and when i think about that kind of stop and cause you were talking about twitter it is going into wor'sown ism a happy go lucky person but you are not send me a terrane but i do not have this conversation on twitter because it is i is really really really tricky one because also as when you sit when you do a pangas everybody wants you to on to win there is not a it is everything you do is positive maybeou'll say the wrong thing is a inaccurate thing you can correct yourself with a andorra with donaltrom with folks this you will have to i mean it is a professional boxing a the you have to push the person left to be really eloquent ye to be all sympathetic as you cannot just do what journalist do which is talked on of the person the entire time that is easy the hard things to empathize with the person to understand them to steel man their case but also to make your own case in that case about what he means to be a man to me a strong man is somebody who is respectful to women not out of weakness not of social justice warriors signaling in all that kind o stuff but out of that is what a strong man does that the they not need to be disrespectful to prove their position in life he is often not a lot people say it is a character it is it is he is being masagenistic his being a misogynist is a kind of for entertainment purposes an avatar ye but to me that avatar is has a lot of influence on young folks or the character as has a was in pact out i do not think you can separate the avatar in the person a in terms of the impact as you said in fact a there are number of accounts on twitter end in sougamin elsewhere which people have only revealed their first names a they give himself another name or their using air cartoon image and part of that i believe and at least from some of these individuals wo action o who they are i understand as ay an attempt to maintain their privacy which is important to many people a and in some cases am that they can be more inflammatory and then just pop up elsewhere as something else without any one knowing that it is the the same person some of the this is the darkstog have been reading a lot about you crane and a nosy germane of authorities induce forties and on and you get to see how much the a absurdity turns to evil quickly when no things i worry one things i really do not to see twitter in the internet is how many statements and with else it is a you think just because something is kind of funny or is funny or is legitimately funny it also does not have a deep effect on society that is such a difficult great area because some of the best comedy is dark and mean but it reveals some important truth that we need to consider but sometimes comedy is just covering up for a destructive ideality and yet to know the line between those two i hitter was seen as a join the late twenties in in thirties the nosy germany until the joke became very serious yet to be careful to know the difference between the the joke in the reality and do all that i mean in a conversation ism just such a big believer in conversation to be able to reveal something through conversation but i do not know one of the big you knot you and i challenge ourselves all the time i do not know if i i have what it takes to have a a good apathetic but adversarial conversation i need to a learn more about this a take person or not hear or to m at yet some that something may be at something to ship i do not know i cause the and om not familiar with the content but can ask you am whether not you i seek out or whether not you would ever consider ever don of trump as a guest on your poncount yet i i talk to job lot about this and a i i really believe i can have a good conversation with trump i but i have not seen many good conversations with him a pardon me thinks pardon believes it is possible but he often effectively runs over the interviewer i you sit him down give him an element in letting hurry es i know i mean at ice cool er condition a black curtain studio you have got an a a different side might come out context is powerful well a job really good at this which is relaxing person you do not here i have a drink i i smoke a joint whatever it is but some this energy of just lest relax and there is laughter and on i do not think a as people know ism just not good at that ken castoff i think the way i could have a good conversation with him is the really understand his world view be able to steal man as well you and those that support him which is am sorry to say for people who seem to hate nostrum is a very large percentage of the country and you have to really empathize but those people we have sympathized with oral trump the human being and from that perspective ask him hard questions who do you think it is ha counter point if you are going to you no seek balance in your guess if you c have trump on then you have to have who on well as interesting as ears any touchy ah seems to be a you not strongly associated with am tor counter values at least in in the eye of the public things retiring soon but i yes his retiring that forth interesting anchovy fancy a he had definitely but i do not think he is a counterbalance he is a he is a complicated a fascinating figure who seems to have attracted a lot of hate and distrust a but in love from something in love and not from some people i mean i know people am not even necessarily scientist who have you do not profound hes shirts have seen people with any founds you sir shirts gives me but certainly but a who adore him their people o adore him on the same wither people tat a door trump its it is interesting that you know one species of animal it et such divergent neral circuitry it is almost feels is by design and every single topic would find tension and division it is as fastening to watch a me i got to really witness it from zero to a hundred in you crane where there is not huge significant a division there was in certain parts of you crane but a cross rope across the world there is not that much division between russia you crane and if he was just borne overnight this intense hatred an you see the same kind of stuff with with fancy over the pandemic at first we are all kind of hold huddled and uncertainty kind of there is it to fatherless with a pandemic of course there is more difficult as your isolated but then you start to figure out the the probably the politicians in the media try to got how can i take a side here and how can i now start reporting on this side or that side and say how the other side is wrong and i think i think fancy in is is a part of just being used as escape go for certain things as part of that kind of narrative of of division but i think trump is a singular figure that to me represent something important an america history am not sure what that is but i i think you have to think you put on your historian hat go forward in time and think back a cowgirl he remember be remember twenty thirty forty fifty years from now who is the opposite of that ah you have to i i i would really have to think about that because because trumps singular i think ale sees an interesting one but she young and son clear to know how what if she represents a legitimate we a last scaled movement or not burn sanders is an interesting option but i wish he would be thirty forty years younger the young burned would be a good there are scientists working on that ye i think a not hems specifically but well ye i it may be him we we never now there is a big conspiracy they that madness a that is that is a the body double it is no longer the u u her him return conspiracy there is non a that a the pudnuci an camera to day is a body double one thing that you known in science in particular in anatomy there is a classification scheme for different types of anatamus which they either say you are a lumper or a splitter have some people to call a whole structure something not in the silly just for simplicity but for lot of reasons and then other people to mice divide the nuclear intomultible names and of course people used to be able to name different brainstructures after themselves other be the the nucleus of lagan that and the the the superman fasciculus or whatever less of that nowadays but and by the we those structures do not actually exist just a yet a we have not one to find those yet that was making those names up but what is interesting is it seems in the last five years there is been a lot of tret there is been a transfuse me toward a requirement for lumping you cannot say it seems that it is not aloud if you will to say hey ya and here ism not stating my ism net i will never reveal my preferences about pandemic related things for hopefully obvious reasons it it some people say valines yes but masks know or valines and masks yes but let people work and other people say no everyone stay home and then other people say now you know savings do masks let everybody work known was saying no savings no makes and and stay home i do not think there is this sort of lumping right the the boundary's around a ideology really did struck to defy science i mean it was not scientific it was one part science is at times and sometimes really hard course science other times it was politics economic ham mind we really saw the confluence of all these different domains of society that use it very different criteria to evaluate the world i mean i as a scientists a remember when the valines first came out and i i ask somebody one of the the early concerns i had that was actually t satisfied for me was how does this thing turn off a you start you generating in mar nay how is actually get turn off i asked to for and you know they know a lot about are an biology and the you has tit turn off they explained it to me on the oke make sense ask some other questions u but most people are going to think about it at that level of detail necessarily but it did seem that there was a just kind of amorphous be jobs of ideology he that they grabbed on to things and then there was this need for a chasm between them there it was almost felt it became e legal in some ways to want two of the things from that men you wen one of the things from that men you i really felt i was being constrained by a kind of ben to box model where i did not get to define what was in the bent box i can hear at bat to box my or bent box to we but nothing in beating it and i think i an that topic and i think a lot a topics most people are in the middle with humility on certainty in the juscona trying to figure it out and i think there is just the extreme defining a the nature of this division i think it is the role of a lot of us in our individualize and also if your if you have a platform of any kind i i think you have to try to walk in the middle with empathy in humility and that is act what science is about is the is a humility still thinking about who is the opposite of trump i a it maybe it is not i me maybe a fou he is or thoginal to to trump i mean i not everything has an opposite i kiang is a maybe he is an en of one maybe he is in the minority of one because he was an outsider in ut from washington who then me i there but also i wonder e i you have to pick your battles because every bow you fight you should take very seriously and just the on of hate i get i got and i still get for having sat down with the visor so that's a very valuable lesson for me will that one was got due lot a heat ten still does cause s you had some some pretty controversial guess on ism that one that on on is he still tinier see i believe sol seems turn over crazy this a thing i did not rise here and in sine o somebody moves institutions a big deal most people do not have more than two moves in that in their career may be but the often you hot moved to next building is a big deal but it in bile attack it is i have a former collegment from banter when he is been a see here they a see o there is that you went back to a company was e seat before if he is price back an t universe he worked out for it for all i know it is amazing how much moving around there is very itinerant profession ye i think there is in certain companies i guess in batik would be the case the the semis more of a the manager types you can some was jumping around benefits your experience ye get but become better and better being a manager there is some leader revolutionary see els that sthickeron for longer because they're critical to a pivoting a company the mitrosaliceo currently a sound of practise somebody that a obey see almost it is somebody that that is part of pivoting a company into new domains constantly but and by check there is a machine and for in in the eyes a lot of people a big farm a is big tobacco it is a it is the pity me of everything that is wrong with capitalism it is a it is evil i and i showed up in the conversation where i thought with a pretty open mind and really asked what i thought what difficult questions of him i do not think he is ever sat down to a grilling of that kind in fact ism pretty sure they cut the interview short because of that and i thought literally was hot in the room and wert wearing and i i was asking tofu questions for for somebody that half the country were large present of the country believes he is alleviate a lot of he helped if through the financial resources that that finer has helped to leave that a lot of suffering in the world and i thought for somebody that i was asking pretty hard questions boy did i get to here from the side usually one of the sides is more intense in o their anger there is certain political topics with a would entertain for example i would i would hear from a very you'll probably the left far left that would write very angrily and that is a group you here from the lies a we o i did not get almost any messages from people saying why did you go hard on on him a he is a he is incredible human incredible leader and see all the company that helped helped us with the vaccine and nobody thought would be possible to develop quickly you did not get letters that is not i mean t here and there but the the sea of people that said everything for me being weak that i was not able to call out this person how do sad what he platform this evil person that how you make him look human all that con stuff and that you have to deal with that yet the of course it's great it is great because i have to do some soul searching which is did i i you have to ask some hard questions i love criticism that you you get t i have some low points there is refueling some despair and you stead to wonder was i too weak should i talk to him what is true you sit there alone and just marina in that and hopefully overtime that makes you better but still do not know with the right answer without one is who feel that money plays a carol here on when people think big farmer they think billions of dollars maybe you trillions of dollars really and certainly people who make a lot of money get scrutiny that others do not part of is tit they are often not always visible but i think that there is a natural and reflects give an are not justifying it a i certainly do not feel this cause i do i know some people who are very wealthy some people are very poor a i cannot say it scales with happiness at all people are always shocked to to hear that but a it but that is what have observed in very wealthy people a but that people have a lot of money are often held to a different standard because a people resent that some people resent that and may be a there other reasons as well i mean among people who are very wealthy often times the wish is for a status right not money you get a bunch of billionaires in a room and unless one of them is melon who is also has immense status for his accomplishments a typically if you put a noble prize gonna room with a munch of billionaires they are all talking to that person right and they are many very interesting billionaires a but status is a is something that is often but not always associated with money but is a much rarer form of a of uniqueness out there a positive uniqueness if one consider stats positive there is a downside too but a i wonder whether not the finer see o caught extra heat because people assume and i probably assume also that a his salaries quite immense ye i because i have a lot of data on the secund is that is a very good hypothesis wast just the scientific i he is about tell me it is a great hypothesis but it is wrong i know a smear i know this smear i honest the thing it is wrong there is that effect is there for a lot of people but i think the distrust is not towards the we o the distrust is towards the company one of the really difficult sole searching i have to do which is just having a tract with wiser folks at every level from junior to to see o they are all really nice people they have a mission they talk about trying to really help people was that is the best way to make money is come up with a medicine that helps a lot of people the the mission is clear they are all good people a lot of really drilling people pages you can have a system where all the people are good including the see and by good i mean people that really are trying to do everything they dedicate their whole life to do good and yet you have to think that that system can a deviate from a path that does good because you start to deceive yourself of what is good turn into a game where money does come into play from a company perspective where you convince yourself the more money you make the more good you will be able to do and then you start to focus more and more and more an making more money and then you can really deviate and loose track of what is actually good ism tot saying nosily finer does that but i think companies could do that you can apply that criticism the soccer me to companies to big farmer companies that one of the big lessons for me that i do not know what the answer is but that all the people inside a company could be good people you would want hang out with people you on to work with but as the company is doing evil and that is a possibility the the distrust i do not think it is towards the billionaire individual which i do see a lot of in this case i think it is the it is wall street distrust that the machinery of this particular organization has as has gone off track it is the generalization of hate again yet and then you good luck firing out what is true this is the this is the nonstop but i should say the individuals a individual scientists at the and i h a in in a finer i just incredible people there the really the really brilliant evil the i never trust the administration or the business people in the offense business people but the scientist are always an that that they they have the right motivator in life but again with they can not blinders on two focus on the science not the germany has history of people just two focus on the science and in the politicians use the scientist to achieve whatever and they want but if you just look narrowly at the the gurney of a scientists is the beautiful monk as they ultimately in it for the curiosity the moment the discovery versus money we any prestige probably does coming to play later later in life but especially young scientists thereafter the their is the pulling at the thread of curiosity to try to discover something big they get excited by that kanistov and his beautiful to we tat is beautiful t see have a former grades you now a posttockit attack and isn't even now she had a self pone she mud coming to law put herself pone into the a darken has tremendously productive but that that was not am why brought it up i she was productive as a side a fact of just being absolutely committed and obsess to discover the answers to the questions she was asking as best she could and it was you could feel it you u feel the intensity and her a just incredibly low activation energy if there an experiment to do she t go do it your teaching it at my tea you are obviously traveling the world your ring the outcasts a lot of coverage you chess recently which is interesting i i do not play chasseur i i have some scientific questions do about the oh ki sure and then let us get to those for sure and then you are not gonna it oh no o we and then and then also some some very a drove spell massachusetts again umworsh h the also you still seem to have a proclivity for finding guest er controversial right you think but tat were tin ut true for time at the finer see e o tong a found the these are see are in a intends people and say what we are getting folks is a am we are not doing narrow imaging here and the traditional sense of putting someone into a scanner what we are doing here is we are using as a the great carl dicer to who as on your podcast am thank you for i think you for connect as he is an incredible personae is an incredible psychiatrist by engineer in human being an and all an writer and your conversation with him was phenomenal i i listen to it twice i should have taken notes am we talk about it in this household we really do a his a his description of love is a not to be miss it'll sleep it it that because a i try and say it i will not capture it well but yet we are getting a a a language based am map of a at least a portion of let freedmen brain here am what else is going on these days in that brain as it relates to robotics a i for last conversation was a lot about robots in the potential for robot human interaction what it even what is a robot et camera am are you still working on robots or focused on robots and where were science showing up in your life besides the things before e talked about i think the last time we talked was before you crane yes or you were just about to leave yes that i mean that is what i went on ell yon us might be the last he said you not come out here before afters i m no let us see you before you go but i are in the flesh i think us o a lot of the it is the lot of my mind has been occupied obviously with that part of the world but the the most of the difficult struggles that ism still going through is that i have not launched a company that i want to launch and the company has to do with a i i means it may be long conversation but the ultimate dreams to put robots in every home but short term i see there possibility of launching social media company and the it is e nontrivial explanation why that least to robots in the home but it is basely the algorithms that fuel affective social robotics robots conform a deep connection with a ice been really you have been building prototypes but struggling that i do not have may be if i were to be critical the got to to large in company or that him well it is come on i think you have got the got i man it is clear if you will do an interview with the finer s in your considering putting this tape fellow on your podcast and you are gone to the in ah that you you have the got i it is also a am it means not i doing i quite a lot of other that is a i mean but it it dos takes the thing is as many people know when you fill your saying you are busy that business becomes an excuse that you use against doing the things that scare you a lot people house family in this way ah my wife my kids i cannot when in reality some of the most successful people have a wife and have kids and have families and they still do it and a lot me to can fill the day with busy work with a i like y of course i have pocket all this kind of to and they make me happy and there all that are wonderful and a there is resource as teaching is on but all that cane of service an excuse from a thing that my heart says is the right thing to do and a that is why i do not have the gust the gust to say no basically everything and tin to focus all because the part of it is i am unlikely to fail at anything in my life currently cause have ready full in a comfortable place with a with a start up its most going to be most likely going to be a failure if not embarrassing failure am well the machine learning data that ism aware of do not know a lot about machine learning but the within the realm of nurse sine say that a failure rates of about fifteen per cent is option for you neuroplasticity ingrowth whether r not that translates to all kinds of practices is not clear but getting trials rite eighty five percent of the time seems to be optimal for language learning seems to be option for mathematics and seems to be optima for a physical pursuits iron average rite ism shamming that it that you have more a machine learning i geeks not to list en your podcast than miss in this podcast but does not mean he ought to fail on fifteen per cent of your weights tat folks homing it can be or sixteen per cent now ism just kidding but the a it is am it is not exact but it but it is a pretty good rule of them i think a lot of start up founders would literally murder for eighty five per cent chance of success i t i think a given all the opportunities i have the the skill set the the funding all that castoff my chances are relidtabe high for success but what relatively high means in the start up world is tho far far below eighty five it is we are talking about single did your percentages most tart ups fail i think it means the decision to folks on the company not o the things means to decision to close the hatch on dopa mean retrieval from all these other things that are very predictable sources of dopamine i not that everything is dope mean but you nowt do not bemean as i think that the primary chemical driver of motivation and you know if that you can get some degree of satisfaction from scrolling social media from that particular cup of coffee that's what you can do i that is what you're going to consume unless am you somehow invert the agrithem in you i and you say it is inmate my denial of myself drinking that coffee that is gun to be the do not demean ramtiouthing then an notes the beauty of having a forebrain is that you can make those t vision see know this is the essence i i do believe of what we see of avid hogans there is much more there there is a person than none of us know ism an only he knows of course but the idea that the pain is the source of dope i mean the fit the limbic friction as i sometimes to call it is the source of opening that runs counter to have most nervous systems work but it was i it is decision base right it is not because his musculature is a certain way or his he had crisper or something it is because he decides that u and i i think that is amazing t it but what it means in terms o starting a company an changing priorities is a closing the hatch on all where many of the current sources of dopa mean that you can derive you do not la mean from the failures within this narrow contacts and this a very reduction is view an and no now centric view of what we are talking about but i think about this lot i mean the decision to choose one relationship versus another is a decision to close down other opportunities i i think that the the decision he order one thing off the many verses others is is decision to close down those other hatches i think that you absolutely can do it it is just a question of can you flip the algorism you have remap the source of dope men to something else is and maybe it maybe go out there not to succeed but make the the journey is the destination tight thing but when your financially vested in your time and as far as i know we only get one life at least on this planet and due you want a spend that wisely i and a lot of that the people that surround you they be people a really important and i do not have people grow me that say you should to a start up it is very difficult to find such people it is out in big start up culture is that is but it does not make sense for me to start up this is what the people that love me my whole life have been telling me does not make sense what you what you do in i now just do the thing you are doing previously why do i get the sense that because they are saying this were a to go on i ships never that unfortunately unfortunately i need a have talk to people i love that my parents family an on friends ism wont of those people that needs unconditional support for difficult things the kin know myself coaching wise i it is good to i shears how i get coach best let say wrestling i a coach that says o you want a win the lyrics they will not for k if i say i want to when the gold men at the olympics and festal wrestling i i want a coach that does not blink once and hears me and believes that can do it and then is viciously intense and cruel to me on the on on that pursuit i if you want to do this lets do this i but that is support that i that positivity i do not ism never a you know ism not energized nor do i see that as love a person saying raspy criticizing that i saying you are a you are too old to win the inleegold metal ray would all the things you can come up with that is not helpful to me and i cannot find a dulpomen or i have not yet a dustman source from the the haters basic people there criticizing you just trying to prove them wrong i it does not a it never got me off i never a when some people seem to that i mean avid yogins it seems to come a way seems driven by many sources that he has access i do i do not know as have never asked him but i i if i were to venture gas it'd say that he probably has a lot of options inside his head is to how to push through challenge not just overcome pain not but but he will post sometimes about the fact that you do not people will say this or people will do this and it and and talk about the push back approach he will also talk about am the bushbuck approach that is purely internal that does not all of any one else great versatility there mother's at there is literally a voice yells at that represents some kind of a thine devil that wants him to fail and he is the o he calls him bitch and all kinds of things thing we'll fuck you ism not ism not he is there is always an enemy and he is going against that enemy and i wish may be that something i means really interesting maybe you can remap it this way that you can construct that is of kind of obvious mechanism construct a amorphous blob that is a hater that wants you to fail i this kind of the day oi hogans thing you are in tat that that blobs as you are too weak you are too do you are you are too old you are too fat you to whatever and getting you to want to quit and on and then you star getting angry at that blob it may be that is a good mot of it i have not personally really tried that ellipse had external oh you know want am challenge when i was a penstock a very prominent laboratory several prominent laboratories in fact we are working on the same thing that i was and i was a slowly postal working on at project pretty independent from the lab i was in and am there was competition but there was plenty of room for everybody to win but in my head and frankly i will not disclose he this is and and because there was some legitimate competition there and a little bit of friction not not too much healthy scientific friction am i might have pushed a for extrahours or more i little bit i have to say it felt metabolizing it felt capital right it did not a i could not be sustained by it and i contrast that with the pod cast or the work that my laboratories doing a ow folks on stressing human performance et camera and it is pure love i just i want it is pure curiosity in love i am in their hard days but i never there is no adversary in the picture i there the practical you don't workings of life that without those o thing that jo really inspired me on and people do create adversary relationships in podcasting cause you get you tubers do this they get they hate seeing somebody else be successful there is a feeling of am a jealousy and some people even see that is healthy o this that g mister beast of somebody somebody's popular you too person how do they get hontrmillion views and i only get twenty views mister beat devoted his entire according to him his entire life he is been okas on becoming this mass of you to n with that you do not he is inspiring in many ways but thine the some people they get become famous for doing much less a insane pursuit o fa of greatness an mister beasts this people become famous an on social media and on and it is easy to be jealous of them ma just one of the early things have learned from voice is being a fan of his pockets is ho much he celebrated everybody and i again i i maybe i room my whole open you thing but i do not get energized by people that are they become popular the potcasting space an you to it doesn't it is some it is all of it is is some and m ism inspired by that but the promise that is not good motivators inspiration is o cool humans can do this this is beautiful but it is not ism looking ism looking for a for forcing function that is what i gave way the salary for y mite is hoping my bacon cot at zero that will be a forcing function to like o shit and i and you not allowed to have the normal jobs i wanted to lunch and then the podcast becomes a force of income and sit content ye well and here i i have to confess my bias as et you are a you are good at what you do in the realm of podcast and your excellent a other things as well i just have less e o experience in those things i know here ism ism taking the liberty of speaking for many many people and just saying i i i sure hell ho you do not shut down the podcast not as your friend and tat somebody who cares very deeply about your happiness and your your deeper satisfaction a if it is in your heart's heart to you accompany well then am it do the company and a lot of it i wouldn't even chare characterized as happiness i knon'it you have things that in your in your life but ism probably the happiest i i i could poshly be right now that is wonderful but the thing is that there is a longing for the startle that has not do with happiness it is a something else they camp that itch that is o on it pretty sure it'll be less happy because it is a really tough process it is it i mean to whatever degree you can extract happiness from struggle yes maybe but i will not see i i think it'll have some very very low points its a lot of people o who found fine companies found companies know about you are and i also wont to be in relationship i one to get married and sure s how star up is not at it increase the if a the likelihood of that we could start up a family and start a company without that is ism huge believer in that which is getting a relationship at a low point in your life which is ism not disputing your stance a nor am i agreeing with it it is just a every once a while there is a there is a likes freedman ism that am that hit is a particular circuit mat i i haggis laugh out la i just think that it is easy to have a relationship wheneverything is good the relationships that become strong and a trusted quickly are the ones when when shit is gone down well then there is hope for me easy a before we sat down am i was having conversation with a podcast producer who is a a i would not say avid rather he is a rabid consumer of podcast and finds these amazing podcast as he is am small podcast and and and unique pilots any way we were talking about am some stuff that he as had seen and read in the business sector and he was talking about am the difference between you job career and a calling right an i and i think he was extracting this from conversations of a a see you and founders et camera am forget this specific founders at a that brought this to light for him but that this idea that if you focus on a job you know you can make an income and hope for you enjoy your job or not hate too much a careers is represents a sort of in my mind a could of series of evolutions that one can go through junior professor ten car et camera but a calling has a whole other am level of a a energetic pull to it because it includes career and job and includes this concept of sort of a life it is it is very heard to to draw the line between a calling in career and a calling in the other parts of your life the question therefore is do you feel a calling to start this company or is it i borne of a compulsion that am irritates you is it something you wish would go away there as it someone that you that you hope i will not go away now i hope it will not go what it is a calling it is a calling it is auto hopeful it is e ti when i see a rob when i first interacted with robot and it became even stronger the most sophisticated the robots i interacted with i see a magic there and you are you look around does any one else see this magic i it is it is connolice may be when you fall in love that that feeling the the any one else notice this person i just walk in the room i feel that way about robots and i can elaborate wit that means but ism not even sure i can convert into words i just feel the social integration of robots in society will great a really interesting world and our billy to ant the promorphies when we look at a robot and or billy to feel things when we look at a robot is something that most of us do not yet experience but i think everybody will experience in the next few decades and i i just want to be a part of that exploring that because it has not been really thoroughly explored the best robotics in the world are not corny working on that prom at all they they try to avoid human beings completely and nobody's really work in that promise turns when youook at the numbers all the big neck companies that investing money the closest thing too that is flex a and a basically being a serpent to help to tell you the weather play music and on it is not trying to form a deep connection and i i is vas you just notice the thing not not only do i notice the magic there is a got feeling which i try not to speak to because there is no track record but i feel i can be good at bringing that magic out of the robot and there is no data that says i would be good at that but there is a feeling is just a feeling i when i because hive done many things i love doing be plan guitar all that nonstop a beget have never felt that feeling when i doing to mesa i do not feel the the magic of the genius require to be extremely good i guitar i do not feeling of that but have noticed it in others great musicians they will they they notice the magic about the thing they do and they and they ran with it and i just always thought i think you had a different form when i before i you robots existed before a existed the form was o more about the magic between humans the i i think of it as love but the smile the two friends have towards each other when i was belly young and people would be excited when they first noted each other an see notice each other and there's that moment that they share that feeling together i else well that is really interesting it it is really interesting that these two separate intelligent organisms are able to connect also on this deep emotional level it is it is it is a is just beautiful to see and i notice the magic of that and then when i started a programming programming period but then programming a systems you realize oh that could be that is not just between humans and humans that could be humans and other entities dogs a cats in robots and that i for some reason it hit me the most intensely when i robots ye it is is like calling but it is a calling that i acting just in joy the a the vision of it the vision of a future world of an exciting future world is full of cool stuff or i can be part of building that and part being part of building that means doing the hard work of capitalism which is raising fun from people a which for me i know is the easy part and then hiring a lot of people i know couch rehiring but hire and hi excellent people excellent people that will define the trajectory of not only your company but your whole existence as ha human being and in building it up not failing them because now they all depend on you and not failing the world with an opportunity to bring something something that brings joy to people and all that pressure just non stop fires the if tho put out the drama the having to work with people work lawyers and the human resources and supply chain and and a because his is very coma compute heavy the inform short the computing for structure managing security sire security is because you are dealing with people's data that yet to understand not only the the bast security of data and the privacy how to maintain privacy correctly with data but also the psychology of people trusting you with their data and what is how how if you look at magxakeburg and jock doeskin those folks they seem to be hated by a large number of people the jacks i did not i most lei think i always think of jack is a as a loved individual but o we that yet you have a very positive i mat my jack lot and i i his mind and i am some one close to him i described him to me recently as he is an excellent listener that is what they said about jack and that that is my experience of him too a very private persons we live it at that by em i lis the i i think jack dorky is am one of the one of the greats of our a of the last two hundred years and it is just much quieter it om about his stands on things and a lot of people but much of what we see in the world that is wonderful i think am we owe him in debtor gratitude ism just it voicing my stance here but n the person is really important ye a wonderful person a brilliant or person a good person be you still have to pay the price of making any kind of mistakes as the head of a company you do not get any extra bones points for being a good person but his willingness to go on organ and o you'll directly and say i do not know an answer to that in some cases but to deal directly with some really challenging questions to me earn him tremendous respect yes is an individual he was still part of hem is you you have said your and i love jack to and i interact with a has been on your podcast yes but he is also part of a system as we talked about and i would argue the jack should not have brought any one else with him on that pogges if you of are ye at a carrot of oh he had o i guess o tho the legal of the head legal a with him and also it requires a tremendous amok of skill to to go on a togas i organ and be able to win over the trust of people by being able to be transparent to communicate how the company area he works because the more you reveal about household for me t o company works the more you open up for security the the vector of attar increases also there is a lot of difficult decisions and terms of censorship an not that are made that if you make them transparent you going to get an order of magnitude for hate save to make all those kinds of decisions and i think that is one of the things i have to realizes you have to take the a that avalanche of potentially hate if you make mistakes will you you have a very clear picture of this architecture of what is required in order to create a company of course there is division of labor too i mean you do not have to do all of those things in detail but finding people that are excellent to do om the you do not to run the critical segments or a it is obviously key it'll just say what i said earlier which is if it is in your heart's heart to start a company n if that indeed is yourecalling in it sounds it is then i cannot wait does the heart have a heart well at expressing mot probably not on romance's my atom point early days we worked on cuttlefish and they have meltable hearts and they but they pump green blood believe in not very fastening animal a speaking me of a hearts and om green blood earlier to day before we sat down i solicited o for questions on instead in a brief post you ant a if you will look at some of them yes lets think he is in t e real time i podcast is always teasing me that i never have any charge from my phone on these people likes to run in the a run in the yellow or wherever it is and i thought on yet have madhouse always the i fond people are out battery we are to a new one we in this one has plenty of battery i just got a new one have have different numbers for different i things personal work et camera u ism trying that now i all right get in to the i have a chest think our to mention to oh yes please it will i in fault you if i if i look up these questions as you ha no no but i will in sell you by asking is thing is hilarious there is up bin a controversy about cheating an can has leman who is a twenty seven hour player oh ya i yes a living lip on your eclipse chantlan by the way a love your clips cancel and i listen her folks channel the big accusation i is that he cheated by having i mean it is is have joke but it is statant getting me to wonder whether m that you can cheat by having vibrating anal beads you can send messages to i let's rephrase that statement not you can but one can one can the on cannot you now's a personal attack yes but is made me realize i ma i much sit just my tea i use it all the time for casting send myself messages i do remind me myself of notes a but it is interesting i mean it it ti ism not going to call you again yes that is exacter i keep my phone the thither it it did get me down this whole rabbit whole of well how would you be able to send communication u in order to cheat indifferent sports in me that does not even have to do with them chess in particular but it is interesting chest and poker that there's u there is mechanisms sat of modern day where your streaming live the competition people can watch an on to if they can only send you a signal back i they it is it is just a fund little thing to think about and if it is possible to pull off i i want to get your scientific a i valuation is that to cheat using some sort of interceptive device li ya vibrating a unkind can well i no no that is one way to send the els is li torso basically yes there is a famous i believe there is a famous real world story of physic students i money get some of this wrong ism saying this in kind of a course form that somebody will correct this but i i believe it was physics graduate students from you see santecrus or somewhere else may be is calpac bunchy university that no one associates with any one universe that went to vagus and use some sort of tactile device for kind of ism coward counting i think this was ashy demonstrate also not this particular incident i do not think in the move casino where there wit they were they spotted a i remember roberto hero who you have a ism not vague resemblance to by the way intact driver not i wish i had it got your impression my now traves tickle look it out folks trap as tickle as if likes evereshade to said tom i would they yet a a tapping device on his ankle that was signaling someone else was counting cards and then signaling to that person yet that could be done in the tactile way it could be done obviously ear pieces if it is deep our piece i think that their ways that they look for that certainly any kind of vibrational device in whatever orifice provided someone to pay attention to that will on playing the game yet i think it is it is entirely possible now could it be done purely surely could there be something that was a and listen it would not have to even be below the skull this is where whenever people here about hurry lank or brain machine inner face they always think how you have to drill down below the skull and put a chip be o into the skull think there are people walking around nowadays with am glucosmandering devices levels which have used and was very in formative for me actually as a kind of an experiment give me lot of interesting insights bout my bloodshriger regulation how it reacted from foods et camera well you can in plants a tactile device below the skin with a simple incision extol one of the narrow surgeons at hurry link i i know well because he came up at some point through my laboratory and was at stamford and he actually has put in a radio receiver an his hand and his wife has it too and he can open locks and at of his house and things that you unto e skin under the skin ye you can go to that work how to you u here sir you go to a a a body pester type person and they can just slide under there and and it is got a battery life of something and some fairly long duration how do you experience the tact a a e tactics oh know that there is allows him to open certain locks with just his hand but you can easily put some sort of tactile device in there but this have to connected the nerves or is just just if brio just vibration and you can probably sennit even if it is end the c and it can be by who can be blue tooth linked i have seen there is a a engineering laboratory at the university of ellipsis champagne a ran that is got an amazing device which is about the size of a bandage it goes on the clavicle and it uses am sound waves pinged into the body to measure cavitation think about that this for a moment this is being used in the military where let us a your leading an operation or something people are getting shot shot at and on a laptop you can see were the bull at entry points are our people dead ore they bleeding out a entry it points you can get if take it out of the battle field sierra you can get breathing body position twenty four hours a day there is much that you can do looking at cavitation these same sorts of devices on twelve hour blue tooth could be used to a send all sorts of and make may be every time am your s puss to hold your hand i'mi'm not a good gambler i only play re that when i go to vagus because i you just long boring and you do not games we get to u get some good mileage out of each out of each unusually but the am maybe every time you pussy a hold the person get sort of a stomach pinching because this is the inostimuling the vaguest a little bet in they gettable of it of make it does not have to be am morse code it can be yes no maybe writing an e begot be i green red yellow type signaling it does not have to be very sophisticated give somebody a significant advantage en i have not thought about this in detail on before this conversation but of others in an immense in is a enough a pokcoplar named pillion no id i do not follow the gambling what the us h is considered to be one of the greatest pokers players of all time legenemally it of he just incredibly good but he got a there is as big case where he was accused of cheating and prove an it is not really cheating which is with really fascinating is it turns out a ye place poker at techs hold i mostly but n all kinds of poker it turns out that the the grid on the back of the cards is often printed e litigate imperfectly and you can a use the asymmetry of the perfections the try to figure out certain cards if you play and you remember that a certain card is tie i think the at in that deck that he was accused of and ait and nine would slightly different a symmetry wise he can now a ask the deal actin to rotated to check the symmetry you ask the dealer to rotate the card to see that there is to detect the a symmetry of the back of the card and now he knows which cards a its and nines and or likelier to be its and nines and he a using that information to play to play poker and whin a lot of money but it is just a slight advantage and a his cases and in fact the judge fondness that he is not actually cheating but it is not right you cannot use this kind of exorinformation that it is fascinating you can discover these little holes and games if you pay close enough attention you it is it is fascinating and i think that on you i did watch that clip about the potential of a cheating event in chessman and and the fact that a number of chestplayers admit to cheating at some point in their career very very interesting on lines on line cheating easier right when you are playing in line cheating in a game where the machine is much better than he human it is very difficult to prove that you're human and that applies by the way another really big things and social media the bots to if your running a social medico my have to dead with the bots and they become one of the really exciting things and muslin learning an artificial intelligence to me is they the very fast improvement of language models you ale not works the general test the interpreted the generate from text images and all the can stuff but that is you are now sing to create credible bots that look awfully a lot humans well least then i can be those script bots that seems to populate my comment section when i post anything on in dream i totally to leap those even though they add to the common ah roster and if i they bother me much is i spending at least ten fifteen minutes on each pose just to leading those i do not know what they need to do but ism not interested in em those and whatever it is their offering am speaking of none bots i man assume t all the questions a are not from bots there a lot of questions here i more than ten thousand questions goodness o it'll just take a few are working from top to bottom am what ideas have you been wrestling with lately and i think about the the company as one but as i scroll to the next what a up what are some others some of the things we talked about which is om a the ideas of polite you understand what is true what is true about a human being how to reveal that how to reveal that the conversation how challenge that properly that at least to understanding not division that that applies to everybody from do trump to later queen also another idea is there is a deep distrust the science and trying to understand the growing distrust the science trying to understand what is the role of those of us that have a a foot in scientific community how to be how to regain some of that trust also there is a i thinks we talked about the how to find in how to they how how to find how to maintain a good relationship me that is really been have we never felt quite as lonely as i have this year wen you train it is just many times i would just lay there in just feeling deeply alone because i felt that is my home not my home literally cause ism an america i love i am a proud america at it'll die in america but my home in the sense of my degenerationally my families home is now going is not has been changed for ever there is no more being proud of being from the former rushier you crane is not just it is now a political message to say if if you or to to show you pride and has been extremely lonely within that world if with all the things on pursuing how do you find as successful macho has been that is been taught obviously and there is a fusion of technical ideas with a start up how the heady make this thing work well tit the relationship topics when we talk cubit about and last time we be touched on ten bit more detail am we are it come back to that a as i admit a note here ah what or who inspired lack you to wear a suit every time you pat guess that is a good question i do not know the answer that the too too once is that question one is a suit and too is a black suit and black tie as i used to do i ease to have more variety which is there is those those of black suit but i would sometimes to a red tie and a blue tie now that was most in me trying to fit into society was varieties your supposed to have some variety what inspired me is a at first was a general culture that that does not take itself serious in terms of how you present yourself to the world in academic in the tack world just at go everybody was wearing pajamas and a very relaxed in in attack i do not know how it is in the signs in the chemistry by all gentle on but in a computer science everybody was very i mean very relax in terms of the stuff they wear i wanted to try to really take myself seriously and take every single moment serious an everything i do seriously and the suit made me feel that way i do not know how it looks but made me feel that way and i think in terms of people i look up to the war suit that made me think of that is is probably wish our fireman i see i wonderful you man b is i seem as the pity me of class and humor and brilliance and you don't obviously i can ever come close to that kind of am a you will be able to simply explain really complicated ideas and to have humor and whit but deafly aspired to that and then there is just the madman that whole air of the fifties a classiness of that there something about a suit that both a removes the importance of fashion from the character you see the person i think a a not to i forgot who said this might be cocoshan alias on me this is that you you a wear a shabby dress and every one sees the dress you wear a a beautiful dress and everybody sees the woman in that sense i of i hope lie quoting that correctly but a that is good i i think there is a sense in which a simple classy suit a lost people to focus on your character and do with a fool responsibility of that this is why am and ell of that and i i love what you said just prior to that my father who again has always asked me why i do not dress formerly you do ah always said to me growing up if you overdress slightly at least people know that you took them seriously it is u i a sign of respect for your audience to it in my eyes am some one asked is there an a i equivalent of a psychedelics and i ism assuming thy mean i is there something that machines can do for themselves in order to alter their nail circuitry through unconventional accusation patterns yes obviously well i do not know exactly howspsycadelic's work but you you can see that with the all the diffusion models now with dolly and the stable diffusion degenerates from text art and there is is basically in a small injection of noise into a system that has a deep representation off visual information is able to convert text to art in in introducing uncertainty to that a noising that that kind may be i could see that as a parallel toe psychedelics and is able to create some incredible things from a from a conceptual understanding of a thing it can create incredible art that no human i think could have at least easily created through a bit of introduction of randomness random does a lot of work in the machine learning world just enough therefore a lot of am request of you for relationship a lot of requests about statistics about you data about you specifically am flipping past those am what was the hardest belt to achievement ugitszo i would have assume the blackest but is that actually true no i ma everybody has a different journey through juries o as people know for me the black bell was the ceremonial belt which is not usually the case because i fought the work i trained twice a day for i do not know how many years seven eight years i competed not stop i competed against people much better than me i compete against many and beaten many blackballs and browbeats i think for me personally the hardest bell was the the brown belt because for people who know hugest to the the size of terms divisions for bluebells and probables is just humongous worlds when i competed a world it was a hundred and forty people in division which means you have to win i for get how many times but seven eight nine times in a row to to to met and i just had to put in a lot of work during that time and especially for competitors structures usually really make you earn about the to to earn the purple belt was extremely difficult e tingly difficult and hem to earn the brown belt means i had to compete nonstop against other purple belts which are young you talk about like the people you should compete are twenty three twenty four twenty five year old there shredded incredible cardie they can for some reason are in their life wort they can not kits nothing they can dedicate everything to this pursuits of their training two three four times a day died is on point you are going and for me because a ye there usually bigger and tower can me and just more grass actual good ashes ye i had to go to the lot of work to earn that brown belt but hey had a to is you job you thin i should button i try you i did to one class but i i really want to the hunter brass as many pursuits legumes or a different you doing your twenties and thirties and later it is i gits a different you cannot you are not you can have a bit of a ego in your twenties you can have that fire under you but you should be set of more men and wise and patient a later in life well one would hope a that is the wisdom i think organ is still a meet head you still goes hard and crazy and he still supercompetitive on that some people can and forces foreboding that but whatever they are doing there doing something right me as they're still in it and that is superimpressive there were afar too many questions to ask all them but a several if not many ask o highly appropriate question for where we are in the ark of this discussion and this is one a admittedly that you ask an your pod cask a all the time but i get the great pleasure of being in the the question asker seat to day a and what is it your advice the young people so just gave a lecture a my tea and i the amount of love i got there is incredible and of course whit you are who your talking to is usually undergrads may be young graduate tons and there one person did ask for advice a as a question at the end of the much of cunt my answer was a that the world will tell you to find a work balance to a to sort of explore to try to a try difference years to see what you really connect is a variety general education all that connistov and i said in your twenties i think you should find one thing your passionate about and work harder at that than you work that anything else in your life and if it destroys you destroys you that is advice for in your twenties i do not know how universally true that advices but i think at least give that a chance sacrifice real sacrifice towards a thing you really care about and work your also that said have meant many people and ism starring to think that advice is is best applied or best tried in the engineer disciplines especially programming i think there's a bunch of disciplines in which you can achieve success with much fewer hours an it is much more important to actually have a clarity of thinking in great ideas and have an energetic mind thine the grind in certain disciplines does not produce great work i just know that in computer science of programming it often does some of the best people ever the have built system have programmed systems i usually the john tarmac kind of people that drink soda pizza and programmed you now eighteen hours a day i do not know actually you you have i think really go discipline specific my advice applies to my own life which has been mostly spent behind tat computer and for that a you really really have to put in the hours and what that means as essential yo feels a grind i do recommend that you should at least try it in your own that ta if you interview some of the most accomplished people ever i think if they are honest with you they are going to talk about their twenties as as a as a journey of a lot of pain and a lot of really hard work i think what really happens a unfortunately is a lot of those successful people later in life will will talk about work balls they will say what i learned from that process is that it is really important ah to get a son in the morning to have health to have good relation shire or not a tea exactly i think you have forgot those people have forgot ton the value of the journey the took to that lesson i think work life balance is best learn the hard way i my my my own perspective there is certain things you can only learn the hard way and you should learn that the hardly the as that that is define advice and i should say that i admire people that work hard if you want twill get on my good side i think here are the people they give everything they got towards something it does not dual matter what it is but towards achieving a excellence in a thing i that is that is the highest a thing that we can reach force human being i think is excellent that a thing i love it well speaking of excellence at a thing whether not its teaching it at my tea or the pod cast or the the company that resides and the mere future that you create in i i once again i i speaking for an enormous number of people that excellence and hard work certainly are woven through everything that you do every time i sit down with you i begin and finish with a such an immense feeling of joy and appreciation and gratitude and it would not be elect freedman podcast or and case of ferrymen being a guest on a podcast if the word love were not mentioned at least ten times a the feelings of gratitude for all the work you do for taking the time here to day to to share with us what you are doing your thoughts you are insides here on what your perplexed about and and what drives you and and your callings every too yes please it would has try to cut me off but with wit getting a in long a this is a just think it about this reason is one o my favorite sober frostpoems and i a cause i wrote several essays on it as you do cause i think it is a popular one that is read and essays being trying to interpret poetry and it is one that is thinks with me i man both is calm beauty but in a seriousness of what it means because i ultimately think it is the a ta i stopping by woods and a snowy evening i think it is ultimately a human being a man asking the the old visit as the old communal question of why live i think this poem even though does not seem it is a question of a man contending with suicide and choosing to live whose whose woods these are i think i know his house is in the village though he will not see me stopping here to watch is woods fill up with snow my little horse must think it queer the stop without a farmhouse near between the woods and frozen lake the darkest evening of the air he gives this harness bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake the only other some the sweep of easy wind and downy flake the woods are lovely dark and deep but i have promises to keep ad miles to go before i sleep and miles to go before i sleep the woods representing the darkness the comfort of the woods representing death and he's a man choosing to live i think about that often especially my dark darker moments is ah you've promises to keep thank you

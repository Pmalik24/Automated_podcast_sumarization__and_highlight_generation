a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in to day's episode of the show if you prefer a beat version you can find that at our weight this america life dotawork no you they chico is this medical life m or glass am joined in the studio rate now by my coerce to ben low whether to been i a a and am just going to say that this for you abet to tell you acknowledge the existence of sex but if tits truly all that you acknowledge that it exists o tell me tell me would happen i yet a case this guy pal this happen when he was in his early twenties and he arranges this lockup with a guy he meets on line and i should say the guy his profile does not have that much inform it says he is closeted that if they are on a meet up it it has to be very discreet he said i could not go over to his place and can i also had a roommate he would have been difficult for me to host him is well he told me i know a spot i know a spot that we can go why do not you just meet me at these cross streets at ten o'clock and i said okay worse for me and i drove over at night to where he told me to meet him i get to the cross streets and he is not there there is nobody there and i think obey nowhere is he is cunningly it'll just hang around for a bed and finally he sees the sky standing on a corner and my guy be fans for him to pull over and unlike oka great confirmation it is him perfect and i lower the window and i say to him oh sorry about that i just was not sure if it was you and he was do not what it is all get and he gets ti my car pal asks him where we going i the guy starts to direct him to the hookup spot you make a left up there turn right of this corner things started to feel a little weird when several minutes passed and we were still driving because i had been under the assumption that this secret spot would have been around the corner or something then i ask him welfare a we going and that he says glandule now if you are not familiar with away i mean the place where i picked him up was in franklin village and glandule is not supersuperfar but it still close to a twenty minute drive something must not be adding up here and then i start to second guess everything that had happened on that ride far what why was not he at the spot when he said he would be he was a little bit further up than that was also weird and then he realizes this must not be the got there is no way that this is the guise was to be meeting it is as e scared a did he think the scan rob him or heard him in some way he actually he does not have time to be scared because he pretty immediately realizes exactly what is happens what guy would wave you down and and get into your car this was a total stranger to me who was there waiting for his rideshair driver use will not you say that he seems told obvious i know you would think right that can i present to you pal's defense of himself please first of all this was twenty thirteen if you remember that sort of early and ride hair hachure son the whole dance that happens where you waved don a driver you get in and sort of people know what to say to each other that just was not in his head in the same way back then exactly a the other thing is that the guy that he was spent to me up with his hocus the photo on the pro file was kind of grainy and he was wearing sun glasses in the photo pal actually did not have a clear picture in his mind of what the guy was supposed to look oh of yet ah though there is one marching that is a little but marvanovious give away i always feel little bit is silly when people point out that he got in my back seat oh he got in the back seat to the car he got in my back seat but i invite you to look at it from my perspective because i thought that in a matter of moments ways going to be joining him in the back seat i did not think it was that weird he was just preemptively getting in the back and oh he is just he is very he is the is thinking a had he is taste i thinking i had let's the more it is the more spacious part of the car and i did not even know the name of the person i was meeting it isn't i could have been hay are you drew or whatever oh you did not have a name to go i did not either ye he could have gotten in and been hay are you here for waveband i would have been i guess am now pal has to make a decision li is he going to say something i have no idea what to do because part of me once to pull over and say to him there's been a huge mistake but then i realize that if i were to do that i would have a lot of explaining to do because i he would have he would have wanted to know why did i let him in my car also i should say by now they have been driving in the car together for several minutes it is way past the threshold for a light hearted ups is eerstand make ah ye and then pal he has this more alarming thought if this is what i think and this is somebody who as in fact just waiting for his user then the actual driver i going to be pulling up and trying to find him and he second now not even two seconds later as soon as i had that realization his phoneying oh my got my heartstofps because i know what it is going to be before he haven picks it up i know it is into he's driver telling him that he is here and i feel foolish and i feel embarrassed because i i thought i was about to be out id i panicked and my heart was racing and i did not know what to do and then he picks up the funk and why and what does he say he is saying things her what do you mean a understand would you mean your outside oh my god and he was ah that is wearied i i am already in the car and then pal has this total perspective shift cause now he is thinking about how's this on a look from the back seat of the car that would be frightening to be sitting in your user get a caul from your driver saying that there outside and then you look at the details of what car you are supposed to be looking for and what your driver looks see that your driver is not that person and the car is not that vehicle if i were him i would have thought oka on being keen out or what what is happening right now so the guy hangs up the down and it is at this point that pal gets this gift from the got he says to me i they ever send to drivers immediately i was just yes sometimes there is a glitch sometimes eyes a glitch and they sent to drivers that is what happened i cannot believe he gout saved i know and for the rest of the drive he commits to the part he is pal the user driver which means he as along as the guy in the back tries to make conversation oh how long if you've been driving done it you get paid well you meet interesting people ti things that and how are you answering i was just making things up yo a and draw not to not too long it is it is all right i got paid all right the people are nice i was just completely making it all up theatre funny thing is though that because i did not know whether he thought i was user or lift or some other i share i had to be kind of vague because i did not one to say ya user's great when he would be wet that this was a lift in it a that is what i me the lucky thing for pals that because he ask for directions when the guy first got in the car the guy does not only notice that pal does not have the a open or the we piazopand he is just comfortable con him directions all the way to glandule eventually they do and up at his house and then as he is getting out of the car i did pard of me a tiny tiny part of me was thinking still is this the guy to see about to invite me it is a trying to hold on to any glimmer of this making sense and then incredibly the guy does in vote him up he does he does and actually they are still together to day really no of course not the guy just wishes him a good night en does in it's at and in the next day pal out an from his actual hook up and an turns out the guy just and scared an decide an not to come that to this day pal still stands by his decision what i think it is for the best that i did not set the record straight cause in that case he just had a totaling oral night he had a totally normal night and hat he it a free rite i the dos hardy decide to set the record straight the world usually does not one t hear it is almost always an in convenient truth to want a programmed we have people who step up tell the truth the rest of us have not heard and sometimes do not want to her an let the chips fall we they may say with us he he that one hottest he began to day with a kid twelve years old he thing to figure out the truth to setting straight for himself this boy ill ye his family had recently escape for many duple and you crane maple was a city that you may remember back in the spring everybody was trying to get out of he was underseech from months food was running out the ruffians bopped ha maternity in children hospital than a theater the people were using as a am shelter soldiers in civilians made a long last stand at the steel pan the lots of failed attempts to set up a humanitarian corridor big parts of the city would destroyed fly and his family manage to escape all that they made a t pound and then last month incredibly the sad they wanted to go back to marry up to see if the old home was a place they could still live puticia valley hipness talked to alias about what happened i meant silly will li was volunteering at a refer e enter and worse this past front one renydangn i was showing a couple hands had he was a camera and interne one another when ill yo walked him to the room i could tell you his interested but tho shy to say much i asked if he wanted to town us and one of the younger kids asked if they could intervene him they were eager to try with some one man he trot and popped himself in front of the camera he could tell that outside of mortices and he was a cool kid it was something about the way he carried hyssop i that oi remember thinking about how dark the rings ere under his eyes i double checked as he sat in front of the camera you sure you one to do this why not he said yes o dulia was seven asks his name and how old he is ilia replies as et yet wat a a bat you my name is ilia and i am twelve years old my city is maniple i was born in mariupoy have lived there for s pan of twelve years all of them i lived there until he works fell in us that is that is hong going to name such unpleasant characters the works are his way of saying russia soldiers then he tells the room at that rush i all yer second question is probably going to be about my feelings about the war and then he went on to answer his own question he described watching asap stall the massive steel factory near his house that the fustian's bomb for months as it burn for days on end about how he had hid in a basement whilst nips fired at his home right into their windows code bi talus a just o boy the clever show boss a do not berlin says the curious feeling was when he finally made it to his grandma's house i house he spent a lot of time in and it was completely burned down there were corpses of people laying outside all around he did not ow of his grandma was alive or not we wish boy was he gambit missed a nobles an meal we came to my grandmas and we could not enter because the house was completely mine it was not until hours later he found out his grandmother had survived e hes a here jane the eleven year old filming him stopped recording ilia covered his face with his angry birds teashirt it was remarkable to me that he had made it out of marble and all the time i was in poland i did not meet anyone else from his city ilia and his family made it to one of worsens nice or refuge e centers which offered them long turn housing doctors lawyers teachers and psychiatric mud come in to help on side there was food and a playroom for kids it was safe well run orderly the day i met ilia he ask for my number right away that is just the kind of city is a little business man sometimes in the mornings if i was late to my ship he would call me to nature i was still coming and then confirm a time to be e fact he would then informed the others and i would arrive at the shelter he would be waiting for me outside billion was all mar serve than the other kids he could not always break out of his quiet when he did he would get into long conversations with me using phrases listen here van or you got to hear me out how a to after months of hanging out with ilia in the other kids i had to go back to the states on my last night working at the shelter as lea walked me to the tram stop which had become our daily tradition he chased me with the water gun and la he seemed to be getting used to paly o but a few weeks later he called to say that his family him his long dad and sister were making plans to go bad back to maypole i had not heard of any families alias who would managed to escape mariapole and make it all the way to safety in poland to then try and return after all the city was badly damaged and now under russia control and the shelter they were in it was one of the better ones the one's most wanted to get into i called alias ma o wat to much out ting a to she told me that last week it was island his sisters birthdays they don't want birthed parties she said they my wont anything no present the only thing that they wanted for their birthday it we are take its home awe petites hes but i asked her have you been trying to prepare your children for the fact that things may be different a he across the book of la n his not in wudeto she said we i tell them look how beautiful wars is what could everything we have here when we come home it is not going to be beautiful this she said she tells them that they are nock an have ice free and they could say we do not need any of this e ready to eat while we have you just h want to go home not w et i towny o the truth is iliasmot felt the same way as her kids she told me she would rather wake up in her own home than sane pollen they been on the run for once she would had told many temporary places and she felt no relief for comfort and also this was a big part of it she felt an obligation to her own parents which she left behind but she also worried about what it would be for kids to see the city change they will have to come to their own conclusions she said i talked to ilia farewell about it he said he wanted to go home because that is where his grandma is he said it'd rather be home were sure conditions are in grated tat i can do as i than just be a little cat here not knowing my place prior to the war i he had spent most of his time living at his grandparent's house because his parents work much when can his parents fled mariupole it was the first time he had left his grandma and his entire life a i worried about only one thing when he said i really do not want to go back to school he said he was not worried about anything that might happen within the class room he was worried about actually getting there he had heard that there were minds everywhere he said a freaked him out e ably he did not his parents leaving him to go to work at the factory for the same reason and told me he would come up with a plan to started business there they could all work together selling back packs and naknaks that the fleemarket or something ilia actually expected home to be different he was aware that rush had fully occupied his city and saw in social media that now even the sign at the entrants that s ad mariupole had been changed a it's what i get a is yo ski now now look at the first photo that is that is what they've changed it to i now look at the second photo it says marigold and instead of a outrank and e they added a russia e s they have already renamed it o i was maniple used to be at maria know it is made mud a a a yo anoa he hell told me in his sister been fighting about that his sister thought that when they got home they just make peace with the fact that maniple as they knew it was now over t the ruffians had one but this was their new life ilia re fused to accept defeat he ruffians were the one who destroyed the city he figured you cranial would keep on fighting all an all he had makes feelings about returning ye cut t a i want to go when i do not want to go he sang fifty per cent one way fifty per cent the other ye t a this is the thing you's trying to set straight for himself was marble stilling to feel home two days later mid august illiattexted me from the road by the way he wrote there already on rut home i do not known it'll be able to write to you again and then radio s silence i could not get a hold of ilia or his mother i stated up into the morning hours scrolling through you crazy an telegram channels made for this exact reason ad there been a bombing an miss ill strike that i had miss but then a couple days later hilly popped up on my screen he wrote to me of bad news the border cards had want let his mama and sister in to crane because of a document as so the family decided to split up his amen test returned back to dorsal while he and his dad continued to maniple and then a few days later another ten message came through all you had made it he wrote me and of date the way he always tens it and long run on sentences there apartment had light and water though the infinite was spotty and there was no gas but they bought an electric stove yesterday no more of that on the first day back he made sure to see his grandmother they hugged and drank tea together just old times he walked her on the neighborhood with his dad he told me he was nervous about filming outside because the soldiers did not it when people did that even he insisted on sending me at least on cilia lily's hand is shaky as if he is trying to keep his phone hidden but i can still make out the image a large collapsed building next to a stop silly his favorite super market the only thing left of it it is men on bens yeti tenor a y ne later we talked on the for he told me i lived in the city for eleven years and i got use to certain things and now nothing really works it used to butts be o o the anon i the loop story t it is all broken down he said but there a new house is being built i mean you hear shots being fired from the distance they are de mining a late now and then to day at eight we heard machine dun rounds being fired we does not to scooldavia wherefrom i asked we did it well not from far away nearby when he went to the cemetery with his dad to visit some family who had been kill during the war he was show he go be which oo m u he told me i went to the cemetery and there ware many craves i cannot even describe it to you you cannot even count them it was many and this is only at one cemetery a go get shaky we left some flowers some candies some cookies a drink and some cigarettes because my mom's cousin and her husband they used to smoke and that is the tradition you just you leave them mention cigarette publish according to local officials the russia siege of maniple kills at least twenty two thousand people and may be a lot more ham island i talked a lot over the pasoreves and as time went on i began to notice something in our calls but the things that once bothered him the soldiers a minds his sisters attitude about the war we started to describe them differently yes lots of the city was mess but did not feel as bad as it had looked on hi spoke from poland he had lit and electricity and when i asked if he was still nervous about those mines on his walk to school he said y e stole no i already been walking and there is nothing there the russia soldiers just told me where to walk and were not to walk i been listening to them ilia was now taking advice from the soldiers that occupied his city i yesiliav you are there lots of russia soldiers there i it of key gens ye and on there is chetchens will you and what they just walked round the city i asked w ye they just walked round the city thought to shops to different places not of on you see bevy guard and how do they behave themselves a bit a excellent polite honestly when the chickens are here in the kits come up to them they give you moneys you can by candy his mam told me the chickens give him sod as nan chips anything that kids ask for when i asked silly if it was heard for him that there are resign soldiers everywhere he told me do not i already got used to it you think they will stay there forever or for now lot forever ill y told me he would even made friends with some of the russia and checked soldiers it felt strange to hear him say that he knows it is russia that started all this but there are the ones in charge now and he told me people get killed for being proem crane there are all kinds of things that do not make sense invalid's life right now there are parts of town that are destroyed and parts that are fine schools in session but there are mines along the way when you are living through a war there is only much you can set strait you have to hold a lot of contradictions in your head at once ilia is getting pretty good at it valley canoness one of thepuors of ours always women sis to finally did make it marriage and surprise the grandparents allow is the to fillmentthere as regression present in fine mere prudent side decree to made four regions of you crane into part of russia officially cooking what alias is right now the ignition secretary general said the move went q against everything the international community is meant to stand for i to oh what a handled web we weave quickest up before we start the story that dimensions part of the male and atomy they that under advisement pro and con decide what you going to do it is not what the story is about the star is about a creepy and dangerous creature that is all kinds of terrible things this as about somebody who takes issue with every word i just said about that creature lily eleven met up with this person to hear er out this person is my friend kelly patched and if you run in to her at a dinner party are bar maybe you happen to be standing behind her in the security lying at the air port she might ask this what do about black woo o spiders what o k i know that they are very poisonous they have a really bad bite a bite that can kill you he and dam and i know that the female after mating lake kills the male and eats him fantastic that is exactly what most people know about backwoods of spiders and your totally wrong and this is falsie's mission the expose the lies about the spider being a wanton murderess correct the record and restore her good name kelpie s to work as a park range er in new york by the way she else is to report science stories and over the years she is a mass and absurd amount of information about these spiders let me it let me tell you it'll start with the the black widow name the idea that the black widow eats her husband or the spider they just mated with that she is a is a murderer forestall in black morning a husband that they just killed kelpie says the female eating the male of this has happen but very rarely and it is barely a noticeable trait if you look around about the rest of spiders are doing many species of baby spiders which are called spider lings often eat their siblings right after hatching and some species of spiderlings even eat their own mother after hatching and sexual cannibalism which is eating your mate after he has done the deed with you is very common in the spider world but whose who is not common that much for is backwoods ow spiders they only do this in captivity it practically never been seen in the wild in the northern hemisphere meanwhile the male spider here is no mister rogers check to what he does the male black widow will sometimes go round to the the females web and sort of clip off little parts of it that she has no exit routs and then he will go up next to her and calmly sort of caress her and then he throws a web of his own over her to then copulate with her and the scientists have called that web the bridal vile which is not what that should be called are you serious oi cut this it strikes me as a very weird behavior and if i were a person naming spiders and saw that sometimes the female eight the male after eating but also that the male does this crazy thing and ties down the lady basically i might name the spider after that but why did not they because they were men he thought it was exceptional that the female killed the male my gush cannot have that a lot of species of spiders do this bridal male thing one theory as throne cell lays out that the male's trapping the female there is another newer one to which is more accepted by scientists ne tee it is more as seduction than a trap as scientist put it when they explained it to me it is bondage yet spiders to bondage nit number tax that her bite is fatal from nineteen fifty to nineteen fifty nine the data we have says that the were sixty three deaths in the guess from blackwoidow spiders interesting way most of the black widow bite victims hackman seem to be male in an older stay they were eighty per cent male here is a theory as to we most of the reported a black widow bites from this time happened in what were called outdoor privies a outhouses h black widow spiders they enjoy dark lode the ground sort of places they especially love to make their cob webs between two objects and because bugs stinky places you know imagine flies right this flies in outhouses that it makes a great food supply right ha and to get to the stinky stuff yo got to go through the bowl right i putting your web there is excellent imagine this is nineteen fifties your dud you need to go number to you make your way out to the outhouse sit down and you junk tangles there handles yet that is but she said and as it does it hits the cob we and the usually nonaggressive black widow it stinctually runs over and bites down on the new creature that is landed on its web my god get that do not cent terrifying now it is is not it ye yet there i not even you cannot even imagine a better situation tailor to getting bits by this like usually very nonaggressive spider they do not come after you and the statistic that you saw yet how many bites were on penis the majority were on on fetuses don't wit dot she thinks all these penis spites happening regularly might be one of the reasons there were many deaths space then the skin there is less thick and there are lots of nerves there right and this is a narrow folks in venom oh oh oh perhaps being bit on the genitals sins the venom going into your body a fast or stronger way than say if you were bit on a callous on your foot anyway the point is once more people had indoor plumbing along with improved asks site magical care the number is which were not that high to begin with they have gone way down and in the last several decades there is no record of any one dying from a black wood ow spider no one in fact the backwoods has usually a pretty shy spider scientist i evens and tests where they poke and proud her trying to less at a bite and she turns to other defenses first tries to run away curls up into a little ball n ta bigger than a quarter sometime she those silk at the danger to try to escape the bite is her last was ort ye i think that the world should know that they have been lied to and that this this the black word o spiders not the bet else has a proposal to set the record state change the spider's name easy get rid of the name that mires her and all this twisted lower she does not deserve i think that is what it looks re naming her backwoods of spiders were not always called layers s they have had many different names some of the name a the hour glass spider the tea bar spider the me walk people intigionistoc californium called the spider book to the one she likes best though the shoe button spider u the shoe button spider yet she looks a button after all little round one i decided to test out this new name on the people i thought were the best suited to judge it was my whole chest was in a win scrip i spoke with eight people who would been bitten talk to even others over hemal here is some of them and not to the worst cramp it you ever had in your wife a barley horse finger but that being my hole back bit a really bad sharpy horse at does stalk and en cops you chasstray quit ting at my body and i would holding on you the be panel both the vehicle and breathing myself when it would happening and pro it merely not i cannot rendered i win but if feel to go in waver not every one whose bit has a bad reaction this and again bites ere very rare and a lot of the times there mild but when it is bad it is bad i ran tells his idea by them do you think we should re name the black wood o spider the shoe button spider thirteen people wait in no one was into it why got i not i do not that at all no no that be e name that the show button rider back me of they but a the very ma name this is gene she got bit eight years ago in a portably a novella i roger ben black wit a rider merit me to of no ti a tort o ort a spider you in tat wen on and they probably have that bat but o black wit a i it it it uni come bow and and i think tho spider that on have for some one else the would been bit told me honestly i think black widow is an excellent man where i a spider i word feel really equal an coy sellevan is one of the bees of our show call page is hosting an up coming podcast all about big rival rest ant history and got to be petty feuds it cons one's on keep youriyes out coming out democrats an republicans in congress on doing such a great job coming to thoughtful by partisan solutions to our nations problems let us see what they do with you four that is in a minute chico bubgredio when our programmed continues to saran life amir glass to day's programmed setting the record straight stories to people who feel very strongly that they have to clarify what is true and what is false but something very important to them weavarrived to fact three of our programmed at three you f no fiderday with for to bunch of people setting the record straight on something and now it is my pleasure to introduce our senior editor avid cestonboun who is usually very measured something wants to get off his chest the thing it'd the record set straight on you for are not real they are not aliens from other planets come to this at us yes i know the paragon recently announced the new program to study weird stuff pilots are seeing yes i know there was that superolong new yorker story or maybe you saw the sixty minutes piece we have tracked many strange stories on sixty minutes but perhaps none this it was pretty good teeth s what you're tilling me is that you in fools unit dintofo sling objects or real we'll a seep we beyond that ready unidentified does not mean alien space craft it means identify or maybe you saw these videos the navy rs and even even the sky what is true merry beers or resident from ears core and record o objects in sis that we o no exactly what they are pecan explain ow they move her trajectory my do not a in easily explainable particularly maddening our conversations have had with people i know about this and midway through i realize oh i have to be polite because it is clear they think this is real no more polite i have reasons for thinking all this is bullshit science reasons for aliens that actually visit us if they exist in the first place they would either need to be insanely patient or be able to travel faster than the speed of light cause the nearest stars are crazy far await i was a grads point in physics i worked on one of those giant particle accelerators i can tell you you can try to make those particles go as fast as you want they get very close to the speed of light but they do not go faster we got to ninety nine point nine nine nine nine five four present to the speed of light you can double the moon of energy using and it does not double the speed it just gets you a tiny bit closer to the speed of light the universe really does seem to have a speed limit that is what the equations tell us i mean maybe there is some way around it but it really really does not seem it and think about it for a second in the fifties it may be made sense that all the outvotes were blurry and hard to decipher but to day every single person with a smartphone has a superpowerful camera in their p pocket that is billions of cameras if alien spacecraft are here should not we have better pictures and the fact that basically know scientist seem interested in this at all and prefer to dwell on say detailed questions of how solar systems form it tells you something if any these photos are made our blips or whatever really were alien craft it would be the greatest discovery of all time i cannot think of a font big enough for the front page but basically every scientist and every university is sitting it out as kneel to grasstison the astrophysicist who runs the planetarium the america museum of natural history put it hots talking about the people who believe these things are spacious quit the fact that you do not know what it is is not evidence that what it is o k you know science exists he says cause the human sensory systemsevs unfortunately with scientist of doing science there is almost no one left to try to set the record stays no one to quote in those new stories saying think that is just a weatherballoon if they do quote some one it is often this my mac west have looked a literally hundreds if not thousands of you oasis people send be them old time and is always new one's coming up mac runs a website called megabuck where he another tread are really run these things down sometimes they figure out the object in the photo or video was a plain by finding the actual plain from maps in flight records or one of my favorites there is this photo some one on a vacation took of these mysterious lights up in the sky over the water mac thought it looked a reflection off the window is taken from inside he found the actual rental house based on the position of the mountains in the photo called the home owner conmincter to take a photo from the same spot by the window and confirmed yes a reflection of the living room lights most you have for cases are really really simple a boring occasionally a you get an inn interesting one and the most interesting ones the ones that you get ye from the government i called mack up earlier this year because something exciting was about to happen there is going to be a congressional hearing on you offs the first in fifty years which meant finally the experts were get away on the record in front of congress this stuff unexplained things seem by pilots a on radar is usually secret but now we are going to hear from the people actually looking into these things presumably with the help of the smartest scientists i wanted them to set the record straighten in these partisan times when red and blue america seem to violently disagree about everything under the sun this is one issue neither side has ta taken come on america maybe we can agree on something i would that i really would the morning of the hearing mac west tan i got on azure together to watch at live the on the west to sos little before sixty in this time we are waiting for it to start bayou feeling about this thing its can't be very interesting i suspect so skin bean mixed back i mean to for me for me i think unless they have a scientist their testifying it could be very hard for me ye well i think what the gods look about is setting up the programmed and proceed an i can talk about the evidence and i can agleam there i think i think they are i i heard this morning the you this is can new that they may be showings from vide and talking about their analysis of to vice which you surely superinteresting from me because ' well about be you analysis the feet of the hearing started the some committee will come to order the big formal hearing room on capital hill couple of large america fly as in the back more than fifty years ago you es government into project blue book that is the chair of this house intelligence said committee congressmen angry carbon democrat for median e teas kind of weird and also delightful to hear a discussion of the offers wrapped up in the formalism of a congressional hearing for it turns out the government sorts tho the question of whether we have been visited by aliens the same way does any other problem there is a task force this one sat of last nonmember call the euroborn object identification in management mechanization group or aim saw to that so your pronounce it to day will bring that organization out of the shadows yes ring it out of the shadows there were two very high ranking officials there to testify and answer questions from the lawmaker son i i under secretary of defense for intelligence in security road sultry and shot bray deputy director of naval intelligence we also me bray laid out what the new task for was doingthey now have a formalized system for say pilots to report things they see and currently a date abase of four hundred incidents in i reported going through them thing to figure out what they are many as i hoped working with all kinds of smarchinally subject matterects work from a wide variety of fields including physics objects medalergy meteorology you pose by the way have now been regraded u pens unidentified aerial phenomena me we ma n i think pilots will not be embarrassed to report sayings and now the military does have real concerns incursions in our training ranges by unidentified objects represent serious hazards to safety of flight bray said there several categories of what these things could be s the airborne clutter a n atmospheric phenomena in some weather the unknown your they could be something of ours may be a drones something from one of our adversaries i which might pose hae national security to for one final category a been he called your other which quit throws for the possibility of surprise and scientific discovery or he did not seem to want to a alien say in the apartment ones then things got interesting word bray turned to a screen in the hearing in this fhidio you as navy personal recorded what appears to be triangle some flashing recorded several years ago off the coast instant this is a video that ha in leaped to while ago but never explain number small it is wild wins the footage's green because it shot with night vision goggles vidioand wat you see are these very clear trianglesthey really appears to be some sort of triangular craft linking your mack was not impressed this is this w put this bikinis polissit the are this issentiy is a camera out to facts people a plan a cameraart of fact mac claims there not really triangle shaped he thanks it is a kind of optical illusion crated by the camera itself next bray shows a still image with another mysterious green triangle just the ones in the video several years later and off a different coast you ass navy personal again through night vision goggles and an sell our camera a recorded this image but this time other youescnavias at also observed an material systems near by meaning drones or something that bray says there what the camera was saying the triangular appearance he is a result of light passing through the night vision goggles and then being recorded by an lesson our camera sank her excellent haw d you feel about that he just showed the video an and it luxuriantly bad and then the actually explained ye that that is right that something o ha to being looking but that be error i ma well every year now and right from the yet ten seconds after the i day was posted i recognized what he was and post of the wishes a cameraocy fact and no one in the government has said that now now said e and the person least is being veemencely insisting the in is actual pyramid shape craft flying around and the s i i completely wrong an o we her the the cobras just explained that i was correct which is a which is grit put that once to rest one record set straight one unidentified lying object identified it is coprashowed another idea which you said was more tirerilyn this as one make had see ample it was new the first had not been previously released which shows an observation unreal took a it is this this one is from an of eighteen citified it is shot out the window with what seems some one's for you errand for the tiniest fraction of a second limited something flick aby ait is there and that it is gone there was what was i to this that is in many cases that is all the report may include davits say to sherif alarm make t gets through the is mister bra can you re run that first image it looked it was outside of a plain win a congressman madam shift democrat from californium chair of the house intelligence committee and if you would not mind going up to the screen and tell us what were what we are saying explain why we should be looking at in that first image absolutely it turns out the technical capability of the s military has its needs there rial hard time stopping the video at the exact frame where the thing flashes by they try for four minutes if you could stop that from ti something his is terrible media terrible example is almost certainly a been at on cluster s not demonstrating any we at van me ne ring or ais en what you see here i is and a aircraft it is a operating in the a any us name a training range a that is observed a spiritual object i in that area and as they fly by it they take a video you see a a it looks a reflective in the video somewhat reflective somewhat reflective cuss is a my label and it quickly passes by a the commit of the a of the graph and is this one of the phenomena that we cannot explain i do not have an explanation for what this the specific a object is and is this one of the situations where is that is that is the object that were king after thank you a and is this the situation where it was observed by the pilot and it was also recorded by the aircraft's instruments we will talk about the multicensor part a in a later session later session means the behind closed doors part where they go over all the classifieds tax translation they have other data had a some advance icing that who knows maybe givesthem a pretty good idea of what this is e or what it is not suggest you but because it is classified they cannot talk about it not helpful and then this happened mister multure ma alleger republican for wisconsint ask the bunch of question is o bray and also under secretary molter and he seems to be in prosecutor mod lake is trying to get something important on the record other basically do of any other programs currently looking into u a peas answer no or any ones from the past decades we do not know about you do fact then this it is also been reported a that there have been u p observed can interacting with and flying over sensitive military facilities particular not just range is but a some facilities housing our satiric nuclear forces at one such incident elegidaly occurred at mamstram ere fore face in which ten of our newclyrice beams were rendered inoperable at the same time a going red or was observed overhead or not commenting on the actin of this obsiisi big gothic to you fin mythology have any comments on the accuracy of that we pass after mister bray looking ape a tremors that that is not a within the holdings of you be response look at but are you aware of the the report i have a i have heard stories i have not seen the official bat on why me is pretty high profile incident i do not claim to be an extra on this but that is out there in t ether your you are the guides investigating it i man who else is doing ti something was a firstly brought to our tenon we old look at it a they're anythings er out thou anethole officially brought to buttons how would have to be officially brought your course ism bring its your cousin is prettificial torso wo back big look at it but throne there is som a authoritative figure that says there's aninsnt that occur we would you to look at this we i do not claim to be an authors at a figure but for what is worth i would you to look in into it for other was now there was something that needed explaining a red orb nuclear i we bees becoming inoperable i figure the must be at on siphon video made our computer records but nice explained that there would not be this incident it allegedly happened in the nineteen sixties recess this hearing a return in the cold session at noon other a then it was over the first you afoul hearing in congress in fifty years mack and i had different reactions to the hearing he thought it went fine i i i felt this hearing was good and that we did get om star at i think it was fairly well balanced and the touch lot about the process to the sing to less up i was pretty frustrated it'd wanted some one to say look there is no reason to think any these things ore alien space craft or we do not have definitive evidence of anything that violates the laws of physics make wanted that last one to actually we did not get it have you feel about the unending nature of this you do not to mean everyone's going to walk away from every one of these hearing yet believing exactly whatever they want yer yet people who want to believe in clients was the look we had hearing this real and people lake pouring to say look they showed the vision actually explained what it was see yet ye t you reference but it is the topic that impossible to ad because this always going to be in identified flying objects this is a horrible thought that i hadnreally grappled with there will always be blurry photos of things in the my probably more now theverone has a sulphone with them all the tile there really is only one way the record will ever get set straight bat we will get an answer to whether aliens are here on earth and that is if we actually find them in other words the believers can win my side can you can never prove aliens aren't here done telling you they are not the carton you is a primal senior titer to t a than a to the is tennis day by

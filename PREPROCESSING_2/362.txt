welcome to the superman lapponkes o science science pass to life i m enter supermen and om a professor of nerbilogy and opthymology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor robin chart arris doctor career arris is a distinguished professor of neurology and psychiatry at the university of californium plan francisco he is one of the leading researchers in the field of psychedelics and how they change neural circuitry in the brain his laboratory is responsible for understanding for instance how syliciben also sometimes referred to as magic mushrooms change neural circuitry in the brain such that new ideas and new forms of learning occur is laboratory is also responsible for carrying out various clinical trials some of which have demonstrated that appropriate dosages of syliciben can alleviate major depression in more than sixty seven per cent of people that take the drug now this is not to say that everybody should take syliciben and today's discussion describes both the clinical trials and why treatments with psychedelics in some cases work and in some cases do not work in order to treat major depression as well as discussions around syliciben lisergagaci diethlemide sometimes also referred to as els d as well as d m t and how these change the brain and how those brain changes can relate to changes in mental health as it relates to depression and other psychiatric challenges as well as how psychedelics are being applied in order to change neral circuitry for sake of expanding different aspects of the human mind including creativity intelligence and much more during to day's discussion doctor chart arris teaches us about the history of the study of psychedelics as well as how the legislature that is the laws surrounding psychedelics are evolving in the united states and elsewhere for the use of psychedelics to treat psychiatric challenges by the end of to day's discussion you will have a thorough understanding of how psychedelic's work both in the short term during the actual journey or trip in fact much of my discussion today with doctor chart arris talks about the different aspects of the psychedelic journey and how those relate to therapeutic outcomes and of course by the end oftodas discussion you will also understand the long term effects of psychedelics that is how they can actually rewire the brain before we begin it'd t emphasize at this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science backtolectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doom slash superman and now for my discussion with doctor robin chart arris doctor chart arris welcome have been wanting to talk you for a long time i certainly known who you are for quite a while because i place you in this very small a very special an important category of researchers who has been pioneering the use of psychedelics for the treatment of specific clinical conditions and really on carrying the torch for essentially the entire field what a start with the a voice of gratitude and a thank you for doing this incredibly important work could you tell us a little bit about what psychedelics are fact i curious as to how the name psychedelic ever came to be and what you think they potentially reveal about the workings of the brain and then we will talk about the clinical applications well even that one is a is a cannot hot one because a opinions differ on how to define psychedelic but perhaps a good starting place is to start with the etymology where did the word come from and it was a brit excommunicated and living in in canada humph sent he at was due to present o a paper at a national academy of sciences meeting on psychotomematics drugs that mimic aspects of psychosis in their action and certain drugs masculine an see nineteen fifty six and elastin at well on on the bill and ha he felt dissatisfied with them being under this catocree of psychotomematics and felt that the signature psychological effects of these compounds went beyond just mimicking psychotic symptoms and he wanted to find em or apt turn to speak to in a sense the principal component of their action and at he jotted down a few different a possibilities about us in torso i think and one of them was psychodelicatually has started t as an ended up being psychedelic and hat he had a correspondence going on with another be it also living in the es order psycho a where they were playing with some terms to refer to these compounds and and the in the end the almond one wit psyche relic and he had this little ditty aim to fathom hell or saw angelic just take a pinch of psychedelic a that is we for the display an and and what does that mean it is to ancient green word psyche means the human mind or if wee being a as she true to the ancient green it means soul an and then the other component a means to make clear or to make visible or to make manifest or to reveal to all of those work and and it is it isn't neologism it is a made up word but it does have that ancient green origin and it is speaking to this principle that these compounds reveal aspects of the psyche of the human mind the soul that ordinarily not entirely visible an and that is yet myology and it is wonderfully poetic but i happen to think it is also very accurate it is a a useful term because its sort of you might say valance non specific it does not say o can have a great time or the you gong to go mad ait is more that it reveals psyche and it could be hellish but it could be heavenly an and a that is the etymology and also bit of the psychology an ane in i pointing to the phenomenology the subject of experience but there is also a pharmacology here and quite recently there was put out ay nonsense statement about psyche relics the really referring to what we call the classic psychedelics to say that these oral compounds that work on a particular receptor in the brain the return into a recept a and that is in not the way that we cut define these compounds i said this one's a little hot because ism of the view that while the pharmacology is really useful how the drugs were chemically you cannot avoid the phenomenology and if we trust the etymology where the tum came from than we must recognize ad we cannot neglect the subjects of experience thank you for that a beautiful description of what brought us to to day in terms of using the word psychedelics and now its thrown around all the time yet too much yet too much and and ism guessing on no guessing ism certain that it is i also used to describe many compounds that do not touch the five ago to if have each tea to a the ceremony into a receptor am there is a broader categorization by most people and am we interesting to see where all the coming cloture naming goes for the time being id love for you to tell us a bit more about this idea that psychedelics however one defines them can reveal something about the mind that cannot be revealed otherwise are you talking about the subconscious i mean the you know psychologists and mast famously frond but also young and all also neural scientists i think ism think about subconscious processing i think perhaps the most sailing example for me that is outside the realm of of anything psychedelic would be blind sight this phenomena the you take people that are blind but still have some connectivity in their brain and you present them and aboard with i computer screen with different number of dots on each side you say how many dots are on each side of the screen they say what you mean i cannot see the screen an blind sit would just ass and their garage is accurate far more than chance would would protection they have called blind sight and people of said well this is the subconscious revealing itself an there is no second ell a drug involved but what you're describing is a formal object indue state that reveal something that normally ow should we assume is masked or that we are oblivious to a even though it is expressing itself but what what does it mean for the drugs to be re the you revealing something about the workings of the mind that would would not be obvious to us otherwise ye since the a example of blind sight is interesting but it is different blind sight would be a referring to unconscious processing may be implicit processing a stuff going on in the mind imperception in a sense that is below the threshold of conscious were but yet its influencing e s its sort of kind of related but it is different a in in kept psychologypsychonalysis psychodanomic psychology an a sigmanfroid call and on an we take about the unconscious a and that it is more about the kind of blood an got o the human condition wit human nature bi the personal unconscious ay things that you might not want to necessarily be conscious of cause it is painful a that that is the repression aspect pushing it out of conscious whereas repressed memories and particular ye dramatic memories a difficult a relationships o could be complex roman notnassary just the specific in a index tromabut a series of roman an and you have the collective unconscious which is really can young contribution to say that am in a there a transpersonal quality to the unconscious this aspects about human not just this individual human a thees aspects to our on our minds are psyches that a am not fully available to conscious awareness spoken come up in certain states in a psychoanalysis when crazy for dreaming as as the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious that was frond am but a we now know with psychedelics and this was what dreamy into the area was discovering literature am that we speaking to this particular action the psyche dedication and wit saying that when these drugs lycelesty psalesyben ifaundimagimushians am when they used in psychotherapy am material comes up the may be may have been repressed am the the ta is of in a therapeutic vary an awareness an insight of this material seems to catalyze the therapeutic process with n a strong emotional release these cathartic experiences and a an insists whether the in puts e the personal am or whether the transpersonal am but a for me this is really where the meet of it is with psychedelics and classic psychedelics in particular the likes of compound psychs alestean an psalesybon i would say that if it was an for this action by classic psychedelics we would not be interested in psychedelics i i think we only had compounds catamaran emdimay cannabis does the could be said broadly speaking to be psychedelic i do not think it necessary would have captured the well detention is psychedelics are right now i anything is a major gaps of pail is this principal action of the cosmic psychedelics what does what does this mean that ism referring to psyche revealing what is that and dispose where ism going with this is what is that in terms of the biology as well what is going on in the brain and the body when people become aware of things the previously they were not fully aware made to talk about some of the clinical trials that you have been involved with ism in particular looking at sylisibon the as you mention the principal halls hallucinatory psychedelic agent in magic mushrooms ism id to start with a kind of nuts and bolts question ism just say that everyone is on the same page have read the papers that you have published in the others have published in this area and typically on the dosages he used in these trials are twenty five milligrams of sylisibon and we talk about one recent trial in particular that compared twenty five to ten milligrams to more frequent use of very small amounts one milligram over three weeks for instance however when people talk about magic mushrooms they often talk about gram doses of the mushroom because ism assuming that they contain milligram dosages of sylicibon here we are not am encouraging a use of any kind the are clinical trials but for them clarity of understanding what is the conversion typically one gram of magic mushrooms will contain how many milligrams of sylisiban on average because of what i want what ism trying to do here is is celebrate people to this idea of microdosing verses macrodosing and that is fairly straightforward to do with respect to the clinical trials but then in the the lot of the lay discussion around this you hear about heroicodoses verses microcosms and fighting there is a lot of confusion if you would am educate us on this a idea of what is a microcosm and perhaps also how many milligrams of sylicibon are contained in a graham of coin quit magic mushrooms wat a microdise is neither of these o that simple tether fa it is a fun challenge a microbe one definition is that it is a die oof typically a classic psychedelic plenty or salecibon an that is that has some perceptible psychedelic effects psyche it does not put you into a noticeable to state of consciousness that feels your tripping an and if that was list it looks as i the threshold is around bow that we ten eleven twelve microgram mirror mic cry on a very clearlaroga some and ten micrograms of list are you saying will not induce visual hallucinations in most people it is it is that is threshold level tan's about the level that that some people who are sensitive could feel it but if you were to talk to the a microdisingcyris they might say that that is kind of the all part for anelestydise that you would consider a microdise and then you would take the semi regularly it is typically something one day on one day off for one day on two days off this kind of thing there's different pritycl s and and yes in at some like him madman an a one of the popular users of microdising i think would say the a true microdise should be subperceptible you should not feel it yet the assumption is it is going to change you in some way one a kind of trait level more than a state level and an maybe behavorly and and the typical story goes it for improve well being an maybe maybe it could improve certain aspects of cognition say related to creative thinking and i emphasize the maybe there because that is another angle with microdising with kind of waiting force and compelling evidence as thinks standright now i say we lack an that compelling evidence ti some suggestive stuff but often the study designs on that strong it is really hard to do a study with microdising because you need to have permission to give people a microdise to in it a practical reasons they would go home with and an otherwise you your requiring them to be in the lab say three times a week for ex number of weeks to meet the criteria of a course of microdising which my be two or three times a week to say a month and that is a hard thing to do in a lad study its expensive you need to do that against say suitable control to a pleased by control and there is a study that is been done in new zealand and that has some interesting preliminary data the did i think can it did the design right and but i has not be published yet and have seen some positive findings presented around improvements in unmoved but it is a bit early to get too excited about that and ten the try perofuan or that an but as things stand the evidence is pretty thin and and an we have to be honest about that we did quite a creative study o with my colleagues at imperial the guy leading that balance as sheet vulgarian chap and did really creative design very much his brain chilly and instructed people to do their own blinding there don't place by controlled blinding of their own microdising this was a classic citizen science study do it yourself science where they would get their elestesi shaves in hope them up put them into ja capitals i plaque and have other capitals that the place boy that they just close empty capital and then shows a whole arcade scan technique car that you you cannot shuffle them up but they have got the arcade in the cuarcode you can break the cod late to ran but once he have shuffle them up you no longer now which one had have the the microdisyan on which one are empty was a zealously is a sloshy also tried it with mushrooms but the issues with the mushrooms what people would but sometime the belch and then they have is mushroom taste then instructed people to get some i non psychoactive mushroom material to perinsis really to an easy study not an easy study and and the it was i love that kind of science in a real creative first move a kind of science and the results o fascinating because him the short story is that the microdosing did not and compellingly beat the place bloat it did not and he controlled because he asked i he controlled for expectancy said people was positive expectancy which is in a sense the vehicle that carries the place by response it is why you have a place by is the positive expectancy contrive the repeat effect to a large extent he measured that are trial and then used it to kind of correct for the response and habit it wore those who got a place by but thought they got a microdise did as well as those who thought they got microdise and did get a microdise say it was the bigger effect that the majority of the effect was in thinking that you got a microdise in ta sense it was a victory for the power of the place by response and it is created all sorts of controversy people do not want to believe it that kind of thing that is the beauty of science is not that that science is not about what you want to believe that right there is the beauty of science ready i love that experiment a kudos to them ism not going to attempt to say his last name i i i e wen you mad amusnot i i think you you got it am you were involved in a a clinical trial that was a published last year comparing twenty five milligrams of ism sylicibin to ten milligrams of syliciban is a very i to a at a drug called a i taloprim yer yer semipro semipro i and this one telegram over three week am dosage i in am wanting to discuss the results of that study a bit ism and some of the other trials that you have done involving syliciban for depression for the treatment of depression ism a could we calibrate ourselves twenty five milligrams of sylicibon is i is that what would not what its can be a perceptible dose presumably mollusk n is an all that and is that of what one would find in a ism guessing here if ism accurate this does not mean that i have experience here but a two two grams of of my of is tat a we think ye stria miss the the oo mistaken wen of fonitangen pert yet twenty five kilograms as police been would be we do not know and and it is important that i say that because i would not want people to hear my aunts a here and then use it to calibrate the araindising mushrooms and get it way off si its guess work and i love to see some on to proper study on it and yet am i look the olicibon content in a given mass sylocopy mushrooms magic mushrooms but to my knowledge that has not really been done am some one pose starts ride would give a better answer here but i think the percentage within the mushroom mass is some of solisibon in the mushroom mass and solicit which is metabolite of solisivon and is something in in the one per cent little bee may be a range case one one graham one thousand milligrams of magic mushroom would contain about ten milligrams of sylisivon i broadly speaking e great that helps calibrate an and i think again just allows the lay person to understand a bit more of were we are headed with these a sylicidin our trials and and the results we do not have to restrict our discussion to just that one clinical trial but if we include that one and in compared to some of the other trials that you have done i me you re laboratories seeing phenomenal in my opinion phenomenal results in the treatment of a otherwise intractable depression major depression which many people suffer from from to a i i suppose they are a two sessions of using sylisibing in these ranges of ten to twenty five telegrams to have that correct yes o c e could we talk a little bit about what people typically experience during those sessions that allows the phenomenal transformation of mood and state and trait as well and ism especially interested in whether or not it is the experience during those sessions that is the trigger that is necessary for the the transformation from a depressed to a non depressed state because i the the impulses to think it is that what one thinks and sees and hallucinates am an hearers is vital but of course these drugs can create normal plasticity changes in our normal wiring presumably for long periods of time what are your thoughts on the the experience itself and maybe for those who have not done these compounds before you could explain a little bit about what is typical for people and what you think is leading to that incredible positive and pervasive change in mood state and trip but it say that its more than impulse that is an leading us to think that the experiences important it is really data and and converging evidence now am independenteens independent studies a converging on the magnitude of certain kinds of experience latest yes with subjects i writing scales is predicting therapy to outcomes pretty pretty strongly and very delivery am and that is guiding us now could you say what maybe there's experiences of some kind of spy phenomenon i say a central brain action wet absolutely but then all experience is an happy phenomenon by that principle and yet we care about it en a and it matters a to us and in our human relations with each other i think it does matter to a human being when therein a say a psalicide an therapesession and as the drug effects begin to come on in e body starts to feel a little strange and tinkly and the the em some initial anxiety and then in their mine they start to notice patterns may be colors and then may be those patents deeper an the dynamic may have this fascinating organic quality or the patience in our studies to bemusing e and i mask yer so they rein the imisiyes collie that is what you said mind's eye i supposed to looking out into yes anothercal ta the make a differences to psychodelictherapeves is taking a psychotelicis you shut your hides and it is a it is a world away from taking psychedelic ye at a rave or something in a sense good luckthe an but in psychedelic therapy yet is it is and settled conditions and this music playing in one of describing here is very much the default a the is at in a very little variability between the different plates that have done this work on these conditions a typically it is true people ideally mental health profession was at at least one who a psycharterist of clinical psychologist of some other kind of psychotherapist for psychotic nurse an but ideally too who meet those criteria with a individual who ingested the drug and a music playing throughout a kind of runway into taking the drug and throughout o this continuity the music with lyrics or or withoutouslyrics to begin with and the music typically is spacious to begin with an and then builds and becomes atmospheric ah there might be ad a nice trial drums in the distance or or something as as it develops or the sound of a bird in the distance and i a birds call an and then as it gets into more stronger drug effects a the music and starts to coax a emotion and very intentionally end strings for example would come in and a and it is it would be an interesting experiment of one that we love to do actually a to see whether if you were to pull that out whether the the psychedelic experience would be as emotionally intense as as it is in psychodelictherapy when you have music there is a default and across the board people should find this remarkable because a kind of is all of the publish studies that an out en i having such an impact a on psychology an beyond have music there is a staple component and we just take it as assumption that it needs to be i tend to share that assumption but it is remarkable that it has not been tested properly but it is that you n if you were to run with that and and if you were you in i had a kind of critical gender you would say well this is music therapy and why u making all this fuss about psychedelics a it is music that is there in all these trials with all these fantastic findings i there is something to that and this will teak me up probably to talk about psychedelic therapy being a combination treatment a we have the chitin between the two vicious i ashen the hypothesis the assumption that should be tested met t there is a positive insurrection between the two recessivity between the two a that is why its psychedelic therapy yeoman just cart hart her it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there isn't i start taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiatics that i need for got health our god is very important as populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probiatics unathletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptions vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste trip if you would to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road and the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitamin d the k too again that is athletic green stoical slashhubermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a vitemend three k to this is extremely useful to hear because i think most people think of psychedelic whether not they have experience with psychedelics or not its a visual hallucination in some editor hallucinations and cynesisia some visual auditory blending am some at a sensation rubbing a surface and and being able to elicit the a sounds in one's mind am of course it camera but seldom do we actually hear about the the specifics of these clinical trials in a way that for instance points to music at one of the perhaps key variables now you mention that as people enter these psychedelic states that there is a little bit of initial anxiety m out a year and a half ago i had a discussion with doctor matter johns who is running some solicit an trials at john's hoping as and he mention that the critical importance at least in his mind to this idea of the patient voting letting go or allowing the experience to take them someplace mentally as opposed to trying to constrain their sensory and cognitive experience aiobcures what your reflections are on that on that idea and why it might be valuable clinically and this ties back to this earlier discussion we were having about the unconscious or about psychedelics revealing something that is there all the time but that we do not have access to it is and again ism ism struggling to find the right language for this because we do not really have a neural mechanism you do not top down in ambition or something that to explain how this unconscious might be uncorked in the psychedelic experience but to make it quite simple and direct how important do you think it really is for the patient to feel they are quoting letting go and what in the world is letting go in biological terms ye e i think we will get there in times of having been your carpets of the mind revealing itself to itself can the i science of unconsciouthe unconscious into consciousness or unconscious material into conscious of lenses it is a it is a wonderful challenge it is huge h challenge but it is the challenge to embrace and and letting go very much's again a staple component of have the different teams do this work in terms of encouraging a willingness to let go and when we started out doing our depression work and and did that first trial is the first trial of a vepsychadelic in a formerly dagos depression in a we that was the target population and depressed population's the first modern study to do that and and we visited hoping our friends there and and were and mentor on how to do the guiding bill richer very cossimana they were just and brilliant and and in a wising in there and in their guidance to us as to how to do the guiding in our trial and this phrase of trust to let go be open you are here a lot i do not know who fairly should be attributed to but i would attributed to bill a bill orchards may your everything's borrow you probably got it from somewhat one else but its such a see principle it is it is almost a matter that your trying to instill in people trust let go be open and those different components where the trust is about the the reputed report that again this goes beyond just in tuition now we formerly measured the reputed report we but do it even were just a single item me a visual analogues so iron the subject ratingscale ten on the morning of dosing and we find that it sir it is a significant predictor of the quality of the experience that you have under the trunk in in the psychadelictherape and then the theraputed outcomes ex weeks or months later an very powerful kind of chain of a for predictive components there the trust essentially important and again not just the intuition but the dates appointing to that let go at there is a readiness a readiness to surrender to let go to not resist an we do measure that to and see that it is predictive o response an and then the being open is about a an a willingness to go there to confront to be inquisitive ah something that is easier used than done can be terrifying and i when you are dealing with a very vulnerable population ah it is probably more the rule than the exception a their carrying some significant adversity life adversity or frank former that they have suffered and that message of be open be willing to confront and to go there is really an i it is really powerful an and that that is how it plays out an and often there is struggle there is something going on that is i do not want to be feeling this make it stop that can be night perish at times with it is very very strong and with these bigdoses that we give it is a it is very strong and a actually a a student an that have worked with an i think now doing a put marry broker is working on a fantastic project characterizing the different phases of the psychedelic experience with the early face is dominated by n negative emotions and a negative a negative the vigilance feelings of anxiety and struggle and than it is a different story and the later a could ask about that for i think that is fascinating and important to analyze the divergent phases and again ism delighted here because people typically here about a psychedelic journey but we never really hear about the the kind of stereotypic components of the beginning middle and end of that journey we know that there is a peace and that there is a kind of a part shooting down and an et camera but a when you say that typically there is an anxiety may be some negative silence in the early stage do you mean about the sensations people are experiencing or about some prior event that is being called to mind that there remembering m likewise for the positive phase of the psychedelic a journey or trip are people they still called a trip ye are for the a like a will you've trip for the psychedelic trip are people feeling positive about the experience ah there is been some sort of break through or there in a in a calmer state or is it that they tend to be focussing on prior events that were positive in other words is there a threading through of some a concept that comes to mind for people maybe about an earlier traitor may be about a sense of sell for a sense of other forgiveness a you do not could be any these things but what we know about the confiner details of all that o say the initial am struggle is more against a general drug effects than pinning it on on something specific it is more that in a normal waking consciousness we have a sense generally speaking if we well or well enough a sense of assuredness about what is wat an as ti grand and and i and an we have that assuredness in to an extent about ourselves as well it might be illusory but e have it and what the drug's doing is it is breaking downfall of that and it is carious he and i and if it is a big dice it is just human nature to bi to get in i race against that of ben and a bet dying i do not want this it feels i could be dying yam i might lose my mind yet that i ever come on a to i the classics is but i might i might know that have taken a psychedelic and i might even know a bit about psychedelics but i still fear that ism going to go mad an a that i know that generally speaking these drugs the have a hi an an i for facility an a risk ah i still think i gang to die and i an and it is just it is very palpable in that and that comes p say yet that is that i mean those of the court is tatty dis too and very relay that comes up and it is really a basic drug action it is dice dependent that it is a basic drug action that is forcing something about the nature f the mind and the way it is made up that makes it feel that way o but it feels ism losing my mind or it feels a could lose my mind or the i could go in saying or that maybe i ism dying here and this is be ye a you have talked many times before and have done really wonderful work looking at the changes in communication between different brain areas while under while people are under the influence of psychedelics i think the gestalt of those at are correct me if ism wrong is that ism compared to the non psychedelic state that under psychedelic influence am there is far more us just call it interconactivity or a communication i between a brain areas the typically are not communicating which probably i s not surprising to people given the the subjective effects of these of these drugs what is the evidence that after the psychedelic journey is over that some or perhaps all of that enhanced communication across brain areas is maintained and if what role do you feel that could play in these incredible positive therapeutic out comes yer we we have had a some recent findings in in that direction where yes it is true and yet it the a picture the says a thousand words of some people might be familiar with these two circles an the project that we did in liberation with some researches were ordinarily the communication is going on and within systems other regions of the visual system will be speaking mostly within the visual system tat be a cindiccleqist freakishness or a modularity to the quality of the communication in the brain and then the cool finding with soliciting was the first of paper is that the communication yes he sort of transcends these modules and becomes much more into modular an crossing different a modalities and that fair correlated with the magnify that the subjective effects and that we replicated it with elestesin different methods and a new paper come out soon with decent showing a similar effect the bit of debate about what regions of most implicated but the general effect of an increasing globe functional connectivity is what we call it will globe communication in the brain and this is well under the influence is the unrevised of repeople into a brain scanner while they are under the influence of the drug yea yet at itself must be a quite an experience given that these scanners are small r tubes you are in a bite bar yet u it a bite bar in your mouth that is a a all get quite a at u stay you do not always have a bite father at leas with the psychedelics but yer you go to keep you had still and and after loud i am a scaninois going but because it is regular am there are not you many surprises si it is at surprisingly tolerable inert in a hospital setting you not worried about what would happen if you had a party a of en in a profession has around and don't most people generally tolerate that setting quite well surprising well but years we do all that and and yes we do see that am opening up of the communication across systems in the brain and it does speak to kind of intuition about the subject of experience the in i different modalities might be blending with each other is it sorry for interrupting but i have to ask is it thought that the activation of the sunstone into a receptor is what is responsible for the increased communication between brain air is that under normal circumstances would not be communicate yes the is a few reasons why modelling work the computation modeling work the first identifies where the two a receptor is and then looks at and models its basic effects on your activity am well recapitulate the the or am recreate the effect that we see actually in the data with the scanning i doing the computational modelling you can see the same effect by knowing a whether to it whether the see receptors are and then making them do a certain thing that we now psychidolicsty i can imagine two possibilities and i think it is important to distinguish between these two one possibility is that the activation of this season in to a receptorateleast increase inactivity end hereby auditory visual hallucinations emerge changed patterns of thinking emerge et camera that sort of the obvious interpretation but am the scientist in me has to ask is it possible that all of that increased inactivity is occurring and yet that is a distinct phenomenon layered on top of some other effect of the psychedelic drugs impacting access to the to the unconscious hallucinations in other words is it the increased connectivity that is leading to the subject of experience or of those two things happening and parallel will they happen in parallel and the map to each other the question of causality what causes wat a is the tricky thing where i i would suggested the we the the causality is circular that i influence each other and that this gets a bit philosophical but a kind of matters because otherwise in a that's a trap the it is easy to fall into a were you are thinking that it is all about the brain action causing the subjects of experience and that typically what we doing collative mere science am it is kind of the tot of first port of cold kind of materialist the approach who will not combe a materialist essentially but still appreciate that circular causality the mind also interacts with brain am and it a to pick the to apart and there is a kind of essential dualism where subjects of experience is the thing in anon itself but that is not to divorseive from what is going on on the by much level the the reason i ask is because am as i understand it nowadays there's a bit of a movement within the scientific community that study psychedelics to develop drugs that can essentially cure or alleviate many of the symptoms of depression or drama that are built off our understanding of how psychedelics sylicibe in and here it'll throw empty am in there although classically notapsychodelicates connivers lumped in wend get back to that later but that do not produce hallucinations or massive changes an subjective experience i should think this is what initially got us into conversation on twitters i s had learned about this paper published out of a group at you see dais that essentially modifying psychedelics that they have potential therapeutic application for the treatment of depression but zero hallucinate genic properties and i thought while this is going to be a very controversial thing in the world right because the the history of psychodelicsas you pointed out has been one of people accessing different modes of thinking feeling seeing things these insetting go trust et camera a therapeutic relationship and here we have i do not want to say farm because it is not really farm but we have laboratories wo are trying to he's apart the activation of receptors independent of all that subjective experience in order to essentially treat the same conditions an we you to comment on this where you think it might be going and you knot whether or not you think that is the writ or the wrong approach if it has any validity at all it is farmers to son mama to is tots u mama be pokes because farm would to have drugs that can cure depression but do not make people hallucinate is that a they would and patience mine and the system would not because the system is used to tit is medicine right and it does not give this this a mental imagery of a the summer of love in san francisco or of v you don't callidoscopeiyes right once more e you can imagine the more to be careful with my wording here those who would not be incline toward that would might might embrace at the p u i that that is strictly effective at treating depression with no hallucinations at it does not look it in a an individual lying on a sypher crying there our eyes out a am about in a the life that they have lived am and that deep catharsis being life transforming the very different from that model an ism skeptical of it and mi for a few reasons and and one is that i i cannot see the logic am i cannot see the pieces fit in a way that is compelling and ism also skeptical was i think it could easily be wishful thinking because of that point that patience would it and the system would it and i just the cannot you got it there that in mind as well am would not it be convenient in a if it were true and you could get the therapeutic action without the psychedelic effect on a way that is a title bit of what microdot seems seems to be design ye you you said take dosages there below that that a perceptible or awareness of some effect threshold over a longer period of time in an attempt to ping the circuits or two you at you alter the circuits but not hallucinate yet not have a catharsis if if mycrodising could do that and it is sub perceptible the mychrodising is not psychedelic action because wheres the psychedelic action when psychedelic when defined mean psyche revealing you are not getting that effect you might be getting the pharmacology might be getting some direct palatine into a receptor agonist that could be driving a therapeutic response but you can get that with access rise as well an i and my point is what is what is new ora may be it suit knew in people are now developing direct to ay agonists rather an indirect through a ceremony releaser the selective serene retain visitors the escessorise serpriian are there any essessorise that selectively agonize an which folks by the way means activate in a good way agony sands terrible to those men an for might thing that mean the disrupt but they can activate the ceretoninto a receptor are the any drugs that will do that that are not psychotic ism not aware of abut then again am non o there ah there are me that there any that a licenseton used as medicine in psychometry as he had this delay an recently on social media and i could not see i could not see a compelling example i saw two agonist that we use for other things eve a compound liveried used in entreating parkinson's but atciits more of a opening agonists i and there always having other thing there it yer yes it tapping other in let be o trash rote things is there is here a selective ceremony to a receptor stimulator an agonist and that it is not psychedelic that is thereto enpsychaltry in the answer firmly as not i have not seen it yet will they develop one well for patient's sake i hope because it would be great an let us wait and see if they do i doubt it will be psychedelic and i doubt it would have much to do with psychedelic therapy an and it would be much more the system released to of chronic farm chemotherapy take your drug every day let us let us hope they find it an it works for patient's sake but as things sdanright now am a little skeptical let some of the findingstead of being seen that a really exciting f fantastic work being done showing things increases n the communication components of neurons dendritic grace a spine price a synaptic pine price yet by the way folks just all interrupt for a natanessarily spin the bone inner the not the cerebral a a calm but am spines are these little little tiny twigs with bulbs on the end of of neurons that are allow for communication points between neurons sooner pastose is often associate with growth of dendrites and spines and worth which is what whatrobins referring to that that reminds me an i just one o make sure that i we close the hatch on the earlier answer because i interrupted you is the increased inactivity between or communication between brain areas that is observed while people are under the influence of the psychedelic also observed later after the effects of the drug weareoff and then it'll just throwing another question there because we are on to this topic now to what extent do we think that now plasticity structural changes in neurons functional changes in anurans are responsible for that and how long does that last let say i take let i come into your clinic am am main subject in your experiment i take do come in in the morning i do my psychedelic journey five or six hours later an par shooting back to reality as we call it and then i go home increase inactivity lasts for how long and how long are the structural brain changes an during wall your asking fantastic questions and a partly because we do not have the answer yet but we do have some we do have some date and we have looked to us will the in a sense the function plasticity or what we assume it to be or at least the function changes the increasing communication across systems am that increasing probable inactivity function inactivity do we see it after the trip we know we see during the trip pretty well replicated correlating with intense strung effects do we see it after the trip the answer is we have seen it in to different depression cohort suicide integrity for depression in don't study where we look the next day we saw it kind of residue am a affect similar to what you see acutely being seen the next day and then in a subsequent study we saw it also three weeks later we have seen it to independent ay to sets this decrease immordularity is how we measure it the same thing essentially broadly speaking its the same the an increasing globe connectivity punctual connectivity and i she unpublished we have seen it in healthy volunteers on a correlation revel not on an absolute change level but if you look at it is relationship to a mental health outcome and this is an important thing to stress with he depression work we saw a relationship between the magnitude of that change the decreasing modularity or increasing global connectivity and the improvement in symptom severity interesting ye of what i and just a state a a different way am what robins referring to his wets i to modularity is our scientists we think of the the different modular networks of the brain that e of the eye talks to a region of the foulness in solved in vision which rocks to the visual courttacs which you eventually converges with auditory information of course am but there is a separation or modularity of function this increased connectivity is cross module enduring the trip but afterwards as well an you are saying that that correlates very strongly with the strength of the the audio outcome to depression man the the logical extension of that is that extreme modularity of brain function is depressive in some way n ow we do not want to go too far but what does that mean that increasing cross talk am between different modules of the brain is strongly correlated with a positive therapeutic outcome we do not know other than as a relationship i mean this is this is the thing we needs be little careful not to run with it too far i mean that some things that it suggests i think it suggests a more flexible a mode of brain functioning if you are not getting stocking modules or the modules on am excessively cut off from each other but you see different things with with different presentations if you a to look at cognition shop a cognition is that she associated with more modularity t it is a rule it is a little slippery and we need to be careful with it just a again o a forgive me for internet i think have friends who are am i would say are on the spectrum who are am very linear in their thinking in extremely intelligent in a in the conclassic sense of being able to watch it through hard problems to arrive at a solution and then have friends who are us just cellmate they are from the creative communities outside of science that am are very expansive am they see cut connections between many different things but you sometimes you have not all of them we have to catch their ideas with a butterflying at and oftentimes what they are saying does not sometimes just as it make any sense now they also produce incredible creative works but to have a conversation with them is anything but a linear experience they are not random thought generators am but there is a non linearity or random ass to their processing that is distinct from these other folks that ism describing as on the spectramen of course it is a spectrum there is a whole ranging between am sounds to me there is some therapeutic value you to being able to move along this continuum from the more linear to the non linear is that is that i think ate i ye your it is resinating what you are saying it speaking to my intuition the you i a you could be very pass passing things a hoping things u an analytical science is my li kind es better as we say in side your either a lumber i a splutter ye but the way in being very particular about what wat when to caul something psychedelic you i that that kind of party analytical way thinking you with you might associate with a for modulassystem you big am where as the system it's for gladly into connected and open ye might be more flexible and creative and divergent in the associations and on say yes that is speaking to my intuition to how ye your describing it and i imagine if you take severe psycho mythology severe mental illness a depression have always thought thither is something intuitive about the time itself a depression in a landscape win is that whimsical depression physical depression that it is easy to fall into and if you do its hart to get out of its almost am if i understand what your saying correctly almost getting am stock at one location on this continuum because most people do not reside at one or extreme one extremer the other at full time tin in o migrate back and forth between expensive sate said for linear stats you do i low mood if you are health and inverticomesy can filly me to disappointment but you can spring back but someone willing know you can spring meyeiht was the suicide or depressive person or too decidedly depressed person am somehow at least t my understanding there there is something about the extreme depressive states and extreme anxiety states something my laboratories a bit more familiar with anxiety which alters the perception of time such that people feel that negative that state is going to go on forever or that if it goes away that it is going to return at random ye kind of a vulnerability to the time domain yer gets and it my tragic but that the corgi i bus in depression that everything's hopeless and and there is no light at the end of the tunnel yes i you know if you are to get stock in that rot and have that bus then your cut off from other things are the century a modalities or mogul san i cuts off from the world cutoff from other people stocking in a rot and a yes i think we sharing this intuition that e a decrease in much clarity are an opening up of the the system the brain an could relate to an opening up of the mind that is kind of enduring after the after the psychedelic a dicing session and yet and and the third replication was to see and healthier an improvement in wealth being because that healthy we do not look at depression these are people that are healthy walking into the trail ye take filicide and twice a well as my they do and but the first ice is ore kilogram which they they do not feel it is supply by chronoscope micro oh we are sticky we on the heads an to measure that brain was and during each dice and one kilogram you see no change an we i think that you mycrodosers on just can tat i a again a acridine as have always just been of bit skeptical based on my conversations with the the scientist actually doing the work with with am with a psycodeics it seems the the answer keeps coming back do to to one or two maybe three mackrodos is in a controlled safe setting well hat's compelling the evidence for that is compelling and a that is what is making all the difference right now and my codes sees just appealing but again you know sane is not about what we want to believe a it is about what is sully coming through and what seems to hold up can i detesting would you say that is right the one or two or three sessions and how how far apart of those typically spaced in time ytobely one to three weeks across the sits is the way people are doing the the psycelictheropydicing sessions two sessions a in a hoping imperil and why y am i that is a being a kind of default to we yet she is three in a care anerectiatrals son a sudden therapy franerects he a two patients left to to see after am nineteen have gone through the trial very exciting results the using a alleviation of the the obsessive thought about food in a willingness to consuming even healthier amounts of ye even in improved a wait at the long follow i critical a wen we didn't episode on eating disorders and i learned that a intersection serosa which by the way folks the rates of are not increasing it is been pretty stable through time despite what said about social media and a et camera but am incretion rose being the most deadly of all psychiatric illnesses which is a big statement because you do not a melic depression call by poler depression as a twenty to thirty times the the typical suicyderate a busily many erects it your people withanerecty i think is how it is now as the is what one says not a interests expect people withinerects her am often die many of them one yet tragic often young people as well and similarly with suicide in times of premature death the tragedy with psychometry is strong and and ta a it is it is rewarding to be doing that train to be saying it results i have to check myself a little bit that an ism an reporting on it in this very permissery way and tat the trial is not yet publicly released and and publish say an it is still on going as well but that is three three section ins three sessions and i cannot say what the disease is because we still have an there is a blinding complain an but there are three dining sessions and the tat see now i think the two weeks of par and and we do the follow a and yes it'd to you close out this a description of the of the journey and the trip by extending past the day when o people have shy take the drug into this o what have her described as the integration face you have to reintegrate right i all this at all this increased inactivity during the session hallucinations insights anxiety letting go maybe revelation may be a epiphany oka great at what point is that consolidated meaning am are these patients subjects an studies having daily conversation with their therapist are the journalling every day and i want to keep in mind that most people are not going to be part of a clinical trial and of course here we are not suggesting what people do or not do but was just put it this way am were people to i you psychedelics what is the way that people can maximize on the nauru plasticity and the brain changes in a positive way in the days and weeks afterwards in other words how long is this called integration n last and but how far can we take the eking i could imagine that am how often one chooses to think about the insights could also have an in pact ye a because clearly people went to raves clearly people did psychedelics in the sixties and we do not know if it clearly people do psychedelics now but we do not have at o n those people you have access to the understanding of how they are spending their time and the therapeutic out comes would you we have not got into the numbers yet but again a a incredibly impressive you knowing upwards if as i understand at sixty per cent or more o people getting a really from depression ye seventy e seventy per cent incredible specially when compared to the typical a inti the present treatment a and on what is this business of integration how is it done properly ye ye gush well how long does it last as well an a lifetime an i life is a journey a trip is a a journey an and as always work to do an as chackcome feel pays after the ecstasy the laundry ye art's adore be other one i forget them an tit is e yes in the works on going and and and the the ye an but this gives you a footer it enables people to an to work more easily and and that is true the classic psychedelics wo say true very true of em do may they a a pytramatsic street is order it is really giving you like up making it easier to do very very difficult work going back to a aroma trying to digest it process i into great it an it is a such an essential combined of the treatment mood an but one has to be realistic as well y en i by saying our integration last a lifetime well people delivering a service cannot be there for a life time and what is the answer there an and a people a wrestling with that issue right now an and i i think one of the solutions might be that it is in a sense on you a to a point at the therapeutic team and treat you to a point and then it becomes what you might call practice in a similar way that meditation as a practice it is something that you have to keep up and if it slips than things could slip and and that is the way it is and or you have a a another psychedelic treatment in i people have even used this term of practice in relation to psychedelics whether a psychedelic practice time in a a meditation practice but i amusing meditation an intentionally here because i actually think that and meditative practice an spiritual practice elements of spiritual practice could be a very important compliment to psychedelic therapy and i think it is probably doing something similar in terms of promoting an ability to sit with a form colleague of mind sad it quite well in relation to psyhodelicterape verses chronic farmer cotherapelre accessories being on them all the time psychadelyctherape allows you to sit with rather an sit on i thought that is quite and yes i en i the meditation of mindfulness an the ability to yes be present sente but also present sense and accepting things come up you and watch and process and and let go a that holy grail of of mindfulness a awareness without reactivity respond i yo i egg up in the maria and you would hear this language i and ism not being disparaging the si friends that are on the board a vessel and and worked on the and have gone there and it is and yet you hear these terms right be responsive not reactive which to a now scientists is grass on me which probably list means i have this sues but me and surely i do but clinic what does that mean wright is or saying o to be the observer but not be drawn into the expense and and again i do not be overly reductionist but when i find compelling about the emerging data as it really is data on psychedelics as treatments for depression and drama namely suicide an and m d m a is that it really seems to allow people this space that that is commonly thrown around giving space between stimulus in reaction and vice or frankly talked about this but you knows have been reading a wonderful book called the prince of medicine good dates back to the origins of medicine very dense book we've been talking about the stuff and thing about the stuff for thousands of years psychedelic seem to give people access to that better version of self which is remarkable what is also remarkable it is perhaps worth pointing out is that five years ago i never would have been comfortable having this conversation i would have been afraid to lose my job stamford magazine this week just published an entire issue about psychedelics with howcademine works m d m a solicit with the appropriate cautionary notes and there but clearly times or changing speaking of which i know you are doing a trial on first time use of psychedelics what inspired that and what are you observing and as you tell us that please give us am a few of the the my contours a what is the dose am hold a these subjects i is some to men women are they suffering from depression or not wet can a what it what is the landscape of that study and i a i realize us a still early days of the study or maybe it is come to completions not yet published however cranial it is not published it is not submitted it is completed si this was one o another one of our covets studies in a sense meaning covet it and we had to finish the study and it was hard to finish the study because the give a as true of our salisditepyves is es a telegram alexorpri trial am a which is published new englandg of medicine that the this was twenty that paper by the way folks will provide link to in the shownote captions as well as some of robin's other a papers i think that twenty twenty to new inland journal papers really fabulous a given it the different dosages and the comparison to a century what is mycrodosing and the comparison to citalopra weather intrusting that you link the way we gave small dices of salicipeanto mycrodising we did not think of it that way we thought it was just the necessary please by or the big big dice the twenty five kilograms it ti yes and say that we could say to every one wet giving e salisivean and not be lying for those you got as telegram let surprise to six weeks they they got very very lightish of solisidim but allowed us to standardize all the psychitherapeand on but the the other study that your referring to i was in healthier healthy volunteers a middle aged a average age i thing was forty si not yet typical student study that as often the case in psychology research ya or only under cards and a volunteering for your study as this is say more more of an age range and also i think it was an equal proportion of madam female all the staff at with female which the safe very proud of them though it produces its onpetential confounder it to have a one one sex of a a staff possibly ye they did a good job in the sense that an we saw significant improvements in well being at the end of the trials let me describe the design it was say repeated measures design meaning people come in you collect your baseline data and do as brain scan and you give people an a placebo we gave people of placebo as she let me remind a little bit every one's healthy volunteers middle age never take a psychedelic in their life none of them entirely in i fresh forgot people coming in and and the plan is to give them their first eve psychedelic experience o that is what we did in the study but to do it we have this repeated measures design with or first get a place to and we have the proceed by that we can do all the procedures or the therapy or the music listening but not give a popping dose of psalesiban we again we gave them a place not of of psylesibe in one kilogram we stick e g a had sets on during the experience to record the brain activity and from the scalp a the oscillating electrical activity and we do the more scanning and before and after to see deeper into the brain and we can look at the functional connectivity that we were referring to earlier and also properties of brain and atomy which we did in the study the the short story is the all of the changes that we sore both psychologically and euros biologically were seen with the twenty five kilograms it all happened with that big popping dose and what did we see while we did see significant improvements in psychological well being we saw what i call the entropic brain effect which is at he formerly quite accurate we see an increase in the informational complexity of on going brain activity recorded with the e g on the dose of salicin the activity becomes more complex it is harder to predict across time it is more information rich and that effect correlates as it does very reliably with the magnitude of the subjective effects are the bigger the trip the bigger in tropic brain effect and you pretty well replicated finding and but then the m a the smart and seeing deep into the bring was probably most exciting result where we did not just see some functional brain changes but we have seen some anatomical brain changes as well and we used to techniqcalled diffusion tensor imaging that looks at the cabling of the brain the white matter tracts we saw a change in major tract we we for of limited our searchplace the really thick tracts and really thick fibers and he fibers that came through as changing the ones that travelled between the forefront of quarter and and the thulomess and astrict and and there were two tracts to prefrontal tracts the changed and they changed in the direction of the decrease in actual defucivity which an could be interpreted as tract integrity where a decrease would be an increase interact integrity it is something that you see in the developing brain the atrial de facility decreases as the brain goes from being a baby to being a adult actual the facility goes down and an engaging and theologies of aging actual de facility goes up is is in the opposite direction if of the results you talked about earlier in terms of brain inactivity of a sort of increased communication across areas if i unerring correctly and am perfectly happen to be wrong brother way that this decrease in axial diffusivity is translates to a higher fidelity of communication between the prefrontal quartan and the thalymusanstrad am as opposed to lass and your description of this is somewhat the the transition from babyhood and childhood to adulthood a speaks to the same where we know that there is a massive calling of connections i supposed a growth of connections in motherworts as we get older we get better at doing certain things and less good at doing potentially most everything else is that right is because the change was anatomical an and not functional the other stuff was is really measuring an communication in in the brain by looking at how the activity fluctuates across time and whether there's fluctuations in activity a sincereness between regions and if they are we say that functionally connected and we infer that that talking to each other cause they go up and down in sincrany but when it comes the anatomy with talking about the eustatic you no material staff and a a wit seeing the fibers in property of the fibers change an at least that is what we think and recently we had an independent person come in and reanalyze the day thousand i one of these things incredible finding requires and i credible evidence really strong evidence and ani would say the evidence of mom's most studies i we need to be cautious on that but we did mean analyze it and used this an correct ion proceed o free water correction to be more sure that it was a change in in the actual microns structure rather in something to do with the exextracaluleus space that the water surrounding the fires and it came through in fact the the change was strengthened by doing this corrections strap learn a this is neural plastersity as the consequence of one first time session with twenty five kilograms of sore iron ye ye we are excited and and the n he was it be different ye know the second analysis coming in i was not sure she believed it and then she yen i thought this correction technique might connikill the result and and it came through and and shes it ocean now i am excited to say we will say we do not know what it means what what does it mean functionally we do not know how did the people change while psychologically as i said her well being improved we did look at that cognition and we is the cognitive flexibility paradise that looks at people's ability to notice a rule change and then flexibly adapt their behavior based on noticing this rule change and people improved after the twenty five kilograms and did not significantly improve after the place by those there were not correlations with the the devil change that the cabling change and these psychological outcomes but with these studies in smaller sample sizes you do not always see those correlations come through am it is something we do not know what it means but it is it is a change in brain anatomy that is in the opposite direction to what you see in an aging brain or with pathology of aging and it is what you see in a healthy brain as it goes room yen a normal negro development into adulthood very very exciting and intriguing and i appreciate that you have lighted that is just one study although from everything you said it somesli been done with immense rigor we will eagerly await the publication of that study and us we can peruse all the day done and the subsequent studies i want to hear a bit about the study that you have been carrying out on the use of cylicibon for the treatment of libra my alga ism extreme by fire my alga i could because i have a good friend who also i will not reveal who it is and know it is not mean this is not that i have a friend thing who also is a scientist who a a sits it a fairly high position in the national institutes of health who am quietly has express to me that they are incredibly frustrated with the fact that am the standard medical community has am largely ignored fire my alga a and that for many years it was a kind of lumped with things chronic fatigue centrum and other am called again call ism not saying this but people offering for t these is oh it is psychosomatic that is all in your head which is a narrow scientist is a ridiculous statement to hear because it is all in your head your brain as in your head after all your physiology and your psychology our influencing each other of course and in the the world is starting to appreciate that more but first of all am maybe could tell people what libra ma alga is what inspired you to do a study on fiber my alga using sylliciran of all things am cause that surprising to me and am if you are allowed to or if you have access to the data and am in mind a share with us alone bit about what your discovering in that in that study surely happy say say again it is sort a sobintarpy an population is fiery august in drive say this is people presenting where the generalized chronic pain unlike some other pain disorders where the pain is focus you can say it is my low back which is very common a chronicle back pin this is ore generalized and it and for that reason it is hard to know what it is and and that is why it is been a controversial space in medicine and it is been yet it is had that charge thrown at it that may be psychosomatic an just to your point an is anything ever independent of of the mind anyway but this is actually a fascinating space for how in a subjective experience the lived experience and the mind can influence the body because there is some really interesting literature around the etiology the how the pain has come about innocence what cause the pain what is the story there and a head of the trial i would say to my colleagues let us just be careful because there is some fascinating literature around things am a background of trader and am how am that can relate to issues related to inflammation and how that can express into things fiver mile jesindrome i just ad be very careful that because if you go in with an assumption that hare's some very trader for example than he's that hole it'll decide of psychoanalysis the massively tried it up around false memory and on and please do not hold pair resumptions that you on are uncover am very trimer in every case now the teamed treated i think eight people am and it is going it is going very well again i just won be careful with how i describe it to ma in a to manage expectations and not get to be carried away but i i check him with the team every week and am there still based in onion doing the work am and a it is remarkable what i hear about the profound experiences the people have under the drug in this study we only give one dice it is a very mechanistic study we a have the e g cap on in the sessions amlikein the healthy volutes shady be this time now taking into clinical population and that they are in the me they are they are wearing an mask under the influence of twenty five telegrams of sosivon most of them probably have not done sosivon before to lit bit the first time study in some sense they have an fire my alga that is debilitating in some way that they do not they want they do not want it obviously and during the session are they thinking about their pain are they being told to think about their pain they are not being told to think about the pain in fact an as i understand it while there is a the repeat model around acceptance of the pain it is an unlike some the peatiest work you on encouraging them to focus on the index aroma and then en i work through it in trying digest it we we do not do that with the pain to the pains there an but there is not an invitation to focus on it and that is probably one of the differences with classic psychedelic therapy yes is empty a may therapy arguably m i therapies more bit closer to traditional talk therapy whet there is more dialogue people are able to talk on empty may am in the empdiamatrials to you a know whether or not they used masks or because it seems to be an important distinction between as you describe the therapeutic trip verses the trip that one does of going into the woods and taking silk then take aslsaen in the woods or at a party or a while staring at a poster or for it wore a leaf am again on not try to trivialize those experiences of an obviously they can be profound but am i am told am but a the my ma trials am seem to involve as you said more more directed a dialogue am in sometimes even kind of empathic connection between people by their actually looking at one another the eyes and i contact in such a keep part of a the human a social cognitive connective net works a do if they put masks on people during the him be pretty sure that they have the e musk the cause a lot of the media may a work and i was part of an media ma trial am a it was am as i understand were toward developing because it is an impathageand empathy toward the self am pretty sure they have the i masks the but they probably and it is a great question because you cut formerly test this it probably do not use them as much e things with the classic psychedelics if you're looking at your guides your facilitates s in their faces a melting o what a yon india ma just mi really start to feel we are connected e in is a especially beautiful and niter and and yet as that a fascinating effect of loving i know the people that you with am and a i imagine they talk more and use the eyeshades less and it is more interpersonal rather my interapusmor going inside they do use a fascinating him apology that some people of critique but it is a very interesting a phenomenon and it is this notion of the inn help they use that at language a lot s been pretty cause it sounds very suggest give on that is probably one of the vehicles here driving the toreutic process is suggestion i think out to be honest about that an ah but a when they go inside that is another term that we use very much in the classic sicadelic therapy work you go inside you nay put the eye shades on and people are encourage to go inside an but when they do that in the end may work especially they might be told explicitly and listen to the inner hear an that kind of language he could see how a cynic or a septic can come in and and see that some kind of suggestive priming or buying i thin they they have point a skeptics often do but i i do not think it it is at all of the story and briefly cause it is an interesting point an speaking to that point a bit in our salisibin there basis as telegram trial we measured pretrial expectancy and we did it for booth's conditions what kind of improvement do you expect with the lexirpri the pesto telegram at the end of the trial and what kind of improvement if you go into the salisibin arm and get a big too big dices of salisiben what kind of improvement do you think you seen tat in in that am and n o course it was a poinflip as to what arm people went into and there was no cross over and and what we found was it was true that we had a an a sample bus a most people had higher expectations on average of a higher expectations for salisiben and it is efficacy or effectiveness thus is the assessaride elexorpray and however when we looked at the correlation or the predictive relationship between pretrial expectancy and response we saw the pretrial expectancy for the asetelepra predicted response to ace telegram a crosspotually every single measure all these different measures of depression and anxiety and well being and and i think none of the scales ism pretty sure it is none of about twelve or mental health rating scales was there a relationship between pretrial expectancy even though it was high it did not predict pretrial expectancy did not predict response to the suicide interaphe say that was a bit of a you knows smash on a he for the idea that that classic psycodelictarapees some kind of place by response i think it is important to address that question and betas san if it does not come through as it did not is it did not come true then it it opens up even more intrigue about well what is it that if it is not just the place by response or rasuperplicy by response an amplification of the place by response then it must be something else and how intriguing it has a direct the repeated action it must be something and we do not yet know what it is i talked about the the residual in a increasing globe inactivity that one possibility but the truth is with were just scratching the surface and yet the therapeutic out comes i again just marvels marvellously impressive am ism curious as to i as well there are that many labs but the the laboratories theatre o focaston classics academics for the treatment of depression and and now as you mention promising results for interaction fapromyalge as well although preliminary print very promising oh why the a lack of attention to it a twenty an is it that list trips are just too long is it that they are qualitatively different am are there any data on am non microcosms of elastin here i wont to be very careful because i learned through by interactions on social media that this her microcosms am very misleading and in some cases can be dangerously is leading because as you mentioned earlier the effective pcychodelicdose or the effect meaning that can induce a a a real trip with hallucinations et camera a of celeste is actually in the micro graham range some people here microcosm and they think microgram of celeste is a micrograms is a microcosm when in fact a macrocosm of celeste can be measured in micrograms rights o this is where a in the absence of scientific training people can really go go astray a or even in just in lac of understanding of the metric system and since now hero ya your recent a rivals yes fortunate for us sorry eland's loss as is the uses gained by a a robin's lap a move from from inland to a the united states recently square one for us am but why is not there more use of celeste in these trials i think i it probably is the duration of the trip it used to be stigma a and it was easier to get ye sonasibin study three because other were they were getting that true to is strike o francs vole videoing uric n switzerland and than robin griffin coming along into a sonasibin law hoping say you could appeal to that precedent since say what i doing it idea an i come we not do in an little inland am that is how it work for us we did at you go on and in plenty study once wed kind of laid the foundations an for doing this kind of work and it was a brain imaging study was really extensive one actually when we yous both acari and another vitality cod egg am sot of super beg in a sense an but e you knot why did not we an why did not that turn our heads to think o should we not be doing our trails with last it is i does have something to do with e pragmatics a study day with solicideniss long enough it is a ford tor six hour the in the leftie o ask us to have the people in the lagan until eight hours picked dice with person i think could be quite excessive especially if it is a bodice you know if you have that the piece by condition as well it becomes along in practical ye scientists are not paid nearly enough to warrant the a there is no such thing as over time in forth graduate student in bistort is often at the uni morgen members tat a doing that ready hot we it was describvary well to me by a a student when i was a graduate student said to me they really cannot afford to pay us by the hour ecauseesy work i he was a electrophysiologist or he would run experiments no joke folks three to five day experiments sleeping in bouts of two hours here or there in a dark room with a bunch of equipment in a recording these are long long acuter physical physiological electro physiological reqorringe an yet no no scientist does it for the money i promise you a that there is money in farmer there is not money in a personal income a it is not lucrative if for the basic scientist a yes i plenty is what a anywhere from eight to fifteen hours sometiahin would be a little long ye be worried if ye was still tripping at that time maybe with a i big is i as k ut yet eight hours plus and dice dependent yet it is a bigodise its i a longer expense but you nap gin a dice at say and i ten i m in the morning which is for less habit often guise than that six p m still feeling the effects and then how long you wait now to kind close tings ow before they can go him even with salicin ya people still at work into the evening and the staff were always the lasts or f course as they go to pack up and yes said these along days and it and it is just it it it is too much and i that makes else o your practical constrains i learn from a a recent guest on the podcast and i that we recorded with a doctor watchman piano is a cold mind when i was down at the all institute is a pinier ta lot of the studies on called intermittent stand that the reason the intermittent fat a that that the eating period an these studies in animals and now on humans is eight hours the for feeding window in these takes because am the graduate student was going to otherwise lose their relationship because their significant others says listen you can be in the lab for twelve hours that meant some hours before the experiment than eight hours and then some hours afterwards but you cannot stay in there longer and and many people use the eight hour feeding window as a consequence the sienceit has to exist in an be carried out in real world frame a o i as empty a man a little bit am a little bit shorter write its about a forts it is also about fortis yes sir and similar to salicin yet is an catchy in the maps work they read dis after a certain point to the bust the be hope the optional vista yes say there is that am and now people a thinking well even these salicin sessions a long an expensive and if you have to have to staff members the all the time that six pensive n us when my to the expenses is in the starting can we abridge the experience make it sure to and get away with is and get get similar kind of therapies outcome it is a lot of interest in that direction may ask about ism sorry to interrupt bat i want o mature do not forget to ask about combination sylicive an m d may therapies the reason i ask but this is ism and here truly not me but i know people who ism do self administered a ism combination sylicivan and m d a may i i think have this right i think it is called a hippy flip i there is another one that of all zealously to again ism not suggesting people do these kind of drug combinations but ism the way it was described to me was that the sylicibin because it is season uric ism sometimes can be not a downer but can have a bit of a kind of a kind of a murky feel to it some real deep introspection sometimes in the the darker realms of ones psyche depressive thoughts et camera not that it westerly stays that way throughout the trip but that the my am because it has a very strongly search and uric but also dopemanurgic i man sort this has an emphedeming component a cocaine in fact ism if you ever seen o one in eddy a ma their pupils are about the size of a a quarters ah for reason there i i am extremely extreme autonomic arousal compared to a sedative i which by the way would constrict the pupils i they describe the use of eddy a made a kind of balance out the kind of affect component of it ism what are your thoughts on combination sylicive an m d a may i does this hold anytherepeutic potential this is obviously a back yard chemistry ism in the sense that people are or venom can combing the stuff on their own which again i do not really recommend i to see the science go first but i understand this is how t works in the real world am there would i would your thought on in combining compound yet i guess the convoying it in re creation context but also underground therapists to work with this coma that is what ism refrain ye i am not thing my people pardoning with the stuff ism dog out there are thousands now of a therapists that offer a second arctherapes illegally reallycause it is not legallynothnly you has to possess yourself am but that are doing this yesthat is really why mast ye and i think tears something to be said for one has to be careful with his as a scientist but in no if there doing it are they using some kind of trial an era the same is true of course with the you no longer history of psychedelic plant medicine if by plants we include the fangs as well say exit the extended sense plants yen no there will have been trial an error there it might not be as systematic as the since we do to day but maybe there is been a learning process and maybe what they do an they have come to because they found it works say by that principle ism interested in that combination and whether it does am offer some advantages maybe in certain patience if we one of the bust terms in medicine these days precision medicine a precision medicine an personalized medicine say maybe there are certain cases where you no introducing am say soliciting after the eddy may or the other way round could offersome advantages and the differences are interesting you know solicited can get you to deep places maybe the colonel of your suffering and and a major life experiences and complexes the a easily link to whatever the pathology that you are presenting with am but it can do it sometimes quite aggressively an i and if it say pusher mat's express disorder it can be overwhelming and you comfit it and really it is that it is the the resistance is really challenged and they fight back and the therepetes it breaks through and the progress is not happening because you have agitated the defense mechanisms where is a eddy may offers is something arguably more directionally reliable in terms of in tomes of the valance it is more directionally positive generally and end may experience diver bad time on a ye you lame quite blond and by one of the concerns i had with mediacy have never done it recreation i have had not and have not ever done it recreational but when it was done in this the peptic sailing i realized because there was music on at the beginning i asked you actually asked them to turn it off because i realize that the an the music was becoming such an attractor to my attention that i suddenly was searing thing about music and my love of music which was not the focus of the session that i a sou was there t for am and ism glad that they did turn the music office is the moment they did i was able to drop in within the i asked to this to the sort of go inward and address some certain issues that at least to me felt key and productive am that seems to be the kind of a hazard with em do ma is that i it is such an impathageand that a one could i start to you could go down any number of different an rabbit holes ye yet but but it is also it is a strength because you well the classics soliciting can take you that very reliably but maybe aggressively and i may makes it easier to go there and and that is its strength and that is why that marriage of them tit maytherapefapetosy and particular s it is it good come by it works because you are gin a go there innocence you have to to really make the therapeutic progress you cannot have to go back there am but we we can a sent up si that you can go back there and feel as safe are am more trusting and be able to go back there where is you have never otherwise being able to go back there without an i dissociating or having in a horrible flash backs and on si am that is the strength that it offers i guess the limitation would be the maybe it does not take you as the as the a classic psycadelicson i tend to think ism bastilniss won as a kind of honesty to the classics in that it is it is hell as well as heaven you i and that is the psyche it is in all rob is i i really appreciate that you bring that up because i think that there is such a fear of a i called bad trips there is such a fear a in nonpsycada states to am to avoid that the painful and everything everything we know from drama an the a treatment of trapan we have had several guests on here my close colly close close coly gat sanphrd doctor a avid speak our associate of psychiatry is clyncolypnotis amazing amazing human being in scientist inclination sit as really just it imbedded this in my mind that the only way to deal with drama is to get right up next to that drama to the point where some relief as experienced there is no other real way am as i really appreciate that you are saying that the classic psychedelics may offer the the am with a very strong nudge perhaps the opportunity to get into the the uncomfortable in a way that ism empty a mayor some neoclassical psychedelics a perhaps to not recon mut time frames i or duration of trips and these different c compounds and how they deffer n how there similar a and leafed educate me on d m t and some of the work that you are doing with d m t a my understanding is that it is a very brief trip a minutes a people i know who have done this again to therapeutically a my a it'll just point to one very exciting i think am group and initiative which is the veteran solutions initiative which is a group a this is carried out in mexico but in conjunction with laboratories at stamford and elsewhere who are valuating the curl changes i in this involves i begin which is you logo which is a very long durations relic twenty two hours or more followed by a i think one or two doses of d m t this is for veterans with o to deal with any number of issues a appears to be working with great success and have spoken to several of people have gone through this and the way that they described d m t almost at across the board was quote here ism just pulling quotes right panic data a the most profound experience of my entire life even greater than the birth of my children quote being attached to the shock wave of an madam balm quote there is no way i would do another dose because the first one was unbelievable interesting by the way i think most of us including me would think why wouldn't you want to do it again then but this idea that that was just b one anything these are significant excuse me these are significant statements coming from individuals who have existed at the extremes of human experience to begin with write these are i clue tear one operators with special operations o exit and may or may not have drama but d m t sounds a big deal a short duration really big deal what do we know about its chemistry what do we know about how it is impacting brain net works and what in the world is going on that people are describing it as ah the ways i just mention ay moments ago yet it it is a rocketship it far if the salasibon is likes ship leaving port than ya this is this is a rocketship in to craziness is and by the is it ceremony into a it is yes it is a classic psychodelicates o direct agonists o direct stimulator of the ceremony in to a receptor its an order of magnitude less poetenthan salasibin but latencies of funny thing because dose dependent that does not mean that the experience with the empty is less than that of salacibenis just that you give more of the drug an ah but a it has that is matched by its its stickiness for the ceremony into a receptor which is this kind of golden ruin in psychedelic science is that it was discovered in midnineteen eighty is this type relationship between the affinity of the stickies or the binding potential of the psychedelic for the two a receptor in particular serotonin to and its potency and ha sticky of the drug than more potent alasteereay sticking very very potent you only need those tiny microgram doses the empty by its affinity is is an a little less potent but by its effects when you give a stranded dose its just in unit is just wild and t empty because there is another compound can five method de empty which is a bit different pharmoclogically and subjectively ts it similar in terms of its fanatics it is another rocketship an both compounds an in the wild solo speak ah an smoked often empty and five emit people of raping both actually now an there are v ta pence en o being that developed a the people to administer administer is bet more tradition its being a smoking thing this is clinically not recreational we are both both now young in en a underground partition as a using the vat pens they them because people big trade the dosage they get a feel for what it is to be going into this states that they feel i can let go and go into it but say and it you i think some of the veteran's work might be giving five emit after the i began an a phenomenologically a if there is a difference between to any and five emit people might put it on then e have been more of a reliable ever dissolution experience less visual and more kind of all round immahian in the great whole loss of self identity and just in mission an everything give mere just talk about ego dissolution for second ions such a sticky a a interesting idea i can take a step back as a our scientist and and say i gan ego dissolution this idea that the that it from a very early age we have the concept of self and that in i wake up every morning and i know i me and not somebody else and sonly you do the same and most most people do the same i would hope but that and that there objects in the world and people in the world beyond us but every time we here about ego dissolution it sounds it is a a kind of a temporary a elimination of the of the idea that things stop and am start and stop between us and everything else almost you knowing that and of a were a not try to sound philosophical or a metaphysical but the other sort of the molecular continuity of of life right for all all yest little little bits fiery i ism not a functional way to go through the day right because you want to make a cup of coffee you do not really want to get lost in that if your goal is to make a cup of coffee but am but you don't what is the the what is the power of ego dissolution is it the idea that we bolt that we belong is it a sense of meaning is it the sense that we we are not as important as we think which of course could be wonderfully useful a way to go through life to to think of we are not as an as it we we are vitally important but we are not the only thing right because i do believe connection is vital as most people do what is ego dissolution and why would this serotonin to a activation cost that is remarkable yer great questions having w what is it a you alluded to it with a start stop i think you i because you could define it bay boundary in a sense what it what is not me it is as valid here is is the a developing sense of what is me that a child develops at whatever age am and a a major characteristic of the ego dissolution experience rather just a negative a thing going away my sense of self going away is is the positive o now i feel into connected with other people in the the world at large and i realize you another there is that molecular continuity an actually that is a grand truth and oh maybe the age thing is somewhat illusory or at least a construction of my mind and indeed it is rite well it nous ye in is no transcendentalism about that it is just logic i think about about it a little bit family m an we all know what immediate family is but f om forgive me for interrupting myself i do it all the time anyway when i teach anatomy some clever student always figures out cable that is connected to that and that is connect but ultimately everything in the brain is connected to everything else ye there is just no way around that that is a true statement ye and you really just have to decide where you draw the boundary between wen you rally a i where wet where are the modals what are the modern you can say the brain is just one big backroom argue e and then you also not include the body and now fortunately people are trying to embrace this idea that it is not mind body it is both because your nervous system extends through both of course as at the same con be said of family we are related right not just by virtue he fact the were human beings if we did are genealogical charts we would find a a convergence at is on point e and of course this becomes a bit of a game but then one realizes that where you draw the boundaries and if you draw them at brothers sister parents biological parents at camera that is a game to and it is just a construct y in it is a phonogram you i we you draw the line when to pass i wen to collapse it is a sutra classic consideration in since when to pass how long perverse letter fly ye it is the just question i well why to psychedelics do it and a the we think psychedelics do it because the toxic reception at least been a classic psychedelics do it and that is important distress empty may does not really do it in the same way my sullenly a it be yet abates a my experience with am empty may is that it is such a strong in pathogen ye u and and that it can die cause empathy for others ye certainly you could imagine situations where one at in empyamajourney a and afterwards says o these these my oppressors you are the people that harm me they ah and here ism not referring to my experience but they did the best with what they have i should have empathy for them forgiveness but also for oneself that there is an in a empathy for self i know i said this earlier that is very hard for most people to access perhaps not the nurses out there listening they will be of course empathy for self but every one else i think am a all the other healthy people am or the healthy people other than nurses and not picking on nurses i have to imagine they suffer to in fact i think that is the rout of their nursisism am that empathy for self is not something that comes reflectively for most people and the here ism not out self love or self respect but this notion of being able to see the self as am not just deserving of love and care but actually holding that in place while in confrontation with something challenging in a way that allows more not less access to adapt give response as to that challenge i think that is the way i i can't conventionalize it ye ye but me drugs offer of a great they offer great ah great scientific tools for starting this question what is eye dilation and why do drugs much inmates it a what does that tell you about the brain you i because other drugs cocaine really sing more of e a different euro transmit si a dypemaine more than secretin and the opposite is the case with eddy may it is more pinion flatter i absolutely pe will become hyperlinear hyper am linked to their own desires and wishes and future outcomes become an obsession it is the stuff of a kind of america psycho and the a kind of a clenches and stereotypes of the the the ladies a a logan culture ye ye we did ta study one sat looking at independent relationship with ego inflation on one axis and ego dissolution on the other and street it just massively passed or differentiated between cocaine and and the psychedelics ass can't study cocaine makes people's egos superinflader yean sot unit us dissolution and the opposite is the case with a wit psychedelic i isn't no imaging to to explain our cosine does that that would be a great study yer great i wish a as about a coming to a gat well also about local coming a you on g a shop in your lab has a ready got on if it is right to finish the thread on on why psychedelics and ego dissolution we do not some things or we have some hypotheses an it is the the target receptors a careworn into a receptor the classic psychedelics hit i heavily expressed in what these days i to call recent brain because evolutionarily it is recent brain it is cartel that humans have more than any other species if you look at a mapping of cortical expansion from same macaw or him to human it is the very same map that you will find the two a receptors in an that is the target it is and and yet it is just easy to think that well that could be the logic brain and there and the classic psychedelics come in the kind of they scramble up the activity that is the entropic brain action and in terms of the start stop the boundaries an that in tropic action a spreads out the system and it does not shut it off it a spreads it out an dissolution or and that you would talking about headrace as well that fits if it is if it is more capacious sir its sort of fits an the big qualifier with psycho the lectarapy that the people rightly bring up is it does not last as the paradox of it the paradox of ego dissolution to that ego might go away during the trip and you have these profound insights about the molecular continuity and how we are all worn and interconnected and then you come down and however long later the ego comes back but maybe with a vengeance and sadly found i things can go rig when people have not done the work perhaps have not done the integration work and may be ego defenses come back and and i and it is not it is not a pretty picture i how often do you see that in the trial said you what percentage you er the out of people coming through do you think it end up with all worse than they they were before ate the trial it is very rare in the trials that we have done and ye but you see defenses come back say you you do see people relapse that is more in a few few pushing out like three months pass in something treatment resistant oppression that is more the rule than the exception sadly people relapse if their histories i history's of chronic depression then while you might give them a a window of wellness it is sadly t does not last as not to say that it does not overcast it does and and we have people who were in our first treatment resistant depression try who are well to my knowledge to day back at work in fantastically well and but sadly the majority have have relapsed to my knowledge and need to do morse second o journey well they cannot because it is illegal that is being the really difficult situation that we have been up against is that we do a trial where all of a sudden is sketch of one drug becomes a medicine in the trial or at least an expo r mental medicine we give the treatment it works fantastically well gives people a remission that they have never ready had a the however long and and then detrolens in that denied that treatment and worse still if they would t have that treatment they would be committing a crime it is sort of a sick job in away but that is hat's the situation that we have been and that is a perfect seaway for what i want to talk about am now which is what is the current state of legality in terms hat were the progression towards legality it'd also to touch on the rule of unless just a incoming big farmer there lot of start up companies now trying to capitalize on these discoveries that you and others have made am you the landscape out there is very unclear to me am maybe it'll just a call out some silos as i see them and maybe we can draw some am bridges between them if they exist at the ground level not the grass rules but at the ground level i look to laboratories yours matter johnsons rolling griffin's ism some laboratories at stamford a join willies a laboratories doing studying the effects of psychedelics inhuman beings o not animal models in terms of their clinical application for the treatment of depression in alexia i now know favor my all ja drama let us lump empty a ma an there's well ism assuming that it a works in equivalent way at the level of kind of ware the legislatures taking things o case o labs using government money philanthropy et camera then there the am they sort of the therapists out there that are accessing what we believe ore clean sources of emdiamay sylicibe and list to do this the are doing it illegally this is in the guess or a other a western european countries cause obviously s get a differ by country i who are administering these things sort of on the basis of what they are reading in these studies that you all are publishing but also expanding on an experimenting hippy flips and commination drugs and calamine and et camera be let us ley can amen out from it ran ow because it is legal but there is that then there is the ism i do not not say its or recreational slash open market black market and here i want a a raise a flag to the fact that a a doctor peter ta did a terrific podcast on this recently in his own podcast the drive the fact that o sentinel lacing with sentinels now showing up in m d may and psychedelic center purchased on the streets of serious caution to those getting it from uncertain sources and and then you have got farm and then as an umbrella for all of this you have got the fly a and lawn foreman agencies which currently say this stuff is illegal unless it is been used in a clinical trial selling in or possessing it can get you charged with a crime ranging from i do not want to say cause i do not know but ism up to felonies right years in prison so cannot take it through our ports cannot do not get caught with it do not buy it do not sell it kind of thing where are we going from that picture of the silos i know things are in clinical trials now most people including myself are not familiar without the different phases relate to the proximity to legality could you just cone give us the landscape and touch on how long you think it will be before the people that come through your trials could then go get a prescription for cilisivon or potentially buy it without the risk from a reliable source one would hope but without the risk of getting thrown in jail ism i used to live in oaken californium my understanding and please crew me if ism wrong folks do not trust this and to ration in getting trouble man shining is that sillicidean is it decriminalized in gland but that is not the same as being legal wet is going on out there we was march jugs that fifty five had by the am but feel free to beinseust o subside on if well plans of funny one i live close to land thenar headships in plan am you know am the might be selling cannabis an and you now cannabis related paraphernalia the de selling mushrooms as well filicide in mushroom o e fair open ye that is a fact i don i can verify tat phone precious them but have gone in and cannot checked out with what what is going on here ye yer yes a you ka a the police are not going to priorities am that activity the purchasing of of those mushrooms as a crime now in plan because of the decriminalization say those headships should not strictly be selling while they should not be selling am they will not have a license to be selling licenses do not exist a yet for that here am but a let us see whether they get shut down they probably well i do not know but there is a ten a church in i plan that a said am say that that the selling in its part of religious rights the they using that church model is si poll am a the way the native america can use pe one and they have more genuine am a case because there is a history there am with a ironic in tic e back on that anyway that is that is of close to where we are right now but am federally which is really the major inflection point is the leftie am an the licente seeing of psychedelics as medicines to be legally prescribed across the country cross the passed beyond and that is close because the key ad has say there are different phases of clinical trials in the key one to know about his face three a pase three trials a licensing trials if that successful and typically have to do at least two successful ones show the results to the regulators who are the eft a the medicine regulators and say is this good enough now for you to give me a license that i can sell and and provide this medicine that we have demonstrated as a medicine an that work has been done with media matherapee for poshomats it stress ti sort of maps have led that work and done to face three trials i think they have already publicly announced that the second trial had results consistent with the first we know the results of the first because there published and they were remarkably good something sixty seven per cent remissionrates in a long term inishamme as some of those remissionrates for drama were years at is different then what you are describing for striven were people might need on going using that is true ye ye but of course just phratrama in those trials my understanding is those and m you may trials we are not focused on depression yes yes lodestone on atheroma and that is something because that dater is being called now to my knowledge as we speak and and there anticipating a decision maybe this year and with roll out happening as early as next year men that sort of best case i think could ask you when you say roll out whose ran its the appropriate a term for mama ha at called rolling an about twenty percent of my audience maybe fifty not will understand that and not funny joke that i m made am who is going to roll it out is this where would one get the empty it that the clean source of end am meaning not lace with mental all not lace with madam cetacean am not undergone any chemical conversion to some other drug which can happen which extended shelter life et camera there are people going to go to their psychiatric to get eddy may and who is going to be providing it is at go be some big major farmer a this seems a serious set of issues it is and i do not have all the answers i do neither maps would be providing the costate done the work and they have set themselves up in a sense to potentially become the provide a am whether is a farmer company which is the big question at wrestling with the women it is very expensive to become the fame company and that they probably deserve to make the choice because they put in many years of hard work when all of the stuff was considered raver culture party drug they were the ones that spotted the therapeutic potential they we knew there was the repute a potential bay on work going back men he decades but am points to them and i think that i think in my opinion they should have the agency to make those decisions yer it is a remark such a remarkable thing that is being achieved and i i think they have done it all on to philanthropic donations am i think i am yes i am there there is the ai question mark in the after a rob o asking questions about am to to your question i he who can provide this because in the face three work and of until this point has been a map's training a master of his training and you have to do this formal a training am in order to to be a practicing within the trials but now there is a question from the fed a whether that map's training can be the training that a cognition has to have to now be a provider and when i say roll out is and offering this is a service essentially and were with the refer or come from that is a good question that ism not hundred per sent on the answer whether it would have to come from a psychologist or whether some ones an to the general physician could do that referral but they will be going to a provider who is license and certified and will have done some training and there will be a nonsense son in a what constitutes good enough training to provide there will also be some stipulations on the basic underlying professionalism of the cognition who provides i imagine they will have to be a mental health professional i do not think they would have to necessary be a psychiatrist the could be a think a clinical psychologist for all the risings i think without question there would have to be a physician present or at least within ready access in case of an emergency especially with them the a ma because of the are propensity for cardiac issuslya because of the experiment privates in what wearies unsoicide and in terms of the these trials is it in face two face three it is in face three and there is solicited trip work being done for treatment resistant depression by a company call compass a those trials ad which are always mufti sit there is always a bunch of teams or labs in a sense and geographically spread out theatre each contributing to date o the then gets mass together and is then submitted as part of the face three trip results that is happening with compass right now is salinize interrepyfor treatment resistant depression those tries a just started and am i think the earliest estimate that i heard in er in a journalistic article was because i do not encompass would say or they would not say publicly something twenty twenty six only six what while empyema ass a head of so let's quite a few years at head and it is more of e not a certainty but it is very very strong position with emir may where is the works only just begun with with salisiden in tums of the face three trials but then you have this other situation of however many psychedelic resechentas there are now across the globe am it was not nice to an i we had the first one in onion in twenty nineteen first one in twenty nineteen is twenty twenty three now and i do not knowhow many there re but i much as happened in such a small space of time am yes but sir all these different indications have been able to tell you about an premier and library mile just in become trona do a the trial a with a colleague of mine and you see a serf in madam phetamin usticeorder he is got a tool going on in parkinsons disease sir and chronicle back pain and by pole disorder i mean a much going on i see d almost the full gammer to psychiatric disorders am not schizophrenia to my knowledge am a being looked at there is much grand grand you a ground swell of activity am and i think these small investigate to led studies typically the small because trials are expensive am ire going to be report in positive results i know were wiring and it will be yo know for a see now least four trials all with really positive resolves in very difficult to treat disorders and that is just us and i neither pay much else where a diction disorders as well and i might johnsons were copiously am michael began sheets all this compelling grounds well it is really something and yet you not the system to really make a big break through and times a licensing is of course slip and its not confrustrate people but it it has the t ask me don't people am how else we we revert back to what happened in the seventies where there was a lot of interest in psychedelics it is come interesting to me there was a a close fuck supposition of meditation and a count of behavioral approaches to a self directed state change and psychedelics meditation can have made it through the hatch in they were the some years where it was considered kind of counterculture wo magic carpet weird o stuff by western science but now imine their tens of the proteins of thousands is not an overstatement of quality studies exploring how meditation can provide advantages for the mind and even for mental health am and psychedelics a now catching up but they used to be close cousins in the in the a cultural framework but the problem was i think psychedelics were viewed as a making people crazy and a university professors lost their jobs for having discussions the one that you and i are having right now am and the some people went to jail but mostly mostly people either left academic institutions or lost their jobs were as now these are am some of the these studies of the sort that you are doing it that are taking place at stamford and hoping and elsewhere are a some of the greatest magnetic pull for philanthropy for universities downers are very interested in supporting these for ts of studies because they and their family members and people they know suffer from psychiatric illness for which am the current a big farmer approaches simply have not worked it is her sort of interesting to me that what once was seen as am kind of poison is now being viewed as a potential therapeutic a it is not just interesting i think it is it holy it speaks to the evolution of of the human species people seem to be coming more open minded about becoming more open minded that is yet and yet say ye it is a the much as happenings bypast and as another elements of it is it is complexifying space that is a there is critzigu there is been some bad practice in psychelictherapy boundary crossing isles that a course some scandals that is too bad is not it it well i think to the gene therapy right it just takes one bad incident agent therapy was on a fast track three decades ago and then a what sadly a child died in a gene therapy trial and it is shut downing therapy practically for half a decade and then it slowly started ratcheting up again breaking there broadly to find an hour in the age of you potential directed gene therapsid crisper an things o that sort which makes people some people change an other people very excited if you v huntingtons in your family crisper is the most exciting technology ever because ye potentially eliminate it from your family want going forward corse so i just really height that we can be balance as this old plays out because it it could go similar way given the statement given the history that people be very twitch with with a summisolated incidents a and a and i i overgeneralize them perhaps am in a sense its shining alights on them i think is important that that has happened recently as important because it really drills home how important it is that this work be done right and and what the necessary safeguards and and at standards should be am a yo it will not be it will not be an easy rode forwards but am but let us hope we got a hope that it succeeds because current treatments you people talk about the matter have crisis and to your point earlier about an erect rate it is not always actually the case when you look at the and eputimiology when you look at the dater that you see a big inflection and you know diagnoses or cases o psychiatric illness i would say it is more that the treatments have not moved they have really progress they have not got any better since the nineteen fifty more or less and and new drugs have been more of the same there have not been any paradise shifts and that is why i get a little impassioned when i talk about psychedelic theropean an that point that this is something different it is not a drug every day it that system is not going it do we really want to keep on with that system a sure you at not every one will want to trip and that will terrify some people much that they will just one to be on their flexor prior or a non psychedelic psychodelical whatever and of course it should be allowed to have those options of course and the more options the better and but i think there is it is great value in tat really understanding what psychedelic therapy is and and and i think when you do you realize at it is ta man o paradise challenge you many levels and and the fact that it is different my say it is it is greatest to pal my tin well i am certainly grateful for your passion for the potential for psychedelics to be added to the array of potential treatments and i really also appreciate how much you i put it in their alongside the other treatments maybe even commination with other treatments i supposed to say this is the thing that is on curate everything and yet the nation that you have for this potential paradise shift the one that really appears to be happening at the level of clinical pardon now i is important i want to extend it a voice of gratitude for that and for the work that you are doing i mean have been outside of this field but as an earn scientists have been paying careful attention to it really for the last five seven years or and it is abundantly clear that it is a small group of individuals who are really thinking in terms of how the system works now and what needs to be done in order to change the system for the better yourself that are really the driving force behind this a new movement or paradise shift that without question is going to lead to improvements in mental health and physical health outcome i just want to say thank you for that also thank you much for joining us to day to share this immense knowledge set about the history of psychedelics what they are what they are not ism they're clinical applications as seen in your laboratory an other laboratories a ism sure people already notice as but your incredibly generous in terms of attribution and and also in your caution about explaining how some other results in particular on anterectsy a libra myalgia are perhaps preliminary but very exciting they are not published yet anyway i we one call them preliminary a and also for touching on mechanism that is not just about people feel better but pointiest potential underlying mechanisms and terms of connectivity changes and on and on thank you much for your time to day thank you for the work that you are doing and thank you for the work that is sure to continue we we will provide links to studies in your laboratory lynx to your laboratory people can learn more in support in the ways that they deem appropriate for them but just thank

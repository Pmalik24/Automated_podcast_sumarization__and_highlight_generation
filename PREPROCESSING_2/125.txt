the first re publican date is to night we examine all the candidate strategies one of dona trumps former employes slips on him in florid and trobidan apparently went to sleep at a memorial service for victims of the mallywild fire ism centaur of thesis ventshburo so say showsponserback press we p m thousands of my listers v already secured her errata join them n express vepianzi cam slash men it is to night the fight for second place in the republican pit is big republican nomination battle to night except the dona trump is not on the stage is that going to hurt him in any real way means certainly token i herd him in the poles given the fact that he is currently leading the race by some forty points over the rest of the field combine the current pulling status right now according to the real clopoltics palling average has dona trump i fifty five per cent and as onto mantis at fourteen per cent the van aromas vomits seven point two per cent bit pens at for nickyhali at three nips time got at three crispy at three and then every one else including the inevitable dug burghal the absolutely unstoppable force that is dug burghal at below one per cent what is this mean what means that pretty much everybody on the stage to night is going to be attacking onto mantis and that includes the trump campaign the trump campaign already to day put out a put a place a a bingo card for onto sanctomanis the sang and marry tailor green put out this the sanctoman is to bate night bang it just shows you who theme trump fears because really they look at that field and they say there is really only one candidate there who could theoretically threaten dona trump that is true in the early states by the way in the current two pulling he is within shouting distance of dona trump and it is still very early remember it is still august the first causes are not until canary how can happen in allwhat does happen on daily bases in politics a lot can happen between late august and late canary which is when those first iwalcaucuses are trump is basely trying to take out to mantis early he he is putting all of his focus on to mantis none on any of the other candidates marry tailor green put out a a bingo card for debate night it is entirely about to mantis it is entirely about to mantis and it shows you the nature of the attacks on to mantis been trump there is not a single attack on a single ronasantus policy not one now as pagans or reactor i find the sort thing insulting i verynew attack other con sedatives on stage you should nobly do it over their policies if rota mantis were to make a trump debate night bang of trumpet to take part in the debate it would take things it gave a medal to anchovy touchy did not call in the national hard during mass riding in twenty twenty spend seven trillion dollars his last turn office ray there there's a a bunch of stuff that he could the biggest one of course would be lost to jobidon in twenty twenty with get two in just a second butt if you look at the bingo card that trumpet out about to mantis i understand that a lot of trump supporters find the sort of thing charming and they think that this sort of kitchen sink attack tells against democrats and republicans it told the gas killer client was killer client was already deeply on popular withe america people will see if it works but aurous here's con of the bingo card here some the things at first wall if it parrots left wing lies it says things on defend slavery that is a left wing lie ronisantus has never defended slavery it is just a lie it says things nervous laugh wipes snot gaslight bovid record o gene is not gasket his cover record ronisantus had the strongest loved record of any governor in america things on backsdown saved by fox news dismisses pole end of the day gay leg the whole thing is just designed to to can a sneer at the mantis which is trumps utter stranger but he has a seventh grate strategy when it comes to going after his parents by the way it works in seven great and a works in twenty sixteen there is no reason to think it can't work now he use a very similar strategy with rid cut bush he is very similar strategy with a grin to little march he is a very similar strategy with great to in tad right s o him doing it to ronisantis is not exactly a shock but it shows you were drums focuses trumps the front runner this battle still believe there not is a two man race even though the mantis is sampan has not caught fire in any way shape or form as of yet will the debate to night it is going t be odd because trump is not on the stage which means as we say some one else is going to try to take down to status and tried to supplant the mantis as the other possibility in the re publican primaries because again forty five per cent the vote is still up for grabs even at at least at least righting its it is early theoretically to be above fifty the debate stage is filled with people who should not be on the debate stage that includes people again including a a hutchinson the way tat hutchinson got on the stage known cars about as hutchinson don trump is certainly right about down n is add hutchinsin nut advert behest that is true a shutchinson has no place on the debate stage he is pulling below cancer right now in the republican primaries but he was able to qualify four of the debate by essentially going to people and asking them to work around the the rules because one of the one of the requirements of getting on the stage is that you have to have forty thousand owners what did he do way got hundreds of college students to donate one dollar and then they were given twenty dollars a pop for every family member friend or acquaintance they could persuade to do not ate one dollar totchinson the summer my gout a punch big donors given to money then he took that money and he plowed it into giving it a way to people to donate back to him one dollar see he gets that forty thousand mark there are other campaigns that did something similar this is ridiculous a gat again that the people on the debate stage the truth is that there are approximately six serious people on thedebate stage many maybe it is really more five and that that that debate stage is filled with with no names who should not be on the stage am he dug burghal on the stage is give me up brake the gets more on this in just one second first that is all my sleep quality it is sucked last night lie west because my little baby unfortunately has some congestion again which means that he was up between the hours of three and five which was a good time from with me and my wife but what did it mean it mends that once again i relied on my heck sleep mattress to save the day i required sleep in the hours when is on that matters in be tossing an turning can feel in comfortable that is what ism glad that i have the mattress made specifically for me well now he looks mattress has they're best version yet the helices fleet he looks his harness years of extensive mattress expert he's to bring their customers are truly elevated sleep experience that helix to leek collection includes sixsdifferent mattress motels each tailor for specific sleep positions and from dis preferences have had that helix sleep mattress for as i say seven or eight years it is great it is firm it is breathable that is count what i need from a mattress if its toss to get back pain if it is not breathe bull i ten to heat up at night hell's o now that which is why they sent me the best mattress for me go to helix sleep out commie fending get the best mattress for you with that two minutes sleep clos find that perfect mattress in honor of laberday hellion is offering twenty five percents off all mattressorters plus two three pillows for my listeners go to heck sleep d out comslichsmen heights cot helices partner twenty five is the best offer yet it is not going to last long with helices better sleep starts right this very instant o case so what exactly do the candidates on stage have to do well the canter goes through each candidate and we are going to establish they're goals for to nah know as i say the entire to bate is going to be about attacking to cantus which means that basically rontosantis first could of assure is survive he has to make sure that he is mum not the person who is the subject of all the headlines tomorrow for all the attacks against him mean as we are seeing in the pulling data discants has been experiencing e rather marked decline in the pulling data s i said a few weeks to go the he is easily stagnant since tune her but the reality is that in that real politics pulling average he has lost momentum if he look that re publican nomination real geopolitics pulling average it shows that in aril he is it twenty four per cent he basically maintain that all the way through tune and then since tune he is dropped in the real geopolitics pulling average from bout twenty four percent all thewy down t about fourteen present which is significant top by the way that support largely went two dona trump some of it went you the candidates a lot of it once dona trump which means that he's to do a couple of things has to fend off all repeople who can be attacking him to right trying to can ta finish his campaign and yes to regain is mojo the only way to do that truly is that he has to make the case that republicans have failed to make which is why dona trump is leading the pulling by leaps an downs he es to make the case that he should be the hominy and not trump he not trump is part of that case the notion the you could can a miticide and say i should be the hominy and never dis cuss trump that is obviously note case trump is trusting right now somebody is can have to make the cases to yet should not be trump it seems there really only two attack lines as to why it shouldn't be trump at tack line number one is that trump was not is great a president as people want him to have been the trump did a lot o god things that be he appointed good con sedative justices i showed me i din thin he is in do that and he did that which is certainly true he move the embassy to jerusalem he created steals in themidle east that booming economy but he also did not build the border wall despite all of his promises to do he did not do anything about the mass rioting in america major cities throughout twenty twenty he em power xanthin he forty to basically run his covet policy and put out a completely confused and dis combobulated policy with regard to covet in which ho was both ripping trying camp for reopening gear up and then ripping states michigan for not reopening down true spent more money in the last years of his ad ministration than any present history by leaps an bounds a all of those things would be the case that can make against trump if you say it'll be abetter president than trumpwill be the problem is that is having really no impact on the republican voting base the republican voting base in the primaries seems not to care very much about what people do it care's much more about what people say and even more importantly about the attitudinal orientation toward the left whoever i seen as sort of the most provocative the person who seen is the hardest puncher is the person the republican base ones and the re publican bays seems to equate saying things with doing things which is we your seems take rise and to mantis to cline the mantis is done all the things the the vague talks about doing in florid but it does not seem that is having a market impacts on the rate in favor of the mantis a sanswill pass bill fighting woke in the state of florid the vocal rite a book about fighting wok and the base treats those two things is exactly equivalent and a point number one which is i should be the guy and not trump because trump under performed as president particularly n is last year the republican base does not seem to want that one which leaves you with the electability argument now the electability argument under normal circumstances for to mantis would be a pretty easy argument after all if you look at ronisancs is electability numbers that died one the state of flora which used to be a purple state by twenty points a if you take a look at florid voter's registration in remember of twenty eighteen democrats had a voter registration age of two hundred fifty seven thousand by august of twenty twenty three the republicans had a voter registration edge in the say to florid by five hundred and sixty eight thousand that is not eight hundred and twenty two thousand voter registration thing hand's a massive massive shift crated by to mantis and by the republican party of florid and ye could look at that and they couldlook at trump ante get taylisen trump does not pull well he is polling at best tat even with jobidon that is not a great number considering that jobidon is a very unpopular president ire not blowing by an out of the water but that because nobody knows by name yet i have not assume run a general election campaign now here is the thing in order for do dances to make this case he has to say the thing than many republicans have feed to say because trump has been laying since nonmember of twenty twenty when he said that he actually won the election he did not actually win the election there is no metric by which he actually won the election in fact to mantis could theoretically make a topaz case one i one my governor's rase by twenty points dona trump we we do not know we do not know other it'd beat gjobidon what we do not is that jobidon beat donate trump you'd actually have to say that because there is no other way round this i mean that is just the reality if you do not want trump to be the nominee you cannot say that he beat bison already if you say that he beat by an already than why would not you nominate donate trump on the electability argument the electability argument has zero legs unless you make the case that trump is not electable and that we have proof that he is not electable because not only did he under perform twenty eighteen n with congressional candidate but he actively lost to the man who is currently running for presidents on the other side in twenty twenty and you can point out all of the flaws in the election all the voting procedures all the mailing all all that stuff is true but dona trump did lose you hoiden in twenty twenty do you want to rerun that race furthermore if you believethit is donate trumpsize that he was jobbed out of it dona trumpet provided no plans naturally win in twenty twenty four if he says the election was stolen even if you grant that what is his plan to unsteel the election of twenty twenty wore he was president in twenty went he are not president now which means he has no control over the leavers are power much thatches being currently in bated in four separate jurisdictions an that is the case that de cantus could make now is that going to be a case that the republican party basis going to take up well if it is not then to sands has a trot and no one else does either if the republican party base believes the dona trump clearly and convincingly on in twenty twenty the electability argument does not exist and as far as the it'd be about a president them trump the republican partybasin bin that in either then there is no argument against trip do mantis is going to have to make at least that latter case that he is more electable then dona trump the big obstacle to night for to cantus to that the mantis does not have a history of being amazing n lobate he is action pretty good one on one with members the media when gets combat i but his debates with andrgillum he was not a stubble debater by any stretch of the imagination here in the state of florid in the the the rap on to mantis and you can see teem trump seem to i will say the fat trump the the south great insults he is very good them but it is conscious that he is good at them if ever argued with the seventhgrater they have extraordinary ability they look u an ex men ability to target your weakest and most vulnerable spot and then say it at is the thing that they always do or they pick the thing about you now you have a bald spot all you have a lobe of fat around yourabut things that are if irrefutable irrelevant and stupid but irrefutable the media a picking up on this the rap on to cantus to night is going to be no personality which is which is trumps rap on him a sweatyeeating putty putting with his fingers anal the rest f it this is me a bruzinsks think now i should point out here the media have a heavy rooting interest in dona trump and to night the media coverage almost regardless what happens is going to be about a terrible to cantus was such just the prediction right now but here is make a bruzinsky laying out the personality lading case against to cantus now balls i mad moreen a have to weren't you between now an i nit gat a personality ism sorry ah i mean ow is a not of be a to not conking at all locking i taco la sir run it's a any talking sis a tasty battle matter man tine e pelicans ye try not to try not ti galloepall me real try not to focus on these really really really whale sand to sat o florid that do not mean anything threats the country i again the this this kind of stuff from me a bruzinsky shouldn't carabao any that wit the media hae an interest in doing renounce in during that trump is thenomine as we will discussing just one second there is a reckon every major journalist is being wood and mined bite him trump in in wisconsin beforethis lobate will he's that momentarily first a majority of gens supports wild leftie policies open boarders and socialism if we are nap should reach them and change their mines the country we know i love we will be lost for ever prefer you is the leading non profit when it comes to influencing young people prefer us

o case let us take a look at some of the other candidates in the race a some whether candidates in the race include for van romaswammis to take has made a what they would all dramatic pulling rise a dramatic pulling rise in in the case of everybody who is not true involves moving from basics euro per cent to approximately seven per cent which his movement forsake no question now the take is going to be in attack dog on the stage because he really has nothing to lose trump is leaving him absolutely alone trump does not care about roman worming trump is perfectly happinto see roman mammy rise he knows that romswammy's not only not a threat to him he refuses to cross him there is are would video going around yesterday showing how a take has changed his position meltable tomes on wether true should debate went from trump is definably going to baby's brave to well trump should debate to well i do not care true to bates pretty quickly now the this going to be the rap on on we van writ we makes in coming he has two was his is task to night is to a loud to chances to be the target sit he is not the target and really again he has nothing to loose cause not a politician as calling he has a political office to defend it is not as though he is running a simultaneous race it is not as though he is expected to even be in the race of this point the take is having most fun of anybody on the campaign tell me the dude's releasing shirtless videos of himself playing tennis and saying this is is debate pray and all the rest the rap that he is hm o take to night is that he switcher's positions a lot and then he goes on media and in he denies the ever took that position his seeing bretbarrows pointing out last night here is bet barren fox news talking about romaswommy denying something that he pretty clearly said and one of the things that i con t do with the ex press the out it states is restore true in government for fat candidate clerical outsider and now he has climbed in the poles o bat and his taken a lot of income y his mass and he is come back tit to can an the gam is that we can ham did the truth the government should be more truthful for us with us i think it is some of this interviews he get caught o and the nine eleven de tour ah hes explained it to day but no he said that was not the quit that he maidan than you play the duo ton a glair i i think that ah he is very smooth we will see how that translates on t stage and in or after with other candidate who may be try to go after ham as he climbs in the pules right that is con be the the incoming for for awake is going be his inconsistency his switching of positions and all the rest but all he really has to do is survive and hope that the dances takes all the incoming meanwhile the pure a egression machine on the stage is chis christy at chis christy right now is pulling shockingly well in new samphire the latest pull from emersion has him in second place in new samphire at fourteen per cent he does not really bear any chance is an i but if he can compete in new samphire his hope is that that will knock down trump may be somebody eleven's i he wins new samphire and then by the time he gets to south caroling may be it into more open race now i do not think that is the way this race shaped ups i think that unless one candidate when is both i want and new samphire trump whites clean the table come south caroling and the rest of the race of there is a split between when now samphire then basilar this thing looks it goes the way that twenty sixteendid when crews one i trump one new samphire but not basic leaps hin bounce an then he white the floor with everybody else i think that you you will you will see something that christy has a history of just being basically as so side modern the stage he did to march ruby he will be the one who says the meanest thing said as dances all be the one who says the meanest things about trump now that we will give both true that there both give to mantis and vivace the bill you would after christy christy will take incoming on the basis that he is the due to his hugging mama that he was the guy who was basely fetching water for donate trump up until the point where he decided that he let donate trump any more that he is a person is willing to do anything and say anything in order get his time on mas and be see in all the rest he will be taking some in coming as well this leaves two other candidates on the take both of whom a well qualified and pulling at near nothing they are both pulling at three there is three other candidates such pence wet's no shot at the nomination because the republican base dos colic pence because trump decided that pence was a crater for no apparent reason because he was fibbing about bout pence is bill to overthrow the election pencewill be on the stage he will be taking the sort of classier christy position which has donate trumpshoun be present went because of his positions on the election and because o the things that he is said as ow can be pretictuarly popular but i also think that pence is not into be the one taking in coming banyan shot are the other to on the stage we will get to clean shot in just one second first let us talk about your employes we haven't employ here let us call him money and the he is in my ear pretty much every morning telling me that the clips i ready everything's great and and yet and i per him literally every morning and yet every time i glue to nashvill he introduces himself to me as though i have never met him and have no idea who he is the first time it was kind of charming the eleventh time i starter's wonder if ones he had some form of short ceremony loss lefty if you are wondering if your employs have short rormemory lesson and

dailyware again that ziprogrordi come slash dailywar zipigreters indeed the smartest way to hire o gay the last two candidates on the stage are a hale and scout ism not speaking about pens very much heir because i do not think that pens really has a follow stage kept to make the former case the the mantis campmake which is that trumps should not be present into the united states because of his moral short comings again that one is not into be popular with the republican base at all which means that pens is theoretically going to take in coming true people who are defending trump on the stage nelson you are not going to make a lot o head was with the trump bays by defending trump on the stage it is a great thing for awake to do i that can do that if he is running for vice president or something nick hale anytime scout are both on the stage both of them are basically stuck in their lane nick hale is is stuck in the traditional republican lane that torsional re publican long is basely fragmenting in in a large number of ways it is being broken up between scout and pens and hale and some to mantis a little bit criscristy and tat is why she is currently pulling in the three prosantring the reality is that that the case that hale and scottney to make is going to be a case against to mantis because for clean scout if they bumper car each other and if they bumper cart to mantis trumps the nominate wright now the field is not consolidating if the field stays not consolidated trump walks with thirty five persuader the vote the case that hale and scottercan need to make is why they should be on the station the other one son not sown me surprised to see nickyhaleantim scotch at it a little bit to night in the particular to bate meanwhile trump is just avoiding the whole thing which as i say he shared debate just on principal not is it a smart thing to invite the shut why not my his leading by forty points he is also whining an dining all the journalist again the one the great lies about the trumpet euro is that the media and trump we are in a complete hate hate relationship it is not true to love hate relationship yes the media hate trump trumpets the media also every often to have a passionate flag that is passionate flingstend to happen directly around election time in the re publican primaries not the general in the primaries that is about the time the media fall back in lob with covering trump because he is ratings the duty is readings gold he knows he is reading scold they know he is reading scold which is we according to politico teem trump is whining and dining a number of topereporters at a stake cost called rare and passing out putting snack packs again this is like the p curdle attacks on assagais based on a in in substantiated story about to panties once eating putting with his fingers or something who is there here is a list of the reporters who are there you already database shin golmocker prison walker bob cost fin dolman dosh burns richer shot rid cline josh daisy rob cruelly maria parked and avid charlatan along with a bunch of campaign surrogates crislevieta us via and adjason miller ism yacht you can see we team trump whining and dieting the media that they say are the enemy pretty obvious what is happening right out also they are still attempting to get their surrogates into the spin rooms that they can just crap all over the candidates suspect fact to their candidate in even so up somberly tinfoil who is a the paramour of donate trump junior let she is going to show up and she says let them try to stop me from coming to debate while i inching come to theater but weather she is let into the spin from is really up to fox news channel we will see a fox news runs this debate with regard to trump it will be kind of fascinating to watch those dynamics in fact fox news actually sent out believe it or not a debate guide for the media to cover this thing they are are their mines they are out of their mines i got a point this out o case here is what they say this is nuts a they say that during these seventy period describe during the bapelob me during the timebalow meeting seven days from the date of the debate and on no media outlet can yare more than a total of three minutes of e excerpts from the debate in any one program including video an audio they aware their mines that is totally crazy there treating this a football game or baseball game which is nuts o cave that is nuts this is newsworthy material involving the presidential candidates the people who are on a represent you at the top levels of america government and fox news is saying the you are not allowed to hear from them unless you watch the debate live or unless you are watching fox news that is totally crazy that totally crazy means that when people me recap the debate and explains you what happened in the debate last night fox news is now threatening to people me if i play you four minutes of the debate tomorrow despite the fact that mi show would bring them an extraordinary number of people who are who are yours and listeners to them to take a look at their next debate an how the owl's anybody suppose to actually figure out what happen in theater less they watched the thing live understand they're now trying to telescope all viewership on fox news to the debate itself but good luck with this i mean just really ridiculous ridiculous stuff they say that you can only use the debate are excerpts there of on the invent by way of the imbed video function at fox news dot come video ism that this is that is totally wild stuff between the irons he is handling in this debate and fox news is handling of this debate i got a tell you i am ism just ism due founded you wish to you wish to actively let people know that you are debate is importantand you are doing by blacking it out essentially from any place that is not fox news live that is that is a wild thing to do truly wild what fox is doing right now actually helps trump and it helps tucker ironically because by restricting the ability of other people to engage with the news making that they are doing in this debate this gives a leg up to trump an tuck a are putting all the stuff out for free on ex slash witter and shoves now available to every one which gives trump a leg up in arms of viewership and fox news a leg down i understand that fox is trying to grip harder and harder to its declining username but i got say this should be relevant information fairy use classic fair use kind of stuff for conservatives all over the country for fox her strict to access to your ability to listen to eclipse of the debate with commentary which is the normal way that fair use works threatening litigation against everybody else is ready insane i cam meanwhile we will we will see whether trumps ditching of the debate has any impact on him in places i i o governor come reads he is been a target of drums i she says that voters do expect trumps to show up and actually be there ti ti ti in cat from own o both no i tin i dot i i in to be er i benin er act i wen in er act with all if a can e ta i we ha we a turn out i o air i tat i had a lot of i wen tin people up i i fate come up an o ti ti i ti in in at i i a o e candy i i an a candidate an ti we no i i tie very a win e a ow is o all an i wan inner act with the candidate now we will find out whether that is true or not meanwhile donate trump is gin a counter program the debate with ha prepared interview with tucker carbon on twitter again i think we have seen interviews with dona trump and tucker before now i do not think he will be particularly illuminating or or fascinating in anyway but it is smart of tucker and smart of trump ye get give credit where credit is due in trams the media business and then meanwhile he is gain a counter program the aftermath of the debate by getting arrested in georgia he has to turn himself into arrest in georgia he had up until the twenty fifth to do it he is tiding mud on the twenty fourth you assume in order to counter program the debate fall out from to night drujulyon he was arrested to day in georgia rude of course was his lawyer one of his lawyers throughout the election deboccel and post election in which rude was making claims about voting machines being hacked and all the rest of the sort of stuff making accusations about particular sultan county employes who heathen under a tract those comments s that he would be sued into the ground i here is ruby's comments upon being arrested out should really be arrested for his failed legal stratagems it seems to me and many of those failed legal stratagems fall squarely in the from of free speech here was juliani but to gorge i feeling very very goo about o e a a feel o to akin o mi to all more s as i i many time ta er an i sit o turn the to like to say diver a say rude yulan to i o o am e win hear sitter thin to satin in smarter e due crime when than any may history angst anywhere and'frinting for cuff g wether or not fond that is true the fact is that the counter programming here is going to be re publican's feeling that team trump is victimize that is the entire stick here and it is kind of true but this is why again the case that can have to mane on tach by somebody is that trump is not going to beet bison that is the only case any other candidatecan make now again the twenty sixteen says that you do not know and that true yo do not know however if you are making the case against dona trumping electable dona trump losing in twenty twenty plus for indictments does not he lay out see how dona trump electoral results twenty twenty plus for indictments means that trump performs wildly better than he did in twenty twenty you just have to assume that jobidon would perform markedly worse than he did in twenty twenty we well meanwhile n trump is as we say he is going to be showing up for rest to morrow apparently there is a an open betting pool on how much trump is going to weigh gnat we people r trying to fig ate how much how much trump ways i guess the overrunders in the two seventies having that living he is probably in the two former to fifties but in any case a the a the the trump is facing how additional legal challenges according to new filings from special council blacksmith this wouldbin the washington d c case which again is a discharge one of trumps employee a marlogo has now flip apparently is testifying against the former president according to trying karate daily wire the employe i dentifieding quortzoccuments as trump employee four quickly changed his granary testimony a for meeting with the lawyer from the federal defender's office in washington to c he said he no longer want to be represented by trump's political action committee a person who is recommended him by trumps lawyer the revelation was made in a cortfiing frumsmith's team in response to you us district sort judge clean cannon that is the federal judge over seeing in the case chalk this is not in the dc case this of the florid classified document's case which again is a political prosecution but also is better founded legally than any the other prosecutions apparently during the in investigations the government gathered evidence that trump employ carols do old vier tried to enlist the director of in formation tacnowlogy farm formarlogo o delta marlogla security footage after the grander in the d c had issued serena for the footage thus human approach standby woodland the lawyer representing trump employ umber fort to notify him had a potential conflict by representing with him and ballata that is the trump eight accused of obstructing granary investigation mister woodland responded he would not have a reasonablievf his con current representation of trump employ for and not raised a conflict ofvinterest when trump em ploy fort testified before granary in d c in march twenty twenty three he repeatedly denied or claim not or call any contact or conversations about security footage apparently the government's evident indicated that this testimony was false troscur's in for trump employ he was the target of the granary investigation this guy apparently didn't want jail and to not he is a flipping lawyers an he is going to testify that people at trumps direction were destroying

the hunter question over his trip to mall the media tried their basis do clean up see an ends bill weir was big bid an fan he suggested that mobile was empires a in chief which is heard because typically when i to empathy i do not go to you nowt place were people watch the relatives burn to death then talk about withal one time i there is kitchen fire in my kitchen i but apparently going bill weir jobidncs the making at thus local were working clasmatowins mufti generational locals i worried of toaster capitalist people moving in to exploit this and by up is much can is they can in this paradise an rebuild frgarintrus is well president says promises that tat that will not happen and remains to be seeing re's a lot of forces a play here right now he did service empathiserin chief after five days or being mostly silent on thou publicly but the governor that he was working behind the scenes to e sure a first responders that theta's had the back on this old man who can barely walk serves as empathize in chief while telling people about that one time there is a kitchen fire that is put out in twenty minutes also big controversy of the day is whether job actually fellow sleep at the amply wildfire memorial service this did not be the first time that he appeared to not off in the middle of a service the media were doing the best to spin this as know he was just being solemn ah yah i i do not now man i don now we are at relive on family on hon that is sleep breathing right there wither my on we french and he wakes himself up that is sleep anything and en you can see his chest moving up and now by the way that is the deep breathing that you get right when your i the middle verencychle right there y the chance is that jobidon was just super solemn right there is supposed to he briefly noted off because in eight year old man and he has not had his early burdinner yet and justice a flight i that do not worry guides he is his euro and wonderful and empathetic as ever he is not the kind of i who had check his watch repeatedly during a a service for a falling marines or something he did that when they brought the body back from aged annistand while the hunter began stuff is not going away it is going o get worst because joined has spent literally his entire carer in ricing his family on the back of his political power it is a thing he has done he is entire career ism working on an entire companion in the stuffer now its taking me a long time mean every one around jobidon is richer because cordon was in politics and because presumably he was offering favors on their behalf a pretty obviously that includes his brothers frank an him that includes his sister vow includes his sons hunter and to and all of these people have benefited by their very close proximity to the enter and then v p and then presidents of the united states according to the pastry tournalmn us relations with china were study in remember twenty thirteen when then vice president cordon stepped off air fore stain nation with the seemingly are remarkable companion his son hunter days later chenghoh authorities to prove the formation of investment bout under written by the chimney's government then named hunter bison as a director and the er caught him an ownership share to discounted price roughly forgot staffword o began earning up to one million dollars the annually for sitting on the bricmaboard the younger bison's business activities loom larger than ever a debate after that trip with president bison seeking reelection as a grinding do ja investigation and a determined prove by congressional republicans scrutinized were hunter bine made money over sees and what exactly he got paid to do now it is funny is that they say tings no evidence has emerged to so pressed and bin benefited from his sons international commercial endeavors now i i just ism ism wondering why you would say that again if i do you a favor another your favor back to me is that you give my kids a rap load of money i benefited it is my kids ism ism confused as to the idea that join has to personally cash the check in order to benefit from this sort of thing it is it is it is sort of bazar now hunter bison between twenty fourteen and twenty nineteen company's a located with hunter bid in la twenty million dollars hunter widen personally made clear up to seven million dollars during that time he is a drug added a drug addicted petrolic one of the worst people in america public life and whose polling down bookobuchs because of his last name and yet everybody knows this that is the part this truly astonishing about this it is not as though this is a giant secret everybody knows this including members of his own family mean literally hunter said that his last name was gold to foreign festers admitting that his father's job but open doors that would not be opened up to other people him used to tell potential business partners what we got people all round the world to want to invest in jobidon frank jobs otherbrother called the bide am made tremendous asset for business van says quit i had a better seat at the table because my brother is at the head of the tic he is a he is a penny any racket there jobidon for his family he has always been this ever since he was in delftware which again is a small business run state meanwhile rear learning now thanks to an in investigation by like roziack over it dailywire that hunterbidon's business partner used the federal position he was handed during ye oboli ad ministration to costing eastern european company whose bored hunter was eager to join according to aback females obtained buy the dailywar through a flayer request epic schweran was appointed to decommission for the preservation of america

eastern european countries about the preservation of holiest year cemeteries and by money to the table to fun those preservation projects raise from private businesses and individuals and he attempted get a loan bank acknowledged on a play on a commission project during the a month hunter was seeking a boart at that exact same company good stuff as always from the jobidon and hunter bison team up it is all going just amazing meanwhile the economy continues to be down in the dumps as have said before what goes up must come down things are coming down both dick sporting goods a goods and maces our flashing warning signs on consumer spending easily consumer spending his the only things been holding up the america economy limit later on in the show when a talk with mark scooter who is an economist tho is the creator of a metric known is gross output which is a much bearer measure of the economy the gross semester produced pes f thing we always use go p is basically joust consumption

significant difficulties hallmark is still doing o k amazon still doing o a but target is getting wame how keelboat is getting camped again a lot of the sort of retail places where not being o line those places are getting hiadhardest because people are spending less money meanwhile the also having to face down the fact that major cities tear getting routinely robed according to axis retailers

retailers also many says their giant number of delinquencies on their bills lot of retailers and out acknowledging that giant amounts of fact are impacting that bottom line jobidons economy going strong it is all going great it is all going great meanwhile on foreign policy it is worth while nothing the warning crane has utterly lowdown which er was bound to do because nobody has an incentive given the current an cent of structure t actually figure out a deal according to the her time's big fan of the for you cranes grinding counter offensive is struggling to break through in trench trussing defenses in large part because it has too many troops including some of its best combat units in the wrong places according t both america and other western officials mordyour crank an forced on your bochmoot and other cities in the east then they are near meletopol and burdens g in the south both far for technically significant fronts official say all of these things are bogging down right now this thing is likely now to go on four years the west as provided no invent of structure for as lencegy to cute and they provided no alarm for bottom to cut a deal meanwhile you ask chinatentions r increasing as the chines economy begins to sink the consumer economy is going to sink as well once again joining doing justaspectacular job a can meanwhile the the lefts use of warfare at this point is utterly out of control ism in completely out of control whether you are talking about the wild innightments being brought by the manhattan d against on trump or whether your talking about this latest insanity the d c attorney generals apparently now proving heard let it is a full disclosure we know lunar let here at the daily ware we think that he is one extraordinary work with regard to federalese society it is lunar let who largely responsible for the cultivation of an originals bench that has allowed for the selection of justices to the supreme sort you what non from pick for the springcort that is heard let actually did it then will none washington to see attorney general brine schwallb is investigating judicial act is learned let and is network of non profits goring to a personnel direct knowledge of the broke the scope of the investigation is on clear but a comes after political reported in march that one of leopard leafs non profits registered as to charity wait is four profit company tens of millions f dollars in the two years since he joined the company a few went later a progress of wash strong group files complaint with the denaturing general and i ass requesting a probing what services were provided well i mean this sort stuff actually does happen on a fairly regular basis of course it is never replied to say the pillory canton foundation whenever you eve a non profit that pays private contractors this appensall the time ever them me go to a big non profit event tenon profited to pith caterer for example avid rival an attorney for the parties in the investigation the complaint i sloppy deceptive legally loud where messing this fully with the dc attend general's office and what this really is about is trying to scare a bunch of conservatives from involving themselves in conservative politics is trying get donors out of business leograns you interviews going to politico he featured a two part pop has wen main wire conserved news organization resided his commandment to defend the constitution as the as the reality of we people are going after him this of course is largely correct now you have the d c attorney general going after leopard let political reported a total forty three million dollars floated to less company over two years the bug that came from the eighty five fun a non profit run by his halls which spend tens of millions of dollars over the paste age promote trumps supreme court makes is now rummy carries often and the friend it so a turning and former clerk for justice clarence homes and the the kind of notion that there there nonage to prove this i mean because this really really looks going after political enemies by the dc attend general which would not be a surprise at all meanwhile the media have dedicated themselves foursquare to the idea that they should be enabled to indoctrinate your children with a g b t u content allivelshiover at mason b c made a muscular case for why a g

exactly what it would mean if he did he is not going to do that its totally is total wildness by the way this is to my mind these story of the day this is really a funny story there's a personated roan jet t nocks a person nonage robins ta this it is a female is biological female and she rote back in twenty nineteen tune twenty nineteen quote i live with two townspeople i interact with thousands of trains an on binary people every day i write and speak about transtissues have i look deeply my own gender identity is result definitely have i ever felt that ism trains t nope trains is not ta contagion nine eleven p m tune second twenty nineteen fast forward to august t twenty first two thousand twenty three is a headline from the iron to star his child than partner came out as transgender now rowan it shut nocks rights on the freedom of coming out as trains himself this is a a woman who says that ta she is a man there was no contagion until precisely the minute that the con in till was contagious oops long essay in the pronto star about how roan always lived within her getting pregnant in nineteen solidified my decision to walk away from rowan roan was a boy i was young i knew my child and i would be judge for it i lean headline o the roles of woman and mother embracing of playgroups and bakesailes of eventually becoming a wife and raising three busy kids when rowan would call to me as he occasionally did i allowed the commotion my current life to drown him out but life as a chaos theories in and devisor moving once said finds a way in february of twenty fourteen are middle child came out as trains then in jualliave twenty fifteen my spots of nearly two decades came out as transom the person i thought was my son was not a boy the person i thought was my husband was in fact my wife and now it turns out that she is the husband oh magical day and now she has a book ah amazing to that is that de has her second memoir about this the first one was called love lives here a story of thriving an transgender family now there is a new memoir out this september about how a she is a died yah a your argument about it not being contagious and then everyone in your family has it is weird it is ala it it it is it is a little weird i i do not believe you i do not do not believe you of brernaskips some things i can go to straights me things that i hate to day things that i hate the anti defamation league ism is now defending badly cooper's used for prosthetic nose which in in a in a portray of lunar burnstein of course if sobteptable why was this even a controversy ism confused o following the films first trailer release on august fifteenthtaccorning to the cane dependent the forty eight year old actor who is not of jewfish descent cause a stir on line as she was accused of fueling antismaticteriotypes the dial however says thereof history uses were often per trade dances medic films in propaganda as evil caricatures with large hook noses this fellow may biopsy of leopard burnsteine is not that that seems a reasonable response shockingly from the entire defamation lag well i mean dah he put on make up to look leopard bursted ism confused does he look more leopard burnstein or less leopard burnstein but apparently were supposed to badly cooper supposed to look badly cooper but were supposed to believe that he is leopard burnstein i cat lee's put it this way leopard burnstein and badly cooper do not look alike unless badly coper where a lot of make up they do not look virtually anything alike their noses in par titular are wildly dissimilar ism ism burnastin's family by thewy totally fine with it as they should be ism super confuse as to why this was ever in issue except that we live in the stupidest time in which we are supposed to pretend offense id things tat are in offensive just to points out the same people by the way who ism sure are very upset about badly cooper in deface are perfectly fine wit the running of comose to murder news in israel i think the the vendiagram there is just a circle being offended by things that are not antisemitism in order to at the same time excuse things that are clearly antisemitism seems to be one of the hot topics of the day if you are deeply offended by badly cooper wearing a prosthetic nose to play venderburnstein to look more tenner burnstein i nought to tell you year your dummy i got that is really stupid it is really really stupid again but i will say this should force the left into some sort of soul searching you would think about what it means when people play people of other tonicities but do in a way that is meant to be flattering and not offensive i know that we now live in a stupid world in which we are supposed to treat every form of dressing up as equivalent pagan kelly was fired from c b s for the great crime of suggesting that dressing up for michael jacks for hollowed is not the same thing as wearing blackface and nineteen thirteens wing in amps an andyrotin which is clearly true but the left will ever acknowledge that that that if you dress up as somebody because you actually think that person is worthy of emulation that is not the same thing as dressing up as step in fetch it again very very stupid time barley cooper it is voice my creative and by the way heller mara plane the mayor also not offensive in any way shape or form this is it is it is it is all stupid man everything is stupid give to pretend offend to things that are clearly in offensive already god's the rest to the show continues right now you

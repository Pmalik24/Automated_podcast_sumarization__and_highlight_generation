sight committee the republicans on that committee wanted to ask hunter about his business relationships with dad job hunter s currently under indictment for nine charges related to taxation all baton unreported income in spending from his lucrative years as his dad's alleged bagmen republicans voted last night to formally open an impeachment inquiry which presumably gives them some sort of grater sepia power yesterday hunter showed up in washington d c to gran stay he began by announcing that hunter bison was the real victim a victim of republican ago cruelty hunter bison according to his father the media and wait for it hunter bison he is the victim in fact hunter biding is the greatest victim we are it not for hunter bison's last name he would not be prosecute for gun charges and taxation over a million dollars we are not for his last name he would not be dragged before congress to talk about his business here he was yesterday for six years ago re publicans clouding members of the house committees whore in a closed dor sestionsection right now have impugned my character invaded my privacy a tack my wife my children my family an my friends the ridiculed my struggle with the diction they belittled my recovery an they have tried to be humanized me all to embarrass an damage my father auto devoted his entire public life to service om we impugned his character he did not immune his own character if besbennino eat hundred thousand dollars on sex workers we impugned his character we impugned his children you mean other than the child that he refuses to support with child support and refuses to give his last name we made fun of his addiction because he put pictures of himself on his computer and then wrote in his memoir about how he started parmishon cheese off a carpet which is inherently arias we de humanized his recovery because of course he finger paints for a cover and then sells those paintings for half a million dollars to his days business donors and we have dehumanized him man that is that is the worst thing of all of course weren't not for hunter bison's last name he would also likely be a homeless drug antics without a pending to his name on pay child sport and no life prospects at all as hunter once admitted his last name was gold to foreign in festers his word gold hunter one said his fathers chat quote open doors that would not be opened up to other people hunter by the way is not the only member of the biding family who feels that way him bison job's brother told potential business partners quote we have got people all round the world who want to invest in jobidon frank job's other brother called the biding name a quote tremendous asset for business van his sister says wrote i had better seat t table because my brother is at the head of the table hunter bison is not a victim he is anything but a victim but according to hunter a ma n who again tried to disown his own daughter father well he was a drugattle deflect in who urged his father to do the same to his grand daughter all well he spent nearly a million dollars on prostitutes and drugs the whole debacle surrounding hunter and his dad according to hunter baton is a winchunds here we go there is no fairness or decency in what these republicans are doing they have live over and over about every aspect of my personal and professional life much that the lives have become the false facts believe by too many people no matter how many time to this debut they continued to insist that my father's support of you crane against russia is the result of a non existent bribe they displayed naked photos of me boring an oversight hearing and they have taken the light of my dad's love the light of my dad's loved for me and presented it as darkness of few things on that one first he suggests that republicans are saying that jobitans supporting you crane against rush because of berisemant or something no that such not even the accusation then he suggests that republicans showed a photo of him in need he retune there about martretal agree in a house hearing where she was talking about the fact that hunter and his daddy lied about the provinces of the laptop on which hunter bit had placed such photos but here is the bigger point when he says that republicans have turned his dad's love for him into darkness sometimes were capture into darkness say when your powerful father uses his power in order clear millions of dollars for his family using you as the family bagman even knowing tho giving you access to the family predicant allows you to fund your salon drugadictions putting aside the semi personal situation of the biding family lover when we really have heres a pretty cut in drive corruption case yesterday hunter claimed that his father was not financially involved in his business note the words financially involved in his business let me stayed as clearly as i can my father was not financially involved in my business not as a practicing lawyer not as a word member of derision not in my partnership with the chines private business men not in my investments at home nor abroad and certainly not as an artist well that is some pretty careful wording right there financially involved not totally involve not involved my business at all financially involved as in did not sign checks on behalf of the business was not an executive did not funded himself was not doing the ten forties but how about whether job was involved at all in hunter's business well obviously job was he always has been in reality hunter baton has never in his life he say job on connected to his father or to his dad's corruption as a delftware enter job was very close withvice president of embionnett t which just happens to be the biggest bank in delftware an b ana hired hunter t to a management training post after hunter left am b ana under got a job of the canton department of comers then he went to work his a lobbyist for a former bison

to theamerican spectator by nineteen ninety eight that bank had become quote the second largest t issuer of via and mastercards in the hungry some annals believed it would eventually overtake city cop to come the nation's biggest creditor bank how convenient hunters lobbying work earned him huge but as for the new yorker quote and in formal arrangement was established why did not would not ask chunter about his lobby in client and hunter would not tell his father about them it was not we all sat down and agreed on it it came naturally hunter said hunter has been clearing family money for

order that is on charge do come hurry also stock get how do we know about all of the scandalous material well if you recall the story broke wide open in mid october twenty twenty just be fore the election when hunters la laptop hunter while hides kite had left his laptop in repairshop in delftware and then never shown up again that laptop came into public view it contained not just pictures and video of drug use an prostitution but the contents of those details in whatnot messages the whole biding criminal corruption story was emerging just before the election bison like and did members the deep state and did the media on october twenty second twenty twenty bison like right out in open a bate job said quote i have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life my son has not made money in terms of the thing about what are you talking about china the only guide who made money in china is trump the america public never got the full story before the election that was because the f b i vaguely worked america largest social media services that the laptop might just be russia dis information the social media services actively shut down to semination of the neural posts blockbuster story then hundreds of former judo experts on intelligions signed another letter false a testing that the laptop had the hallmarks of russia dis information then job's campaign suggested it was russianis in formation too all this time job and hunter and everybody else knew the laptop was reel including the f big all this time hunter was also under a act of criminal investigation by the f be he had been since twenty nineteen that investigation covered two separate matters hunters years long navigation and hunter's false attestation on the gun form that he was not a drug atilt in twenty twenty three hugs to turning avid writes of delftware a man who worked with bode and long connections with all the power players in the state of delftware announced o deal with hunter as the sweetheart de hunter would get no jail time for the tax charges he would receive a diversion on the gun charge the deal also included a cleverly created proviso to immunize hunter from all further investigation hon his forge dealings including possible and obvious violation of the foreign agent's registration act that proviso was included in the diversion charge not the tax charge all this blew up in public view because two iris whistle blowers came ford saying that the do j had a tempted to cram through the sweetharddeo in order to avoid implicating jo not only that they claimed that jobidon's do j under merit garland had actually stopped the investigation by refusing writes special council status and that the do j had pushed through the do the whistle blowers as it turns out were right according to the nor timesquote mister writes appeared willing to forego any prosecution of mister biding at all his office came close to agreeing to end the investigation without requiring a guilty plan any charges but the correspondence reveals that his position relaid through his staff changed in the spring around the time a pair of press officials on the case accused the dona of ham stringing the investigation now this wise suddenly demanded that biding plea guilty to committing taxoffences the deal finally blew up when the judge and hunter's case refused the plea dead she noted ho was totally in unprecedented then to cover up that tobocell merit garland announced the wise would be a special council you know just in time to avoid waits having to testify before congress about the sweetheart deal when tapises has finally charged hunter on nine tax charges hunter will likely go to jail but just remember he is not going jo because victim and there is no weight in hell that jobidon was ignorant of all of this that is why the impeachment inquiry has now been voted on and is gaining seem hunters says toll out politics of course and as they political back politics are of course part of the game but hunter also says the impeachment inquiry itself is scirriless here is hunter and in the adepts of my diction i was extremely responsible with my finances but to suggest that is grounds for an impeachment inquiry is beyond the absurd it is shameless there is no evidence to support the allegations that my father was financially involved at my business because it did not happen well no actually the only shameless person here is the gan who sells five hundred shows bowler finger paintings to his dadstoners then refuses to pay child support and insists that any settlement involve denying his daughter the right to use the only actual asset the biding family has jobidin's family name hunter should be hit with contempt and he will be it with contempt the only question is how much more information as in a drip out that ye bunks every last t argument jobidon has ever made about the innocence of his son and his own ignorance about his sons a business arrangements again the notion that job and hunter ere totally dis connected is a lay it is obviously untrue there is evidence to that of felt and despite what the media will tell you about there is no there there that is not true whatsoever it turns out that job has nothing to say about anything here is job biding on all this extra and job is out he will catch you later in just one

are out of order everyone is out of where this whole sort is out of order alpushin o retain from an justice oral careen john pierce was asked about the fact that do jobidon had apparently known that hunter was going do this thatlooks in olfolotic obstruction if you our cipinan you now have a duty to appear before congress somebody helps you not appear before congress that is kind of obstruction he here is correct john pierce trying to speak to that did he is been anything n wen his ta a the tan couple o just a couple o things on that and i going to be really clearly as hunter bin is the private citizen and i certainly would refer to his representative i you i the president was certainly familiar with what his then was going to say and i think what you stay was from the heart from a bison and you heard you've heard me satin he tend the president fay this when it comes to the president o piss lady they proud of him a continuing to reveal his life they are proud of their son a gain the attempt to turn what he is a corruption scandal into they are just proud of their son he is really weak not only that she just said out loud that jobident knew full well that hunter was going to avoid the stepping why did not he just tell him not to avoid the hoping kind of obstruction he is it not apparently it was not just job involved in the sort of obstruction he behavior going to politico hunter bison pulled off his surprise appearance of the capital wednesday with the help of a fellow aliform e resident epic seal well yes the fading congressmen the man know i was stopping a chines by the democratic lawmaker confirmed to politico that he reserved the senate swamp he spot mere felt from the capital that often host press conferences for hunter brain's dramatic remarks tiki cam reported swallow before the presidents beside the president on as hunter sought to go on offense against the house hope but apparently it is not just that he helped set this whole thing up apparently he also helped coordinate with the white house on this one person who knew about the sudden appearance the president himself two people familiar with wednesday's morning events told polite go that hunter began notified job of his plans again kind of obstruction he ism noticing we are really obstruction he the republicans of course are a fighting matt about a representative chippy of texts went after hunter bin yesterday he said an important order he said hes tad did not t having in ballet the manically that is that high he did not say was a blank at in o that he was in ball that truly important the harder bog this pace tickly in on going od domain o ball o stupid the vision an stupid statement at were seeing that right here going o the capital sang is that's in a ten the magical tell heel see if that is true but that is a big towel to me we all know that his dad was in ball in an ricing a hunter we all know the fora enemies were setting billings of dollars to that we know from wish lower testimony that they were so walking the for as for being able go after the investigation o twenty fourteen an twenty fifteen we know these things to be true worked haven the inquiry to day we will seek the true were been having to do all of the work the department of just refuses to do and the luck we get also our hold him a contempt if joust for we need to do in the house or representatives and then see where this process got meanwhile house over she committee chairman's comer who been leading this entire investigation he says we do expect under hiding to comply that we expected t om in and a e o p e a e o pop to the engage miso be a serve probable there negation o tat one we public bag i ran we a garlic re of the to the e the tobago o public ruction at the ha o we ta ti lag of of ten the i a n her to none wooing o doit to me we ha i ti e pi en tin her n tin been all i her to we the cows of own of do o back ta to p the extensions that we work very hard o n is to bet later a a we expect the to to to bet bin to and then wo we wan a tact the have o public very with tom representative him jordan of oho who on both judiciary and the over sicomittes he says listen if he's hung an a shop will hold him in contempt what we want is the fact wan the facts and every single that every single that is gets in off in is you brink in e ta foreign inter you behind close got wen you can get those facts an en as tochairmanset we not om to ho on have we say this t coming council an the whine house o not argue that to begin you could con for a deposition was because there was not a formal not for in peach mi for that is on a happening a few house we think it is gut acts we think the house of representativeswel go on reckon with the down that solely resides in the house to say we are in n official an petting party was of orle per sac and let that hawk see wetter excuse his at tension to ben year to day but let us we take that not we expect him to come in for a a or his interview for his deposition and frankly i lasso i tank look at am proceedings as we before just for the facts t the reality is that contempt to congress done mean ho have you have criminal contempt where you actually hae to find charge of the do jay the delta has topside whether to go forward with those charges y of civil contempt in which you can ask the judicial branch to enforce a congressional sepia but that takes a while and you have an heron contempt which as were actually send he house senate sergeants at arms to cetane and imprison somebody which has really never been used such a set an empty threat but again this the game let us be real about this there you aspects one is the actual corruption of j onion and hunter bison in the fact that a lot of the stuff was taking place these relationships for being form promises were being made well hunter bison's dad was bice presidents of the united states under barakobama and a lot of the manipulate of cover up was happening well his dad was actually president and it was the do j doing that manipulative cover up with those sweetheartials but there is another aspect o this two and that is the democrats open this can they open this can and now the can is open democrats i reached on trump not once but twice and they did not on the basis of no criminality they did not even a ledge criminality and there impeachment proceedings they open inquiries over a phone call that he had with vlodamers lens with regard actually specifically and weirdly too an investigation by the cranial into the corruption of bedesman turns out that corruption fairly obviously is real that is number one and the number to was over canary sex were no criminal charges were actually alleged by the members of the house impeachment committee and once that can was open the notion the republicans were not going to use that against jobidon is insane when you impeach somebody not once but twice and when you threaten to impeachment day one which is what democrats did the minute the dona trumpentered office it was only a matter of time anthill republicans open in impeachment inquiry into into hoiden and one of two things will happen either mutually assured destruction will be restored in which case both parties goals in we cannot keep i teaching each other presidents we really cant or it will be this all the way in till the in of tine and if it is this i suppose it is this tons thing the on of the world me frankly investigations spinal president's being had under the gun all right i mean if this is if this the world the democrats chose for all of us to living i guess i can live with tat do not threaten me with a good tine meanwhile democrats are really upset about all this oleander o cost cortex i she has her lines to read and she reads them with passion and lots of commotions she says the bid impeachment increase in exercise in futility ism ism certainly glad that woman informed her what that wit that phrasemans her own a it we the one republican witness sad that the are from what he hasting there are not grounds for an impeachment inquiry or rather frankly impeachment in general a of president bedim but that has not deterred the republicanize from continuing try to a force throw a completely groundless and unsubstantiated i will not even colitis investigation it'll just call it e exercise inutility well she is she is very upset and she is very serious legal scholar all ism impressed ism impressure it we'd only be better if she were wearing her smart people glasses that she sometimes puts on in committee hearings to look not an idiot meanwhile represent of can gobang he is doing the same retire they just do not have the facts they do not have the fact at or no ah why they decided to do a join appearance can got men and hard moscuoets on mason me see am but this looks an outtake from a from waiting for good a really bat reduction an wert wasting here we go this is a bogus sham in preachment with no evident whatsoever and the notion that ten and telenaldin hin forward for some sort of procedural reason is completely bonk the bydmidministration has been way more cooperative than they need to be and certainly far more cooperative than dona tromp was when he provided zero documents to the congressional in preachment rein to does in nineteen the administration has provided witnesses a hundred housing and more documents the problem here is not that they do not have the materials the problem here is that they do not have any facts to support their allegations of any wrong doing by president by t remember can bellman was one of the lead lawyers in the impeachment inquiry into donate true turn about is farepli democrat's naturally a now suggesting that any attempt to impeach bison is he insurrection it is an insurrection to what was it when he did it twice with with donate trump and claimed that he was a tool of the ruffians here was representative sima govern of massachusetts doing this retire this inquiry has nothing to do with job it is about the republican party at how radicalism an extreme it become they are allergic to truth and transparency republican say this is not about a three or dated outcome it is they are going to try to peach president bi despite the fact that there is no evidence against him at all trumps and a violet man a mob here to the capital to reverse the election results an certify that he want even though he lost what they could not do on canary sixth they want to do with this extreme political sum they have contempt for our democracy they want to finish the jo if contempt for the democracy because they wanted impeachment inquiry into eking that is part of the actual system its part of the actual system again democrats used it twice meanwhile representing gasman crocket of texts democrat she is going in furnished his republicans are domestic enemies if you watching in preachment inquiring to presenting your domestic enemy i wont what that want is that mean when democrats do it to trump twice it mi no e no i we to o e e mi em me m do a a o i mes no a e e i no we a no me no of be a man e will the be to a it outwash domestic enemies anybody who opposed them as a traitor their traitors organ a fight journey by calling all of our parents traitors and domestic enemies ask in ago amazingly well again it is very hard to make the case also that your god join is being unfairly targeted by the house republicans when i kind of noticed the blacksmith is unfairly targeting donate trump in extraordinary y ways has an excellent article by mason killick over at the washington posed talking about jack smith's prosecution of trump and more about the time line of jack smith prosecution of

to order order yours on amazon or wherever you get your books today of cam meanwhile aswarm talking about democrats are blaming that it is totally unfair wrong horrifying fore publicans to open an impeachment inquiry into jobidon meanwhile jack smith is doing whatever he can to get tonal trump arrested and put in jail before the election reason hillock has really god peace over the washington posed about that he says there are real legal problems with special council blacksmith's election interference case againstonnal trump the former presidents effort to overturn the twenty twenty election was despicable but political lying isn't generally a crime smith's case too rely on some of the vaguest laws in the federal penal cot plying them in untested ways but let say you dis agree you thing drums post election behavior as clearly criminal and president titans d o j had no choice as a matter of law but to indict him for it two recent developments in the case should none the less undermine the fiction that smith is in a political prosecutor smith taught a pretrial gag order againstrum that would've limited much of the candidates political speech that it had to be successively narrowed by two quarts now in a filing at the spring part smith has all but announce that his prosecutorial time line is control by the twenty twenty four general election where trumpet is likely to be a candidate start with the gag order litigation in september smith asked for startling restrictions on trumps right to object to his own prosecution he demanded that grumpy barred from disparaging and inflammatory statements about smith order the judicial system most astonishing the special council suggested trump should be barred from blaming bison for the prosecution a mentally muzzling a major line of criticism against the administration trump was to unseat judge tony trust centopointed by mama clearly leans toward the prosecution in this case for the gagwarder will significantly narrow then the one smith sight then last fridge a three judge pelopadel composed entirely of mama and bison pointier have the even narrow that gag order then is what smith one was a dramatic violation of free speech principles against tonal trump but that brings us to point umber too which is the fast track smith final emotion on money to buy pass the normal oppellit process and fast track the trump trial baste of what can only be described is a political time tables says killick trump claims gets immunity from prosecution because he was per forming official presidential duties when he tried to overturn the twenty twenty election and because the senate acquitted him in his twenty twenty one in peach for trial the claims are likely wrong but they do raise novel legal issues but the problem for smith is that the trial cannot be completed until youactually solve the issues true can denied trumscommunity claim is trump is now appealed to the dc circuit but smith is going directly to the supreme quart why exactly is he doing that what is the compelling reason that this thing has to be done right this very instant here is what smith says quote vindicating the public interest in testates requires immediate resolution of the immunity question to permit the trial to occur on an appropriate time table if the pellet re view of the decision below woad have proceed through the ordinary process in the court of appeals the pase of review may not result in a final decision for many months even if the decision arrived sooner the timing of such a decision might prevent this court from hearing in deciding the case this term as wedlock points out the argument is totally circular and no point tho smith explain why this thing has to be decided right now who cares who cares let say goes to the apelicort landfill take takes months then we'll say goes to the supreme quart and takes months and now its twenty twenty five what is smith's big rush smith does not say what he means if the justices do not take the case now the chance of completing a trial before the twenty twenty four election will go down if trump is not tried and convicted by the election the chance o biding winning will take a hit that is the whole point and every one can see it when trump complains that his case has been politicized there is a lot more evidence to that of fact then to the claim that there is a political motivation behind investigating the biding corruption scandal o came meanwhile the latest on cloudy an lathy president the apparently invulnerable president of hazard university the hazard crimson has now come out and suggested that she did in facts violate academic integrity good for the aboard crimson it's a shocker and once harder law the crimson is a very left win newspaper according to mediately in an article detailing the allegations against can the crimson noted it in a independently reviewed the published allegations and concluded that gave work captured to quote violate halyard's turn policies around platrism and academic integrity the newspaper has been generally defensive of clouding gay but the crimson details the allegations and says that she pretty obviously violates standards the students would be bound by meanwhile the springs about again what we talked tat yesterday on the so the final argument against getting rid of clouding gay whishes she is black lady and any criticism of her is races the person best position tare stimulate this criticism is another mediokher but highly placed person who has been elevated because of her race and because of her interjectional stay us n colhanna ones somehow towed is some sort of valuable historian despite the fact that her histories are entirely wrong blast and quite disgusting actually morally here she was yesterday explaining this is a races campaign against clouding gay of course of course everything is race of campaign she is being singled out as some one who is only surviving because of her race what did you make of that well it is rath i mean we haven't no one has produce the thread of evident that to that the tho qualificase and a that a a president gay hat a that e is a black woman that in halting on in the i tic and the fact that a tho president tho all came under intent scrutiny that only one has been called ruled o the tho called the berth the are forming fact in higher the thinks tho what black woman in the country have gone through historically and continued to go through every day i he clearly qualified she is clearly qualified and can ones one least qualified historians ever and yet she was offered a tenured position university on rough caroling then she turned it down and she went to historically black college and university she is been made sort of the face of the near times by the fact she is not done to work for them for couple years it is pretty astonishing by the way is worth noting that if clouding gay had been fired she would not be the first hazard president to be fired bore's summers you'll recall was busted from his position as president of hazard university this happened whole i was actually at hazard she was ousted from that position for the great crime of suggesting that perhaps under representation of women in the hard sciences was due to both under performance on testing and also lack of interest wo no that was discriminatory the he had to be fired for it meanwhile clouding games menticide against yes depends on the contact and everybody's well she is a black lady i us we have to keep her it it really is truly amazing stop and continues to be truly amazing stuff but again cloudinggay cannot go for the same reason that d i cannot go it is the entire reason for a higher education now the perversity of higher education has never been at higher pitch and raglan unpleased that there keeping clouding gay because id prefer that they do not again have the figleef of firing the president an over it you pen donors cannot feel a stage that may be their con ferns have been heard a cannot feel that way at hazard hopefully people continue to pull their money from hazard university in other major universities that mirror that seems d e the varsity equity inclusion nonsense and become part an parcel of the indoctrination course at all of our top level institutions area one second we will

leatalit for the word but no actual changes in policy at the border well they have been trying this line for a while here that if re publicans do not just sign off on a clean you crane bots because they love louden and it is not working they continue to push the line but again that dog is not hunting here is a keep jeffreys the house my norway leader if an agreement is reached o you believe the speak will put it on the float it that remains to be seen because a the pro photon calk's of the house re publican conference ah is extreme it is a loud and it is going it is a led by march we tali gran and gem cordon on the inside and on the outside it is led by dona from antuckor custom and it seems increasing my clear that this pro photon cakes with to see later mar photon in and you crane which would be bade for medical an ask o security which is like it is an open question as the wether house re publicans a serious at all about funding thecranian water for again that is that dogging in a hunt because re publicans are already shore will you want oud actually secure the boarder will now sending negotiators according to the waster journal have moved closer to striking a broad deal on changes to reporter policy after the white house offered significant concessions to win re publican support for separate legislation further finding you crane in the war against russia a deal would mark a break through on inistue that is royal washington for decades with the current talks driven by the record number of migrants crossing the southern boarder and grope lawmaker's decision to tine new aid to keynote to changes an emigration policy all democrats are criticizing that lineage many are signalling in recent days they would be willing to make such a trade off that white house offer includes creating a new expulsion power the boarder that would allow the government to turn away asylum seekers without letting them clemisylum democrats have proposed allowing that new ex expulsion authority to be used only of certain thresholds are hit like daily illegal border crossings democrats have also offered a create or requirement that some asylum seekers be held in emigration attention for the duration of their hearings that was not know whether the new requirement would reply to migrant families or only single adults it would also raise the initial threshold asylum seekers must meet in a screening interview and expand the government's rapid deportation authority to be used at nation wide rather than just at the border enter names landlord of voklohoma said work enough to hostile but it still possible therestill days in the calender represent of don bacon of dobras he said were close to an agreement not sure their were there totally bedclothes now again these are mage or concessions from toabiton over the border and frankly we should continue to fund you crane that they do not actually collapse under the weight of a a new russia invasion for example and we should find israel in is battle against common and wish fungi wan was they are armed a porcupine against china all that of his good stuff getting a bunch of border concessions from the by administration is a big republican win and that that again can only be had if a deal get's cut here yow again condos to the re publicans for standing strong on this particular provision and democrats yo there they're seeing the light at least a little but meanwhile on the economy the federals ore is sending some on of strange mix signals there leaving infrostrates study they are not changing the introstrates weld be expected that because the inflation rate has been coming down and the economy has been slowing but they're also signalling that they may start to lower the introstrats as early as next yearn they might to it as much as three times that is om obvious the causing the stock markets to jump because people are now suing that that means when the new money flows in the stock price er gin to go up because we'd gin to do with new money flowing into the system and you are not to do it the shoving the stockman et get in now and get in early would be sort of the idea ow warn buffet is thinking the opposite warn buffet end thinking they are no new business starts tossing money at the america economy has not in fact generated massive growth it is not a question of the fluidity of cash in theamerican economy rat now it is a question of cross willing to invest in a long true growth projects in the united states when the political situation is rife with chaos when it feels as though the entire working community is shot through with bad employs but git is harder to start of business now than it has been t any time in the recent pass a without people starting new businesses an coming of t new products in new services that is the tuff the generatesioconomic growth not government spending its the stock market may continue to rise because again wearying pat your money if there is more money in the system but that does not necessarily spell economic health the de the doggones in austral hidden all time high because they were cheering progress on inflation and their seeing the possibility that again monetary policies can get looser next year whether that soft landing is going to now materialize in a way that woulds not mean economic stagnation is anybody's guess the definition of south landings can use in question a south landing presumably according to the by administration would mean just avoiding a formal recession but if they mean their on to avoid stagnation i have serious doubts according to founder of say consulting and former get economists the soft landings in the bag inflation has come down for several months recession calls are coming off the table barring any other catastrophe the economy has done the impossible josh reborn chief economist at s m b c no security said recent history suggests a march twenty twenty four rate cut is happening the future's market agrees investors are betting on seventy five per cent percent chance the federal slash rates the first three months of next year presumably that would also be political and attempt to inject new liquidity into the economy in advance of the election as to increase of feeling of economic health going into election twenty twenty four and then byre get to brag about it economic record or something again i remain highly suspicious at the idea the you can have stagnating wages for full on two years thou can inject to this much boney the economy and then have overall inflation that in terms of for example mortgages up ninety per cent since two thousand and twenty and the can somehow come out the other end with a healthy economy i just think that is a very very difficult thing to two actually expect at this point o cain just one second will bring you the latest from the israel comes war if you are not a member become member use coach pro checkout for two months free enol angel

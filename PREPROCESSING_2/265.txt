the early nineteen sixties during what my mother referred to as the tale end of the classy years my parents were given two collies which they name drastic in duchess we were living then in new york state out in the country and the dogs were free to race through the forest they napped in meadows and stood knee deep in frigid streams coast are and their own private dog food commercial late on canary evening while lying on a blanket in the arras duchess gave birth to a litter of slickpotato sized poppies when it looked as though one of them had died our mother placed the creature in a caster old dish and popped it into the oven the witch and cancel an green oh keep your shirts on she said it is only sat on one fifty ism not baking any one this is just to keep it warm the heat revived the sick poppy an left us believing that our mother was capable of resurrecting the dead face with the responsibilities of fatherhood tastes took off the poppies were given away and we moved south where the heat and humidity worked against the best interests of a cole duchess is once beautiful cot now hung in ragged patches when finally full of worms she collapsed in the ravine beside our house we reevaluated our mothers healing powers the entire animal kingdom was beyond her scope she could only resurrect the cute dead the oven trick was performed on half a dozen dazed in chubby hamsters but failed to work on my first guinea pig we died after eating four cigarettes in an entire pack of matches do not take it too hard my mother said removing her oven gets the world is full of guinea pigs you can get another one to morrow youlegies tended to be brief our motto being there is always more where this one came from a short time after duchess died our father came home with the german shepherd poppy for reasons it were never fully explained the privilege of naming the dog went to a friend of my older sisters a fourteen year old girl named windy she was studying german at the time and after carefully examining the poppy and weighing it with her hands she announced that it would be called matron which apparently went girl in what she referred to as touch when she was six months old matron was hid and killed by a car her food was still in the boll when our father brought home when identical german shepherd the same candy brigand as matron too this tag than for egression was disconcerting especially for the new dog who was expected to possess both the knowledge and the personality of her predecessor matron one would never have wet on the floor that my father would scold and the dog would sigh knowing she was the canine equivalent of a rebound matron too never accompanied us to the beach and rarely posed in any of the family photographs once her poppihood was spent we more or less lost interest we ought to get a dog we would sometimes said completely forgetting that we already had one during the era of the matrons we had a succession of drowsy secretive cats who seemed to share unique bond with our mother it is because i open their cans she said though we all knew it ran deeper than that what they had in common were their claws that and a deep seated need to destroy my father's golf bags the first cat passed into a disagreeable old age and died hissing at the kitten who had prematurely arrived to replace her when at the age of nine the second cat was diagnose with feline leukemia my mother was devastated ism going to have said he put to sleep she said it is for her own good and i do not want to hear word about it from any of you this is hard enough as it is the cat was put down and then came the anonymous postcards and phone calls orchestrated by my sisters and i the cards announced the miraculous new cure for feline lukhinia while the callers identified themselves as representatives of cat fancy magazine we would to you sad he is our covers story and we are hoping to schedule a photo shoots s to morrow possible after spending a fatless year with only one child stop living at home my parents visited a breeder and returned with the great done they named marina they loved this dog and proportion to its size and soon their hearts had no room for any one else and terms a family there six children had been nothing more than a failed experiment marina was the real thing the dog was their first true common interest and they loved it equally each in their own way our mother's love tended towards the horizontal a pet being little more than a napping companion something she could look at and say that looks a good idea scoot over why do not you a stranger peeking through the window might think to the two of them had entered a suicide pack she and the dog sprawled corpses their limbs arranged and to an internal embrace my father loved the great done for its size and frequently took her on long aimless drives during which she would stick her heavy anvil sized head out the window and leek great quantities of home saliva other drovers pointed and stared rolling down their windows to shout hey you got a saddle for that thing when out for a walk there was the inevitable are you walking her or is it the other way round our father always laughed as if this with ha first time he would heard it the attention was a fictive and he enjoyed a pride of accomplishment he would never felt with any of us it was if he it was as if he were somehow responsible for her size and stature as if he would personally designed her spots and trained her to grow to the size of a pony when out with the dog he carried a lesbian one hand and a shovel in the other just in case she said just in case what she die in you need to burn her i did not get it now we would say it is for it is for her business my father was retired but the dog had business i was living in chico when they first got marina and every time i came home the animal was bigger every time the were more marmurduke cartoons displayed upon the refrigerator and every time my voice grew louder as i asked myself who are these people down girl my parents would chuckle as the puppy jumped of panting for my attention her great patted paws reached my waist then my chest and shoulders anthill eventually her arms wrapped around my neck and her head towering above my own she came to resemble a dance partner scouting the room for a better offer that is just her way of saying hello my mother would say handing me the towel used to wipe up the dogs bubbling sea ridge here you missed the spot on the back of your head the dog's growth was monitor on a daily basis and every small accomplishment was documented for later generations one can fined few pictures of my sister tiffin while marina has entire volumes devoted too her terrible too hit me my mother sat on one of my returns home from chico no wait let me go get my camera she left the room and returned a few moments later o say she said now hit me better yet why don't you dispretend to hit me i raised my

knew i was down on the ground the great done tearing holes an the neck of my sweater the camera flashed and my mother squealed with the lift got i love that trick i rolled over to protect my face this is not a trick my mother snapped another picture oh do not be medical it is close off with us grown in out of the house my sisters and li foolishly expected our parents lives to standstill there was posed a stagnate and live in the past but instead they constructed a new we consisting of marina and the founding members of her fanclub some one who obviously did not know her too well had given my mother a cheerful stuffed bear with the calico hearts ditched on to its chest according to the manufacturer the bears name was mumbles and all it needed in order to thrive were too double a batteries and a regular diet of hugs whereas mumbles my mother would ask and the dog would jump up and snatched the bear from its hiding place on top of the refrigerator yanking it this way and that in hopes of breaking its neck that is my girl my mother would say we do not mumbles do we i learned that we liked morally safer but not my walls that we did not mumbles er thunder but were crazy about stand gets records and the cranial couple who moved in up the street it was difficult tho keep straight but having known these people an my life i did not want to be left out of the wee during the final years of matron too when the first half of the marina epic i lived with the female cat named need my mother looked after the cat when i moved from valley and fluorite chico once it'd found a place and settled in need was old when she moved to chico and then she got older she started leaving teeth in her bowl and developed the sort of breath that could remove paint when she stopped cleaning herself i took to bathing her in the sit and she would stand still too weak to resist the humiliation of shampoo king wet i could see just how thin and riddle she really was almost comic one of those cartoon cats

our lives an in our homes it is pes a fiction from river rate you'll it was three days after our old man died that my brother donate accomplish the most spectacular deed of his life i wish i could have been there to see it donate taking the greyhound down to koalas all by himself being the baby armadillo for eight hundred packs from a pie faced india woman at the manta coon market tucking the little thing under his arm a football and running the length of the pedestrian border station past the heat struck tourists in their sombreros and loudsocks and the cards with their side arms and wacky tokes pushing through the last steel tooth turnstile and spinning a madman into the heart of the koalas slums an into o o it was his proudest moment though it did take him the rest of the day and half the night of wandering among the hookers and street corner punks to find a bust that would bring him back to who where we lived there he was after i came home from hours of frantic searching sitting stiff back on the couch bend the little armada was rooting at the crotch of his pants and dona's pink sweating face had screwed itself up with such a grin of utter self satisfaction donate ended up giving the armadillo to me but present he said something to make me feel better i thanked him took the armadillo which clod at my tea shirt a cat and gave it a little squeeze what else could i do my fathered work as ta janitor for twenty one years but he was also a reader of books a scholar if it is possible to be both the scholar an a six great drop out and one of his favorite subjects was zoology he could bore you into a coma with what he knew about the great horn owe or the common meal worm for the laughing hyenas of africa but of all the beasts of the animal kingdom he loved and admired the humble armadillo most no not the smartest of the prettiest he would say when one of them scatted across the highway in front of our old we mans but the hardiest who see what ism saying the most resourceful he often promised he would get us an armada for a pet but he died before he could come through an end all hard attack standing in line at the grocery store i was seventeen donate nineteen our mother a gwadomall and migrant worker would married my father under the impression he would one day be a rich man who could quire a cattalo in a house with a swimming pool had run off when we were babies it was just the two of us now it took me about a week to get over the shock and then i did what i had to i dropped out of school started working full time pouring concrete for hossenfeffers and moved donate in me to a cheaper apartment near the madman son's rocking yard were donate could watch the cars getting pulverized from our window we got money from the state that paid for dona's medication but the rest was up to me donate was really something else what could be done with the guy who ate his own ear wax who carried a maroon many bible in the band of his underpants and red random scriptures out loud and in a appropriate times who could be sashay about the room one minute doing a dead on impression of salmi dais junior and the next be down stairs in the clos running a pig and trying to tear his hair from a distance he would have been able to tell him from any other tea anger he had relatively good hyping did not usually talk to himself and public and was something of a handsome devil with his dark hair hanging down over pale green eyes sometimes i would take him to a party or a dance with me and the girls would flock around us he could be as charming his hue hastened in short bursts before he would have to run off and hide in the bathroom i remember once when i was nine or ten and we were playing in the back yard he kept pestering i in saying i am the india you are the cowboy o say i told him to shut his trap i was busy building a cave for my almsman he would not give up me india you cowboy oke done over and over damn it donate you free i hollered do whatever you want but just shut up for a second ism not a freak he said sticking his chin out ill right then i said the next time i looked up donate was on top of the dog house with the bow and arrow set my father both for him at a courage sail he had the arrow notched and pulled back to his ear just the indies we saw in the we i had not notice before but now i saw that he had taken off his shirt and tucked at in the elastic of his shorts it looked he was wearing a loin cloth and an used a little blood from the scab on his elbow to make fiendish redstreaks across his face he was doing it perfect really just a t v india i did not believe he would really shoot me i just sat there a jackass my hands full of dirt i did not see him let go of the bowstring but i certainly did hear the shop the grow made when it hit me in the chest dead enter more from the surprise than anything i fell flat on my back it was only a target arrow but it pierced my sternum just enough to stand upright from my chest waving around sluggishly a reed in a river i lay in the grass and stared up at the neon yellow fetching of the arrow my hands were still full of dirt donate jumped down from the dog house and stood over me he was smiling an odd satisfied smile as if he was expecting to be congratulated on his marksman ship he looked down at me for a long time before he gently put his hand around the shaft of the arrow without pulling it out he said might smack dab in the heart white n i told donate i wanted him to name the armadillo after several days of deliberation he decided to name it after odds the happy drunk on the and graffiti show who our father had resembled in almost early detail it'd got used to taking care of donate alone i had no choice but odds was a different story first of all odds smelled he gave off a musky odor that intensified whenever he was nervous or hungry and no matter if we scrubbed him raw with industrial soap and water the smell would come back in an hour or and then there was the furniture armadillos or burrowing animals this is something i learned from my father and in the confines of our small apartment odds did not have many opportunities to burrow instead he would marched through the house a tiny gray tank and moved the furniture around he would waddled into the living room put his blunt forehead against one of the legs of the coffee table and bare down inching it around the room his little squirrel claws scrabbling on the rood floor at least once a week he would crawl between the actress and bowstrings of my bed and take a dump my father was right about armadillos they are hardy they are resourceful and if o dis's typical there as dome is donkey cat sometimes in the course of his incessant apartment wandering odds would find himself trapped in a corner and would spend the rest of the evening attempting to claw his way out odds was technically my pet but donate cared for and hurried over him tormented him teased him then made up with tearful professions of regret and affection while i was away at work they would do things together donate would carry odd around outside conversing with him rooting in the weeds and the vacant lot searching for earth worms for crickets for dis's dinner sometimes donate would hide behind the recliner and when odds passed by would jump out and shout in a high supernal wale look out odds poor odds would spring two feet into the air a startled cat his leathery body twisting his claws clutching at nothing and once he would landed he would scurry into the hallway looking back over his shoulder and barrisnent in those little piggy eyes his kind of living arrangement was no loose to my social life i can tell you if i ever wanted to bring a girl home i figured it'd have some difficulty explaining why the apartment smelled a bears dim why the furniture was strewn around and why my brother was naked and hiding behind the couch waiting to scare the daylights out of an armadillo it took five years before i found some one i loved enough to bring hold allusion was good about everything told me i was a saint in a christian to be taking care of donate she was wonderful and beautiful and good smelling i could barely stand it eventually i proposed to her after which i went home to talk to donate it was springtime in the desert the smell of can't is blossoms everywhere and i was full of love and desire i could barely see straight allusion and i had decided that we would get an apartment near by that wash my new promotion at poison offers and allusion's job at the county court house we could afford our own place and with the help of the government support donate donate would be all right as long as we checked on him daily made sure he was taking as medication and occasionally washed down the place with a mania the smell when bother the neighbors i have to admit the thought of escaping from donate and odds and that cave of an apartment was almost as enticing as the thought of being together with allusion at home when i sat donate down to explainthings to him i could barely get a word out i stuttered and stammered kept wiping my mouth when i finally made things clear donate whipped out as many bible and frantically page through it but could not seem to come up with anything the first time i had ever seen him at loss for a scripture he yanked at his hair and ground his teeth together until they squeaked finally without saying anything he snatched up odds who had been napping under one of the couch cushions and went into the laundry room slamming the door behind him i felt kicking that doordown and ringing his neck couldn't he at least tried to be happy for me to think of somebody other than himself for one minute i wanted only to be with allusion and i hated donate for making it difficult hated him for the years of responsibility and obligation and lost opportunities hated him in the way only a brother can hate the brother i took a few steps toward the farewell to leave i did not care i was going to stay at allusions i first night ever away from donate when i heard a splashing noise for inside the apartment the laundry room door was locked and i shouted dona's name but got no responds i tried to kick in the door which was made of something cardboard my foot went right through it once i had my leg free i look through the splintered hole and could see donate hunched over the overflowing utility sink both arms submerged up to his beeps the back of his neck was purple and pulsing full of angry blood and it took me only a moment to understand he was trying to drown odds i unlocked the door and grabbed him from behind but he resisted me running and plunging odds deeper into the water i wrestled him out into the living room ere we fell sideways against the couch donate twisted away from me and stood up the matter dripping off his elbows forming a puddle around his shoes odds was curled up in a ball just when he slept and donate began to shiver badly that he lost his grip and let dis's body slide out of his hands and hit the floor with a wet slap dona's face twisted into a mask of concentrated green see he wept see what i did looking at my brother i felt all the parts of me that had been opening up since i had met allusion collapse on each other many empty rooms hit would have to be me and donate brothers inseparable no one else allowed i do not remember if i looked away or if it was as sudden as it seemed but one moment odds was as sad wet corpse as dead as an armadillo could be and the next he was huffing and twitching and scrabbling to his feet donate let out an arching shriek which sent odds zigzagging into the kitchen where a mad chase ensued donate slipping and flailing nocking over chairs and pulling down the drapes still choking and sobbing now with relief he finally hurt odds under the table once he had pulled him out he held him up his fingers locked in a death grip around his little body and cried odds is resurrected odds is resurrect a fair trade donate got his armadillobac and i got to many allusion never again did donate show any sign and jealousy or resentment he was the best man at our wedding red a local section from kept and it the reception and even bought us a gift book called hot see for cold fish things went well this first few years we saved up enough to buy the concrete business from old house deffer who we tired to write his barley around the content and donate and odds seemed to thrive together we stopped in to visit as often as we could allusion cook dinner for them on tuesdays and thursdays and we paid a house cleaning service to scrub the apartment down every week but the furniture back in place and steam the carpets donate had his first episode one night while i was and phoenix at a heavy a equipment action they found him digging up the lawn and front of the city first bank blabbering about how difficult it was to find high great earthworms on the south end of town when the cops tried to approach him he pelted them with dirt clods and threatened o fistful of worms if they got any closer he spent most of the night in the holding tank before sheriff basket figured out who he was and gave me a call a few months later donate climbed an old elm at the city park which branched out over a sidewalk he managed to pee on a few passers by before the groundskeepernocked him off a branch with a well thrown ran we took him to a doctor who adjusted his medication and suggested the donate be put in a home where could get the care and attention he needed where he could socialize with somebody besides an armadillo i brought up the subject with donate but he told me he would rather die than give up odds and go live in a house with a bunch of half wits and knuckleheads the only other action we knew was taking in donate and odds ourselves allusion was eight months pregnant with our second baby the business was really starting to take off he just was not a good time we told ourselves he might be able to work something out in a few months when things had settled down by the end of the summer donate was dead the call came in the middle of the night they always do sheriff brassy told me the donate had been hit by a car on eighty seven near the refinery he had run through traffic completely naked dodging cars and spinning down the medium until an old coupled in a minivan clipped him with their bumper knocking him over a temporary still divider and on to a concrete platform where he was partially impaled by a jutting piece of rear he bled to death before the ambulance arrived after i went to the hospital to identify his bad i drove out to the accident side for half an hour i combe both sides of the highway without a flashlight until i found odds cowering under a piece of discarded plywood his left foreleg was mangled nearly torn from his body and he was bleeding from the soft flesh of his belly i drove him over to the only veterinarian in town marry oleander and pounded on the door anthill he answered marry was an old retired cowboy with a glass ball and i dent in his head where a mule ad kicked him jess geronimo christy he said it was four o'clock in the morning i held odds out to him and he said what you have there's an armadillo fix him up i said son he said i do not know what you think do it marry oleander peered up at me he side and held the screen door open come the hell on in marry amputated dis's leg stitched up the wound on his underside and bandaged him until he looked one big wad of gauze when i tried to pay him he waved his hand in front of my face took a slug off a bottle of body he kept under the operating table jess richer just promise m you will never make a peep about this to anybody i took odds home and he has been part of our family ever since over the last few years i have added on a wing to the house just for him he has a room with the skylight and two bay windows his own pillow bed to sleep under and a bunch of old furniture to push around his far as i am aware he is the only three legged armadillo on earth with his own personal waiting pool allusion is not thrilled about having an armadillo in her home never has ben but she knows it is important to me the kids we have four of them now cannot stand odds either they want another pet some kind of happy slobbering dog or and it'll bin snake to impress their friends odds is not only real real dumb they argue but also smells do to and not sure which is worse i tell them they are correct they will get no disagreement for me but odds is our pet and were going to love him no matter what i try not to let myself forget how blessed i am y beautiful family my dream house up in the hills a successful business that pretty much runs without me i am happy and satisfied most of the time but every once in a while maybe once or twice a year something will come over me a dark mood that i cannot shake usually at night when everyone is asleep and the house is quiet and it'll get odds out from under his pillow bed and take him upstairs i run a bat sitting on the lip of the tub holding him close to my chest the way he likes it usually i just let him paddle around but sometimes and the tub is almost overflowing i take him firmly in both hands and plunge him into the water there is not a clock in the bather i count one alligator two alligator three alligator this is how i count off the seconds odd struggles a tiny lion for the first two or three minutes writing and spamming wildly sending up a boiling foam of bubbles fighting and scratching with everything he is got and i hate myself or what ism going t him usually between the fourth and fit minute his on my starts to lose his will and his thrashing weakens as he gradually curls up in on himself a flower dying and goes utterly still this is always the hardest part for me the urge to pull him out his almost unbearable but i go five or ten second longer an the last time one alligator two alligator three alligator four alligator five alligator until i cannot stand it any more i lift him out and he lies there in my hands a deflated sockerball and ism sick with dread knowing that this time have taken it too far have killed him i stared down at him and wait hardly blinking wait for that first twitch or jerk for is nostrils to flare with life and usually there is an almost imperceptible shutter from under his hard shell a stirring and his tail will begin to vibrate a piano wire and he slowly hesitantly opens up and stretches himself clawing the air and coughing a newborn sitting on the edge of the bath tub with odds wet and dripping in my arms ism always overcome with the same vision donate clutching a newly revived obis his face slick with tears trams form from a man twisted inside out with grief to some one awestruck at the realization that our worst mistakes can be retrieved the death can be prayed it in for life that what has been destroyed can be made hole again with a sudden surge odds struggles to get out of my lap he is an armadillo and there is exploring to do i let him down and watch him slide around on the linoleum and try to push the toilet off its back and i feel a small bitter joy lodge in my heart odds is resurrected i whisper i care y him to his room and make sure he his comfortable under his pillow bed and only then will i be able to walk peacefully this the dark quiet halls of my home kiss each of my children good night and lie down next to my wife to sleep ready

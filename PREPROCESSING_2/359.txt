welcome to the superman laconic discuss science science pace to from i may drahubermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is doctor marry been i sordino yang doctor amorino yang is a professor of education psychology and nauru science at the university of southern californium her laboratory focuses on emotions and the roll of emotions in learning as well as how social interactions impact how we learn to day's discussion is one that i found absolutely fascinating because it will reveal to you in fact to all of us how our temperament that is our emotionality combined with our home environment and the school environments that we were raised in shape what we know about the world and our concepts itself in thinking about that we also discuss the education system and how different aspects of rules and how we are told to behave in what actually constitutes good behavior or bad behavior shape how we learn information and develop a sense of meaning in life if any of that sounds abstract i promise you that to day's discussion is incredibly practical you will learn for instance how different styles of learning are going to favor different people from children into adulthood and how we ought to think about learning in terms of our emotional systems being our guide for what we learn and the information that we retain and how we apply that information throughout life for those of you that are parents or who are thinking of becoming parents or who were once children i believe that encompasses everybody out there today's discussion will arm you with an intellectual understanding of psychology and gaur science as it relates to learning but also practical tools that you can applied in order to be able to learn more effectively what i much about doctor immordino yang's research and the discussion today is that she frames up beautifully how those who best learn from traditional forms of classroom we warning as well as those who learn from non traditional forms of learning either in or out of the classerum can best use that understanding of self in order to learn in the way that is best for them before you begin id to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science backtolectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one graham of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc come slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element el event doctor slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor marry been immordino yang doctor amorino yang get here great to have you it'd to start off talking about something that to me seems a little bat high level but i think it is the perfect jumping off point have heard you talk before about inspiration and a a and a somebody who's interested in the brain and a somebody who's interested in the role of emotions and learning and life experience inspiration and awe seemed to me rather high level emotional experiences compared to say fear or happiness and yet inspiration and awe just seem fundamental to how we learn and navigate life and before we started recording we were talking about avid noggins of all people em and we will get back to that but if you could yo share with us what is the role of inspiration and awe an story in how we learn and experience life starting at a young age and then maybe we can transition to older ages yet i mean i think what you have noticed is actually fundamental to the conundrum of being a human is that our most high level complex reinstates mind states are also fundamentally hooking themselves into the most basic biological machinery that literally we share with alligators that keeps us alive and that is both the power and the potential of a being a human and the danger of it our beliefs are experiences are interpretations of the meaning of things which that is where the story comes and the stories that we conjure about no collectively with other people culturally in spaces inside out ourselves also those stories become kind of the through line that organizes the way in which we construct a found experience consciousness even i would say when we hook into those verge basic survival systems by recruiting them into these narratives about the nature of reality the power of the meaning we make what happens as we get this amazing it both fundamental and high level state simultaneously where we feel expansive we feel a it is all incredibly beautiful and we are i would argue actually camping into ore catching into the very basic survival mechanisms that make us conscious that make us alive and and that is that is in essence the power of being a human that is the power of our intelligence at this late state in our evolution when i was a kid i love stories of all kinds i think most kids i loved my curious gorge books ism told i liked the bad a books but then quickly did not the tabour books am i liked the book where the red fern grows i liked am books in stories about it generally was boys for me for whatever reason a that had some idea in mind or some ongoing challenge and that played out over time and the character revolves across the story and of course many many many excellent stories have all those features i can recall specific passages in those books to this day that made me feel something in my body a ism actually very familiar with the sensation of having chills go up my spine a suppose to down my spine the early honor give realize other sort of a different sometimes that travels up my spends on i i seldom distinguish what what that science me to or away from but but it is a very salient memory and experience for me to this day much the as describing the book where the refer grows right now i can cancel it is farting you've heard you say before and and i love this quote and i want to make sure that you get attribution for this not me that we busily have a brain to control our body what is the the role of the brain in control in the body and do you think that there are an infinite number of ways in which our brain does at or are we really talking about a language between brain and body of tingles on the back of our neck tho go up tingles on the back of our neck that go down stomach feeling carnotite and making us cringe away or kind of warm and wanting to approaching in other words do you think that the conversation between the brain and body is primitive sophisticated how new ants is it because a language is very wants we cat him up with fifty words just in english for the state of being happy ye but the feeling of being happy i experience along a continuum of a little happy to elated but it is it is got one thing really if if you would could you comment on this notion of the brain being the organ that is responsible for controlling the body and what that dialogue is what the syllables and consonance of it are perhaps not at the level of biology but ism at the level of psychology and how we subjectively experience that sir the first thing it'll say is that i learned that idea from it from working with antenna omasa a he was my postdoctoral mantra and he taught me first that a this notion that that that it is the feeling of the body it is it is an organism's ability to represent or map the state of the interior and exterior of the body that becomes the substrate for consciousness and for the mind am i would stone to give hymcredit because i did i did not think of that first but the work that have been doing is an elaboration of that it is it is basically addressing exactly the question that your asking which is how is it that we construct a narrative construct a conscious feeling which that word i take from antenna banana it do music how is it that we construct a feeling and stop narratives that feeling elaborate that feeling in t to something that feels a narrative that feels a belief state or an emotion state or an experience i mean that in a very verb way and am and what is the role of embodiment in that what is the role of the brain and that a and and what also is the role of the culture and the cultural contexts and other people an that because what we are really learning across the sciences right now is just how incredibly social and interdependent our species is i mean are biology is inherently a social one we are directly dependent on other people for the formulation of our own sense of self and we interact with one another and construct and to construct a a sense of self and a sense of meaning via those cultural spaces and those sort of am new ants ways of accommodating each other mentally and physically that that lead to the feeling of us back to your original question there is a lot we do not know there a but i think what is very clear is that the kind of background sense of the body the mapping and the regulation of the body is a a basic subtract a kind of of trampling for the mind and we a managing our survival we now have lots of evidence from across many kinds of science about the interdependence of our stress and social relationships and a immunity and our right and and our ability to digest food and and it is even now very clear that is not even just us there is a whole microfilm and all kinds of other organisms that are assisting us an that and that are collaborating with us and that and then the brain is is a is a specialized organ of the body in fact it is not it is not a separate thing it is it is an outgrowth or an elaboration of that process it is a specialization of that process a localization of it am in a way that provides enough processing power to be able to really construct a all kinds of feelings and mental states and beliefs and imaginings out of out of basically just he feeling of being here and then the amazing part is that our brain is also imposing those back down on to our body the way in which our body reacts am and is modulated in response to mental states is also very real we have a kind of a dynamic a conversation happening that is happening in very braw and and direct ways cant narrow chemically another and also in broader longer term slower fluctuating patterns around other kinds of hormonal changes and things that long multiple time scale simultaneously we have a kind of whole right a human is tic how of brain and body and mind that are kind of to conjuring one another in real time and that leads to all kinds of dynamic possibility spaces for how we are and how we feel as we grow through time and i think as humans the legacy of our intelligence is to tap into those possibility spaces and start to construct them into meaning full meaningful sort of chains of ideas chains of experiences over time that we call story and that i think is what you were tapping into as a little boy you were hungry for fodder for for a kind of structure for those feelings that you could start to help them evolve from one into the other and chain them together in ways that produce meaning ism fastening by the idea that early in life we experience some interaction with the world it could be with other people could be with an object in the world and it makes us feel something powerful yet and that lays it a templet for of of recognition meaning that later in life and perhaps throughout life we are always consciously your consciously going back to trying to experience that same kind of awe were inspiration i because again that the what the circumstances almost certainly very from being a five year old to being adolescent at an into adulthood into the i guess geriatric years do they still call it that imcoletedded i vole tinpletically in correct term but forgive me i vinseventy five to to one hundred twenty five i and yet the feeling is the same right yo feeling and it is as if a word can mean the same thing but be used fifty different ways may be five thousand different ways tora it in in this analogy ism saying that at the word is the feeling and and it is used many different ways because i occasionally it'll read a a scientific manuscript that is cool cat's the same way that i feel yes when i was nine years of o and i an all my time i had pat store looking at tropical fish and tropical birds and acting when i got that fresh water viscous fish is the coolest thing have ever seen ye and again i i think i must have a strong memory for these kinds of things ye because i still i feel it right now in my body o it is as if the the same thing maps to many different circumstances is what we are learning across the life span a recognition of feelings in our body as ah this is something i because of the way it makes my body feel or is it cognitive or both from your answer a moment ago it seems i get interconnected and by directional and fast that it is impossible to really say that feelings are in the body or in the brain it is really happening him and neatly that is a dynamic emergency stay they give man example that i is sometimes to help myself understand a notion i mi told my little daughter of nor one she was too two and some months to inform onto it that she is very verbalcid and i i was sitting in the kitchen one day drinking a cup of tea i was sad about something that happened in my life but i are not i was not weeping writhing i just sitting there i must a looked kind of you i lost in my own thoughts she is playing around on the floor she came over to me it'll never forget at this tiny little person she comes over me and notice t i was not really there with her it i mean and she my arm must hanging down she picked up my arm and she hold it against your face that and she said i will not say a baby talk as you will not understand me she said do not worry mamma it'll take care of you and i said yet and i do nor that is that is sweet media it'll take care of you too and she said and mamma i will we love you i really love you and then she said i mean i really love yo am i really love your arm maker ray fast forward two years later almost exactly to you she is for and a couple months and she was not bed one night laying in her bed in the dark and i walked by and i listened at the door to see if she was sleeping the and i hear this little whisper comes out and she says mamma i love you more than ism glad that there is day time what is changed developmentally from her at h to to her at h for it i would argue that the physiological substrate of her attachment to her mother is probably quite similar she had this sort of visceral automatic biological you might say attachment connection to me emotionally that she was trying to leverage in the service of making sense of you not being active in that world and adapting herself to the situation helping me in the first case but what is changed remarkably is not the subtract of that attachment it is her ability to conceptualize it and when she is too her love is experienced as is incredibly concrete embodied real physical thing i love you i mean i really love the body part i am curtly smashing against my face right where is two years later she can conceptualize that love in terms of an idea which is would not it be awful if there was night time all the time and there was no sunshine and daylight and i could not go out to play and i could write yen you are describing my biggest her at people listener to this podium ism going to go into the grave hopefully a long time from now ya telling people to get morning someligh e o i o in an onto but it please continue no but that is right she is thinking about how much she is grateful for there to be sunlight and in her little mind she connected that to the feeling of being attached to me and used one to explain the other write that both things now have meaning and that is the way that is the way i think that we start to elaborate these very basic physiological attachment states aversion states rite motivational states a serious sorts into mental states beliefs poems i love songs all the things that she does right even between age two and age for that really are mental elaborations meaning making of that very physiologically basic sensation does it answer your question it answers it incredibly clearly in much that it'd to continue to build on that example because i think it is very relatable for people and it is the first time that have ever heard the embodiment of emotions described in a developmental remark that truly make sense i thank you the contact with your arm were your arm or both a was the the was the life example that she was using it as a two year old that maps to an internal feeling and an organ a assume she is not here we do not have her in a brain scanner we cannot ask her but verdant assume that her experience of a being put to bed at night and and feeling much love from and for you map to her then a growing understanding of the the world around her the fact the thursday and night and sunshine o as her knowledge base grows she can add examples to the feeling and ism assuming that am does not matter how old she is now but ism assuming that as a fourteen year old the knowledge basis can be different and is going to map to that feeling again and again the question is is what we are doing across the life span is recognizing am sort of i don't ant to call them primitives but a basic emotional states which are not infinite but can be along a each one along a continuum a little bit of love completely in love e along continue than everything between am a little angry and annoyed to completely furious are we talking about may be am ten to thirty core emotions that then we are just simply binning our experiences into and on to and mayor to and then that is our life story and ism not trying over simplify things but am that seems to me pretty great way for a nervous system to navigate a a world that is infinitely complex yet and has a lot of surprise both positive and negative and in which every organism our maingoal is to survive as long as possible and not for everybody but in many cases to trying make more of ourselves i mean those som to be the base drive survive and make more of oneself as rooms to be the two basic function tear the very ideas or more of your work sure of your art exactly them is that in in o really simplicity way to think about it or does it does it work even if there is more that needs to be added does that work is a twenty year old i learn things in college on this is asomyet the first time i learned about the hypothesis this marble size structure in the fact that different her on sitting right next to each other can put us into a rage were we will make us want o mate or we will make us thirsty or hungry or tired i why yes i d i mean it just it bloomy away it still blows me away yet but the feeling s the same as looking at the discuspicion that in yoga's pet shop on californium anyone i nine years old sons that the way i think another night i think yes i think there is there is an awful lot of basic physiological mechanisms that are that become motivational mechanisms right and in all the senses a adaptive mechanisms that we share with all life forms not even to stall animals that all life forms but they look different and different life forms for sure because the adaptor functions the time scales and everything are different if you are a tree than if you are fish than if you are slime would or your me right but i think you are right that what we basically our doing is taking these very primitive physiological regulatory capacities that are essentially there to keep you alive and and that is a very dynamic thing to keep you alive you have to consulate adjust for the the needs of the internal organism the needs of the external you do notate mans of the external environment on that organism and being able to manage in that space over time is a very complex dynamic i kind of kind of iterative process and we take those processes and we conjure out of them a form of consciousness an awareness of those processes that becomes something that feels mentally powerful to us and and i think one of the ways that we can know that what you are saying is right is that this is just our first experiment on this but but i think it is really poignant we we we first started to study am the the ways people would react to social stimuli right to have emotions compassion or or admiration in thaadmoriz skinner am by telling people a stories of true people situations that invoked these emotions in all kinds of plotting in the we ask people how to make you feel then we can see whether they actually feel that way and then we move them in the the acari skier and ask him again to watch the story info and what we expected we had some very basic hypotheses that things am watching somebody else under physical pain would activate the same systems in your brain that allow you to feel physical pain a and the same with pleasure a round admiration for skill by watching somebody do flips on their bike on a railroad tie or whatever it is right a or virtue we watching a civil rites leader or somebody who does something that is incredibly virtuously powerful but not physically skilled am and we had a real surprise in those findings a which i think really went against the prevailing notion of how emotion works and which is still something which i wrestle with trying to understand we hypothesis that feeling emotions about very physical direct things and feeling emotions about are mi drawing in space but felling emotions about complex elaborated things compassion for some one having lost u small or something wore you do not see any real physical pain but you can imagine how their feeling based on your shared experience am of loss it or admiration for virtue am that those things would build a curl biologically the way that they build developmentally the way that they build evolutionarily m and we did find that to b the case an many other groups in experiments have found that to but what was a real surprise to us is that emotions based in pain and emotions based in something rewarding or pleasurable virtue which is really inspiring as people describe it were actually recruiting the same brave systems including the hypothalamus right and other systems the anterior insult which is basically visceral sematomotor quarters its quartics that feels the state of how your digesting your launch whether your hearts pounding all the kinds of things right what we found is that these emotions when they get complex when they are about stories the vigilance is no longer the defining feature the vigilance does not even matter that much instead what matters is does the emotion pertain to a stor that is conjured in our minds or does it mainly pertain to what you can directly witnessed by looking at the person they step off a curb they break their ankle and you go all tats i get really heart right verses there eating dinner alone in a restaurant and somebody tells you his spoustide just a month ago right where you have to tell yourself an entire story about how he must be feeling in that situation as compare ted just looking at him and seeing the ankle and going who and it was that leap which is really uniquely human which is fully developed really throughout a very protracted period right little children do not fully appreciate those kinds of mental states yet right and in adolescence kids are all about trying to conjure and simulate these things and they do it very yen are they overdo it and they do it in these very sort of awkward way is that adults recognize as i it'd not likely to correspond fully to reality right many times a and then we start to build more and more facility more and more sort of wisdom around conjuring the story that makes the most direct parsimonious sense out of the things that you imagine somebody else may have experienced given the complexities of the contacts in which they find themselves it becomes more and more dynamic more and more her inferential and this also goes back to what you are saying about development this is actually how i see development across the less by my little you year old loves the arm then she loves me as much as something else that she really appreciates daylight and then she goes on from there and when she is eighty godwilling some day write she will be making a different kind of story picking out things that matter in more subtle ways that other people may not notice because of the historical contact because of her her more lived experience that she brings to that story writes o the things that become salient the things you learn how to notice and build a story out of are developmental and there learned a cross time but the basic fundamental processes around the emotions are always driving the need to make the story and just to come back answering what you said before i think we have this incredibly complex dynamic set of basic commotions whatever you want to call them physiological states that we share with other organisms that are physically action programs that teach you run away from this writ move toward that a eat this do not eat that right but those things inhuman and to a lesser degree in other in other animals become the fodder for not just action programs in the moment but ideas that transcend time ideas that become the narratives of the stuff of beliefs of values of a of identities a those more ethereal essences of us that are conjured entirely by us cultural spaces are fundamentally grounded into are ability to experience the world in a real physical embodied sense but but elaborated far beyond t it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the robotics that i need for got health our got is very important is populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the mean system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those robotics an athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptegins vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste crime if you to tryathletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road an the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitamin d three k two again that is athletic green stock calm slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin three k to i started off studying the visual system and i do not want this to turn into a discussion about the visual system but individual system we know that there is a what is called the hierarchical organization where the eye in cods and can respond to edges and light verses dark in red green blue and from that very basic set of building blocks there is an elaboration or a build up of what is really called the iceberg model that was developed by my scientific great grandparents avid huwon' torts the weasel who one the noble prize for that work where you can look at somebody is face and recognize it or see a profile moving at in particular direction and still recon nice that person or see a word written in and conventionalize in your mind's eye what that word bird actually looks parakeet blue parakeet in other word there is a hierarchical build up and what you are describing sounds somewhat similar that there is a hierarchical organization whereby through development we we first learn i guess earlier i call them primitives but basic building blocks of no when some one steps on my foot at harts can hurt a lot or a little ten any on who stepped on my foot whether i have a shoe on douser learning contact but it that there is a build up on top of the basic somatic experience of different examples that map to pain including emotional pain and physical pain because we know those are intergegitated somewhat and that over time this builds up that we have you will countless examples but you add it you said something else that is that goes beyond the the hierarchical organization tat we seen the visual system which is that when there is a narrative or a story that we have to add it changes something about the representation of emotion ism ism struck by this by this ism comparison between seeing somebody step off a curb and break their ankle even as ism described just a flying angle ouch yet i real you look it wat you do it your face into a party a have broke my i broken my left foot five times coming up doing the same sport and just i can still here and feel the thing going at mean six months in a cast or whatever it is verses a story you have seeing somebody sitting alone in a came writing in their journal and then you learning that they just lost their spouse of seventy five years it two fundamentally different visual images the emotion could perhaps be the same ah yes that is rough and yet the need to impose story yes chit changes do i understand that curly that there is something not just more an developmentally mature about adding in story and adding context but that when we have to do that that there is something that is fundamentally different about how the emotions are mapped in the brain it i guess the perhaps the the ante from looking for is what did you see in brain scanning experiments we are somebody views a simply a physical break of a somebody him verses somebody has to add story is there is something that an that comes out in the subtraction of one from the other that tells us oh a ha whole set of brain that works that are not just about saying ouch yes but that have to do with the need to contra up story in what one of those brain areas and the perhaps we can we can yet de digecthos a little bit yes and actually that is exactly what we found a whole system of brain areas that that did this which now many people have described and were still trying to understand the full role of these networks but i these regions together are called in the literature the called default mode network right because they were these did the activation of these characteristic regions of the brain which are in the back middle of the head and some characteristic regions on the lateral bridal and am those were first described i in your imaging experiment wear people were asked to just rest right rest and relax something about anything just clear your mind for a few minutes trite this is mark as racial on his colleagues back and two thousand one am and then and then contrasting that with i i tasks when people have to do something very attention focus requiring for you really have to work hart and think and they found that these highly metabolic characteristic regions of the brain wore coming on mine and activating themselves when the person was resting and deactivating and d e coupling from one another not talking back and forth in exchanging signal very much am when someone was doing a really effortful mental task and that was a real conundrum for a long time and what we now know is when you ask somebody to think about nothing or rest now for a few minutes you are long in the skin of thing thing abbot nothing other nothing and then you start day dreaming about all manner of stories you start to imagine yourself into the future her am when in none big to i or as my grandmother's birthday next we i wonder if should to go along for if she would rather have flowers you you are imagining other people's mind states you are thinking i madam it were or i wonder if i should young change jobs you knowhow are thinking about all kinds of possible spaces that do not actually physically exists in the real here and now and and what we found is that are our findings were i think some of the first if not the first to to a actively demonstrate and increase in activation in these default mode systems not a decoupling of them but an activation of them when we ask somebody to do an effortful mental task and what was the task asking people how do you feel about this story which involves a lot of imposing of cultural and social an convectional knowledge to be able to appreciate the story of the give sitting in the came writing in his journal ah who lost this spouse of seventy five years you have to know a lot to be able to appreciate how he must be feeling how does it make you feel whet me pull up a lot of relevant knowledge personal experiences and memories and then hypothesized generate some kind of a narrative some kind of story line that would accommodate his situation and allow me to infer those kinds of stories which are very different from you are somebody stepping off the curb how look at that ankle right it is very obvious how you should ow that makes the person feeling how you should feel about that you do not really needs to bring a whole lot of cultural knowledge about their you personal history with their spouse to ye all understand that is breaking your ankle hearts right and what we found is that it was those kinds of stories where people had to bring a lot of contextual knowledge to fully appreciate that activated these default mode systems thispout the losing of the spooning of the spots what we later showed in a series of experiments a contrasting as true stories that are meant to induce admiration for skill right something physically skilful some it can or cogitable skilful ndmemorizea rubric's club and solve it with your eyes closed right or do flips on your bicycle and land on a railroad tie right these incredibly skilful things a as compared to i i the same kind of basic emotion in the sense of feeling inspired a attracted to it it is pleasurable it is really cool you wish you could do that too but now it is about a state of that persons mind or quality of character or disposition of self talking about the incredibly brave a actions of mulla in packastand standing up to the pat to the to the tolly bottom right where it is not about how well she walks down the street holding her school book there is nothing really physically skilful to see there it is about the conditions under which she is doing it and what you can infer about her state of mind and her quality of character to be engaging in these actions under those conditions and those complex kinds of inferences we found a activate these defaultmode systems uniquely in effect we can in trial by trial experiments literally depending on what you say about a story whether it inspires you that particular story out of fifty right in a two hour interview beforehand if you are inspired by a particular story as compared to another on rich may not resinate with you right then when we put you in the amariskanner we can predict that you will actually activate these naval systems differentially based on your psychological reaction in the interview we can actually show that there are systematic ways in which these large scale networks did the brain the way in which the brains kind of balancing its activity in its cross talk around the different parts that are contributing different kinds of processing those dynamic balances are are different when some one is what were doing what we are calling out transcending the situation of that person right and starting to learn something bigger about what it all means or what the story is or the the broader reason why this inspires me and not just is about her right you can look at mulla and you can say oh i i i hope she makes it that is that is that is really unfair and i an right or you can look at her inspan can say this to us and experiments with than ages but wait a minute and they actually wait they cover their face they close their eyes they look away from the from the mall of it yo and thy look at the plain ceiling and we can actually get covers with the volume off to identify these periods of time and say that when they come back from that pass their speechless their their postures closes read thy put their hands down that kind of thing they do not gesture right and when they come back from that they are talking about two things they are talking about the broader inferential narrative around what all this means wait i did not know not everybody n the world does not get to go to scan gets to go to school that is not right right and and these ethical interpretations that is not right and the third thing that comes up is a feeling of self and what it means for you because you are using your own self and consciousness is a kind of springboard a trampling we said before to try to appreciate what it must be to be her the next thing people say to us or did say to us especially as it makes me realize that i go to school all the time and i cine t take it for granted and maybe i should work bastards try to do something about that for other people we have this incredible confluence in the brain and mind this laying of of of real physical actions and things that happen that you can directly observe with the visual i system in the world and the you impose upon those a a desire to construct a story or meaning and you elaborate that meaning and in doing you also ramp of the internal sense of self awareness of me being me of conscious systems such systems as support consciousness in the brain and brain stay very basic things we sure with alligators right that become that kind of inspired state of wait it makes me want to do more for the world or it makes me inspired to know there are people her or she gives me hope for humanity one can told me right we have got this incredible dynamic layering of the feeling of the body the real physical body the observation and sensation perception of the world around us in of physical real or social real sense and than the elaboration of that into these cultural narrative that become feeling states and where valance kinds of disappears right it does not matter much any more whether it is painful or pleasurable it is more about dent means something ism suffering because it is helping some one else right in it becomes something desirable even though it hurts me right otherwise none of us would go through chiller and it is that meaning process that makes us really uniquely human and that is the development of these emotions over time i think incredible if ism understanding correctly there say feeling state in our body when we experience i or observe somebody in in their own feeling state or experience i it may be the same as theirs might be different and frankly s antral scientists ism going to say will never know exactly it we will not no an old the isophical ten we won i ten woman fusee blow is at the same things i variance i probably not baste on from my knowledge of color vision and the distribution of cones to explain why ism saying that the distribution of cone photofigments in your eye in my eye are extremely different ah to the point where we are not working with the same palate and i think that makes we mates li interesting but i but assuming that neither of us is color blind red is similar enough to both of us that we both look at and say that is rest but one and eighty mails is regain color blind would look at it and would see what you and i call red and call it orange in any event when we let us a listen to or watch and listen to marauder king we your classic i have a dream stanch i or when i hear certain music that i first heard when i was fourteen as particularly interesting for me time in my life in parks i was fourteen and we will get back to that and were again ma ta a fortis t thing i to at a essence it it'll just say it'll go on record saying that the i thing that the music that we listen to in our adolescence in teen years is one of the main ways in which we come to recognize the extremes of these feeling state tablets that you are describing i can one of the ways i prepare for podcast is i is to walk in and for my solo podcast is to walk and go through some of the narrative my neighbors thin come crazy mum but that is what k i think they are crazy too be the as fright a that is right ad exactly and but i i always know what music to listen to before i do a so podcast depending on the state that i happen to be in driving into the studio very is the one i need to be in in order to the deliver that particular material and i know because i it is almost knowing what pallid of colors and emotional colors i have in me at the moment and which one are going to be required deliver that material am because it it is different depending on on the topic a matter for that episode what ism referring to here is is this idea that you ka we we come to understand emotions through our own experience and how observing other people and listening to certain music can influence that and i i realize that some people probably have more of a buffer between there am experience of the outside world called exteroceptor seem things outside us am and there internal landscape u some people i realize have very little narrative distancing in fact live with some one who has very little narrative distancing when she watches a move if the person gets punched yes she dis she she fences if it is a happy move she gets happy if somebody in a move is sad she really feels in for a while i though goodness keno this is really seems a little extreme but i have talked to professionals about this and it is something call lack of narrative distance i inspiration it is another way to say yet being transported by a story right and and i think that it is it has its adapted utility ism not being critical i think that is an incredibly interesting aspect to ourself some of us i have a lot more narrative distancing especially with violence and i i think that is because i grope round a lot more violence than she did and i see somebody get beheaded and a felt and i and i unless it is something where have really been built in to the story of that person and it was a real world thing that i knew actually happened than i i just come to go oke what is a move and hits a move it is not real and if it is a move about something that is real that might be a lo bit more of an emotional impact and of course if it is a documentary and it is real footage it is pretty rough ye but i do not ism not horrified in the in the way that she is horrified and ism horrified but not to the same extent obviously that some of us have more of a buffer than others and you can see this in a move or in a classroomful of kids watching a a speech the eye of a dream speech or hearing the roseaparts story or for instance or listening we to and watching a avid login social mediopost ism a avid earlier because your son had a question for me about avid logan than i happened to u have the good fortune of of having met and know a little bit i do not know m very well but i know am in from some unperson a interactions and he is every bit as intense and every bit as serious about his on going progression as he appears to be that there is there is no falsehood there it is one hundred per cent date a fact dangling he does what he claims to do am more yum that we do not hear about superimposes of human being when we see something a avid yogin's post or we watch and listen to that i have a dream speech and we start to feel something ye we we are feeling inspired to use the the basic language are we mapping to some subconscious a awareness of that in ourselves meaning are we mapping to sometime when we felt inspired in another circumstance or are we really you knows is this merely kind of a return to a feeling state that we have to recognize i do not no the experiments have ever been done on this but is there anyway to to determine whether or not we can to fly have novel emotions past age fifteen or we really dis relearning or that nor he's really just doing a sort of templet matching of while ism feeling this again and an this makes me feel capable a new out n run today even though i was going easily not run to day mum or it is possible to have a a fantasy view about how the world could be in terms of am equality that a an opportunity and you what i that is subconsciously as my brain saying i remember when i was sexton and i did not know the difference between some people having opportunity and other people not having out a is that what is happening or do you think that we are more sophisticated than that and we are actually really a responding to what we think were responding to oh was there is latten there am a a couple a couple of things to starts the the first thing i was thinking before when you are tong about the visual was tom which i think it is relevant now am is is that as humans the more developed we got the more experience we have the more am we have adapted to the contexts in which we live the real physical context in this case the visual context included m be but also the cultural values of that context the things we have noticed other people notes right how do you learn when you are living in the jungle that on you see eyeballs you should yet i hope g stand next your mamma right a you learn what to notice you learn what what you need to attend to in the world and your when we are perceiving things either very basic things a visual scene or hugely complex elaborate things a martin lather kings speech we are as much imposing on to the world our own expectations of what is there as we are perceiving what is actually there right as we impose on to the world we bring what you might call our cultural ways of scene and knowing ore values and beliefs and we push them on to the experience of what we notice even in very basic ways things cultural values a change the way in which people observe and remember scenes rights there's classic work by chinobucitiama and other people showing that in japan verses in a in the us a when you show people a scene of a you know like an underwater scene with all the beautiful thingsthatreunder water rocks and plants and things in little fish slumming by and then one big fish slamming by right and you ask a japan's person a what is as a picture of they tend to talk about it is a scene of rocks and plans and little fish and tan a big fish swims by a if you ask in america a a western educated person what is this picture of they say oh it is a fish swimming through a scene right we we tend to notice first and you c he is shown that this is is very very automatic it is very low level it it is perceptive not just conceptacle and it actually changes what people actually notice in the scene and what they remember later and all that kind of stuff right we learn how to sort of filter limpet we are not little a robots or little a a vidiocameras walking around observing the world and when we see something as complex as a social story we impose on to that all kinds of personal experiences you said are we ever able to experience new emotions after each fifteen i think no but we are very well able to experience new feelings right which are the complex elaborations of these physiological states and the stories we tell ourselves about the meaning behind them that is developing all the time and it is developing through all kinds of quoting quocognitive media we do it through our science right by being inspired and interested in something by being in awe of something we do it through art through trying to express an emotion or a feeling or a value state through the way in which we portray something to other people right as humans we are driven i mean even as cave people we were driven to say i was here here is my hand plant ism in a spit it on to a rock forevermore anybody else comes an nearest can to see that it was me who was here and i have a me right and what were really doing is moving through the world not in this kind of receptive passive way but we are actively imposing ourselves on to the world were actively bringing are interpretive power and adapting what we do next relative to the way in which we accommodate rid page talked about this a hundred years ago accommodate or assimilate those things into us that we that that may disagree with our schema that may ah that may a line and accord and reenforce them this matters a lot for the ways that humans experience the world more broadly because think about for example am a terrible topic genocide or the holocostrate how does something that happen right how is it that people who have empathy who who love their family who love their neighbors can suddenly turn on each other right what is happened is they have shifted the way in which they narrative the context of those events the way in which they impose interpretation on somebody ease's pain has beenfundamentally shifted from that is another human suffering to that is not a human that is a a rat a pig a bug and whatever it is right and that dehumanization process allows us to shift our stories set that we bring another set of values and beliefs into the space am i just as i ism glad that you have brought up that ark example because my understanding from my psychology courses and university were that ism as much as we would all to think that we are incapable of being the committees of gene capable that their studies ben that were done in the fifties but then have been repeated over many decades showing that i uncertain contacts am essentially everybody in anybody would respond to a an authoritarian figure and torture somebody else and an ism sure as people are listening to us this their thinking no i would absolutely not do that but all the data point to the fact that if the conditions were set in a particular way i you and i and everybody else most certainly would a very ere idea that i goes back to i think young idea that we have all things inside of us and we certainly have all the natural circuitry components inside of us for ism rage and contempt in and horriblemis treatment of others as well as all the good stuff am a but i ism just glad that you brought up this example because i i think that for a lot of people it is its inconceivable but have never heard it framed the way that your describing it which is that if the story becomes not about the other person suffering but primarily about one's own story of suffering and that can suppress or literally inhibit the marry circuits that invoke empathy a then it makes perfectly good our biological sense as to why that would at least be possible and of course i do not think it is a good thing it is just i many aspects of our biology and psychology just happens to be the way things are it is an i think it really i think i mean ism the ever the optimist ism also ever the educator i i i know ism a teacher ism very also very interested in the ways that we design educational experiences for young people i think the only hope we have to protect ourselves against these possibilities is to system magically develop dispositions in ourselves proclivities within ourselves to question our own motives and to deconstruct our own assumptions about situations and to engage with other people's perspectives systematically and when we develop those dispositions the hope is that we are developing within ourselves a kind of a a a veto system right a system for checking our own motivations against other people's experiences of those motivations and much of what is leading i think though now are going in another direction and a kind o of political direction but much what is leading us in to these very decisive political types for example not just and the rise of authoritarianism not just in the us or the thread of it not just in the us but around many places in the world all of which by the way are western educated a a is that we are taught that to know something means you own something in yourselves and then you take that with you and you impose it on the world forevermore i know how to do of to redo and i can do it whenever you some kind of thing and that is what i good student is where when people in learn to engage with their own knowledge states in in more curious open minded flexible ways then we dispositionally teach ourselves to to check are assumptions to we think what we think we know and in this is see develop mentally to notice when we need to do that and when we should just plough had its totally fine and and what we are doing i think right now to ourselves both in the education system and in things social media is were re enforcing our own braces by diving down habit holes where you we hear the same thing over and over again that we enforces your own belief systems and then you come to believe those things and those put you on a train toward a particular kind of action or belief system that never becomes deconstructed and is very comfortable it is easy to do but the responsibility i think we have as individuals and as groups as humans given the amazing intelligence we have is to rise above that and actually look back on our own selves reflectively and deconstruct our preferences deconstruct our values and our beliefs and systematically quarry them specifically around how they impact or influence or or or change the situations of those around us or do not right the situations and sustainability of the world that supports us or do not and it it all comes back to the emotions that drive our thinking we have these very basic primitive physiological states which vary across individuals the degree to which they are incredibly powerful easily evoked first is not there is a lot of range in that all of that variation makes things interesting right a but it is our ability to learn to experience those and to no it develop wisdom around when we need to quarry our own emotions and deconstruct the narratives that are that we are using to validate or substantiate those kinds of emotions in order to assess whether we actually are right whether we should continue or whether we should step back and and and and and refrain right and that kind of mental flexibility really comes out of an emotional disposition it it is our ability it takes it back to what you are asking at the very beginning it is our ability to not just drive from what feels the bottom up which of course is always starting on the top down because you have got some interpretation of the world that makes you feel fear that makes your both do this that makes you get a but also to be able to rise above to transcend and think about what are the broader systemic historical i a ethical civic implications of this narrative on telling myself which feels the fault the truth and how might i deconstruct those systematically and how might i invite others to give me their version of those events and engage with those systematically in order to be able to really appreciate the implications of my beliefs and the bottom line is that the emotions that were talking about to day are actually the fundamental drivers of all of our thinking decision making relationship building right our community lives and our personal well being all in one mix but that does not kind of excuse us for acting on their bequest it actually imbue us with a responsibility to then develop dispositions to systematically query those and frame them when they are not serving us her the world well exactly what you said a as much that you a ism a believer in following lots of different types of social media accounts yet have taken some heat here and there because people automatically assume that if you follow an account that you subscribe to that ideology but i follow many accounts to my disagree with what they say specifically that i can learn different perspective as far as i know were the same species mean these other people yes o ours we are sometimes i wonder but they pray one of they wane i many i wonder to and there is enormous range in in in those o those accounts that i follow am in i followed different counts for from reason some for entertainment some for information some for challenging myself some for a my desire to be baffled every now and again but to always return to this idea that we are all we are all basically working with the same building blocks of neurons and neral chemistry some people's dopamine which whether not you are into bit coin or a neturetitional currency a the one true currency that universal is dope everyone is work a id opening and exchanging their own opening with world experiences but there is one o the reason why thing it is important to a not be slide in one's thinking or exposure to different things on social media a somewhat controversial statement actually because i think aloud ye will assume that if you follow somebody from a particular political party that that means that you vote that political party et camera am u that to me always seem crania i am fortunate have is a good friend who is on this pod last rick rupees of extremely accomplish music producer in instead produce must from essentially every honor of music pongeracos our serve i got my start and still love ponkrouf music much but classical and hippo an everything in between a rica somebody who forges broadly i severally learned to try in forage broadly in terms of ideas and ideology and i think lodge were just scared to be exposed to something that they hate much becausethey do not that feeling in their body of of disagreement am but i at is not its ye very you know that kind of cognitive fishnets phicodus very difficult it takes work to rest all that ye i i guess it is the i to think there is a way to step back from that and observe it not from a disconnected stance but from a place of curiosity about what is driving the those mechanisms and people and and may be where we need to adjust our thinking may be not to adopt their mode of thinking one hundred per cent i ten per cent or two per cent i think one of the the reasons things are decisive right now is because of social media and the soloing or of of conorchard very divergent trajectories of people only following and listening to an obeying certain kinds of information and other people the other and i think the pandemic is the place were all that re my clashed very heavily man continues to clash another areas to certainly not something is going to be solved a inside of this conversation and yet i do have a question that that grows from thisaspect of our discussion which is you what do you think can be done at a concrete level in terms of education of younger people as well as education of people who are out of high school and and beyond to a trying adopt these were encompassing modes of of learning and experiencing the world i mean it is one thing to say expose yourself to lots of different ideas it is another to to understand how to how to do that on a way that that is adaptive and any ideas you have i think i do in and the audience would really appreciate an and feel free to to make this an editorial u what ere mat i act to date i mean obviously this is your weal houses this is your expert y ism curious what which we do should should i send my family members who have very divergent political beliefs from me information to the to the contrary they're thinking or what would i do and whet oat you for me what shall we all be doing with our ten year old and or i in ourselves well i will not i will not commit on should you send your family members your if i there is other people ha do that a the the the tat work and they know how to always frusta she that overran us is it is o cacankany red now we can we all lo each other and but one thing i really do think a lot about and this is the way in which we educate our young people might we do without ten year els a and the the first thing it'll say about your time i all i do not if you a shall have thing let but is a is is query them about their beliefs when they follow something when they think something is impressive or bad ore ask them why teach them to unpacked their own beliefs that does not mean that you that yo do not still hold them necessarily it does not mean that you adopt the opposite belief right if i talk to someone who has a very different value system than i do and i disagree with them that is legitimate but to it also but but in deciding that i disagree i have sort of we visited my own belief and queried it have have externalized it a little bit made that thinking visible as byway we talk about it in education that is avid perking that caravan talks better that way you no making you are thinking visible and then examining that thinking and and i think one really important stay that as society will have to take or we will not make it and i know that sounds a little em dramatic but i actually think it is true sadly ah and ism stare to think it is more in torture is that we need to really get brave about how we think about the process of educating our young people and what it actually means to expose young people to develop mentally appropriate age appropriate opportunities to grow themselves as thinkers as individuals and as civic agents and community members i think that our western designed education system has in it some very basic beliefs about what counts as knowing and what is worth thinking about and knowing about and how do i know that how do i test you on that that i think is deeply they are deeply problematic and read us i mean i know this is a strong statement but they lead us to a place where we are we are actively punished not just not encouraged but i would say actively discouraged from really playing with ideas engaging systematically with our own beliefs deconstructing those beliefs and engaging with complex perspectives on topics and ideas that is just not what school is about and it needs to be we need to shit right now the way in which we think about school is about is basically judged by quote on quote learning outcomes right what have you learned and how do we know that we make you demonstrated by yourself undermine pressure in a particular septic right or you are onto come back and ism going to give you a question and you are going o go be the answer i had not mind and if you do that in time then it'll say you learn it and now we are done check right as compared to a system and there are educational systems this this is not a there are people for example the performance a assessment contortion in new york city is is a contortion of public schools some of which do this extraordinarily well they have a a dispensation from the new york state government a not to give the regency examine as their graduation requirements a and there a and and their there mark benchmarks of learning but instead to have alternative ways of accessing kids work kids work for months to years depending on the project on these indents intellectual mufti disciplinary projects where they explore a topic and they engage with their own process of learning about that topic and they bring in teachers and community experts and other people in they present their work and then they quarry the work and they talk about their own learning process in what could happen next and what decisions they made and always gangentexactly you have to invent not just the work but the question you need to look at the world and notice what it is we are not understanding that we would benefit from understanding and find away to isolate and systematically query that why do not we build education systems from are school all the way up that and that engage people systematically in that kind of intellectual curiosity we do not do that we we know that little kid's education are school education if you do not have the water table on the sand table on the cool stuff and the choices and the ways to engage with each other and you do not even all the stuff being really age appropriate for three year old to touch and smushon in it'll try to taste in whatever else they are going to be mess on the footman snuck on a commie's going to refuse to come to school right an there can be laying in the in the doorway throwing kit temperateness but as we know how to do little kid education while don't mean the always do it but we know that they need to be intrigued they need to be invited to think and they bring their natural curiosity and then you expand the range of ways they can leverage that curiosity to discover new things they had not known to think about before right then we get to the standard con cost educational system and we somehow think that that natural human proclivity to engage curiously and meaningfully with deep thinking about ideas an the world is is inefficient and inappropriate and frightening and we teach kids no no no no no turn that off it is it is it is dangerous if you do it it is considered insubordinate right and what we want you instead to do is just let me give you what have already figured out for you ism going to give it to you and you are going to give it back to me it seems to me that in the way things actually happen in school what is created is the kind of desire for the kid to be a computer not a human and they do have a demean system an last what becomes the the buzz the emotional buzz is performance yes if it becomes the buzz at all for the kids that do not get that buzz from performance they do not i that do not intrinsically love the math or the english or the books that they are being presented with or or whatever the subject happens to be i or maybe the only one or two things then they emotionally dissociate from the rest of the material ism i mash describing a bit of myself and high show i was not it i barely finished high school i dropped out o six grave for a few months yet then work me yo yon oventionaly got back to it and and as i imagine you did to i s we ended up as academics but i think what you are describing is key u and i never thought about it from the perspective of oh yes young kids that were given all the things that are going to drive our sensory world in the appropriate ways touch and sound and at a mind via an lying a build meaning in our mind and that we get to as students young very young learners impose some of our own i intrinsic motivation to do certain things and not others and that that is not supported as we are adult what you are describing is will what age do you think this cliffs off you case in are school kids are allowed to do this an kindergarten they are allowed yo first grate they areallowed to do it into in most schools but at what point to kit is the expectation imposed on kids to become little wrote learning computer machines and to get their dob mean from u performance rather from intrinsic pleasure and when they are learn a thinking about you and also how do we address this issue that there are certain basic skills that not every man is going to perform well at and for the kid that says i do not math we as still have you'll learn it what you main to appreciate how do you no how do you conjure up in a a joy or an appreciation in that kid i man seems i gan a hard thing i mean i eventually set myself along a academic tour rectory to that worked out but that was initially just out of pure fear because my life was was really bad i made circumstances in myself made it bad and i was rescuing myself from basis of becoming more of a loser is case schools the thing and i i school andthat was that was the turn hardright into into academics for me but what you do for the person who of really does not math because they are struggling with it or does not biology psychology and how do we how do we evoke a at least an appreciation for that of it sounds the emotion system is the key system to leverage in order to learn and and could you talk about the relationship between emotion and learning cause i realize this is really that the wanna of what what you do i mean you could say at this way right whatever you are having emotion about is what you are thinking about and whatever you are thinking about you could hope to learn about remember something from right understand differently the key question for educators is what everybody's always having some kind of emotions all the time if unlessyou are dead right or unconscious what are people's emotions about in this space if the emotions because whatever those emotions about that is what you are learning about of the emotions are about the out comes did i get it right among the flock and did an they play himself smart see to did wit any one of those right if those are the main drivers then that is what you are learning about if the emotions are about the actual ideas in play the math the physics tho why does the ball roll down the ramp wait a minute that is the same as why the moon goes around a you don't it mean there are right when the emotions are about ideas then what you are engaging with is learning about ideas and what i would argue is that in setting up the kind of accountability system we ha have we have taught people that they are e motion should be about these high stakes accountability measures which means that is what we are learning how to think about perform perform not how to think about the ideas not the intrinsic power of using math to understand the world in a different why how do you engage kids right you engage kids by setting out which problem spaces that in problems that invite them to try to engage with something that piques your curiosity that is meaningful to them or have them bring in what the kid really ate it what is it that you do find interesting kid wrist start there start there and start using your your academic skills in a way that will give you power to do what it is your interested in doing that is the way in use your writing use your math use your persuasive argument skills use your film making skills whatever it is to tell the story of something that u find deeply meaningly powerful to understand and all the sudden you need the math kid's actually say things that there is this lovely em there is this lovely a a long quote from a from a sun's emigrant kid in it one of these new york schools ah with the performance assessments am a in a in an article i wrote with a calling dug connect am the the article is called building meaning builds team's brain tho confined its end in educational leadership there is a big long quote from this kingpin and he is basically explaining what math class meant to him which he had never passed a mouth class before and he says ye got this problem called walking to the door which is basilyzenofs paradox that you get half way to the for half way to the for halfway the you ever get to the door why or why not wright and they spent months learning the math that would help them get at that problem and he talks about how i had a problem he says and i had to learn fractions i had to in order to be able to solve the problem i had and as i engaged with fractions and that problem i got fascinated he says by finite and infinite and these ideas we are driving my need to learn to do fractions right we have got the cart before the horse am not saying you do not have to learn math or you do not have to learn to read a writer or or do all these other kinds of skills but we make those which is in the horse's cart know what is in the cart we call that the the trick of the education system any aim of it when in fact it is the quality of the horse can that horse call the thing right that is the development of the person and what they put in their cart then serves that development it is the talked of ways of knowing an understanding that come with you as you move into the world but this takes real real developmental skill on the part of educators right who are not supported or or or resource or train to think about development in these ways and means you asked when does is fall off it really depends in what school system you are and in what demographic you are when it falls off but for almost everybody except for the privilege few a who are in very progressive alternative schools it falls off by adolescence which is when school get serious and is also ironically wen develop mentally kids are developing the curl capacity and the psych of social capacity and the drive to in fur complex narrative meaning from the things they are doing these are not just my shoes these are a statement about what i believe about sustain ability and about sports and about adults and counter culture at right and as we grow into a space s where we are driven to try to challenge and think about big meanings and gage with perspectives and emotions and social issues and broad important existential questions be they in physics or be they in art or be they in the social civic domain right what do we do we double down controlling the in it and the output transactional mechanisms that count as quote on quote academic rigor and achievement right we start to ask he's what is the name of the the the servant who shows up in the scene and an in great expectations right as it molly or is it marine a right and it is you are who the heck not and that is not the point of leading great expectations right we take away because we are afraid as educators as society we have got this narrative around young peoples and a particular but every ones propensity to build and construct meaning in these spaces and self in these spaces that agency frightens us because we are worried they arguing to take risks they are gong to do something stupid day going a they are going to fall off the track they are going to not make it in the traditional system and in trying to protect them and shield them from their own curiosities their own dispositions for meaning making we i would argue actually stunt their ability to grow themselves to the point where we have mental health crises literally crises in in mental healthright now and adolescence a cross demographic groups is especially bad in young girls as in yet yes that is right but but but tat is everybody and it is worse than girls yes we do not fully understand why that is am i get som i in a suggestions i what we are really doing is actually producing people who are guided of their own inner drive to become someone who thinks powerfully in the space of the world we are frightened to let our young people have that power which is the role of adults is to rap around young people and help them learn to to be reflective to systematic to be rigorous with themselves as they de help the capacities and dispositions to deconstruct their own beliefs to deconstruct their own aims and goals and the ways they understand the world and to rebuild them iteratively over and over in this in this serintellectually humble curious way where were constantly querying ourselves constantly quaking other people where we are willing to sit with uncertainty in complex problem spaces and think through the possibilities rather than settle quickly on to one solution what does school expect you to do settle immediately on to one solution which by the was the solution i arty had in mind when i gave you the question i as compared to sitting with young people and allowing them the in safe and appropriate ways the space in which to actually grapple with complex powerful questions when kids develop the proclivities to do that they learn how to manage those very human capacities that we have been talking about the whole time that can lead to in a terrible evil as well as amazing virtuousness they learn to appreciate and manage those capacities within their ourselves i think much of what we see in terms of these failure to launch examples are are cause i know some of these the children of friends em really really smart kids that did not map well to the system and therefore are not doing well really struggling and em clearly have the intellectual power it just was not served up to the a minute a school was not served up to them in a way the t yet at it says as much about the system as it does abut the get e i i teach a course it ism stamford to the medical students that every first your medical student takes about were science it is team taught it is a phenomenal cortical i because of the the range of expertise i in the teaching ism that comes through and one thing have noticed i is that the they are all phenomenal teachers i but the best instructors ism do two things simultaneously when they teach a first of all they come to the table with incredible expert these obviously you a these are lead an a and wit yo hying to get at if you want people to engage them ideas yet they are true luminaries in their respective fields a diction pain a memory i every system of the of the the to body and brain that release the nervous system is taught in this course but that have noticed every once in a while that i there is a subset of them that as they teach from that position of expert time not only are they clear not only are they engaging not only are their slides i sparse enough to understand but rich enough to include all the relevant detail but they also flip back and forth i from the position of expert to the position of novice learning it for the first time not allow that intellectual curiosity that their keeping a lot they have this disposition we are talking about activating sit i e o no a pleased to as academics were familiar with that right the i ins are up her a and and the can gave of academics interrupting me is it is a sign of interest i dot carol the carol deck was the one that a o gas is right and she is right carictera is right i the great carrell took and am but have seen this especial that there are some topics that i yo i to think that ism i might do this reflectively for because for incase i i start often neral development and i adore the topic i cannot teach neral development without being completely blown away in the positive sense of how brain develop ye i still never caught o the to i on a podcast on it because it intends to require visuals and we do not use those an in the because the podcast must people listen to the podcast em but maybe it'll do something just for you to but some point but the i think it is the the same experience occurs when i see somebody a doctor shah wacky who runs our our pain clinic et afford teach about pain in the systems of the body that relate to pain and emotion and how to cure certain forms of pain et camera treat pain it is he is he is clearly the world expert but the way he describes a system you can tell he is he is learning it again for the first time in parallels all that and i feel that em ignites the emotional systems of the learners brain in such a powerful way that is distinct from just hearing an expert talk about something he is not relaying he is not a squirrel with not an giving all the nuts to the kits he is inventing the knowledge in fun of that right that is a great way to put it as usual others are more succinct and collecting my ideas then and expressing them than i am i think that is it that is a powerful thing i went to a high school that is a has a kind of a split reputation it is it is known as being one of the best public high schools in the country it is also the high school that at least for a while and one of the high suicide writes in the country i as written up in very i newspapers an a and on and much that nowadays they forbid the kids there from meeting a more than an hour before school to practice for the standardized test by the way when i was at school the only thing that school represented for me in high school was m something cane between breakfast and scapebording and a lot and frank that i was not in school a li and i do not recommend that kids go to school stay in school i i missed a lie i had ravelled all had a lot at all times of seaward things it'd a love of making up to do in and college em as a cons goes stand will get the basics but this actually where it'd to go you have a very interesting trajectory here are you university professor you mum study motion and learning and many other things across cultures an i adolescence an and and many other important topics but i you are not a story of of growing up in an economic family you grow p on a farm you man sort of gentleman's farm my dad was a surge and but we had animals and a farm and tried my parents tried to have us you now growing the things we ate you have had a number of different experiences that were tying out before we stare recording but but one of the things that you mention was getting am involved in education i where you works exposed to students of who had very different backgrounds in you maybe you just talk a little bit about ism to of the notes of your experience y you grow up on this farm and then maybe just hit some of the other notes and and thewless let us take a fore in to when you first got exposed to educating others yum and because i think that is an important backdrop for what what we have been talking about here an serves as a jumping off point for where it'd to go next it'll just u men i man it is always hard t his by yourself i do not know what is interesting and what is not i manse's me i i think what interesting as is knowing where y where you have been in things it that that marked that mapped back to your emotional yes a id networks in a way that for you feel that mattered interns of what you are doing now as a little kid i remember even as a little kid not liking school i was very good kid was very well behaved kid i went to a decent public school ism but just the whole idea of it i just always felt i had two left feet i ad never felt it was really me there i was always trying to escape a at and i mean and thinking about when i first tod educating others and my first memory of education others specifically that comes to mind is i was six and i went on a little vacation in the summer to stay with my cousins in pesky michigan ism which is a place on michigan where there are these ism stones where there is my understanding from what i was six is that there are these two hundred million year old fossilized worms in these stones and you can see him when you look at there little worms and you can see him yet i just was fascinated by these stones that these are actual fossilizes two hundred million year old worms and i do not off that numbers car that is what i remember from age six som some paliintoe said the con crew ism but i collected these stones and i went to the little local a exhibit they had at the library whatever and i learned about these stones and i brought some back and somehow somebody thought to ask me to teach my second grate class when i started school about these stones and i just remember ofmhow i got asked end to this but i remember standing in front of my class and talking about these stones and just looking around the room and suddenly noticing that feeling when you are lecturing and you think oh my god they are fascinated by what ism saying every kid is looking at me in o and i was commit right it'll keep going ill to yous more about these stones and i passed him around whatever and it must have been o k because i was then asked to give that talk oddly up to the fifth graters who are way older than me an wererasser a already fascinated by the natural world and able to make meaning out of something in a way that inspired other people if i can be blond us to say and yet i was constantly in trouble at school for not having my homework i was just the feeling of release on a fridge afternoon and the feeling of dread on sundae evening is hard to described and i went to a reasonably while resource school ism anyway fast forward up to one i was older i mean i i was just always fascinated by an i think some of his come for my mob to ism trying to y no speak different languages engage with people who are different than myself just have conversation from the time i was old enough to barely qualified to do these programs my parents had the the resources luckily to be able to let me to do these things but i i went off to france and stayed on a farm there for a summer and went to i yin ireland i went to rush by the some i was eighteen i was working to these little kids off the street and in camping with them in southern liberia and all these kinds of things when i was cold as they say in sierras gloomy and rainy and muddy and cold yes i ya liberia ways sound bleak oh i there's really many times to send me there o ya now that is the real threat i just beautiful in many ways but ism ye this the was sad it was a sad sad story ism anyway i i think what i was trying to do was actually learn by doing by being by engaging with other people who knew things i did not learning how to i build things ism was always really interested in ward working and boat building i went to mention spend eight months there as an undergraduate it documenting these traditional a construction in a northern c en constrict dow to i which a sale boats i sale a sale about construction when i do not no electricity haven in cabin to a cabinetry to me ha n the a i bulla furniture when people at very built furniture but they baby they simple the key of furniture t no or not a a old cabinets and andbuiltin bookshelves and furniture men is om my friends have pieces i made for them i a anything for myself sad o him i but ism i mean i think i was really torn between trying to build things and learn by engaging with other people and in these different cultural spaces being a woman in a cabinet in a cabinet shop an connective is is really not a cultural space that i had grown up and and then go you know i mean and yet right moving myself an change in myself to adapt these different situations somehow felt learning to me i think am and i ended up in a strange situation where i cut my hand i opening a window at a website and i needed to i was on workers cop and i had to take ism some time to let it heel and i could not run machinery i had to tor for what to do with myself and i was twenty three years old and i was not gotta g o back to my parents for more money it that i have to support myself i am i thought o k i i went to college at i his of all i fee lead school and i i i majored in french because i i could that is basically what i was i do not know it'd better finish i doter not flock i can dofranch i know id i know i speak french folly all to a french litteratremajer and done with a quickly then what am i going to do with myself i never thought i could be a scientists but i loved science i just won around taking a year of every science it to a year of astronomy and a year of biology and a year of physics and a year of am humananthropology palianthropology all these things psychology and realized wholly crap this is superinteresting you can study how babies think and and the natural world and then also i be be bringing sort of a scientific lens to bear that helps you understand things in a new way here i was as a a twenty threeyear old with a cot hand and i thoughtwht am i going to do with myself i convinced the massachusetsport of education that i ye i had the background knowledge to be able to i to to teach some sections of a p biology and physics that they had in there high school when i got to am i i finally got an interview with this public school district himself boson where they were desperate for a teacher ism noticing in the boson globe or two weeks into the school year and you still do not have a teacher and to a in one would take me and i you to manage to convince the mas sport of education i to give me provisional teacher serif ice ton bacon the car course work it'd done and how well i did in that course work protected i was really supermotivatede id extremely well in all that am and when i got there a they basely said when i shoot up for the interview i another the high school teacher wants to take those any classes can you just teach full time seventh grate suchlike of i i i had my full contagion of hundred and thirty kids ride seventhgraters come through classroom and a the middle school had just been shut down becausethere was not sufficient funding in the town forts they had taken the middleschool kits and push them into the high school space a what that basely meant is i suddenly found myself in a my a fully equipped high school classroom with microscopes and all kinds of scientific equipment that would be used to teach li later courses with my seventh graters and it also happened that the massachusetts board of education had changed the am the the requirements for for the way the organized science instruction and curriculum from seventh grad life science eight great physical science whatever was e different sciences each year they wanted an integrated in er jusplonary science all the way across and of course that was very difficult for the traditional science teachers to do because they would been teaching only biology or only or science are only physical science am for their whole career and they did not know how to teach the other subjects and here comes me would one intensive year of study in each of these domains i was perfectly situated to tried to pull it together some of the high school teachers helped me thank you to them am and i built out as a new operculum for seventh grate for that district around this inner disciplinary approach to science am together with other teachers was very hands on very and it was very much a was of concepts we would study neuwcler vision and atoms and reactions and then the sun and astronomy in the solar system and then and then how the the energy is being shined over in to the a under the planets and the the earth and then these organisms called plants are actually using those photons to do something chemical lets talk about photosynthesis and weren't outright and ten we can talk about chemical reactions and breaking down sugars and solecism brit we built this whole web corriculon that i was trying to help the kids appreciate the sort of dynamic complexity of the natural world and some of my professors from coral also sent me a materials and all kinds of foodstuff from the coral museum that that they did normally need in that i gave it back when i was down ripe with all these instructions when all the stuff is on dominant evolution and ashaleand handles and all kinds of stuff i built out a cricket around all this stuff and i realized to the first time that i was in this amazingly fascinating space because it just happened that the school i was working in was one of the most diverse culturally in the nation at that time i think we had something eighty one languages spoken out of eleven hundred kids swale that is a lot of first languages and kids were arriving from all over the world this was right after the randan seaside took ids were coming in from estafrica there were refuges from a cosivoan eastern rope there were kids coming in from jamaica there were kids coming and from had there were kids from malaria and a myanmar there were a there were kids landing in that class deer headlights from very very a broad ranges of cultural backgrounds and there landing in my science class and what i quickly realized is they were using these scientific ways of exploring the world and thinking about questions and and trying to a make sense of what they had witnessed to try to understand their own ourselves their own origin story their own place in the world why different people in this class looked and eat differently than me dress differently then me how is it that you look that and i look this and there was all this it crazy adolescent a turmoil layered into this space were kids were grabbing on to the scientific ways of knowing as i handle to try to make sense of who they are and those kid started asking questions of me it'll never forget this one girl the black girl raised her hand and all the other ears look in our papaya ask it ask it i i i she was being brave should talked about it before school i cop can't say that no don't i say it s and she said missimordino why is it that when we are studying homered evolution and you show us these this nova episode with early homeless in africa why do they always show those creatures looking that have sharkskin why do they always look black people and knows well because they are on the quarter and you need that love o melon in your skin to be able to adapt and live without getting skin cancer that space but and it opened up this amazing class discussion that actually went on ferments evolved into a whole curriculum that was biology it was culture of sociality where we started to really unpack the ways that we as humans are natural beings in the world and the ways in which our cultural experiences are extensions of our natural ways of adapting and that had me hooked i realize that that i could bring science write the science of adolescent development and of learning and of emotion and of culture too this very pressing real world's problem of how do we help are kids actually figure out who they are invent themselves in this increase crazy multicultural space and become scholars and intellectuals who engage systematic with the ideas along the way and i i took those ideas and i start of going to night school at harvardic session school to study ism cognitive narrow science and to study a language and cognition and in all these kinds of topics and and quickly realized i really needed this developmental perspective infusestraed i wanted to understand not just old to sings works but how they got that way and i took that back to grad school at warfare and began to study am i in o social and cultural an emotional and cognitive development in kids and ad and quickly they are also kind of hit a a wall where i was i went back to the school district in which i worked and i went back to the teachers who were my cholegues and i i worked with them and i observed their classes and i interviewed their students and we did all kinds of work around how kids were building scientific concepts in ways that reflected their cultural concepts and ways of approaching the world and i i quickly realized it seems to me that kids are doing all this meaning making and we as adults are doing all this i all the supportive you know meaning making were also engaging and growing and learning in ways that reflect not just you know knowledge bits little computers but also that reflect the biological subtract on which the learning and the thinking are happening and i wanted very much to understand how we could use and average developmental biology as a kind of a constraint to from which to appreciate the kinds of theoretical frames we were inventing in the in the real world to anthropological educational space the developmental psychological space how could these two systems i act as a vendiagram and how could the inner section between them the places where the theorizing about the natural behaviors and the wakekids were making meaning and learning and describing their knowledge and engaging with each other on the one hand and the ways in which the brain and the b biology are engaging in our supporting those processes on the other hand the places where those two circles would overlap that seemed to me that was where we could most a directly target to start to deeply understand the nature of our developmental psycho biological growth themselves and i set out to try to study about am the ways in which culture and sociality shape the brain ah and physiology and and survival mechanisms and development and at that time which was not even that long ago it is two decades ago quickly realize am very very little was known about the way in which emotions beyond things fear yet it'd flash of snake in your faces and you are mental alights upright i was thinking of something lotto more new ants do what i mean what on seeing happening in science class among a kid from cosovoin a kid from awandaas there trying to figure out why they understand how they look different right at those deeply emotional conversations they are having but they are not cut and dry as the things we had been studying and that is what really drove me to try to start to understand in an integrated way the way in which ore our biological development and our psychological development are actually sort of two sides of who we are and of how we are organizing ourselves to build capacity a mental capacity as well as sort of physical health and capacity over over the course of our lives as were engaging with living incredible am a story and foray into what sounds to me really a durability to identify how the universals among us the universal biological features the universal psychological features can really strongly in form specifically what is happening now in a class from interaction in the mind of an of a of you or somebody else or of any of us but to approacriite from the other direction in other words to take what is happening now and say why is what is happening now happening yeas o is it as and is actually happening underneath the sirs a a beheggo right as supposed to saying cat this is a this is the psychology character structure this is the biology of the hypothalamus but rather say is any one else really shocked about the a school shooting in shrill and go through the the feeling of shock and and go from there to the biology as a route of learning get and of course i do not want to take away anything from the real world seriousness of that yet but but it sounds to me you you saw that there that there is a different portal through which to teach and understand experiencing that we are all but especially young people are really tied to our emotional states as the as the mean filters i which we that just that and therefore make decisions and move through life an men i think it is key that early onumand if we a teacher oftentimes we the subject if we happen to fall in love with young figure for b in a paper gray an that is not is that is not how i went through graduate school i just was blown away by the fact that sperm meats egg you get a munch of self duplications and then and then you get a bring a brain the ye brain rid how does that have as ay and craze amazing and i w have lasted with a graduate adviser who literally told me this is outworks in my lab is what she said a she said we have everything you need here it'll help you if you need help but badly you are gin a messaroundal stuff you are knocking a burn down the lab you are nocking i kill your self with any of the poisonous stuff but then courlan mess stuff up and and do some stuffing in a figuresome stuff out this was literally the description and and i liked her lab because that green countertype and she had pictures of interesting animals on the wall and then she said and idea one two kids while you are in graduate schools am not can be round very much she got to figure it out on your own and i said cannot play the music i want she said sure and i said can i put tinfoil on the windows cause i want to be bothered and she said sure and all say oo ka this is the place for me in other words she gave me a room to explore of course she gave me a lot of guidance along the washes amazing amazing gradrviz arm extra extremely bless but it sounds to me the that identifying what is the what is really going on now is key and that the other thing that is key is in openness to ideas i mean earlier you talked about on of the its just less just admit where we are out rinowurnic we are in i culture war right now i were it is face now it is very decisive m and one of the major problems is that we cannot really talk about things i mean i think fear of getting canceled fear of exploring ideas is real it is very real not just for academics it is just real people are it is important to be sensitive to the experiences of others absolutely but if we cannot actually explore ideas and feel we can walk out of the room safely then we cannot really explore ideas and i think right now it is not just social media i think it is the fear of offending anybody an and probably the fear of a voicing how upset certain people are about their experiences or experiences of others whatever it is i i do not see a landscape right now where there is true open exploration of n ideas anywhereanywhere at least in this country what we do if there if the if at least two of the requirements are an emotional gripping of of something around the learning plus an openness to thinking about things that maybe we do not feel right to us as as a way to learn how to think something i think we both agree if i may that is really critical and that the world will be a far better place if people could do that in how do we navigate this landscape i mean it is what has to come first a a demonstration of the value of openness an that of ideas and here i i all just state my stateside i feel any idea should be opened to at least discussion any idea but then it needs to be systematically dissected with some rigor that people cannot just assume any idea is true your any as o me ye because just cause it is true for them ism and this i shall learned from my graduate adviser you sh used to say tolerance has to go both ways take when it comes to thinking about ideas and criticizing it cannot just be on right they are wrong or i do not tolerate that t has to be tolerance for all ideas and then you arrive at hopefully eventually for truths or at least for trajectories and what do you think could support this a how early should this start i mean should kids an elementary school be discussing the current landscape of politics and what they see from a place of what we talk about safe spaces but is a safe space one in which o no one gets offended where is a safe space one in which any idea can be discussed i think that is never really been defined for me that is a really fraud issue i mean first let me go back to something you said which i would have said it differently say you said our emotions are a filter right and they do act the filter but i actually do not think emotions are really filter alike much as they are the drives that are undergirding the impetus to think right they are pushing us to think about particular things and i think in as a scientist my dispose ton is always that to understand something is good and the more complexly the more thoroughly you can interrogate an understand something the better there is nothing ism afraid of knowing it and what you are really talking about their is the fear of knowing we why are people afraid to engage with each other basically because it is deeply threatening to reveal things about your own experience that are not he a land in us in us in a space where we can kind of collectively engage with them as legitimate experience that is the user the opposite of cancelling people right its the opposite of dismissing people it is actually developing spaces of trust where we can engage with ideas and and and take them from ourselves right that where they do not there no longer personal value judgments they become cultural means or or or or or models or scheme us that we can we can dissect together that we can engage with together and construct understanding around right and and i do not really understand my own position unless i also understand your opposition to my position even if i still disagree with you i think there are really important conversations going on rind it'll take it back to the education system because that is that is what i know what most about there are really important conversations going around on right now around refrain the experience and outcomes and aims of schooling around civic discourse and reasoning there is just a major report that was produced by the national academy of education and another academies a collaborating with it for example around this topic and helping us to move as a society toward a space where we learn to a kind of lay ideas out and develop skills for reasoning around those ideas including bringing ethical experiential emotional cultural values to bear but then being willing to deconstruct and engage with those ideas whether there the ones that are commenced and fluid with our experience or that appear to be a conflicting or disdisfluent with our experience we need to develop us a a spaces for young people especially but for every one in in to engage with the deconstruction of our own assumptions i said before and to engage with the with the deconstruction of others assumptions and to try to reconcile the building box and that is when we can build some common ground but we can also disagree we but we do not really understand our own position unless we appreciate some one ease's disagreement with our position unless we can actually articulate and appreciate how it is that persons opinion is opposed to mine i do not really understand mine it is such a drypoint one of the reasons why i do read all the comments on podcast on you to it takes me sometime but i do it or on social media is that a oftentimes it'll et a commenter criticism that makes it very clear that i was not clear about something other times it'll get a commenter criticism that makes it clear that my an the other person fundamentally disagree about something both of which are great and for a scientists a delight an keep coming i and of course one people agree and mum they agree and make it clear that they agree from a stance of understanding that of course is also gratifying it is exactly what you are saying and it is one to one of the upsides i think of social media which is that unless people block their comment section and i do occasionally block people if there being offensive to other people o talks the no era why am in eating people that is not inviting people into a conversation tat nit constructive i should have a rule which is i call it classroom rules i never announced it but i i allow for classroom rules you can swear but you cannot swear at people ye ism that is what i was taught in graduate school i that is wherever ye cannot swear at people thought s also o rule at home although we try not to swear its you can swear but tearing at people is not non of mum and that a certain decorum of is required in order to have open discourse that works for me i think that i it is been a while since have been in school but i work at a school and i think that hate ability to ism not just reinforce but challenge one's own stances which sometimes leads to reinforcing our own stands may it tolerable man that is legitimate i mean i have to assume that in high schools they still do debates and things that sort i mean a do they allow that i could you throw kids in a class and say let us debate ism something really controversial and then but you have to debate it from the other side i mean just as as a experiment of forcing the brain to mum try to be effective i forsake of winning but from the other perspective i or stance t seems a great exercise if i a i were a high school teacher that is the first thing i do o think them most controversial topic and then it'd pick it'd ask people to divide along that topic and then it'd swop them into the other one and at them argue from the other one start tho learning ti for shape for sectors this varies very is very and w e use fourteen counts clothes now ism getting it would not be physical it would be purely intellectual i meant let us think in can we take it back to the brain for a moment to the conversation that we are having earlier right we were talking bow the in our experiments in now in whole whole bodies of narrow scientific knowledge we know that there is this very interesting narobiological sort of processing difference between emotions in the thoughts that are part of those emotions that are the result of those emotions that are also inciptating those emotions right the that whole process when it pertains to a the direct actions observable characteristics behaviors a a of another person or situation that you can actually directly pretty much directly an learn or infer as compared to when you have to bring a whole lot of concept content knowledge to bear experiential knowledge a simulation capacity to bear to be able to fully appreciate the nature of a situation and we talked about how that second kind of processing that i call transcendent is is an essence about a distancing yourself from the immediate physical situation the observable perceivable situation in a direct sense and instead constructing a narrative in your mind that is built from that but that then brings to bear all these other kinds of of a information that blow you to elaborate this into a narrative that takes on emotional meaning and in psychological power as a narrative it becomes part of identity belief select cons and we talked about that kind of thinking being associated with the called default mode which is deactivated systematically and decoupled from itself right the different regions aren't talking to each other to each other when you are in the world acting doing a task paying attention inferring the direct things that you need to notice around you your mental playing a socregane the ball's coming at your head that is not a time to stop and us about total nine and girls access to sports wright you are going you are going to trip and fall or you are going to miss you are shot at the goal are you've going o get hit with the ball right we needs a sort of manage that space in order to have these conversations and i think what is important here is to member that the default mode network that is the substrate that that is playing out your own sense of self and inner consciousness and self awareness and is also the basis on which we construct these broader inferential narratives that are the elaborative stuff of stories and beliefs are fundamentally incompatible the activation of those systems is fundamentally in compatible with a needing to be vigilant into the immediate physical or social situation around you if you feel physically emotionally culturally socially unsafe and you feel that your you need to watch your back either literally or metaphorically as you are thinking about things neural biologically that situation is conducive it is not conducive to being able to actually conjure an alternative perspective in which you construct a meaningful narrative with alternate ethical implications with alternate prospective possible future outcomes with alternate views of the historical precedent or contacts being able to sort of mentally time travel into the space of those ideas is only really possible on people feel safe to think together is it sounds its anti creative yes creativity is also associated with the activations of these networks young causally in some recent work i had the good fortune of having dinner last year with ism somebody i will not reveal it is but he runs a a major us e social media platform and he told me that in japan a it is common for people to have two or three or even as many as seven different social media handles and that they do this in order to embody different versions of themselves safely yet these are not tool accounts the are not the accounts and by the way i see you troll accounts say whatever and then you go to their accounts at some private account where they hide rather these are individuals who have multiple accounts in one account they might be a bit aggressive maybe even a bully on line dare i say in another account they might be very fawning and show up as the person that everyone knows them to be in the real world in another account they might be a university professor and another there in athlete and it is fabricated in the sense that the the the post that they put up often do not accurately represent who they are in the real world debut it is accurate in the sense that it represents the different dimensions of their persona y the er driving the real world decision making at some level it is kind i pretend play for little kids it is pretend play but it is it is it is not pretend because it is in care space alki'll just give a go back to rick rebel who in addition to being this incredible music producers is a enormous fan of professional wrestling for many years and have ask him from a perplexing why professional wrestling said the athleticism he says it is the only thing that is real because everyone agrees it is not real and these are a charactetrstrite ye your agreeing for it do not be real and yet it allows these characters to fully embody these different personas and and i had the experience a years ago as at cultzspring harbor laboratory summer camp for scientists where i attended and taught and i was in a cab driving out to coltzpring harbor from the train station si sit and i got into a discussion with the cab driver and he said i cay your from californium e said new york accent i shall will not try in limit a you from californium and he said you are governor who at the time was shortsanegger he said he is great and i and i said tell me more i cape the shortsenegger for a number of reasons he she signed my party cause he was governor now i want to e oses as and and he said well because if terror show up in californium he is on go out there with a machine gun i take them down in his is had he all o the terminator he is the terminator the is the terminator and i realized in that moment this was at was smart guy this cabdriver snag that that it was not a lack of narrative distancing now he had conflated the actor with the roller he played and i realized in that moment that this was not a reflection of him being unintelligent it was a reflection o the fact that the the brain often collapse his identities i of others and makes these i think it is just a in a fashion the on he is arson it is an efficient way to trout a parse the world now we decide and tot that is that kind of that cereal now we put him over there on a she fry at to return to the discussion that that we are having i i think that the ability to embody different aspects of self but also the ability to transiently embody the personas of other people and to do that in a way that allows for really thorough exploration of idea space n i feel like can only be a good thing provided it does not get physically violent or something but that to me seems the exact opposite of what is happening now which is that am people are soloing off into their camps were specific language and specific ideas are accepted and others are not main it's it is it is interesting and perplexing and disturbing to me that the way that is certain things that have no thing to do with politics get lumped with one group or the other that it is crazy to me on the one hand and and yet i i think what you are describing seems to me the rout out of all this i really mean that i feel you the education system starting young and getting people emotionally engaged learning what they what they do not but then also teaching them about their emotional systems and how it helps tom parts the world is really the solution that when we are upset we can and realizing yet ism upset it make sense why ism upset lemme explore it from the other sides tit also make sense while there upset and that seems to be what humans have done somewhat throughout history never perfectly well but it seems it ought to be possible i mean the forebrain is there for reason could you in in wanting to go back to obit of the biology in the research what have you seen in terms of cross cultural consistency about the role of emotions in it in our ability to parse and learn and u because vas see were not consoled these promise to day but although i think you have point shine light on some some potential solutions what do we know for sure about human beings in their capacity to do what you are describing to to really learn differently ait worked in the classroom where you ere teaching but how could each in every one of us do this i mean how would we approach to i i us one to take us to the practical yum what can we do when we read a newspaper article what can we do when we were on social media what can we do u when our kid is refusing to do something because they would simply do not it or or that the teacher they do not the teacher are are there paths through that that you have identified or that you can sense work i can get funny examples my an gets won the ain't thingsthat scold right i it is is not you lice thing o what you yet an what souls do you use an silence to not e yet my my son and when he was not this grate he was he was very upset about the behavior chart that his teacher had at school and he had a ye had a behavior shire they'd a behavior hire to back the room the the principal did not agree with this but that teachers there for a yearn look there is his behavior chard and you have green you start on green with your little club and then there is yellow and then there is red which is call your parents win i never understood why they do not call your parents on the green but at anyway right you start on the green and i get you get down to the yellow en they get round the red and there is bed's little friend is always getting on the had by nine arms h we just get it over with you and and he tried to talk with his teacher about why this behavior chart made him in comfortable because and she could not she could not understand his perspective because she kept saying but you are always on green you are always doing what your suppose to be doing and your respectful an your well behave wise at a problem and what he was trying to say was that somehow it just made him uncomfortable to have that there he was costly bothering me with this i finally told him i was trying to work one day and he was home from school cause i would let him work from home some days because we needed to to kind of buffer all bit and a he would bring all is work me when you would down himself it'd be working he would be working right it is fine he had all kinds of projects going on and this is a kit who of stole sizes her is a kit who went to first grade and about two weeks in t a first grade good first great class he he was crying on a sundae night to me i i go to school to o a school my wall was we you now what is wrong as come thinking he is getting bullies in his long us i finally looks to me goes i have much work to do how do you expect me to get my work don if ism sitting in school all day i canary can real can you write because you are actually a mode of it is right wed take kids motivations and the things they are interested in and we side line them and try to structure the venison back to the r legs ja tie that youth he was that he was saying to building armor at that time he would yo i know we drive terrible parent an we gain some safety glasses and we taught him how to use an we explained how medals sharp when we gave him some so thati'll supercool and some tin snaps and he made a whole sit of armor in the back yard at second it and anyway it took a months and most common chain mail the whole bet he s supervises no anyway a he made our plinth me did all kinds of things a but here is this kid and he is bugging me about his teacher in this behavior turn i said ted go read a letter to your teacher id bodies that much you go it a letter about what bothership i because in doing he is first of all helping to solve the problem secondly he was he was formulating his understanding of what this behavior chart is and why specifically it bothers him and in doing and helps him not be bothered by it right that is an example of something you could do rite he wrote this letter to his teacher which and that being published in the national academy of science entering and tats hook how people learned solid too because i was on the committee of people that wrote id and we needed an example of kid's making sense out of motivational things and actually took his name and a this then often put the letter in the book basically is a little kid saying listen teacher when you put up this behave your chart he called a bad behavior chart which it was not it was just a behave or sharp but he interprets it as bad behave trip when he put that up it is as if you are you are daring me to do something bad you are you are basically he does not say because he says you are basically making me uncomfortable because you are laying out up like a perspective on me a possibility space for me that you are now bringing in to the conversation that i could be that and let us see if you are going to be ought not to day o was still on greatnight and where is this o it goes back to the idea that kids are and all of us are interpreting the interactions and the structures around us not only for what they are but for what they represent as somebody ease's interpretation of what we are or are not capable of and he saw that behavior chart as a marker that his teacher assumed that all kids in that class are capable of being badly behaved and that their may name of being in school is to be well behaved right and he writes all about saying saying dear teacher every day i come to school every single day and every single day is new that is what says and i could learn something new except then i see datatat the bad behavior sharp right he saying school is supposed to be about learning and and us engaging and you are making it about something low level and basic as are you going to behave yourself to day we are we are insulting him by the way we frame the context take it back to the bigger issues of civic discourse anal these things i think much of the way that we are organizing are lives our social relationships are community are civic structures right now is i mirroring that teachers behavior chart had she take the chart now i do not no i do not think and and whats and i ask because ism not sure that it matters i think what probably matters is that he had the chance to voice he voices his understanding is understanding of the chart ye that is right and now anybody can read his understanding chart just ti and in the most widely restarts look on learning right i and mot vision i mean the point ti couple point's first is that we are structuring the way we structure ire environment can unwittingly impose are mental models of other people's possibility'spaces on to them and people find that inherently barren right think about how we are doing that in many contacts not simply in schools am and then the second thing is from the cents perspective deconstructing exactly why and it is something bothers you by understanding how it is that you are interpreting that thing then opens you up to be able to manage those spaces in a new way and to engage in the mango if we take the conversation back to the idea of civic discourse of civic reasoning of engaging with with any idea right there are ideas that are deeply problematic there are ideas that are deeply hurtful that have long histories of drama associated with them of long histories of power dynamics a and oppression associated with them the way in which i think we deconstruct those ideas is going to be critical to how those ideas live on implicitly in our social relationships in our society if we cancel them if we negate them and pretend they do not exist all were doing is burying them in a place where they cannot be deconstructed and only by actually taking them apart and appreciating the pain the the the relationship structures the limitations the resource applications the inequities that are implicit in those concepts only by deconstructing and deeply understanding those can we we build them in a different way it is very difficult because on the one hand we have a space created for ourselves right now in society that is deeply unsafe for many people and when you are in an unsafe space you are not in a space that is conducive to constructing and deconstructing meaning using those defaulted systems and other system says to be cast d bout the brain right in kind of oversyblifiit that are a the substrate of autobiographical self of possibility spaces of this of deep a moral and ethical emotions on the one hand we have a space that is deeply unsafe for individuals to think together and genuinely there are real implications for people to reveal certain kinds of identities to engage with certain kinds of ideas in culturally a culturally a formulated spaces right that we have constructed together and the irony is that we can only fix that and create a different way of interacting with one another by actually boldly going in there together it is a very wants line where we need to develop skills in this is where i think and and many people think now that schools should be focused across disciplinary demands whether its mat science social studies story art the arts right sports should be focused on helping young people and teachers develop capacities and dispositions for deconstructing and constructing again safe a safe cultural spaces to think together about interpretations about narratives about stories about assumptions about ideas because as we engage in those thoughts together we call that civic discourse right we learn kind of rules for not triggering and sensibilities for not endangering another persons ability to engage on equal footing with us because if we trigger those unsafe right dangerous places for people they cannot nor a biologically then engage with us deeply around sharing their perspective and deconstructing ours together to build something where we have a shared understanding in the middle we have to trust one another and trust trusting one another really means we have to have a space established in which we can feel safe to deconstruct our own beliefs and to allow others to do the same and to assure them that we can engage with those beliefs no matter what they are and then actually exteriorize them and evaluate them together and think about them around your values we probably both hold well being sustainability of society and of cultures and of groups right these things are cops everyone wants to be while every one wants to have a sustainable life and a life feature and of cultural set of values and when we all appreciate that were bringing those things the table but then or systematic about constructing a space for civic discourse in which we are supporting one another in deconstructing our own beliefs rather than each others beliefs right then we are at a space where we constant to construct some kind of understanding some kind of new wants more a adaptive more prosodical and true sense way of engaging with one another with not necessarily way of agreeing with one another but way of engaging and constructing and deconstructing meaning together that we can be adapted that we can build a society where everyone can flourish that we can build a society where everyone can belong and can a can actually have the resources they need i would argue as long as free speech is not possible for everybody yet that nobody robot let's that is right the nobody's say nobody say that there is an illusion of safety around the idea that u people who who have voice are going to get what they want simply because they are the ones who are allowed to talk and other people are not yet i think you said it privily when ye said that any time ideas get buried there is noway they can be sold ye we know this from the scientific literature agrees and a realize within social science and biological sciencitor deeply troubling ye m i can think of experiments that were done in the realm of euro surgery on humans in the nineteen sixty a people stimulating different brain areas and seeing rage or seeing very politically controversial ideas emerged from the person's mouth in real time function of stimulating that brain area and then you say well did they really believe that and they just never were saying it and the person does not even recall that happening during the surgery or men this idea that young had that we have all things inside of us yet i think can be seen as a very dangerous notion and territory that we have all these shadows but the at the ism also an optimist and i feel that the the optimistic view of it is that by knowing that we have all things inside of us potentially that id by unit and by embracing that fact that we can manage that not to steal what you just said we can manage that and that we can function much better when we see something in the world that we think that is not me ism not that and i hate that when if we understand that that also lives inside of us but that we just do not realize it and i realize some people hear this into that is not true i have my stances and i disagree with other things i would say absolutely yes but the difference between one person stands in another person stands is could be purely development a wiring it could be am it could be difference of having read different childhood books and an oriented towards one book verses another ism an i do not i think that we are very similar at the level of for wiring and core algorithms that we run but somehow these days we have the perception that we diverge much i think the only thing that is really missing is what your describing is is a place where any in all ideas can be explored freely not to establish consensus an legality had certain kinds of ideas rut too actually exteriorize that i and de construct them for what they actually are absolutely am hank you for working through that that pase cause is it is a tricky one i an wary it is very from yet it is it is very fraught u but very important i have a question that is very basic but have never gotten a good answer on i was raised thinking that mariners were a real thing ti the that there these neurons that exists in the in the brains of us an other old world primates macaw monkeys but especially in humans that called marinrons that are active add when we see somebody experience something and it evokes the sort of empathic understanding in us have also seen some reviews written recently in some popular press saying that a mirinerons are perhaps not playing that the critical role that we thought they were mum what is the story on marinrons and i were not going after anybody's work in particular i just want to know whether not there is real validity to the notion of mirinerans ism not an expert in but i can tell you what i know about it and the way that i i think about it i mean i think it is pretty clear now that there are no such things as mironerans some special kind of cell type that is in the brain the the they have not been found they were predicted but they were not found but something else was also predicted back in the late nineteen eighty i i by antenna de music i where he talked about the brain i in terms being organized interns of what he called convergent and divergent zones he talked about i the brain being organized as networks converging and then diverging again back out you have places where processing is kind of coming together and then then then what happens in there then determines how things get spread back out and you have got these sort of loops happening in the brain and and his his thinking on that was very much am commensurate with others thinking about the notion of a of gold directed action and perception if you think back to developmental scholars we ad new nothing about the brain very much can piece rite back in early a a twenty twentieth century am where he was observing young children and noticing that they were interacting with the world and they expected certain things and they were he thought imposing theories or schemas on to the world and then and then accommodating was the word he used a the world with their actions what it did not act the way they expected and then assimilating ghat back right to change what they expected next time that he had this model that he built from from systematically observing children a the in particular right am where he what he realizes that kids are not just flailing around sort of discovering things had hardly they are imposing a certain logic on to the world and then they are systematically testing that logic to their hypothesis very basically yes right they there expecting things and then when the world does what they want that reenforces and when it does something different that surprising and then they have to accommodate and make sensed then they have to expect differently in the future what does this have to do with urinary i think when you bring these different ideas together that the psychological observational ideas and then the nurbiological ideas am what we basically have and i wrote about this little bit in ti think two thousand ait give a paper collsomthing the smoke around furfurans and i forget the secondhand the title but has the word golds and and a and directed actions and think right am the idea i think is is it is not that there are special grants there fir no when we see another person do the thing write that but that we are prospect to the notion of us imposing our expectations on to the world you have to share and understanding intuitively the goal of the other one's action in order to activate these mirror regent right am i we are and what are those mirror regions they are basically regions that are deeply interconnected with each other right they are thoroughly interconnected with each other interns of white matter fiber tracts and they are regent involved in am action a a planning goal granted actions and perceiving the outcomes of those actions it is a kind of a loop between acting and perceiving and acting and perceiving and and i argued at the time bright that goals are emergent high level goals are emergent from the dynamic feed back loops of acting and perceiving rights i was really taking a very pianette in view but imposing that on the nurse i think you take what ism saying together with a piagettian constructivist view there many other constructive narial scientivesal a constructive psychologist also and and then also the world data what we see is that we do not have these special currants bit into our head what we have is a natural proclivity not non know where that comes from right but we have a natural proclivity to try to appreciate another persons actions feelings experiences by leveraging our own similar actions feelings experiences and when we can share goals or experiences that becomes more facile right and that is been ton over and over in these mirror type paper is right and when you a distance yourself from those goals and actions or do not have an intuitive sense of them then you do not get these mirroring activations you do not get these kind of ramped up a a sharing of of of of goals or of of experience i think it really comes back to the way the nervous system is wired to be inherently social we are cultural learners we are situated in social spaces from the moment were conceived and certainly from the moment were born and that social space observing others in reacting with others regulating each others physiology each others attention each others a emotion right as we do those things we accommodate to each other and we wire ourselves to expect certain kinds of feelings and then to recognize those same things and other people and as we share constructed experience together we start to appreciate the sameness right that the the the parallels between other peoples and our own emotions thoughts goals and and we can also a dehumanize them you do not make the other the other person not share or thoughts emotions goals and then we are capable of all kinds of arable things we have talked about before right aweryord where you've actually distanced yourself what is this scoop on mirinerans i do not think mirror neurons exist i think that is the consensus but ore propensity to engage with other people by simulating on the subtract of our own self and then inferring the goals and the feelings and the outcomes and the experiences of those experiences that we would simulated that is what is very essential to being a human but keeping in mind that there is also this layer of learned lived cultural developed expectations we impose on to the world and we not filter but we a we steer our attention we steer our perception to accommodate to aline with our expectations it is never just the reality of what the person experienced o what happened it is always our perception of that reality as we expected it to happen there is this very dynamic cultural to construction happening that is ism that is messy that is iterative that you can learn to do indifferent ways in different contexts and and that is kind of how i understand this notion of mirroring before we conclude i do want to answer your son's question o do not be prior to recording there was a a ten message that came and we do not a read it verbatim ut the the message a very alien's son i is a lateen age years and he is been doing a deliberate cold expose record showers own on a daily basis and reported that he is not yet he has not had any colds since sparingness this is actually a pretty common experience because the pulse in a adrenalin that is inevitable with a uncomfortably cold but safe no don't shat of that in the morning does e hullmuch of exercises to get warm an the jumps a free doctor amaze him a that spike of a gentlemen we know as in o protective if it is a short lived spike in a dental foot chronically i e do not a conextrss the that is not good we know that from the beautiful workofbruse manual at royals ya another cars is yes but then he asked should he get sick should he continue the cold showers and and the answer is no i think that then it would be hot showers and hot baths and salon a type stuff is probably bear but not hot that it is stressful ye you really want a reduced stress on i on a sound ill system he sounds for many reasons a remarkable the young man as as is your daughter i cons abri and i honor and t was an you are remarkable and i a i really mean that i we we could go on forever exploring these ideas i i absolutely i would love t have you back for another discussion odor need non any about your research i want to thank you for taking the time of your research casual your teaching casual o con educate us to day these ideas are vitally important and and you provide many real world examples in fact that is one of the things that i love much about your work is that it is really nested in real world applications and your thoughts and perspectives on the education and how it could be better at the level of educating kids at home teaching ourselves teachers and the education system i i hope we will ring far and wide because they they really can be implemented and not all you about the need to purchase a bunch of stuff no idiot is tire with the different disposition may distil wet a different goal yet the goal of education needs to not learning's not the goalies not the outcome it is to be the development of the person great how is a person changing themselves having learned this and then you design the learning opportunities to change who people are capable of becoming it to the learning is there but it is not the endpoint it is just the means to something else which we have not been attending to enough and that is the development of the person who they become having learned that beautifully but well thank you much for your time thank you much for the work you do and i cannot we to have another discussion with you about the merging research eh alvivac thank you thank you for joining me to day for my discussion about emotions social interactions and learning we doctor marry been

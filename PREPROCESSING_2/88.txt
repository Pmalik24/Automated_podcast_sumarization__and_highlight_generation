when it comes to israel current war against comas there is a clear gap between the sides on a moral level one side commas and its allies seeks to murder civilians that is why they slaughtered one thousand four hundred innocent news in israel and have planted their military sites directly in civilian areas while attempting to stop their own civilians from scapingthose areas comes openly acknowledges they say that they used civilians as human shields the other side israel seeks two save civilians that is precisely why commas locates its military assets in civilian neighborhoods if israel were truly a human rights monster that did not care about civilians commas would have no incentive to shield its weapons with innocent gazes on the one side commas has a healthministry that ruteenely lies in two thousand fourteen for example commands interior ministry website issued instructions to omen acts including the following statements these are direct quotes quote any one killed or matter is to be call a civilian from goal or palestine before we talk about his status in good or his military rank do not forget to always add innocent civilian or innocent citizen in your description of those killed in israliattacks on gaze they also say quote avoid publishing pictures of rockets fired into israel from gosh city centers this would provide a pretext for attacking residential areas in the gas trip on quote because commas runs a tyrannical terror state media members are routinely told what to report which is why that same year in twenty fourteen the washington post admitted that when it comes to body counts the commas healthmanister was quit the only game in town they threaten reporters that same minister acknowledge the he maximized the counts of civilian casualties the new you times and twenty fourteen recognized the commas in fleets such statistics as well the other side israel is a democracy with high levels of transparency a free press her rbostemocracy with highly aggressive opposition parties the cry prime minister of israel has been dragged by that media and opposition through scandal after scandal that does not mean that israel does not get things wrong it does mean that israel does not make lying its central principle in military matters one side commas and it is esteemed colleagues palistinian is lomicchehod that a very long history of firing rockets that end up hitting their own people in to thousand twenty two for example israel estimated that some one fifth have all one thousand palistinian is lomicshe hodrockets fell within gap during the current war over seven thousand rocketshave been fired at israel at least four hundred of them fellshort and had gaze here are just som video examples from the recent past there wereseventeenth is comity had disturb hospital in gaze when a rocket am board israel is fired and landed in gaze this is not the first time a thousands of rockets a foretold is rocket's fail is failed rocket loves at mat israel and the that or cables innocent individual n tat gaze now here is a map of all the failed launches during this war alone nun see this map blankets the entire gozastrip from south to north one side israel has a precision military that seeks to hit as many military targets in sufficient a way as possible that military reteenely passes up shots on military targets if too many civilians will be harm with all this said naturally when a hospital allegedly blew up in the gosistrip yesterday afternoon and compass immediately claims that the explosion was in is daily air strike and tat five hundred people hade been killed the media used their heads they decided to wait for all the information to emerge because compass are liars and just gettingthey went with compasses report because this is what they do as it turned out commosslas as usual line lying from beginning to end a failed palistinian is lomacgehod rocket hit the hospital actually to be more accurate it hit the parking lot next to the hospital doing know apparent structural damage to the building we still do not know how many billable died we do not know the real number of casualties that took israel weeks to determine how many people had died in the assault on its southern for compass throughout the number five hundred within fifteen minutes of the rocket falling there is only one reason the media jumped to listen to commas the media have an insanely strong stake in creating moral equivalents between israel and its terrace opponents they operate under a soft headed mine set that seeks moral parity between parties to a conflict but as it turns out they only seek that moral parity when one of the parties is news if we are talking about a russia you crane the america media treat every russia claim with a grain fault and believe petty much everything put out by the craning government if we are talking about a full terrorist group that just slaughtered babies however are media a suddenly shockingly calculus they suddenly believe what the terrace have to say how interesting how revealing will were actually watching in real time as a genital jaw hating terror group laundered lie about a jewfish massacre of innocent at a baptist hospital is what we call a blood libel that turn dates back to the year eleven forty four when jewhaters charged the news of norwhich inland with ritually murdering a young boy named willing for religious purposes frequently such blood libels claim that news used christian blood to back pass overman similar blood libels reuse for centuries all the way through the time of the notes they are still repeated very frequently in arabia language media in the belie the golds obvious to turn the jaws in a monsters and thus to justify their murder blood libels historically have led to pogroms to expulsions to genocide targeted against news blood libels end in actual blood now the same is true right here commas retailed a blood libel this a blood libel and the media credulously picked it up there sudden credulity has consequences very deep consequences people are going to die because the media bit commands hook here but again that is really nothing new legacy media hatred for the state of israel is decades old really dating back to the post sixty seven era an has cost thousands of lives on all sides if the west had taken seriously compasses own words or for that out of the words of the palsinan authority and atlomicgy hie israel never would have ben force into dangerous concessions to terrorist groups thrave ended with thousands of deaths but the media continue to pretend tat moral equivalents is the story them fatalist to comforting easy story they lie or at the very least they pretend that israel enemies have serious credibility those lies cost blood to day show sponsor by express o vein to lake or web history being seen and sold to advertisers now meaneither get express we plan right out express vepiansa come flesh men hero here is the actual story of what happened yesterday late in the afternoon in the early evening israel time a story emerge that a palistinian hospital in the gosistrip a baptist hospital had been hit by in is really air strike that was the story that was originally promulgated and the headlines for the media just prided whatever comestible them five hundred dead it was in is rally air strike at target an to hospital whose designs kills many killing's hospital and obviously that story was also desire to drop at the same time the pressed bison was riving in israel hurt the original headlines from all of these outlets seeannen quit hundreds killed an is rally strike on gosh hospital palistinian official say now first of a you should note how these hydrants art there all written the same way the way they are written is the claim and then at the very end of the claim palistnian official say now if you led t off with palestine official say hundreds killed is rally strike on gosh hospital everybody would know to take it with a bit of a grain of all because commas lies they literally lie for living it is what they do instead all of these headlines lead off at the claim and then coma palistinian official say rioters hundreds killed an is really air strike on gosh hospital half authorities where the hl authorities that el mention at thou be come of the pastry journal is really air strike on gosh hospital kills more than five hundred palistinin official say allies your english is really airataxks of killed hundreds of palistinians in all coley arab hospital in gosh city where thousands are seeking medical treatment and shelter from heavy bombarbman b b c news hundreds of people have been killed and is rally strike on a hospital an ghost according to palistinian officials make every major newspaper in the world let twas the front page was literally the font page was the top headline every single newspaper in the world bought into camass story what actually happen what actually happen is that is comic ghodpausinis lomacihod which has thousands of rockets in gosestrip they were firing rockets on israel because you know that is ions a night ending an we in to time to try to kills news and trial own or something and they started firing rockets into israel and shock of show it turns out that one of their rockets fell short how do we know that wall as we will see because all they evidence says visual evidence audio evidence get locating evidence all of it says the media did not just er wrong they brought a terrorist lie broad casket to the world and then there slowly having to back track that lies to latch because once the lies to the this will now be the story and it will cost lives it'll get to more on this in a moment first pure talk

alleviate at for veteran your doing something for a god costs well puretalktack come slash apparel switch to pure talk to day okay the idea waited until the contact gathered the evidence and then they revealed that i actually know it was not in is daily airstrike on a on a hospital in fact israel goes out of its way not to hat hospitals how we know this well because as have said multeltimes on the showanothers all shift hospital in the gossip is located directly above compass headquarters this s been well known for decades at this point for literally dockage tell you asked why has an israel to taken down the hospital because the hospital that is the reason israel intake down the hospital for literally everyone knows and is not a giant secret is reported on wickapedia that all shit a hospital is located on top of comas headquarters but israel does not blow it up why because israel understands that the the human damage and the public relations damage that would be done by doing such a thing would be catastrophic yesterday the idea spokesperson revealed that actually is lonagehod fired the rockets tat fell short here he was announcing that yesterday i want e give you announcement of the event that the cut in the hospital in got i can confirm that the analysis of the idea for rational systems indicates the the garage rockets was fired by tourists in got possinging closeprosimity to the kalian mate hospital goa that the time it was hates intelligence from few forces that we have in our hands indicates that the blaming geodes responsible for the fall rocket lunch which hit the hospital goes i repeat this is the responsibility of bi slam gap that killed innocence in the hospital in gozilto e say but i do not know who to believe should i believe the official military of democratic ally of the united states or should i believe the terror scruple good news israel actually then provided evidence that it was palisining diplomacy hodrocket first of all there is surveillance footage from one of the most cavie that is one of the villages that is located round the gos'strip it was one of the place that was assaulted during the commissar tack on southern israel this i surveillance footage from native mascara and it shows the brash rocket fire from gossip you will see in this footage that one of those rockets doesn't make it all the way out and where is it go where is it go i sit there you see the gossaboard er rate to the posit wall look et the look at the rockets go up and here they go all the rockets are are going up into the sky times at israel and a a merely went later you will see in obvious projectile from the exact same the section falling directly in to the hospital area it is of there the rockets going up and boom something came down what the timing is almost who white why look at that it looks exactly is though a rocket failed thees that is precisely what happened rocket failed they it do not worryoure not to you are not for li on visual footage also all just zero showed it in real tone this is footage from allege zero time stamped at the same time that these supposed is daily bombing occurred here is what it like an algebra there is the project of look at that the canasta's on the on the rocket and u o there goes the rocket and am down right into the middle of the gosistrep there's that again that was on algebra that that yes wonder wonderful yes just amazing amazing work there from passing in is comic gemot do not worry that is not all the evidence the deaf also has rate our footage time rate up footage here is a a picture is a graphic of where the rockets were aims there is the rocket launch sight as you can see if you are watching the share can see in the lower left hand side of your screen and the y can see a series of lines that are the direction of the rockets as you can see the hospital is located directly along the path of one of those lines that is a the all taken by is daily rate our footage but do not worry there is more the idea also has drown footage of the actual sight of the hid and what they show is damage done to the parking lots this before after ay you can see from the top where exactly this this rocket landed now you will recall that the original ports that t it hit a hospital square right hit the hospital square kill five hundred people in actuality where dit hit t a parking lot it a parking lot right outside the hospital and come ass immediately clam five hundreds head in the entire meteor own with it without any body count without any sort of waiting with with nothing ay as you will see from the from the footage here you can see there is the parking lot there is the hospital compound and dub again you see the sight of the filter there is no bomb crater no heavy ordinance crater at all there shrapnel on the roof the tile roof of the building next store was not even damage they gave the examples of craters caused by idea f ordinance ere i vas the is create air force diameter of seven meters there are no visible sines of craters or significant damage to building there is no crater haw we northers no care because heir actual pictures from the sight where three no crater there's perfectly obvious from all available evidence that this was a rocket that failed and in fact we have footage directly from tass which is an arabia station showing the actual sight and here is what it shows now does that the mild of a hospital to you rs that l look a parking gothic ut burned ay you can see the and this is footage not from israel is i from tass ay the people walking round the burned outskirts of a a of a parking lot the got hid not some burn cars unless those cars were filled with hundreds of people they are not five hundred ad in that particular in that particular coming and the exterior to these buildings is largely undamaged they have footage from inside the chapel you see some the windows got blown out and the interior of the chapel is intact is intact are yore not seeing give bloodstains on the floor you're not seen bodies strewn everywhere now get did some people die in this failed palistonian islomace hod rocket launch sure i en i out a som yes was it five hundred people where is the evidence also even if t was not five hundred even it was five hundred people it was a rocket from pallistonian is lomaceehod oh but wait there is more that mean you you think tat but but but wait there is more o call get you the more in just one second because again in just in case you were thinking well that that is all circumstantial what if i had for you evidence of commons members talking to one another about the failed illogic good rocket launch good news i do ill bring to momentarily first are you a few years ore decades but a school an wondering what the hack did i even learning what was the point well you wen to a top of livelong school than probably you are you might even be thinking you an't have the time to learn something new if that is you here not alone it is not too late hillsdale college is offering more than forty free line courses learn about the works if see lewis the risen fall of the roman republic ore the history of the ancient christian church with hillsdale colleges on line courses if yore not sure were to start check out constitution one of one the meaning and history of the

century by progressives and liberalism the course is self paces you can start whenever and wherever you want our country needs more america futchly understand the constitution and understand america history and can defend our freedoms against the encroachments of n increasingly large and on accountable government also we just thing more people who are educated but not by our garbage colleges go to hillsdale dot et you slashbentuen roll there is no cost it is easy to get started that is hillsdale dot et u slashes then all hillsdell dot end usloshben now have ben trying to for each all week of the garbage that happens an america college caps that of is not happening hillsdell go check out hillsdellriht now hillsdale dot e to you slash bet i a what if i told you that om i have audyofootige well of we do here is audio this is from commons members talking to one another one a o it looks we it looks one of the pain is lace hod rockets hit near one of our hospitals oops he r wore r most hope give not wanted ism telling you this is the first time that we see a missile this falling and that is why we are saying it belongs the palistonian is lomaceehod they are saying it belongs to pallisonan slomaceehod it is from us it looks it who says this they are saying that the shrapnel from the missile is local shrapnel and not is daily shrapnel what are you saying and then thenamedthen silence but god bless mi could not have found another place to exploit never mind yes ma blank they shot it from the cemetery behind the hospital y youwhat is l they shot it coming from the cemetery behind the all mamadany hospital and misfire and fell on them o here is a cemetery behind it yes amamadani is exactly in the compound yousilence where is it the enter the compound and shoe first enter the compound and do not go toward the city ans on the right side of the all mamadany hospital yes i know it oh soh oh but i thought it was in his daily air strict and according to literally every major media newtalet on the planet they'd ran with compasses liesbetz come ass in right away another they decided the lie about it by the way in that even and youreaccording multiplicity of war crimes admitted in that recording right you are not a la to fir rocket from right next today hospital what a they admitting to that they fired the rocket from right next to the hospital two they're admitting that it fell in the parking line ear the hospital three they are admitting to lying to the entire international media about all this now you could make the case for the media that they are just credulous and stupid except that they have known for decades that the paladin in authorities routinely lie about this stuff routinely lie it is not as though this is somehow not their m o this is exactly there m o they've been doing it for as long as they been this is why you wonder why it is that many newsalits are located with in compass control buildings in the got strip the answer is because you will be shots or you will be hurts if you do not do what compass tells you to do every one in the gocistrip knows this it is colic israel can walk around free with the cameral compass is a tyrannical terror states they tell you to report thing and you report it and if you do not reported they kick you out or they kill you every one knows this and yet the entire media ran with their lie yesterday because the blood libel is more important it is purposeful that is not foolishness at a certain point becomes purposeful an now how many times you can promote the moral equivalent's blood libel lie of a quoting actual terrorist murderers with the relies attempting to defend themselves before you become complicit in the lie and part of the lie compass literally wandered a blood bible into full public view and by the way blew up the idlest andyou will talk about that a second these lies have tremendous affect internationally and you guess went all along with it did not you in the legacy media you did and i wonder why could it be because it hit is all of your political arogenistones or you gets ta claim moral equivalence between israel and its enemies could it be that well get to more on this in just one second because again the fall out from this is dramatic another media there till members the media yesterday corincessing non an no we we still do not know how could we know it is a real headscratcher all the evidence give just provided to you audio visual rate are none of it matters to them many of them are still parroting it some of them are softly backonufoll now we don't no now it is in converse mean on the one hand we do have all of the it on the other hand lying terrorist genocidal dating murderers say it was the news i mean whose to say it is a mystery of catch is make proportions that sort of moral equivalence again moral equivalents in which you take in a grieved party and you will quite them to notes wore actual notes i mean compass is notes ton drums work are not notes come ore actual notes when you will quake those with the news what you are actually doing is both rehabbing the notes and to grating the news tat is the entire purpose of this exercise and it has a facts will gets that momentarily first something more relaxing nice fun the regular basebulsies in is is its officially over now that doesn't mean the fun has to end that is

promocueben far deposit match up to one hundred dollars of as i say the media bought the in your times headline crew they were an overdrive last night they changed they're top headline five times they left the picture the picture is always the same which is some suffering palistonian mam and hiked and a the original headline was is rallies strike is raises strike kills hundreds and hospital palistinians say then they up dated that to at least five hundred dead in strike on goa hospital palisinians say and then they change that to at lest five hundred dad in blast at gaze hospital palistinian say change from is daily strike us hundreds to killed five hundred then's change from strike to blast and now if you go to the near timesthe headline is basically strike in dispute sick homer siphon backing into the bushes media graphic addition s insane but do not worry you till have your friends over namasand be see continue to lid you that was probably these rallies here was mas and be sees rofsancha says well maybe these rallies are line yet you are right you are right probably it probably it is these rallies probably sot that they fake the rate turd ate of the fate to video the fate probably it's all that pro or commas our terrorist who murder babies and burn them and lie i knows carefree to believe them maybe evil people are evil but i have breaking news they are evil and when you cover for them you be come complicit in their evil and our legacy me go have been dedicated for decades the proposition that evil must never be looked in the eye they must be coddled it must be treated is though action aren't evil they are not may sure they're long in we know they are line but will pretendtheir not lying an maybe we can n a make we can manage their shoulders and for israel to make concessions to to the lying genicitl murderers it is its insane here was ma sand be sees rofsanchis doing his best to try in both sides this thing this kind of death toll is not wat yo u normally associate with palistinian rockets these rockets are dangerous they are dead run they do not tend to kill hundreds to people in a single strike in the an that is rally high explosive especially these bunker buster boys that are used to target these humans tunnels under possess city do have the potential to kill hundreds of people and we should say finally that there are instances in the past where these daily military has said things in the immediate after that incident that if turned out not to be true in the long run and the one example it'll give you is that when that the acts the irreternless serena able ley was killed in the occupied less bank these really military initially sad that she was killed by palistinian gunmen and it was only months months later that they admitted that it was likely and is raillyse soldier who fired the fatal shot o and now a massive scandal inside israel and turn who revealed that it was the the israel sold refire shot even with serena lake these really military eventually they did all the research and they found that they tough that it was in his rally military officer cases of that was israel that admitted that a by l of this you really have to out the word of these rallies over overcomes overcomes my clearly comas are the believable party here ow that the last three weeks have been just a master class in new hatred it is amazing to watch its all of hating history condensed into truly period first you have a polices level pogroms lash genocide genocidal massacre of innocent around the gossistrip and half the world goes n well maybe they s no we you have simply her pausing low she saw that then we see the is real cant defend itself it is causing spilling casualties the news must take it the news must take it right on the chin they must enjoy it the news must simply stand there after all we would not want the sing dascaloide we have to make your what we just want piece seise fire now before israel can do anything to defend itself or get back at two hundred hostages that is the best thing then we have a full on blood bible which is what this is paraded by the leggasimedia meanwhile ism ism just ism wondering what is coming next as a sudden of just history ism ism ism really looking forward to seeing what knew antisemitic trope from history can be dropped directly into e middle of this conflagration of garbage great stuff here media seen en hat on a senior managing editor of the military times him somberly positions this this could shift political opinion against his yes that is the entire point why do you think comas did it why do you think they lied and then why do you think you is are costing the lie again it is unforgivable for you understand comes comas is a scorpion riding a frog of course the insisting the frog the media ire not the frog though because here is the thing the media know full well what the scorpion is they are not bamboozles or shock by this they know what comas is and the report it credulously because it backs their broader narrative which is that there is a cycle of violence in the midliast not one side seeking the genocidal extermination of the other side in the other side simply wanting to be left alone i repeat for the one millionth time israel pulled out of the gosh strip can two thousand five leaving the entire thing n to the control of the palistinians and homes they promptly built it into many terror state that launch the worst terror attack on nuisance foholicoss and he media immediately turn around an go back to moral equivalence land it is astonishing here we got pick what those images ad up to is a mass casual to event that could change the international a opinion of what israel doing right now it could shift international opinion against them it is already a shifted that a opinion in the are world against israel a and is her is rally a news channels are still covering hostage families arab news channels are covering the destruction inside gaze i i notice that to you get her all very credulous about that again the credit t if you are that credulous about the plans of terrors script it makes me think you have him latent feelings about this conflict not latent feelings may we should say sing of people who do not have late an feelings about this conflict for shed to leave than oar the terrors cakes in the yes congress they decided immediately to parrot homes is claims and blast them out at full volume respected to lead serer sympathizer she treated out israel just boy the baptist hospital killing five hundred palsinians doctors children patient just that president this what happens when you refused to facilitate a seas fire and help the escalate your warren destruction only approach has opened my eyes and many palstinian america and muslin america likes me you'll remember where you stood there she is just parroting homscrop again because of course she loves comas she is the omascockes ihanomarsame started deal for my sistocamas has ohanomar ever medaterrors croup that she isn't fond of bombing a hospitals among the gravest of war crimes is ohanomar well maybyou might once help palings him she hod that the idea for portably blowing up one of the few places the injured and wounded can seep medical trimer and shelter during wars terrific the president needs to push for an immediate sense fire to and this laughter you noticed that all homascock is are pushing for seaside why a mas getting it asking as well it should ihnomart rescued to lead again pushing out terrors prop again a because this is what they do for an actual living it is it is amazing is are elected officials in the united states really really solid stuff right were seriously good stuff by the way the the mamas cocks adjunct scholar to see she is continuing to parrot the words of her of her fellow homes backs members she spent three minutes the other day trying to explain her calls for a sense fire after many news were murdered is on signed yogin several other of your colleagues a release the statement calling on as fir areas fire i in the region but i wonder what is israel supposed to do about mamas after they murdered brutalize abducted over a thousand of their citizens are they supposed such a to nothing well you i think what is important in not about a sense fires that it is not one side it hamate has been sending thousands of rockets since i astraielis while and what is important is first to identify our coal incomes to what fifteens in turns of let the gotten ut and i fin gay cogesomand i think the position from israel respective is that there was already an attack and mamas already committed at a hack after that happened do you really believe that they should not respond to that i think what is important in arms if respond is israel dos have a right to to sell defense i think we we new to take a look at in the situation i if collect give punishment qualified at defense is if block salmon an male affect that the our congress is filled with clowns an she is rite the she she is the driver of the clown car i o see the fact that the media proper up as somebody who knows things this idiot bartender from brooklet or supposed to pretend that she knows things either she is absolutely ignorant or she is just in ad junk to the comose cacao or both at this point ism to go with both jobidon arrived in israel to day and i met with the israel government in the immediate aftermath of that he put out o statement to how outrage she was about the hit ism hospital again am mig to beloved him to wait for five minutes to see if the fact actually come out meanwhile john hurry was the national security spoke person he u he said that do that he would be asking that widen would be asking chitin ow who tough questions as a friend which is always yet after after your people get slaughtered definitely want to answer questions from the america president tough how many love questions has a jordan asked kolinsky as a friend question very i serious question has joannes a lot of hove questions of a vlodamirs lens and you crane as a friend ever yer that's hot a language applied anywhere except with regard to the israilays of course here was john hurry trying to again start making the room for both siding it then been got on the ground and is will see we he back tract is thing pretty strongly when he talks a person an a to the workman a is tonic down o the is wants want gas tens to the rallies about the i nation on the ground and more critically there at tin her plans her ten in in the days a we ahead and ho e asking on a quest to be asking to as a free as try friend to israel way we ask o questions o a a he is asking to make clear that we continue to want to see this contain not why not is man not deepen in tough questions is for anyone widen immediately said he was outraged by all this then to day he said in israel we at by the way i notice that the other side did it meaning was passing in his loach hut here as present been saying that t deep we said the to are by hear expos as of town sea sue e a i super o to as to i tee the i to pop to o the o her i r w a l e a o er to lo ti ism he was asked by the way why he believe that and he says what i was shown by my defense department not by these rallies by the america defense department the brutish foreign secretary actually tweeted out yet this morning that down everyone got it wrong admitting that that it was all lie that was made up and that every one got a wrong including in the international community he put out itstweet this is names cleverly last night too many people jump to con lesions around the tragic loss of life at all office hospital then this wrong would put even moral basilisk wait for the facts report them clearly and accurately cool has must prevail o say tat the entiremedia a do not give any dams about that at all say they are natural consequence is to this those natural consequent stirgan cost extraordinary numbers of lives and prolong this conflict and possibly widen it the media are complicit in all of that the media have blood on their hands ill

lander ferreous lives and the full public you that has some pretty predictable consequence is already there are forces in the release that wish to see this conflagration spread now it is n the interest of america to keep this thing contain they do not want censbelogettng intone war if they do seals can go hollow against us belie if israel does that syria may come in error may come in and suddenly u have a regional war that makespannd outward to include soon states and mango nice this is something the united state wishes to minimize in order for that to happen however it would really help if the media would stop propel getting blood bibles against the sales that actually end ongoing negotiations is already against you have forces that are seeking to maximize the amount of conflict in the region that of course would include cabala another terrors grouping evil genicitle terrors group on israel northern boarder that also happens to run the leones government by proxy at this point according to the jerusalem post cesbelog denounced what the group said was israel deadly attack on gosh hospital and it was a li and call for a day of unprecedented anger on wednesday i mean it is hard to have have on precedent an anger in a region where pretty much every day is the day of unprecedented anger man literally every fridge is a day of rage over there by protests i rusted outside the of embassy in boots just hours after the incident again all of this promoted by the america media these massive protest spread pretty much everywhere huge protest in lebanon that ended with the evacuation apparently of the america embassy in barroom because people trying to set it on fire there also massive protest in jordan a footed from jordan were massive protest broke out around the is rally embassy in jordan hers without look in see look at the size of that protest of corseventy per cent of the population of jordan is palsinian arab which makes presents because original the entire area was fondu jordan was transjordan and then transport with sliced off the en air area was conceal bitishman at palestine transport with sliced off that be came jordan naturally a huge personage the population is palsinian arab can see the size f the crowd then you had massive protest in costar which is in cranial proxy state an all work very very closely with the with the genital dictators in iron secure they were protesting in costar the giant protest over in costar there massive protest in or on in favor of comas as well again look at the size of those om of those protest many of these devolved into into violent riots or people least attacking particular sites that included for example people who ware actually shooting ordinance at do the at the is rally consulate in turkey s a fireworks were being shot at the frailly consulate in turkeaters with that looked as well it did not stop there by the why a crowd tried to break in to an america military base in turkey as well and all of this was ignited by the america media pardon homastocking points s again slow cat four genius as and leg my meet who only want piece gas their peace loving truth seeking people who exacerbate every conflict they can fine apparently meanwhile a massive prokomascrowd headed toward the us embassy in bagman that was a another thing that happened lesson all this happened overnight because again the misinformation gets around the world before the truth can put its its wanton in the morning here is a massive program of rooms crowd headed toward the embassy an bagged anything lot of ut young males obviously as you imagine in each a by the way from wondering what these out people are are chancing they a chancing i quote america is the greatest devil just in case you thought that this was only about hating tune is there were bad enough they a they hate america also things are one grate protestors in brood as we say the embassy had to be briefly evacuated apparently because professors in brood were a trying to get into the us embassy they a were flying compass flags and draping them over the fences dowry they the they are not guys we have been told by the same legsymedia that the population in these areas hates commons the compass is basically acting on its own that the population of goa they hate common of judantomaria the called wetback they hate hooks that in all these countries everyone is peace loving and peace seeking they all want the same thing ism nothing lot of evidence for that but we have been told it by our legacy media probably we should believe it meanwhile it is also hitting the west police in berlin actually had to set up outside a hollicoss memorial in berlin to prevented from being defaced and vandalized here is video of that last night in berlin en the police present around the holiness memorials rented from being to face meanwhile we saw mass one protest in canada as well in favor of commas those continue the teston amazing job by the way in importing tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands people who sympathize the terrace scrub those at that it turns at than amazingly smart that is that is great i yew that is that is a lot o people who we if you are not and let put in this way if you are on the west on an emigrant vest and you support common question taportio they should not be a particularly controversial statement it seems supporting terrascripts are pretty base line thing not to do if you wish to reside in the west massive protest broke out in grease as well terra simpthise a running wild in spain around the glob around the globe this s day thing is the protesting grease um things are going really really well all credit to me by the way remember all those people we are told are not allied with the terraces en all those people who who really hate the terraslike match moodabas he is the reasonable one in this particular region he is the a of the pausing an authority well i mean it is unfortunate then that e thalston and authority gave comma's terrace families close to three million dollars for murdering jaws that is a thing that actually happen according to pain and media watch the passing an authority which again those of the moderns those a the supposed peace partner they will pay families of deadcomas terrace o combine total of twoponti million dollars say paid for slave system call the matters fun the terrace family would be rewarded around fifteen hundred bus and a three or fifty three dollar alrouncs monthly for life the families terrace married into receiving even higher amount that is apparently a low estimate though those are the friendlies by thewy those are the people o we are told actually want piece the iron probably make concessions problems sense fire would be necessary meanwhile this had dramatic diplomatic fall out as i was talking about yesterday and throughout the we on the show the reality is that every one in the region except for commons has some interests in this thing coming to a clothes without being blown into a broader war rondos a want chateaus if this thing goes hot and iron ans up in the war the leadership of on will be dead and that is just the reality lebanon will be depose s the leadership of on will be dead there be a lot of that bodies there be a lot of rifle suffering in carnage that what everybody is seeking to avoid at this point but because of this false report parted around by the media because of that jordan has now cancelled a summit that was to be held with king adult the dictator of egypt alseesy and machhutabas after the blast they decided to cancel that and due and that was going to be sort of the lead off for trying to figure ut what happened with gossip that is really what those meetings are about what happens with civilians and goes they get some sort of temporary stay in egypt do any of them want to me out it turns out old people don't a surely want to live in gaze has daily a crappy place to live on your governed by either the pouring an authority orslomaty hod rooms many people are leave will they be aloud to where would they go tht'swhat those meetings were onto be about what come to aftercomas instead that got cancel because of this false story that was towed around the world by legacy media according to the times ofvisrael the wite hose confirmed that the jordan portion of jo bidanstrip to the modest has been cancelled twos supposed to hold the summit in man with the leaders of jordan egypt in the palsinan authority jordan announced it was scrapping o the needed the meeting entirely which again goes to show you the their hearts are does it not pentagon why why would that scrap the meting wouldn't they want the meting more desperately with the america even if only to pressure the america to push these rallies a white house official see in a statement the decision to scrap the among summit was made after bid and consulted with king adult in white of the days of morning announced by abas following the hospital blast again the they are all they are all playing up the lie because they want to play up the lie because they wish to exists tor bade the feelings of the called arab street the men lying their people for decades and in doctrnating their children the hatred of news wife stop now ism that is the international situations currently stands now how fast in the liege to bunked anybody's get meany it is it is already been trunks in real time but it does not relive after because in the end in the end they are too many people legs media who still have a stake in the are existing narrative they silva a a stake in the preexisting narrative an there n to continued from on the lie the arab street will continue to pick up the lie an a b leadership will continue to pick up the lie muslin leadership all continue pick up the lie and the contract of the conflict bellman intractable which was entirely the point this has been entirely the point of the palstinian conflict since the very beginning i repeat that you go back to nine he is forty seven nineteen forty eight every war creates refuge es this what wars do the why they three point five millions syria refuge es currently living in turkey the difference between israel and its air neighbors is that israel tried to encourage many people to stay which is while twenty per cent of israel population is culnenltly is daily arab meaning palstnian arab and also israel took an eight hundred thousand tubes from the surrounding regions all of them it took in the arb nations took in zero palstinian grabs to use them as weapon against the news and tat has been the story since the being at continues to be the story to day in a second we will get to what comes next internationally and the continuing crisis on america college compasses first we do things here pretty differently at the daily wire because several of the top news podcast in the world longed a chocolate company overnight we just took on dishy had to had by releasing a hundred episodes of kid's content tons of content well that means that were constantly growing more constantly seeking now hires more costly trying to great the hers the we have how d we do that hell we rely heavily on ziprekreter ziprocrer makes your whole hiring process faster and easier they are powerful acknowledge works for you i den five people who skills an experience matter job the ziproker staves you time by letting you easily invite your top candidates to applied your job them were likely to a play sooner ziprokr is trusted

employers to piston zipreke will get a quality candidate with inlay one not ziperoker dot cam slash daily wire to this zipercuter for free again that a ziperokre dot cam flesh d a i el i w i r e ziperokreer is indeed the smarsway to high check them out right now ziprocr dot calm slash daily wire what comes next well the white house is already discussing the possibility of what they will do if cusbalat gets in according to arista kob the white house has ben discussing the possibility of using military force of cusballod joins the war in goa an attacks israel with its huge arsenal of rockets hell that of course matters the even the discussion the publicly available discussion is meant to push cabala away from doing just that and that is smart american's not want cusballa involved israel not when husband involved no one wants humble involved an ensure usual once cabal involve if they get involved they will not be on the map within a few weeks but they are being forced into it by iron by circumstance is in goa by world opinion and all the rest the west promoting a determine strategy here is a smart thing to do as i mentioned yesterday that is something that to the united states should be doing they should be pushpin cabala from doing this peas again if cabala fires those rocket were not talking about fifteen hundred did use your talking about twenty to thirty thousand edges that many rockets they have and they are much more sophisticated and they can overwhelm iron don that that is the great fear to yous official side secretary state antonym blinking told there leaders in the region that the use is not fooling around by sending many military assets to the region in support of israel they added that any decision use force to be made according to the scope of the husbalak attack and israelsability to respond this why by thewy you have seen cusblodoing pin prick attacks in the north the basic idea here is to tie down is daily troops and material in the north to redirect them away from the goes trip but not got hard that either israel strikes full force or than america strikes full force either meanwhile join is expect to ask congress for a hundred billion dollar package get join is trying to package together eight for israel you cranes are too completely separatists they are completely siderites and the conflict in you crane give bee an advocate of america funding you crane to defend itself and to prevent russia from taking over the territory also the intractable battle field conflicts which is resulting in nothing is can need t have an offal and the united states can have to take a lead position in negotiating what that offramp is with the ruffians as much as i hate flamer paten think that he is a garbage human being in dictator that the running for you ran is much more controversial proposition than re arming the israilies in the face of an on going terrorist caught again arming you crane to defend its on terry try on totally fine with and tat would continue because if not then russawins an walking to keep that is something thatshould be prevented but l thinking the two issues they are too completely severed issues and congress people should have the ability to decide to vote up on one an down on the other or vice verse the fact to bine is trying to link the two in ore to cram them through is i think strategic bad faith the running levels which would cover and entire year they're so cover border funding in hisastrades there thing to lump everything together israel you crane border for another crapsandwhich from the lined administration i do not know why this has to be tied together many house republicans are expressing skepticism over combining all of this together some of the some the senate higher ups he democrats run the senate of course bitch my call is backing the biding proposal mainly because he wants to make sure that the aid to israel gets done and the border security gets done and he saying we do not run the senate or the presidency he says this salt intern connected but republicans argent push for strong border element in ore for that to happen obviously republicans at some point might want to nominate a speaker this is the other on going issue republicans still do not have a speaker of the house or yesterday they held the house vote twenty house republicans voted against him jordan for speaker of the house stove's college who is previously the person who want behind the scenes election among re publicans over him jordan he removed his name the silos not in o get you seventeen jordan decide to push forward and tried it do a pressure campaign against various sort of congress people who are waiting and it did not work twenty republicans voted against him for speaker of the house that included the house appropriations show him cig ranger of texts represent mayo dead ballet of flora represent a kenbuck of colorado and quartet of new york republicans and purple district many of them our fright as i said yesterday that him jordan is very right wing guy they are afraid that he is gingko do things lead broad government shut downs that will lose them their seats and therefor the house its majority hat's this all this chaos and stupidity should just underscore how dumb it was to depose can my earthy with no plan or actual ask is a fit of peak from some congrsspeoplewho levy cameras that is that is all it was because far ism not seeing what the win is what is the wind really what is the wind again the underlying in sent structures precisely the same because if you only have two hundred an twenty one seats in the house which is a re publicans have and you majority of two seventeen and ore a do anything hat means five republican congress people the any stripe can simply sink whatever the entire caucus want that is what happened with my earthy but can also happen from the left wing of the caucus which his on what happen with jordan yesterday representative glam kamala a long time represent cave my cart the ally who voted for him on the first ballad in speakers vote told reporters the he will vote form jordan on the second ballet hennas said he would never vote for jordan not out consider other candidates my earthy is pushing for jordan but again i it is in clear exactly whether republicans can ever get to to seventeen at this point iron donates who is obviously a very right wing pretty grumpy congress person from flora he says he had turns out that pressure campaign against the moderate members of congress back fire the scandal the i talking about the her hanhandahaneldang i con not m born con war anonymously calling torte a say forgetting collagen a by we that at that up o pro met members i believe a a to a to members we they they the that the to wat they need o iron think that a be should be doing i now unit the all to the others in or country i think it the or er members i her your boys at i cop er the that ut i think that there are members or her who the one of beagle for make the the thin or beer an that w or a thin homo the caching ta at that ire they have not work what exactly have the republicans can o do the answers eh right now there apparently on going conversations between the democrats and some re publicans to empower trick my henry who is the interim house leader to just henna continue with his job for just will not be you speaker of the house was move along with trick my henry clearly this a big one for publicans clear they don't look their bun to morons in a clown car shooting blanks at each other ingle that obvious well thought out it was a genius again ism all for a bit of a bit of boisterous activity in the house if it actually a accomplishes conserve of rolls please name the conservative goals that ben accomplish by this idiotic fit of peak can anyone name one him jordan is sol on speaker of the house steivesolis is not speak often house then nobody speaker of the house and has not been for several weeks of this point he him jeffrys is now telling mean end that his back is is open to reaching some form of agreement with quotiqual traditional republicans to reopen the house they are talking about empowering ins from speaker trick my henry he said our for is right now relates not just one in the individual but to getting the institution reopen i have respect for trick my henry thing he is respected on our side of the isle apparently conversations seen senior democrats and republicans have accelerated in recent days what is this going to end with an all likelihood some concessions to democrats ha just you get a speaker does to democrat was vote for somebody slow la so clap for the strategic brilliant of this entire of this entiredabocle really really high levelstoff and meanwhile america universities continued to be a moral wreckage a place of moral wreckage university of pennsylvania is now in crisis because they have not only look to the other way on radical antisemitism but a lot of their downers are beginning to realization been sending money there first of all welcome to the party pal have been saying for literally twenty years twenty years have been saying that donors and sort of donors should not be giving money to left wing colleges who promote garbage they should be doing it and many people at habitat is my lama modern yet but they told thus some good things yet but beat here is the thing ye should not you should where university of pennsylvania no has a problmocoing to san en former yous ambassador john huntsman plant blasted the university of pennsylvanias response in recent monist antisemitism an is promising to halt his families donations to the university the strong criticism from huntsman comes admit a going backlash from donors and trustees the controversy be on last month when a mollie say event took place on company you pen was called the palestine rites literature festival you pen his acknowledged the events included speakers of t a history of making antiseptic remarks you pen leaders is some to statement ahead of the festival condemning antisemitism broadly but not the festival specifically a lot of powerful donors have now argued that open leaders have basically allowed this the go on open leader president list gill issue a statement sundae admitting the school did not handle the situation as well as it could have well here is the thing guys this is stomach problem is not going to be fixed by putting out a statement this this is why also lesser weakener's non profit group the exon or foundation has with drawn financial support from hazard university after that giant student group led letter blasting israel for the recent terrorist attacks that murdered fourteen hundred israilies more of this please more people pulling money from these garbage universities that are overcharging their students for aids agree and nonsense this what this what needs to happen hopefully if something anything decent can come out of this entire terrific situation perhaps it would be the funding of some of our worst colleges in universities perhaps it would be that already is the rest of these continues right now he has have flooded the mail bag with questions about what is going on in israel ism excited to answer all this questions but to hear it you must be a dailyware plus member

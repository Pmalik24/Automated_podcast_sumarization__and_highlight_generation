welcome to the hubermanlao science sciencepactoeli i made superman and o professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is mark and desire mark entresol is a software engineer and an investor technology companies he confounded and developed mosaic which was one of the first widely used webbrowsers he also confounded and developed escape which was one of the earliest widespread used webbrowsers and he confounded and is a general partner at andresan harlots one of the most successful silicon valley venture capital firms all of that is to say that mark entresol is one of the most successful invaders and investors ever i was extremely excited to record this episode with mark for several reasons first of all he himself is an incredible invader second of all he is an uncanniability to spot the invaders of the future and third mark has shown over and over again the ability to understand how technologies not yet even developed are going to impact the way that humans interact at large our conversation starts off by discussing what makes for an exceptional innovator as well as what sorts of environmental conditions make for exceptional innovation and creativity more generally in that context we talk about risk taking not just in terms of mistaking in one's profession but about how some people not all but how some people who are risktakers and invaders in the context of their work also seem to take a lot of risks in their personal life and some of the consequences that can bring then we discuss some of the most transformation technologies that are now emerging such as novel approaches to developing clean energy as well as a i or artificial intelligence with respect to a i mark shares his views as to why a i is likely to greatly improve human experience and we discuss the multiple roles the a i is very likely to have in all of our lives in the near future mark explains how not to long from now all of us are very likely to have a i assistants for instance assistance that give us highly informed health advice highly informed psychological advice indeed it is very likely that all of us will soon have a i assistance that govern most if not all of our daily decisions and mark explains how if done correctly this can be a tremendously positive addition to our life in doing mark provides a stark counter argument for those that argue that a i is going to diminish human experience if your hearing about and were concerned about the ways that a i is likely to destroy us to day you are going to hear about the many different ways that a i technologies now in development are likely to enhance our human experience at every level what you will soon find is that while to day's discussion does center around technology and technology development it is really a discussion about human beings and human psychology whether you have an interest in technology development and or a i ism certain that you will find today's discussion to be an important and highly lucid view into what will soon be the future that we all live in before we begin it'd to emphasize at this podcast is separate for my teaching an research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct rations but no sugar the electrolytes and hydration are absolutely key for mental health physical health and performance even a slight degree of dehydration can impair our ability to think our energy levels and our physical performance element makes it very easy to achieve proper hydration and it does by including the three electrolytes in the exact rations they need to be present i drink element first thing the morning when i wake up dually mix it with about sixteen to thirty two ounces of water if ism exercising it'll drink one while ism exercising in i tend to drink one after exercising as well many people are scared off by the idea of ingesting sodium because obviously we do not want to consume sodium in excess however for people to have normal blood pressure and especially for people that are consuming very clean diets that is consuming not many process foods or highly process foods oftentimes we are not getting enough sodium magnesium an potassium and we can suffer as a consequence and with element simply by mixing water taste delicious it is very easy to get that proper hydration if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element t dock calm slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element el m went dot calm slash supermen to day's episode is also brought to us by eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep that is getting a great night sleep is the foundation of all mental health physical health and performance when we are sleeping well everything goes far better when we are not sleeping well were enough everything gets far worse at the level mental health physical health and performance non one of the anythings to getting a great night sleep and waking up feeling refreshed is it you have to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that is because in order to full and stay deeply asleep you need your for body temperature to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized you want your somebody temperature to increase by about one to three degrees with eight sleep it is very easy to induce that drop incur body temperature by cooling your mattress early in throughout the night and warming your mattress toward morning i started sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover a few years ago and it is completely transform the quality of the sleep that i get much that i actually loathe traveling because i do not have my eightsleep mattress cover when i travel if you would to try bite sleep you can go to eight sleep doc cam slash supermen and you will save up to a hundred fifty dollars off their pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the u sea candida u k select countries in the e and australia again that is i sleep dot calm slash superman and now for my discussion with mark and reason mark welcome hey thank you delighted to have you here and have many questions for you about innovation ah i your view of the landscape of second humanity in general i want to start off by talking about innovation from three different perspectives there is the inner game to speak or the psychology of the innovator or innovators things their propensity for engaging in conflict or not their propensity for having a dreamer a vision and in particular their innovation as it relates to some psychological trait or expression we will get to that in a moment the second component that ism curious about is the outer landscape around invaders who they place them selves with a the sorts of choices that they make and also the sorts of personal relationships that they might have or not have and then the last component is this notion of the larger landscape that they happen to find themselves in what time in history what is the geography malaria new york do by et camera to start off is there a common trait of innovators that you think is absolutely essential as a seed a to creating things that are really impactful ism not a psychologist but i have picked up some of the consists a some of they have some of the terms and i saber is a great moment o delight my life when i learned about the big five personality traits stars aha there is h way to actually describe er they answer of this question and at least reasonably scientific terms and i i think what you are looking for when you r when you talk about real innovators people who actually do really creator brig to work i think you talk ago t a couple things one is very high and what is called trait openness which is one o the be one of the big five which is basely just flat out open and new ideas winter course that the nature of trade openness is trade u en this neansyou are to just open o new ideas an one categrare your open to many different kinds of new ideas and we might talk about the fact that a lot of innovators also are her creative people in other aspects of their lives right even outside of other the their specific creative domain that is important but of course just being open is not sufficient cause if you are just open you you just be curious an explorer right and spend your tire life reading and an doing thy no talking o people and never actually create something you also need a a couple of their things you need a high level of conscientiousness tree another one the big five you need somebody who is really willing to apply themselves inn our world typically over a period of many years right to be able otto accomplish something right they they they typical work very hard a that often gets obscured cause the stories the at getting told about theses people are cows just the is cad the to say this idea and it was a stroke a genius and it was a moment en time and you knows just all he was lucky an the lie now why for most these people it is years and years an ears of of applied effort into you needs you need somebody wit can extreme you o baby willingness to diner gratification an really apply themselves to a specific thing for a long time a man of course this is why there rest very many these people as there are not many people who are high and openness andhigh and conscientiousnessicaus to certain extent they are they are opposed right traits and you needsombody us both of those third is you need somebody high and disagreeableness which is the third of the big five as you need somebody who is just basically ordinary a right because if they are not ordinary then they will be talked out of their ideas by people who will be all that s the reaction must be love new ideas s to that is done amen somebody who is too agreeable will be easily dissuaded to not pursue e know do not pull in the thread any more we need somebody highly disagreeable again the nature disagreeableness as they tend to be disagreeable disagreeable about everything it they tend to be these very out of iconoclastic kind of ranged characters a and then there is just a tablestakes component which as they just also ne to be high act they just stay just need to be really smart is is just it is hard to innovated any category if you cannot sent the side large months information quickly a and those are for basically high spikes you very rare traits that basically have to a we to come together ah you could probably also say they they probably some point need to be relatively low in neuroticism which is another the big five cons if their neurotic they probably can't handle i stress it is kind of is this this tile in there and the a course of your if you aren't if your to this that the sort of science at ti five bits if e o these are all people who are on the far outlying kind of point on the on the normal distribution across all these traits and and then that just gets you to i think the the sort of hardest topic of all around this this this whole concept as just just there are very few of these people do you think they are born with these traits ye all here born with the traits and then and then a corse the traits are not you nowt do not ore not destiny and that that the traits are not determine stick in the sense of that you just cause they have those personality rats does not mean the there and you know deliver great creativity but they need to have those properties because otherwise the does not either it to be able to do the work or the not can enjoy it righter i mean look a lot the people are highly capable confident people it's very easy for them to get high pangjobs in traditional institutions and get lots of you know traditional words and end up with big pa checks and there is lot of people at big institutions that we we know a found i know well and i i deal with many of these where people get wait a lot of money and they get a lot of respect and they go for twenty years is great and they never crate and thing new right a there is there is lot administrators a lot o them be a lot of that of men of an administrative jobs am an that is fine that is got the world needs seen the world needs that also right the tithe investors cannot run everything does everything that the the rate of change would be too high society i think probably would beagle to handle it you need some people who are on the other side who are in a cold keep the lights on and keep things running a but but there is this decision that people have to make which is a cay if i have the sort of latent capability to do this is this rectally what i want to spend my life doing and do i want to go through the stress and the pain drama right and the anxiety right in the risk of failure right and dodo i really want to once in a while you run in to somebody who just cannot do it any other way they they just have to was an example that the lot plants the mean of he haramonexample of our time and he and i i bring him up in part because is ye such an obi is example but a parkas he is talked about this a in in in interviews where he hebosly see he is i cannot turn it off yes come i have to pursue them right it is why he is running five companies at the same time and working on a sects right a titis just he cannot he cannot turn it off you non look there is a lot of other people who are probably have the capability to do it who and it up talking themselves in to or whatever events conspire to put them in a position where they d something else a you in obviously the repeople who try to be creative who just do not have the the capability and otherwhere is some bandiagram there of determinism through traits but also choices in life and then also o course the situation of which they are born the contact within which they grow up culture right what their parents expect of them and d i forth and you have to you knyoucannat get a the way through this you have to thread all these all these nates ken of at the same time do you think there are folks out there that meet these criteria who are disagreeable but that can fane agreeableness that can for those just let in marches raised his right hand em am another words that the consort of em phrase that comes to mine maybe because i can relate to a little bit they em sneak up through the system meaning they behave ethically as it relates to the requirements o the system they are not breaking laws a breaking rules in fact quite the opposite there paying attention to the rules and following the rules until they get to a place where being disagreeable feels less threatening to the were over all sense of security yow we look the really highly competent people do not have to break laws right its it is the there was this there was this there was the myth you know that say er happen run to b be the god father and then there is that care to mire lanky you know who's ran basicity to off know fifty sixty seven years ago and there is a stop scrap line of well my lanced only apple him self tor any general motors he would tax bend the best see of all time it is know not really right people who are greater found be companies they not have to they don't have to be bosses thy do not have to break laws they can they cant they can do they can work it the there is smartness sophisticated enough to be able to work it side the sit hem thy soft need to take the easy out i do nothing there is any implication that they have to you now that they have to if to be claws that said they've to rest enormous right in in n specifically the thing this is probably the thing that gets miss the focus the process of the process of innovating the processecrating something new once it works the stories get rat con as they say a in comic books the stories get adapted to our it was inevitable all long you know everybody always knew that this was a good idea the person has won alleys a ward society embrace them and is if if invariably if you if you were with them when that was when they're actually doing the work or if you actually get a couple drinks into them and talk about it of bey now that is not how it happen at all they faced a wall of skepticism just a wall of basically social essentially denial no this is not in ta work no ism not going join your lab no ism not onto comer for your company no ism not con a buy your product right now ism not going to meet with you and they they they they get just tremendous social registers i the the they are not getting positive feed back from their from from their social not works the way that more agreeable people need to have right is is why these i agreeableness is the problem for innovation if you your agreeable you are insist in the people around you they can to tell you that new ideas are stupid great end of story you aren't you are not going to proceed u and i would put it more on they need to be able to deal with then you real i deal with social discomfort to the level of ostracism m or at some point they're gents get shaken out and there discintaquit you think that people that meet these criteria do best by banding with others that meet these criteria early or is it importanthat they form this deep sense himself debility to cry oneself to sleep at night or you don't line the feudal position worrying the things are not going to work out and then still get up the next morning and get red back out there john parked has the best line by the way onion this he says a now being ow being out to prefer being a creator is a you now getting much the face over and over again he said eventually you start to the taste you own blood and i love that line cause it makes everybody massively in comfortable i but it gives you a sense of how basically painful the process is you talk any outer burner you not to of who is been through it about that there ago that is exactest is exactly what its there is this there is a big individual component to but but look it can be very lonely right and especially ween a very hard i think to do this if if nobody round you is trying to do anything you've remotely similar right an for getting just universally negative responses udo not very few people i think very few people have the ego strength to be able survive that for years i do think there is a huge advantage and in this we you u you see clusters is he huge ad vanish to clustering right and you et and in you to throughout history you have had this clustering of fact right you have clustering of the great artists and sculptors and reticence clarence you have the clustering of the flusters of green you hae the clustering on of test people is silk a valley you have the clustering i creative fun now arts move to people and loss angels right and forth and on fir there is always a scene right there is there is all there is always a nexus and a place or where people come to gather for for these kind of things generally speaking somebody wants to work attack in a it intact there can be much better off being around a lot o people who are trying to do that kind of thing than they are you know place when nobody else is doing it having said that the clustering has you can have downsides they can have side of facts and and you put any group of people to gather and you do start to get group think even among people who are individually very dis agreeable and these same clusters where you get these very hideous and critic people they do have fads and trains just every place else right and they get they get they get wrapped up in their own social dynamics to good news this the social dynamic in those places is usually very forward looking right and it is usually it is usually it is demon wits a hard of a conic class looking for the expect thing right a conto class look in for expect thing that is good the herd part right that what you got to be careful of even when you are in one of the environments you have to be careful that your not getting sect in to the roup think to much we say group think you mean excess give friction do you do pressure testing each others ideas to the point where thinks just do not move forward or you talking about group think where people to start to form a consent is a the self belief that gosh we are strong because we are different whup he can we best re find group think especially less couther one of those things both happen those are goods s those are good ah the part of group think ism going about is just we all we all basically german we we defend observing you n the same ideas right there holly way there this classic thing its anthethethei their years were the la us in there's a lot of volcano movies think why are their pee volcadomiies and it is just to there is just something in stall right there is just something in the air you now the look tack the silky valley has this there therefore moments in time where you'll it'll have these wait is the old thing i what is difference for the fat in the trench right the fact fat is the train that does not last right and you know selling a valley is subject to fats and both fats and trends just any place else wright motherworts you take smart disagreeable people woe pleasing together they well act a herd right they they well end out thinking the same things unless they try very hard not to you have talked about these personality traits of great invaders before and we are talking about them now you invest in innovators you try and identify them and you are one you can recognize these traits her are making the presumption that you have these traits indeed you do will just a get that out of the way have you observed people trying to feign these traits and are there any specific questions or behaviors that are give away that their pretending to be the young steep jobs or that their pretending to be the the young henry ford u picture list of other other names that qualify us authentic legitimate innovators we will not name names of people have tried to disguise themselves as true invaders but what are some of the i the the litmus tests and ai realize here that we do not want you to give these away to the point where their i lose their potency but if you could share a few of those then reward rest pretty book on the m yes solo first of all yes there are people who dot my try to common and they s person ass thing something to they re not and theyyou know if they've read l the books they will have listen at this interview right theythey will they know they study everything an they they construct a farad and they common to present to something they not i mi say the amount of that varies exactly correlated to the attack rat and when stock prices are superior one ally get the opposite was sir prices of superior people get twotomora lives and people who would be doing it basically give up cause they just think hat whatever whatever would the industries over the than is over whatever it is all hopeless an you get this flushing things nobody ever shows up at a stock market low triton says on the no an the ne an the new next tick thing and and and doestand and does not really want end do it because because there are higher status the kinds of people who do the thing the you are dig but there they're fundamentally ranted for social status there they are trying they there their eryngo get the social status that without ashy without actually substance and there are always other places to go get social status so after two thousand the joke was i when i got to selling valley ninety three net four the valley is dead we we back bout that by ninety eight it was roaring and you had a lot of these people showing up your bayou baby had a lot f lot people showing up with withside of ten a stories two thousand marcecrash but two thousand one the joke was that i there were these terms be t see and be to b and in nineteen ninety eight they men be to seamen i a business to consumer and be to be in business to business just the two different kinds of business models fin in at companies but two thousand one a be t be to be fence back to banking i be to seamen back to consulting t right which is the high status people who that people oriented to status who showed up to be in tax we're gasscrew it this is over stick a force and ism to go back to you know gobasacks or go back to makinsiy you know i can jerrycan jerrycan be his status and youyou you get this flushing kind of a fact that happens in it in a down turn that set on in a big upswing out you you get you get a lot of get a lo of people showing up with with a lot of you know with a lot of you know kind of essay public persona without the substance to back up i the way we stress thatgnactly say exactly how we test for this which because it is the last exactly addresses the issue in a way that is impossible to fake and an especially is sectary the same homicide detectives trying to find out if u if u if you if you have actually your innocent heth you kill somebody its the same its the same tactic a which is you you ask increasingly detailed questions a right and tithe way a homasycop does this as you know what we you doing last night you know i was at a moving which moving without i o which theatre you know y which seated you sit oka what was the end of the moving i like right and you ask increase detail questions and people have trouble it it is some point people have trouble making old and things just us in tat just cone about virus bullet and basically fake founders basically have the same problem they have a costa very able to really a conceptional theory of what they are doing that they have kind of engineer ah but as they get in the details that just i just fusses out whereas the the the true people that you want a back that can do it basically what you find is they have spent five or ten or twenty years obsessing on the details of whatever it is thereabout to do and they are deep in the details that they know much more about it than you ever will an fact the best possible reactions when they get mad right which is also a homes cosy i ichactuly was you study want them you don't beaus they want the emotional response of i cannot believe that you are asking me questions this detailed and she if and picky and they kind of figure out what you are doing a and then they get upset that is go that is perfect right but but but they they have you but then they have to approve in themselves and in the sense of they have to be of last the questions n in in great detail do you think that people that are able to answer those questions in great detail have actually taken the time to systematically think through the islands of all the possible implications o what they arguing to do and they have a specific vision in mind of how things need to turn out or will turn out or do you think that am they have a a vision and it is a no matter what it will work out because the world work sort of bend around it i mean in other words you think that they place their vision in context for they simply have a vision and they have that tunnel vision of that thing and that is can be it let us use you funding sample am with escape i mean it is how i first came to know your name am when you were conceiving n at scape i you think locate there is this search gin in this browser in an it is going to be this thing that looks this way an works this way and feels this way did you think that and also think about that there was going tore a gallery of other search engines and it would fit into that landscape of other sorcengions or just projecting your vision of this thing as this unique an special brainchild i mat w give the general answer an that we can tuck about the specific enemy the general answer is to from afterburner she creativity innovation as what economist call decision making under in certainty and it is have been both parts as important decision making your can make a too decisions cops if to decide what to do what not to do and an uncertainty which is the world's a complicated place n an mathematical terms the royal is a complex adapt system with feed back routes and it is really imine it it is it is exstretyn sagas of nothing t another in his novels he he wrote about this feel call psycho pastry ort which is they idea that the like a superior outer that can predict the future of human affairs right and it is we do not have that yyrthat later we steely soft have that yet a and you are just dealing you do not military a a commanders call this the fog of war right youyouyou are just dealing with situation where the number variables are just off the charts it is all these other people right who are inherently in predictable making all these to visions in different directions and then the whole system is combinatorial which s sees people a sliding with each other in fluency in the decisions and i may look the most straight forward con a way to think about this is i just it is amazing anybody believes in economic centra planning it of blows my mind was is usually is just try open a restaurant try just opening a restaurant on the corner down here and fifty fifty odds the restaurants can a work an all you have to do it a run a restaurant is have a thing in sir food and and is most restaurants fail right and in rest taunt people run restaurants are pretty smart the the usually think about these things very hard thy all want a succeed and it it is hard to do that and to start it ta company or to start an artistic movement or two or to fight a war r you are just going into this basically about conceptional battle ground or you military turns real battle ground where there is just incredible levels of complexity branching future paths do whether is nothing it is its you monster's nothing predictable en w feel of course they see the the the sort a drop put tattle really good innovators they have got a drive to basically be able to cope with that in deal withthat and they they basically do that an two steps one is they try a are plan as much as they possibly can and and and we call that the process of navigating the call the idea maze right and the idea maze basically as have got the general idea n it might be the nearest gan to work or nurture whatever and the i cychoct in their head they have thought through if cop if tie do it this way that way this third way here's what will happen then i have to do that hand i have to do this then i have to bring us empty do that here is the technical challenge him get a hit and they have got in their v going their heads as best anybody could they have they have got as complete a sort of a map of possible future side they can possibly haven the and this is where i say when you ask them in creasing detail questions that is whit you are trying to kind to get them to kind and chart out is o ka how far ahead have you thought and how much are you anticipating all of the different twist an turns at this skint take o case then they start on day one and then of course what happens is now they are an't now there in it they are and now there in the fog war right there three turn certainty and now that idea maze is maybe not helpful practically but now they'egoin to be basically constructing o on the fly day by day as they learn and discover new things and that's the world changes around them and of course it is of feed back loo because they are in a chare not young if there's things starts to work it is can o change the world and then the fact the world is changing as tanto cause the know their plan to youknow to change as well am and you the great wit the get ones basically they they course correct they court the great ones course correct every single day you know they take stock of what they have learned a they they modify the plan a the get one's ten to think in terns of hypotheses a scientific sort of mentality which as ta tend to think coke cumin to try this ism going to go into the world i man a bounce this doing this for sure am going to say this is my plan am tell my employs that and tell my vestures that i on t put is take in there owns my plan in theme to try it right am and even though i sound i have complete certainty i know that i need to ten to find out whether it can work and if it is not then i have to go back to onto same people i have to say while actually when it going left for going right and they have to run that lo thousands of times right in they'd you now to get through the other side of it this this light of the creation of this great term pivot which has been very helpful in our industry was the word when i was when i was on the were we use wat fuck up a tificlike sounds much better something much more professional but yet you make mistakes is just just just too complicated understand you course correct you would just you evolve often these things at least in business the business is that end of working really well tend to be different than the original plan but that that is part of the process of a really smart founder sickly working their way through reality right as as as their executing their can the way your describing this has parallels to a lot of models an biology and the practice of science a random walks but hat are not truly random set random walks in biology et camera but one thing that a is becoming clear from the way you are describing this is that i could imagine a great risk to early success for instance somebody develops a product people are excited by it ism they start implement that product but then the landscape changes and they do not learn how to pivot to use the am less profane version right they do not learn how to do that in other words the and i think of everything these days am r most everything in terms of a rewardscheduals and dopamean reward schedule cause that is the universal currency of reward i and when you talk about the shown parked quote ism learning to enjoy the taste to one's own blood that is very different then learning to enjoy the taste of success right it is about internalizing success as a process of being self determined and less agreeable et camera in motherworts building up of those five traits becomes the source of dope o mean perhaps in a way that is highly adapt uts on the outside we just see the product the end product the alone the mack book the thatscape et camera but i have to presume and ism not a psychologist am but i have the hero physiology and of a studied the opening system enough to know that what is being rewarded in the contacts of what you are describing sounds to be reinforcement of those five traits rather then oh it is going to be this particular product or the company can a this way the logos can to be this or that that all seems the prefer to am what is really going on that great innovators are really in the process of of establishing neural circuitry that is all about reinforcing the me and the process of being me yes this this goes ass as extrinsic verses intrinsic medication and that's the to jobs conisanversion o this writer this ceria hippiversion of this was the journey is the reward an eyes we i she as told yes told his employs that its look we know everybody thinks in terms of these big public markers thistle price or the idiot ore the product launch or whatever es now it is actually the the process itself is the point right if you had your point if you have that mentality than that is in that is an intrinsic motivation to an ex extrinsic motivation and and that is a kind of intrinsic motivation that can keep you going for a long time another way to think about it is competing against yourself right it is can i get better at doing this right n can i prove to myself that i can get better i there is also big social component to this and this is one of the reasons why spike a valley punches far above its want as a place i there is a psychological componentwhich as also goes to the comparison set ism a phenomena that we have deserved over time is the leading a ta company in any city we will aspire to be as large as the previous leading ti company in that city but often not larger right cause s they sort o had to have a model of success and as long as they beat that level of success they kind of you don't check the box they have made its they t et but then in contrast your insulin anally and you look around on it is just trace book an disco an trial and to the packed and gladiators yen you just looking at these giants you no many of them for still e knot our suckerberg still you don't go n to work every day and trynatran liked these people are a leno the the males are alive right there n it is clear how much better they are and how much bicker there compliments are and what we find is young founders and that environment have much greater aspirations reckon it just again if it maybe mayst that what may be as the social status maybe there there is n extrinsic component to that but i maybe maybe it helps calibrate that in eternal system the basically say actually you do not know the opportunity her is not to build a local you k which may all local maximum from a success but let us build to a global maximum form a success which is which is something is mick as impossibly can ism ultimately the great ones are probably driven more internally than externally when any one it comes down to it and that is where you get this phenomena wereyou get people who are extremely successful an extremely wealthy we very easily compunch out and move to f g induct call it and there is still work in sixteen hour days ranis is ah obviously something explains tathanas nothing do with external rewards randan i think it is it is it is an eternal thing as many of have been taking a g one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with a one ism sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the robotics that i need edit also contains adaptations to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take a g one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to ta sprite for all these reasons whenever ism asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer g one if you would to try a one they will to drink a one doc cam slash supermen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k to again that is drink a one dot cam slash supermen have heard you talk lot about the inner landscape the inner psychology of these foresee i appreciate they were going e been deeper into that to day and we will talk about the landscape down wether not silicon valley or new york whether not their specific cities that are ideal for certain types of pursuits i think the as an article written by programs some years ago about am the conversations that you over here in a city will tell you everything ye need to know about whether not you belong there a in terms of your a professional pursuits a some of that changed over time and now we should pally ad listen to the mixes a cause it was written some time ago in any event i want a return to that but i want to focus on an aspect of this in transit versus extrinsic motivators in terms of something that is a bit more critic which is a one's personal relationships know if i think about the a catalogue of innovators and silicon valley some of them stove jobs had complicated personal large romantic personal lives early on and i sounds he worked it out i do not know i ad i was not there a couples therapist but he a when he died he was in marriage that for all the world seem a happy marriage a you also have examples of innovators who have had many partners many children with other partners melon comes to mind a the don't my me disclosing anything that is not already obvious am those could have been happy relationships and just had many of them but the reason ism asking this as you can imagine that for the innovator the person with these traits whose try to build up this this thing whatever it is that having some one or several people in some cases a who just truly believe in you when the rest of the world may not believe in you yet or at all could be immensely powerful and we have examples from cults that a i embody this we have examples from politics we have examples from tacinnovation and science and have always been fascinated by this because i feel its the more cryptic and yet very potent form of allowing so one to build themselves up it is a commination of inner psychology and extrinsic motivation because obviously if that per n we are to die or leave them or cheat on them or that you on pare up with some other innovator which we have seen several times recently end in the past it can be devastating to that person but what are your thoughts on the rule of personal and in particular romantic relationship as it relates to people having an idea and their feeling that they can really bring that idea to fruition in the world its real next bag you have photos of examples in all directions and i think it something it something something following first as we talked about the personality track of these people they tend to be highly disagreeable does not foster a good romantic rely i wife ben really i may have heard that once or mice you a friend may have given me that exit ya right may be you just ne to find the right person who compliments that an its willing to youknow there is there is lot of relationships ware you it is always this question about relationships right which is o you an a have the same personality profrofile the same behavioral tratespasesicallyas your partner or desk an i have you knwsaistis is at an opposites opposite thing and you know l ism sure you have see that our relationships for you will have somebody's highly disagreeable who spared with somebody is highly agreeable an ire so eyes to right cause one person just guess to be on their sop myself the time an the other persons just look i it is fine right its fine it is good a you let too disagreeable people to gather maybe sparks fly and they have great conversations all the time and may be they come to hate each other and u anyway these people if you are gin to be with one of these people your fishing out of the disagreeable end of the pond and and again when i see disagreeable i do not mean you these are these are normal distributions i do not mean sixty per cent disageablhat eighty per sent disagreeable the people were talking about a ninety nine point nine nine perfect isagrareeable rights o these are ornery ordinary people part of it is that and then of course they have the other personality traits right there there super conscientious their superdriv and as a consequence they tend to work really hard they tend an to have a lot of time for ramifications for other things there not they wont an they don't enjoy them if they are force to call on them and again that he kind of thing can fritz and a relationship there is a there is a fair in in there that is loaded somebody is in a partner with one of these people in theses to be signed up for the ride that that is a hard thing it is hard thing to do or you need a true partnership or two of these which is also hard to do i think it's part of it and the look i think a big part of it as you know people achieve a certain level of success and you know either in their minds or publicly and then they start to be all to get away with thanks i and they start to be able to spike woloca now were rich and successful and famous and now i have deserve an thistle y get have have you this now in the rely of personal choice you get i in this thing where people start to think that they to serve thinks and they start to behave in very bad ways ins send them they blow up their personal worlds as a consequence and maybe they have regret at later and may be they do not always a always a question yes i think there is that and then i dontkno yes some people just need maybe the other part of it as some people just need more emotional support than others and i do not know that that is a big i don't know that that tells either way i know i know some of these people who have great loving relationships and seem to draw very much on having this kind of firm foundation to rely upon and ten i know other people who are just their personal lives just to continue a strain rack and it does not seem does not seem to matter professionally they just keep doing what they are doing and and and maybe there is a maybe we can talk hereabout it whatever is the personality take for mistaking some people are incredibly risk prone that they need to take a risk an all aspects of their lives at all times if if if part of their life get stable they find a way to blow it up and that some some of these people you could describe in those terms also et let us talk about that because i think mistaking and sensation seeking is something that fascinates me for my own reasons and in my observations of others does it dove tail with these five traits in a way that can really serve innovation in ways that can benefit everybody the reason i say to benefit everybody is because there is a view of how we are painting this picture of the innovator as just really cruel person but often times what we are talking about our innovations that make the world far better for billions of people ninclain by the way we everything were ting but also is not just in tack or science or in in business it is all s everything also took moths true for the arts rights no nor the history of artistic expression as seen you yo people with all pecan kinds of tree we see about piccolo and his and his regular turn over of lovers and partners and he was very open about the fact that it was one of the sources of his productivity a slash creativity he was not shy about that i i always towards alive to day i might be alow that never he might be judge o will differently right or that was his story for behaving in a pattern that that is very no awful for repeople around him and he did not care right might maybe they left him nolo knows right you know is puts in takes all this but but no case i have a theories o her here's a theory this this is one of these i keep a list of thingstht'll get me kicked out of dinner party atitopics an a given point we read it before he go in i just i i on on on o re call that i can i can get out of these things but here here's the thing they get me kicked out of dinner party a especially these days i think of the kind of person where's spike very clear that they are superbug out two point there is somebody s superrich output whatever to main therein they done things a fundamental my change the world they brought knew whether his businesses or technologies or art you worse of art i you know entire schools of of creative expression some cases up to the world and then at a certain point they blow themselves to smothering right and they do that either through a massive financial scandal they do that through a massive personal you none break down they do that through some sort of public expression the cause of them a huge a most of problems they say they say the wrong thing may be not once but several hundred times and blow themselves to smothering and and there is this youknow there this kind of arc there is this moral arc that people kind of and ply which him's the cars the the flying too close to the sun and now he had a coming and he needed to keep his ego under control and y get kind of this you now count of this this this this judgement that applies u i have a different theory on this the term i use to describe these people and a lot of and by the ay a lot of other people who do not act to blow themselves up tut get close to it which is the whole note set of people ah ah i call them matters to civilization progress right and were backward civilization progress look the only way civilization gets move forward is when people this do something new right cause civilization as a whole does not do new things right grupsof people do not do new things right these these things do not happen automatically like it b by default nothing changes the only way civilization's change on any of these axis ever happens is because one of these people stands up and says no no i men to do something different than what everybody else as every done before this is the this is progress this is actually how it happens sometimes they get in as to reworded sometimes they get crucified sometimes the calcification is literal sometimes this justyou know symbolic but they are those kinds of people and then and then and then matters whenwhen they go down in flames they have and and again this is where it really spruce of people's moral judgments cause everybody wants to have the sort of superclean story of cop he did a bad thing and he was punished and i am none oo know n he was the kind of person who was going to do great things and also was going to take on a level of risk and take on a level of sort of extreme behavior such that he was going to expose himself to flying to close the sun wingsmeltn crash to ground but but it is a package deal right the reason you have the pesos an the betokens and all these people is because they are willing to take these extreme level of risks they they they are that creative an original not just in their art or their business but in everything else if they do if they will set themselves up to be able to fail psychological a psychologist would problem psychiatrist or always say you know may be know to what extent to they shall they have a death wish do they do they shall you know it some point to they want to punish themselves o thy want to fail that i do not know but you see that they they they they deliberately move themselves to close the sun you can we you can see what has happening cause if they get too far from the suite deliberately move back towards it right they know they they come right back and they they they want the risk hands anyway i i each matters to civilization progress this is how progress happens when these people crash and burn the natural you now inclination is to judge morally i tend to think we should basically say look and and i do not even know if this means given them a moral pass thou whatever but it is look this is how cable they civilization progresses and we need at least understand that there is a self sacrificial aspect to this may be tragic and and often is tragic but it is it is quite literally self sacrificial are there any examples of great innovators who we are able to compare metalize the mistaking to to such a degree that they had what seem to be immorally implacable life in every domain except in their business purged that is right some people are very some people are very highly controlled that i some people are able to very narrowly and don't i do not rely want to she myself in example in a lot of this but i will tell you as an example i i will never use at in business i number one number two i have the most placid personal life you can imagine number three we ism the least last person the world is ever do an extreme sport man ism not even going to go in the sawn on the iyesbath they ism noise not doing any this i do not her doing it ism not o levying no i ism no no not i tat i ism not on the tight and ism not you know ism not grim down to see the ti panic witness t you weren't i not doing any the ism not doing any the stuff have no interest i do not all i do not see i have no interest in any of the stuff right and there are and i know people this right there very highchievers is just at they they're they are they are completely segment end there extreme mistakes in business there completely button down on the personal side their completely button down you know financially there they there scute scrupulous who following every rule in law you can pass my imagine but but they are still fantastic innovators and that i know many others who are just they their life is on fire all the time in every possible way and whenever it looks the fire is turning in t embers they finger out a way to relieve the fire it m an they just really want to live on the edge do i i think that maybe i think that is an independent variable an again i would apply the same thing i think the something a plies to the arts you classical music as an example i think bock was you non frat an example one of them we not kind of best o musicians of all time had just completely sedate persona l life never had any averment behavior at all in is personal life family family man cons acids my apparently you now pillar of the community right and if both could be bought and yet not burn his way through three hundred mistresses or whatever maybe your canto in the about these two different categories of invaders those that take on tremendous risk in all domains of their life and those that take on tremendous risk in a very compartmentalized way i i soft knowhow the percentages are i but have to wonder if in this modern age of the public being far less forgivable ism referring to is cancel culture i do you think that we are limiting the number of innovations in total bi just simply frightening or eliminating an enormous category of invaders because they do not have the confidence or the means or the i strategies in place to regulate they are just either bowing out or they are getting crossed off thou getting cancelled one by one do you think the public is less tolerant than the used to be or more tolerant well the systems that a i ism not going to be careful here i think the i the large institution systems are not tolerant of what the public tells them they should not be tolerant of i and if there is enough noise there is enough noise in the mob i think institutions bow out and here ism refrain not just to never they essentially say ora they let the cancellation proceed or they and maybe they are maybe they are the naval that comes down but but they are not the the lever the got the thing going and som not just thing about universities ism also thing about advertisers am thinking about i the big move houses that ism cancel of film that a given actor might be in because they had something in their personal life that still getting worked out ism thinking about people who i are in a legal process that is not yet resolved but the public his decided they area bad person et camera my questions that we really talking about the public iigritegry with question ma come back to it but in in s i m an examine one part of your question which is is this really the public for talking about and and i mud just say exhibit a as who is the current front runner a for the re publican nomination a to day the public behest on one side of the political isle seems very on board right a number to look a there is a certain musician who flew too close o the sun blew himself to smitherand sees still hitting all time highs on a strain a muse ex street every month the public seems fine i i think the public might i i would argue the public as action more open to these things than it actually may be ever has been who could tie what that a case i think it is a it is a diferatiation this is what what your question as among out but it is a differentiation between the public an the leads admits a is a is ai my view is everything you just described as in a let phenomenon a an actually the public is very much not on board with ut scene an and what is actually happening as the division but it was happen as the publican he areas of tapped out the the public is more for giving of of of what previously might have been con ordered kind of been extreme behavior am right is it til have got finger all there no second acts in america lives it turns out completely wrong turns that their second acts there acts forth as apparently concave an linen number of acts the public is actually up for it i mean i think it somebody mi bison right i feel like he is every e no his life exemplifies a everything that is amazing and great and also terrible about america if we took rat tiepin to dinner to night at any restaurant anywhere in the night estates what would happen he be loved o he would be likelord he would be the outpouring of enthusiasm and passion and love would be incredible it would be unbelievelisinis a great example it just the and i not even to get a drop for i naval say are without a disagree that of just we i think we would all intuitively know that the public is just one hundred resat absolutely he is a legend he is a legging hes a living but in love in mine hes a cultural touchstone absolutelyand you see when he shows up it movies right he shows have remember that i man the big rate through i figure the sat with respect to him cause i do not really fall sports but when he s showed up in that it as at that first hang over nevi and he shows out n u now i was in a theatre and the august disc but neon us crazy there is excited to see him yet he evokes delight i always say that ink bison is the only person i am aware of that can wear a hurt with his own name on it and it somehow does not seem a wrong in fact he just kind of makes you him more it is it his ego feels very contoured in a way that a he knows who he isn't who he was and and yet there is a there is a humbleness woven in maybe as a consequence of all that he is been through i do not know but yet people love my public less him now exactly now you now f he shows up to likest hazard i i think you can probably got to got in ti reaction i do not know i do not know win avid simony the a who wrote the wire gave i gave a talk of hazard and and it sounded to me based on his report of that which is very interesting in fact that people adore people who are connected to everybody in that way a villi everybody loves mike from from above his dates besides belongs dates he is just or he he occupies this this halo of o loved adoration o c yet men look at the other side of this as the is is he lets and you con alluding to the is of the institution it basically it is the people who ware at least nominally in charge or fee that they should be entry want to make sure we a defend let you not ness telly taking my people who are wealthy your thing my people who have authority within institution the ultimate definition in able s who can get who fired right that is the old ultimate t who can get who fire blame hotted blacklist to an rostra side when push prosecuted jailed i quid push constoshof right i think that is always the question who can destroy his career and f course you will notice that that is heavily e symmetric even ma men these fights play out there is very clear whet i can get the other the other did firkin which side which side cannot am and yet lick i think we we live in a period of time or the please have gotta to the extreme in a number dimensions in a man in that is characterized by for sure extreme group think am extreme sanctimony a extreme in moral e a dudgeon a you know extreme this this weird sort of modern puritanism ah and then an extreme sort of morality of punishment and terror ah i guess they are perceived enemies a but but i want ted i want to got through that because i actually think i actually this that is a very different phenomenon i think what is happening they least is very different that was happening in t in the population at large and that of course i i think there's a feed back loop in there which is i think the population at large is not on board with that program right i think the elites are aware that the population is not on board of that programmed i think they judge the population negatively as a consequence that causes the least to harden their own positions that causes them to be even more alienating to the populatiment and there you know there sort of an oppositional negative feed back loop ah and yet is canopy and it is but against the sort of question o who who can get who fired and leads are really good at getting normal people fired a ostracize bands hippies in the press whatever h you know for normal people to get a least fired they have to really bantogother id really mount a serious challenge which mostly does not happen but might be starting happened some cases do you think this am power of the of the elects over mastered from social media s or going against its original purpose and think social mediating your giving each in every person there only reality devotion their own voice and yet am we have seen a dramatic uptake in the number of cancellations in firings related to immoral behavior based on things that were either done or amplified on social media it is almost as if am the public its holding the wrong and of the knife yes the way o describe it i use these two terms there is somehow interchangeable but elects in institutions and and there there is somebody interchangeable con runs institutions the elects right is its sort of a self herself r informing think a an now institutions of all kinds institutions at everything from in of government birocracys company's not profit ts foundations engine the companies on anon an on people who are in people who ware in charge of big complexes and the the carry a lot of basically power and influence in capability and money is a consequence of their positional authority right the head of a giant foundation may never have done anything in their life that would constantly never a hatpin of them mass person but they are in charge of this you don't gigantic molt ta billing our complex and have all this par the results that is just defined terms you least institutions am it is early interesting a gallop a a has a been doing poles on the following quit on the question of trust in institutions which is sort of there for proxy for trust in elects a based since the early nineteen seventy a and what you find and and they do this across all the categories of big institutions you o busy every every everyone i s talk about a bunch bothers big business mall business banks newspapers broadcast television a the military police you they got thirty categories or something based what you see is almost all the category base it be started in the early seventies that mixture seventy per cent trust and now they incase i almost across the board they have just done it we had a complete basically linear slide down for fifty years epically my up my whole life a and the the the now bottoming ouch congress and journalists bott amount it ten per cent i e grips everybody hates are congress andjournalists a and then it is a lot of other big institutions are twenty in their twenties thirties forties shall big business she scores fairly high tackactuy scores quite high the military scores quite high but basically everything else has really caved in and this the sort of might fundamental challenge everybody who basically says you you did not do this but you will hear this the simple form of this which is social media cause the current trouble and it is call this in example collapse in faith in institutions and and leads is call that part of the current trouble a eyes i all social media cause antimonic all not social media social media is new right in the last in such meetings effectively new practically speaking since twenty ten twenty twelve as when it really took off and if's the trains started in the early nice en seventies right in is ban continuous then we are dealing with something broader n a martin guy i wrote i think the best book on this call the revolt of the public where he goes through this in detail and and he does he does say that ism social me ye had a lot to do with what is happened last decade besides is yet if you go back you look further it was basically two things coinciding one was just a general change in the media environments and particular the nineteen seven ties is when you started an especially thenineteen eighties is when you started to get am is if we talk radio which was a new outlet a and then you also start you has look out cabletelivision and then you also by the way special interesting in the fifty sixties you a paper back books which is another one of these which was an outlet you you had a fracturing in the media landscape that started in the fifties through the eighties and then of course the inter not ut wide open having said that if the aliases an institutions were fantastic you would know it more than ever she has information is more accessible and the other thing that he says and i agree with is teethe public is not being tricked in the thinking the bilges institutions are bad there the their learning tit their bad right in the mystery and therefore the mystery of the gallop poles why those numbers are not all just aero right which is a you know argufy yknewin lotto cases where they should be i think one reason that and by the way he thinks this is bad he and i have a differ view here is our he and i disagree he thinks this is bad he he basically says you you cannot replace it least with nothing you cannot replace institutions with nothing if if if just what you are just left with is dustpan o be wreckage shin left with us as completely basically atomized how to control society that has no ability o marshall you know any sort of activity any direction is just to be a doggy dog offal in a world i have a very different view on that which we canwhich we can tick about id love to end love to hear your views on that i to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside trackers a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and an e to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health rolls ism a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your teeny and long turn health can only be analyzed

any of inside trackers plans again that is inside tractor do calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off that the quick question always can asked be for we go there is i think that one reason that i an many other people would reflectively assume that social media cause the the demise of our faith in institutions is well first of all i was not aware of this i lack of correlation between the the decline in faith in institutions and and the rise of social media but secondarily that we have seen some movements that have is mentally rooted themselves in teats in comments in posts they get amplified and those treats and comment imposts come from everyday people in fact i cannot name one person who initiated ai given a cancellation or movement because it was the sort of dog piling or mob am adding on to some person of his assent anonymous i think that for many of us we ha we have the bottom to use nor science language a sort of a bottom up in a perspective oh you know some one sees something am in their daily life or experiences something in their daily life and they tweet about it or they comment about it are they post about it and then enough people dog pile on the accused that am it picks up force and then the lets feel compelled u of gated to cancel somebody a that tends to be the narrative and i think the logical conclusion is o on a social media allows for this to happen whereas normal some one would just be standing on the corner shouting or calling lawyers that do not have faith in them and you get the the array broch of itch model of a am the turns into a move but that is a rare case of this lone woman who is got this idea in mind about how am big institution is is doing wrong a or somebody is doing wrong in the world and then can leverage beg institution excuse me but the way the you describe it is that the least a am a leading this o y this shift hotersso what is the role of the public in it i me men just ogive it a concrete example a if for instance no one am tweeted or commented a me to or no one treated or commented about am some ill behavior of some o know universe faculty member or a business person would the let have come down on them anyway oh an ways happening with be somewhat have seen over the ears am is is it its there is much astray trading right now there are entire category of people who are pay to do this a some of them woe call journalist a some of them woe call actives some of them we call in ago now profit some them we call university professors y some of them woe call grastodn whatever they are ay to do this e tuna reason done if you neverelook into the a this in formation a industrial complex there is the sole universe a basically these funded groups that basically do quote cot missing for cot o miss information and and and they are constantly mounting these kinds of attacks they are costly trying to gin up this kind of basically panic to cause somebody get fire to it is not a grassy no it is the opposite resonates no i almost always retrace these things back it was it was a journalist it was an active as it was a it was a pay was a public figure of some kind am these a then there is the are antbornervs in in a sort of word way there there basically there they are paid there they are job mission calling in li it is all wrapped up together they're true believers but there ls getting paid to do it handthere is a giant running common here is a very large running complex for this coming from you knowcertain i profile o people who put huge months money in is it is well known yes well i mean it is not my world this is what the social media companies a ben on the receiving end of for the last escape ah is it is this it is it is base it is basic it is basically a political media active ism complex with very deposits behind it and you have got people who basest literally people who set all day and watch the t v net work on the other side or watch the truer feeds either side and they wait they they basically wait it is every politician is been a case for long time not every every politician who goes out of stuff speeches you see there is always somebody in the crowd of the and quarter r it now with the phone recording them and that somebody from the other campaign who is paid somebody to just be there and record every single thing the polishision says that that when a at money says whatever the forty seven percent thing they've got it on tape and then they clip it and the an the try to make a viral hat the stuff is and again these people believe what they are doing ism not saying it is even dishonest these people believe hat they doing they think they are fighting the holy war they think they are protecting timocracy they think they are protecting civilization they think they are protecting whatever it is they're protecting ah but but they and then they know how to use the tools they they know how the they know how to triage and up the outrage and then by the ways sometimes at work since you social cascades sometimes at work sometimes that does not sometimes they cascade sometimes they do not but if you follow these people and twitter the this is what they do every day there course they trying to life this fire right ah i a so ye it was is really bottom up but it sounds it sort of by the mead level and then and the the captures the elects and then the thing takes on i life of hi his own by the way it also intersects with the trust in safety groups at the social media firms right who are responsible for figuring out who its promoted who its band right across this and you will notice one large social media company has recently changed hands and has tin tempted a different kind of at of trust and safety and all of a suddenly different kind of we cotmovement has all of a sudden started to work that was not working before that and in another kind of by cotmovement is not workings volanymore ah an there is it for sure there is an intermediation happening look that the stuff that is happening in the world to day as being intermediate d through s to media consociate me is the defining media of our time ah but there are people who know how to do this and do this for a living so no i i very much viol this as a have you very much the cancellation way f this whole thing it is it is ait is ait is it is ain it is at a let phenomenon and when it appears to be a grascerous thing it is it is it is it is either grasserates among the elites which heres is possible cause there is e no fairly large number people who are find up for that that particular crusade ah but there is also a lot of castrater from the taken placeinsid then the question is look at what point is the population at large ship pulled into this and and maybe maybe there are movements et certain points in time where they do get pulled in and then may be later they get dis solution than than there is some question there and then there is another question of well if the population at large as in a dose with these moments are or they gin to be the same movements is the fellas want n now the a least howdy least can a react when the population actually fully expresses itself right and there is and i said there is a feed back lute between these where the more extremely fleas get they tend to push the population to markstreme views on whether side and vice virus was sort pinkpinpox back and forth and actives this is our world this explains a lot am i want to make sure that mama ti you a my a shallenburg er math you be a bunches guise have done a lot of work just just if you just look in was called the is in formation industrial complex you will find a network of money and power that is really quite amazing have seen am more n more shellenburger showing up am and hes just that you but on the stop he and he anti be and there just their little just tracking money i is just its it is very clear ow the money flows concluding a remarkable on of money out of the government and wishes of course in theory very concerning very interesting government should not be funding programs that take away people's constetional rights and yet somehow that is whatsment happening very interesting i want to make sure that i hear your ideas about wide the a decline in confidence in institutions and is not necessarily problematic m is its going to be a a total destruction burning down on the to worse that will lead to new life is that your view welsh this this is the thing and and look it is a question if your is couple questions in here which is lost how how bad is it really how bad are they i you know think hit pretty bad a lot them are pretty actually bad a and itssso that is one to question and then you the look the other question is coquet if the institution has gone bad or a grip of lilies have gone bad can can its this wonderful word reform i can can can they be reform and everybody was mast to reform everything and yet somehow nothing ever quite ever gets reformed i a and we don't try to reform you a house and posing to barrier fordectason we are not know long there berlin your houses can ever before somehow reform movements seem to lead to more just more breadstuff but anyway if you have an existing station can it be reform can it be fixed from the inside you the li quad's happening universities there is the lot er there professors a stamford as an example who very much think that they can fix standard i i do not now what you think it does not seem its going and production directions right now ell i mean there many things about staffer that function extremely well an it is a big institution it certainly got its issues any other place a there also my employer i me some interesting looks you wants me to get a little more vocal here a no no you soft no oh no i man i think that i me o seems yet i mean one of the things about being a research or a big institution stamford is what first of all it meats the richer the describe before you look to the left you look to the brighter anywhere above or below you and you have excellence i i my have go noble prize when below me who dad my also want to know about prize and there is scientific offspring is likely to win i mean you it it inspires you to do bigger things than than one ordinarily whale no matter what there is that and that is great and that persists am there is all the a sure critic red tape about trying to get things done and how to implement decisions is very hard a and there lot reasons for that and then of course thereat e the things that a you don't any people aware over there are a public accusations about people and positions a great leadership and that is getting played out ins and the whole thing becomes kind of overwhelming and a little it opaque when you are just trying to b run your lab we're live your life and i think one of the reasons for a this lack of reform that you referring to is because there is no position o reformer right deans are dealing with the lot of issues proves or dealing with a lot of issues presents are dealing with a lot of issues and and then som in some cases and we do not have a dedicated role of reformer some one to go in and say listen there is just a lot of fat on this sand you we need to them it or we needs o create this or you that there is there just as in a system to do that and that is i thinking part because a universities or are built on old systems and it is build it is the n york subway s still it is amazing it still works as well as it does and yet it is got ton of problems also well its to the to the to the point the point win i recon devoted the the ouniversitue specifically but thy the point is look if you do think it we subsequent bad then you have to make it never mind you to fuck out if you think it stud to to rent bat but the population largely does think that at the very least the people are ring institutions ought a really think hard about what that means but people still strive to go to these places and i still hear from people who lit for instance did not go to college or talking about how university degree is useless they will tell you how proud they are that their son or daughter is going to stamford for is going u sea labor is going to banish champagne i mean it is almost to me that is always the most a shocking contradiction is yet these institutions do not matter but then when people one to hold up a card that says why their kit is great it is it is not about how many pushups they can doer that they started their own business most of the time it is their going to this university and i think what is going on here do you think the media voter in the math states can have their tic o to stamford no no no and an and you do not media voter in the states could have the kit admitted to stamford even with perfect tasty no no n this iran age the competition is fierce that it requires more first of all i gan re dealing here yes yo re dealing wither with a small number of very silly institutions people may ad mire them or not most people are have no conductivity to the whatsoever in the statistics in the whoring universities are not doing well the but the population at law a you the may have fantasies about the get going stamford but the reality evidence the have a very very say collapsing vie of these institutions a solo wits is his is show go straight to the question alternatives than right which is toque if you believe that there is classic faith in the institutions if you believe that it is merit at least in some ways a if you believe that reform is effectually impossible then you are face w and can debate each of those but e population at large seems to believe a lot of that a then there is a question of out cant can it be replaced and if are you better off replacing these things basically while the old things still exist or do you actually need to basically clear the field to beableto have the new thing exist the universities are great cay study of this because of the student because of ho student loans work right and the and the wast student long work is to to be able to be a unit be to be an actual competitive university compete you need to have actress to federal student lending is if you do not everybody has to pay out a pocket than it is complete why out to reach for anybody other than a certain class of either extremely rich or foreign now students a see need access federal student on facility to get access to federal studntlon facility to be an a credited university guess who runs the accreditation council i do not know existing universities right sots it is it is it is a it is a it is it is h self wandering machine they they decided the u universities are guess how many new universities get a credit end right easier to be able zero an zero right a and as long as that system is in place an as long as they have the government wired the way that they do in as long as they control who gets access to federal student loan funding of course there is not into be any competition of course there cannot be a new institution its cannot be able to get to scale it is not possible and if you actually wanted to create a new system that was better in the at would thar you doesn't for hundreds of ways i could office office you be better if you restoring to day a it probably cannot be done as long as the existing institutions are actually intact can n that is my conteragainst t to martin which is you we luck we forget to tear down the old there may be a learn o destruction before get the new but we are never going to get to the new if we do not tared on the old when you say counter to martin you telly mut the author of revolt to the larger you surgery says is look is he said basically m what martin says martin says is as follows a the elites deserve contempt but the only thing worse than thesiletes that deserve contempt would be noblesse at all right in in in because any basically says on the other side on the other side of the destruction of the elites in the institutions is is nihilism you are based left with nothing an then by the way there is a nihilistic street coming there is nihilistic street in in the culture in the politics to day there are people who basically would just say yo just our her the whole system down right in thewithout any particular plan for for what follows and you you h i think he makes a good point and that you want to be careful that you actually have a plan on thither side that you think is actually achievable bullet the but again the counteragum to that is if you are not willing to actually carried on the old you are not getting get to the new now whats heiress of course is this is what happens everyday in business right the entire way how how do that the capital is system works the way that is that the old companies when they are no longer the best to what they do they get torn down and then they ultimately die and they get replace by better companies have not seen u seers in a while exactly and we know it is tut interesting is we know in in capitalism in market economy we know that that is the sign of health the sign of how the system is working properly right in fact we get actually judge by and trust authorities in the government on that basis right it is the best to face against and a trustcharges is no people are come entellus an there doing a silica job of it thathat that is how we know we are doing our woman in fact in business we are specifically it is specifically illegal for companies the same minster to get together and plot and conspire and plan and have things these a crepitation bureaus we we would get if i created the equivalent in my companies of the cold of crepitation brow that the universities shave it'd get straight to file prison and i trust violation german act straight to prison people h been sent to prison for that in the business world we know that you want everything subject to market competition we know that you want cat if destruction we know that you want replacement of the old with with superior new just once we get outside of business for all we soft want anythat w we want be say stagnation and log rolling right and in satin o basically you institutional you know as e stress you know an entanglements and conflicts if interest as far as the eye can see and then we are surprised by the results let us play it out as a bit of thought experiment let us say that one small banding together of people who want to start a new university where free exchange of open ideas were unless somebody has egregious behavior violent behavior truly sexually in appropriate behavior against somebody you now the committing a crime i they are allowed to be there there allowed be a student or faculty member were administrator and let you say this a accreditation bureau a loud student loans for this one particular university or let us say that there was an independent source of funding for that university such that students could just apply there they did not need to be part of this this a let accredited group u which is sounds very off y frankly u not surely violent but certainly coercive in the inland in the way that it wall people out let us say that then there were twenty or thirty of those or forty of those do you think that over time that model would overtake the the existing model is it it interesting that those do not exist retie airlock homes the door din bar it is interesting n there is there's two possibilities one as nobody wants that which i do not believe in any other as the system as wired in a way that will o simply not allow it i in you did a hypothetical in which the system would allow it my results that as now course the system w allow that where the people the band together you no have enough money or get enough resources to say look we can we can afford to give loans to a a ten thousand students prior o ten thousand is in a trivial number when thing about the size of a university and and you non the most of them awfully w graduate in four years and the will be turn over and do you think that the e great future invaders would tend to orient toward that model more than they currently due toward the traditional model a mamyuwoad ism trying to get back to yours how do you think that the current model thwarts innovation as well as maybe some ways that it still supports innovation certainly cancellation and the risk of cancellation from the way that we framed it earlier is going to discourage mistakes of the category of mistakes that take risk in at every every do not man that really to fly close to the sun and sometimes into the sun or our doing research tat us just not politically it yet looking in to issues that ow we know you write that that we cannot even talk about on this my cast probably without without causing a distraction of what we are actually tin to talk about but gives up the whole game revery exactly u the i keep a file and it is a written file ism because ism afraid to put it in into electronic form of all the things that ism afraid to talk about publicly because i come from a lineage of advisers who are all three died young and i figure if nothing else it'll die and then you all make it into the world and when we'll say five ten years twenty years and i if not you i know a certain yo when to die at some point n then what will see whereas those issues stand in any event there's thewless getting longer or time or shorter oh it is deathly getting longer tat interesting let's get it is getting much longer i mean u there are just many issues that i would love to explore on this podcast with experts an that i cannot explore just be even if i had a panel of them because of the way that things get sound bite and segmented out and taken out of context its the whole conversation is lost and fortunately they are an immense number equally interesting conversations u that ism excide to have ah but it is it is a lie disturb youremember my schism a no oh i si famous that n the sot history of union is the famous things o there such gnetagnetas is name not li sank o ah that is hit sounds familiar but ism not ism not calling to one and he was the god of redid go communist want genetics a be the the field to genetics with the movies did not approve the field o genetics because of course they belied in the creation of the new man and you non told y quality and genetics did not support that if you were doing the traditional genetics you were you a bit you now it is verily fired if not if not killed and the styles ankle stood up and said a have got martial genetics and have not a whole new field ti genetics the basically as politically compliment and then they ash the implement of that in the agriculture system of the some union and it is it is the origin of one of the binary since that the soli union actually fell which was they ultimately could not feed themselves create a new notion of biology as it really station an lexically cryobiology do soy not only created it they taught it they demanded it they required it and then they implemented it in agriculture a solo yes it is it is i never understood there is much o things in history i never understood until the last debate that one of hem well i send for myself at the level of leading certain things but i do not contort what i do talk about i tent to play on m lush open fields a just makes is goes goes to the rot this goes to the rot and it'll collect your question but dis goes to the rot in the existing system which is were vine by thoughiam no different ism just you ism not ism trying not to myself on fire either but that the rot in the existing system and by system i meanie institutions in the elevates tho the rot is that the set of things that are no longer allow it the in that list is ops expanding over time a and that is a real li is the speaking it does not end in good places is a this group of a particular generation that we can look forward to the time when they entry die off it is short of the boomers bless them money else we got a while good good news bad news we gent henna's as were right gent ism on at genic genius as heard as wee we count a slipped in the middle er were kind we we were kind of the am i do not now to describe it we were the condo non political generation con sandwiches mad the users them kneels gentle is a very i think open question right now which way they go i could imagine them being actually much more intense than the money's all these issues i could also nation that react into the money's and being farmer open minded we do not knowhath is coming go asking to go might be different groups of them genius also forty seven year fifty fifty i o hey ware the same yet robins in john hugs films and were the the jocks and the hippies in the punks and the it we are all divided and they were all segmented but then at all sort of wish mash together a few years later and i thinkthey had a lot to do with you said the sort of a political aspect of our generation just knew we the finishes knew the bombers for nuts right all the crazies is that economical farther one the get accounts oo the air m this family ti is wright wit tin care tor michael piton and you's just the say is just a the be a my boomer hippicparents are crazy have muslin the going business shall to something productive let the there was something iconic about that character and in our culture and you now people like me real obviously going business you do not going political lace to bises and then it is just man that came withe back around with the next generation just a touch for quick on theuniversity thing like there are people trying to do and i'amaxhly can to do a thing this afternoon with the you university often which is which is which is which is one of these and there are people trying to do new universities you now i i don't i say it is certainly possible i hope they succeed ism palling for them i this it be great i think it be great if they were lot more of them who founded the university a this is ta whole group of people i do not known to go freelance on that cause i do not know originally who the idea was universe of often you u t often yes its a not you t often call is called universe of oftener they call it i think it is u at wat is it you t x and in is o lot of very sharp people spoliator with it and then the the they are gong to try very very much exactly h what you describe their try do new one i would just tell you the wall of opposition that there up against is profound i m and part of it is economic which is can they ever get access to federal student landing and i you know i hope that they can but i i you no it seems nearly in conceivable the way the systems rick to day and then the other is just there in a they thenar already have come under having any any anybody any h anybody who publicly assocsays with them who is introduction a de immix media he gets let on fire right in their s cansilaction jampans isothere up against a wall of social ostracism am they are up against a wall of nopressataks am they are up against a wall of am you now people just doing the than point pounding on any any time anybody says anything they can try to pain the place down it is remind me o am merry springer episodes and herald very episodes were am you knows if a teen listen to am panic or marlin mansion type music or metallic that they were con ordered a devil worship right we write now we just laugh right wee that is crazy right e all listen to music with all sorts of lyrics and ideas and looks and and that is crazy am but there were people legitimately sent to prison i thing with the westmamphis three write these kids out and westmamphis that look different acted offering were accused of murders the the eventually was am made clear they clearly did not commit but they were imprisoned because of the music they listen to i mean the sounds very similar to that and i remember seeing bumberseers free the westmenphis three and i thought the a with some crazy thing you look into it and this is and it is all bit niche but am months are real lives and there was a active a which hunt for people that lookdifferent and acted different and yet now we are sort of in this inverted world where a on the one hand we are all told that we can express ourselves however we want but on the other hand you cannot get a bunch of people together to take classes where they learned biology and sociology and con in texts wild yes welsh a you now the simple explanation as it is this is puritanism right his as the original america parent is puritanism the just works itself out though the system in different ways a different times you know there is this phenomena s a religious phenomena on america call the the great awakenings there is austere therefore roll be these periods america history where there a spicily religiosity fades and then there will be the snapback of factory all have this basically this you know from frenzy basically of of religion of yo in the old days it would have and you now want revivals and people speaking in to g small this stuff am and then in the modern world it is it seem ts it is of the form that there we living thought now a yes tispasically these waves the sort of america religious you rumor religion in our time religious impulses in our time do not get expert cause we live and we live in more advance times right we live in scientifically in form times and religious impulses in our time do not show up as over they religious they show up in a secularized form i which of course conveniently as is is there for not subject to the first amendment separation churchman state right as long as the church a secular it is no problem and but but were we are acting out these kind of religious scripts over and over again and we are in the middle of another religious frenzy there is a frame did i hear a lot and i do not necessarily believe it but i want your thoughts on it which is it the pendulum always swings back yet not quite so i feel too because it'll take boy telly great take any number of things that were talked about and i should crazy the the way things have have gone with institutions or its crazy we things have gone with social medlar at crazy bill in the blank and people say well the pendulum always swings back the likest the stock market or something yo afterevery crash they will be an eventual boom and rich fir sir by the way does not interview the right it most most stock markets we have of course survivorship it is all our rivers everything is survive it is all everything to satisfy as she survivorship by us right if you look global most stock markets over time crash and burn and ever recover the america stop market as old recover it always rearrange the america not now but i global but the reason everybody refers the america took market as consist the one that does not do that the other two hundred or whatever the crash and burn and ever recover e let us go check anon the a a an argentina stop market right now i add think it is come a back s me said now my fathers argentine and grade to the you ask in the nineteen sixty he would definitely agree wit now that does not come it does not come enow wen wit en their stockscras they do not come back i and then thrall sanchoism this that union ever recovered from li thanchoism and ever came back at led to the end of the country n literally the things hat took down this o the union ore oil and and we the wheat thing you can trace the race suspect told san cops and at no look i and alloys things back is true only in the cases ran everybody just conveniently forgets all the other circumstances where that does not happen one of the thinks people you see this in business also people have a really hard time confronting really bad news i do not know if you have notice that and like every doctor who is listening rand own aloha but there are situate you student business the a situations that see the star track mover a start fact the kobiachimru a simulator right to the big lesson of he come the start captain as you had to go through the soul nation call the copiashon ruin the point was there is no of it is a no windsnario right and then an then it turned out a captain cork was the only person ever when the saree in the ay that he did it was he we went in had a time and hack the simulator rent it was the only way to actually get through and then there is a debate whether t fire him or make hm a captain they are him a captain and the prom ha in real life we you do get the kobiachimru on a regular basis there are shall no when situations that you cannot work your way out of and at a leader you cannot ever cop to that right cans you have to carry things forward and you hove to look for every every possible trace you can but every once in a while you dozen in hi situation where it is really not re coverage n at least i found people just cannot cop with that so and sow what happens as they basically than they early just excluded from their memory that it ever happen glad you brought up simulators cause i won want to make sure that we talk about the new an emerging landscape of a i artificial intelligence and i could trying a smooth are conversation a a moment to got with the this one a by creating some clever side way but ism not going to except ism going to ask is there a possibility that a i is going to remedy some of what we are talking about let us make show that we ere marked hat for discussion will be later but first off because some of the listeners this pot cast might not be as familiar with a i is perhaps they should be we have all heard about artificial intelligence people her about machine learning et camera but it be great if you could de find to just what a i is em people almost to rely her in think o a robots taking over man awake up and into be in a strap to the bed and my organs are ginning pulled out o mes em that robots are going to be in my bank account they could kill all my children and and dystopia for most clearly that is not the way it skin togo if you believe that machines can augment human intelligence and human intelligence is a good thing tell us what a i is and em where you think it can take us both good and bad yes there was a big debate when the computer was first invent that which is in the nineteen thirty nineteen forties the cur people down turning and john on woman and these people and the big debate at the time was because they knew they wanted build computers that they had the basic idea and no there had been calculating machines before that and there had been there had been these looms that you basely pregame toe punch cards and that there was a there was a are history to computers that had to do it building sort of increase complex calculating machines that they were count upon a track but they knew they were in to be able to build they call a general purpose computer that could basically you could programmed in the way the program computers to day but they ad a big debate early on which is should the fundamental architecture of the computer be based on either a calculating machines catch registers and looms and right and and other things that or should be based on a model of the human brain and they actually had this idea of computers model an human brain back that u and this was this concept of called naval networks and it is especially fairly astonishing from from prefer standpoint the original paper on nail networksaxtually was published in eighteen forty three right theydn't have our level of narial science but the rashly knew about the narrow and they shall had a theory of narcs in their connecting ins synapses and information processing in the brain even even even back the ah and a lot of people's time basically said what we should basically have the computer from the start model after the human brain cause if we could give the computer could do everything that the human bring can do that would be the best possible general purpose computer and then you could have it do poison you could have it you now great art you could have it do all kinds of things humans can do ah it turns out that did not happen ah in our world when happen it stay was that industry when in the other direction it when basically in the model of the calculating machine or the catch register and i think practically speaking that kin i had to be the case cause that was actually the technology that was was practical at the time ah ut but that is the path a wake all have experiences with up to an including the siphon in our pocket is computers built on that bits calculating machine model not the man brain model and what that means is computers as we have come to understand them thatyouknowther basically mathematical savants you know best right they are there really good it doing lost o mathematical calculations they are really good executing these extremely detailed computer programs there hyper literal a one of the things you learn early when your a programmer is as a program the human programmer you have to get every single instruction you give the computer correct as it will do exactly what tell it to do and and an bugs and computer programs are always the mistake on the part of the programmer interesting you never blame the computer you always when the to the programmer cause that that that is the nature of the thing that you are dealing with one downsqore coffin the whole thing ye yet ifs the pro is the programer's fault ah if you not any programmer they'll agree with this o relic a if there is a problemince it is my fault i did it i cannot blame the computer the computer has no judgment it has no ability to introprat synthesize under develop an independent understanding of anything if just at literally just doing what i telling to you step by step for eighty years we have had this just you know of this very kind of hyper literal kind of cold o model computers these are called a technically this her what recalled to nomen machines based her the mathematician shone on nomen they run in that way and they been very successful and very important and a world is then shape by them but there was always this other idea out there which is of robot a completely different approach which as base base much more on how the human brain operates ah or at least or r our kind of best understanding of how the human train operates rightsthose are not the same thing the based says look a what what if you could have a computer siding viper literal what if you could have it actually be conceptual right am and creative and able to synthesize in formation right unable to draw judgments and able to a a behave in a you known ways that are not deterministic but a rather a be creative right and n n in he applications for this of course are endless and for example the self driving car the only way the you can make a you cannot para a computer with rules to make your self driving car you have to do what tesla and harmonies of the companies have done now you have to you e ay i right you t use this other architecture i and you have to basely teach them how to recognize objects an images at high speeds the same way easily the same way the human brain does and those are those are called curl nuthouse running in side essentially let the machine operate bastion priors we we almost clipt a a bowlder going up this particular drive and o therefore this shape that previously the machine did not recognize as a bowlder an now introduces to its catalogue of bowlders is that is that hell we g you example less eve make even starker for self driving car a there something in the road is it a small child or a o plastic shopping back being blown by the wind very important difference if it is the shopping bag you you deftly want to go straight through it be cause if you deviate off course you might if you can make a fast just the same is the same change we have not were driving you don't you do not want a were to vat a shopping back as you might have something that you didn't see in the side it is a small child for sure you want it for right am and it be very bit like in in that moment and small children common different shapes in descriptions and a ring fern kinds of c they might to tumble on to the road the same way of bag would tumblthete might look her tumbling and by the way they might not be r i they might be wearing a hell hallowed mask you writes the base them my mightn't have a recognizable human face right an t might r might be a kid with in one leg right woefully one an not those right light that you cannot this what may see we figured out is you cannot apply the rules based approach of a snowman machine n two basically real life and expect the computer to be in any way understanding or brazilein to change to basically things happening real life this is why there's alias been such a stark divided between what the machine can do and what the what the human can do a and bat badly what is happened as in the last decade that second type of computer of the curl notrepace computer has started to actually work ait started to work artily first and erectly in vision recognizing object an images which was by the driving car starting to work a face recognition face recognition when i was started off in visual our science which is really my original home am in narrow science the idea that a computer were camera could you face recognition better than human was very low probability event am base on the technology we had at the time base on the understanding of the face recognition sells in the five form girls now you would be smartest to put all your money on the machine yet you want to find faces in airports even with masks on and bet aprofileverses straight on machines can do it far better than most all people mean now these super recognizers but even they cannot match the best machines now ten years ago what i just said was the exact never s fate faces handwriting a right a and then voice being able to understand voice a mi cove if use just as use refuse gugledox that it has a built in voice transcription if sort of the vastly industry leading kind of voice transcription if you use voice strinscriptioni gugledox its breathtaking the good you i you to speak into it in it just types what your what you are saying well that is godcause in my phone everyone while it'll say i see to go pick up a few things and they will say i need to pick up a few songs and a ne apple needs to get on board a whatever the voice recognition is the gurgles using maybe it knows you better than you think so i was not the topic was avoiding discussing no say that is on the lesstret you let a a li there there is actually to say that yet there is a reason actually why you a good an apple is not right now wat that kind of thing tit actually goes to actually the especially audiological thing of all of all things am a u apple does not to permit pooling of data a for any purpose including training a my whereas guild does m and an apples just stake their brand on privacy and among that a sort of o pledge that they do not pull your data and all of apples a e is a my that has to happen locally on your phone were as gull's a my can happen in the cloud right can have me cross pool now by the way some people think that that is bad cause they think poorly data bad but that that is an example of the shift that happening finds you create now which is you have the separation between the people who ware embracing the new way of training es and the people who basically for whatever reason are not you m excuse me you you say t some people think it is bad because o privacy issues of thy thing it is bad because of i reduced functionality of that a my oh no you your deaf gan a get u there is three reasons a eyes as started to work one of them is just simply larger data sets u larger amounts of data specifically the reason why objects and images are now the reason machines are now better than humans that recognizing objects images are recognizing faces it is because modern facial recognition a eyes are trained to across all photos an the in and out of people billions and ans and buildings of photos right unlimited number of photos of people an thin and at attempts to train facial recognitions systems ten or twenty years ago they be trained on you now thousand pretends to thousands of photos the input data simply much more of fat much larger this the reason t get to the conclusion on this t this the reason why chat p t were well as that p t one of the reasons that p t were well as it is trained on the entire in and of text and the entire intine of tax was not something that was available for you to train an a ion until it came to actually exist itself which as new and the last not musically debate in the case of face recognition i and see you having a much larder in put data set would be beneficial if the gull is to recognize mark indriesin's face because you are looking for signal the noise against everything else right but in the case of chat g p t when you are pooling all text on the internet and you ask chat g p t to say i construct a paragraph about a mark indrsons prediction of the future of human beings over the next ten years u en the a likely to be most successful industries g each b t that if it is pooling across all text how does it know what is authentically mark indrison's text because in the case of face recognition you have a u you have got a standard to work from a a verified image verses everything else in the case of text you have to make sure that what you are starting with is verified text from your mouth which make sense of its coming from video but then if that video is deep valued all a sudden what is true your your your valid mark indryson is of question and then everything coach b t is producing that is then of question r i would say there is a before and after thing here there is a before there is a before cat pay and after you be t question because the existence if you to itself change changes changes t the answer before chat you b t the reason the writ versionareason today is train an data up till september twenty twenty one ut there s the cot out of the train on the training said up till september twenty twenty one almost all taxman in or not was written by a human being and then most of that was written by people under their own names some of it was not but a lot but a lot of it was and why you knows from me is cause it was published in a magazine under my name or it is a potcascranscript in it see it is under my name and and generally speaking if you just did a search on water thingsmatontdrition is written said ninety plus per sent of that would be would be correct and the somebody might have written a fake party article or something that but not that many people were spending that much time writing fake articles about things i said it how many people can pretend to be exactly right and generally speak you you can content your arms around the idea that there is a corpus in material a say with me or by the way something with you there is a corpus of of you to transcripts another your uracconomic papers and talks you given nun kind of get your hands around that and that is that is how these systems are train that theythey take all that dato collect my they put it in there and and that is why this works as well as it does and that is why if you asked chat u p t to speak or write me or you or somebody else it ut will silly generally do really good job cause it betas that it has all r prior to text its in its training data that is at from here on out this gets harder and of course the reason this gets harder is because now we have a in create tax we have a i this can great tartar industrial scale e water marked is a i generate as noon not how hard would it be to do to i think it is impossible i the it is i possible there are people who are trying to do that this is a hot topic in the class your mush stacking a friend is got a fourteen to get in in in a class and there is the is recurring scandals the every kit in the class is using c p tits wright their essays or to help them wright their essays a and then the a the the teacher is using one of there is a tool that you can use that it reports to be able to tell you whether something was written by c p t but it is only right sixty per cent of the time and there is this case where the student wrote an essay where their parent sat and watch them write the essay and then they submitted at in this tool got the conclusion a correct and then the student feels outrage was he got on fairly cheated but the teacher is pile here all using the tool then it turns out there is another tool that basically you feet in text in achy is sort of ah it its they call it a summerier motor really is is the cretin mechanism to basically just a shuffle the words around enough that it sheds whatever characteristics were associated with there i go an arms race going on in educational settings right now round this exact question i do not i do not think it is possible to o they re people working on the water mark anything its possible to the water marking and i think it is just kind of obvious why it is not possible to do that which is you can just read the output for yourself it is it is really good how are you actually on to tell the difference between that in something that a real person wrote and the by the way you can also ask j g p t to write in different styles right you can tell it you a wright in the style of a fifteen year old right you can tell it to wrist in the style of you know a non native english speaker right or if you are not native english speaker you can tell to write in the style of an english speaker a native english speaker right and tithe tool itself will help you evade i i do not think that no there is a lot of people who are in a want to distinguish right quortreal very is far i think those days are i think those days are over genies a b i genes a put out the bottle by and by the way i should think its this does not map to this does not after my world of view of how we use the tactknowledgin anyway which which we can come back to there is that is that s and and then there is the problem therefore of the called date problem then ther'sthe problem deliberate basically manipulation and that is liken one of your and when one of your many enemies i fly istenemies mine who badly is while i know i in to get i right i an i i an am in a create i ani am use it to create something that looks a human transcript what ism an havehi' sales bad things n radio or cavity or aviation me jo organ and i were deep faked inevidio i soft want a flag people to it i wont i will not talk about what it was about but where it for all the world look a conversation that we were having and we never had that specific conversation coulis that's can happen for sureanc there there is cants what there can an need to be as her me t be basely registries where basically you you n think in your case you will you will ism submit your legitimate a contact into a registry under your unicryptograpic hey right and that basically there will be a way to check against that registry to see whether that was the real thing and i think this needs to be done for for our for public figures andyou spent for politicians and you nus be done for your music what about taking what is already out there and being able to authenticated or not in the same way that many times per week i get asked is this your account about some a direct message that somebody got on histogram and i always tell them look i only have the one account this one verified o count although now with the advent of pay to play verification makes it a little less potent as a no security blanket for knowing fit is not this account then it is not me but in any case the is accounts pop up all the time pretending to be me and i ism relatively low on the on the scale not at not low but relatively low on the scale to say a a bonsai or something that who has even hundreds of millions of followers is there a system in mine where people could go in and and verify tax click yes or know this is me this is not me and even there there is the opportunity for people to fudge to eliminate things about themselves that they do not want out there by saying now that not me it was not i i did not i shoe say chatter create that that is right and yes technologically tie saltily pretty straight for that the wit implements this biologically as with public you public cryptography which is the basis for how your cryptography information is secured in the world to day and and busy what you would do the implementation for me this would be you would you would pick whatever is your most trusted channel i say it less an trug you to channels in example were just everybody just knows that it is you an your you to channel as you've ben doing it for ten years or whatever i is just obvious and you just publish in the about me page on you you to you just publish you you your public cryptographic key that is unique to you right and that any time anybody wants to check to see whether any piece of content is actually you they go to the registry in theclaus somewhere and they basically submit they basely say locate is this him and then they can basically youth see whether somebody with your public key you had actually certified that this was at that you made am now who rents that register is interesting question am if that register is run by the government we will all that the minister ministry of truth i think that is probably a bad idea am if that register is run by a company a we would you now call that basically the tuition of a credit beer or something that maybe that is how it happens the problem with that is that company now becomes hacking target number on right if every bat bat person on earth right as you can you know anybody brace into that company you know they can they can they can fake all kinds of thing that they own the truth rightly on the truths right and and by the ay in side is right also their employes can monkey with it right see if to really trust that company am the third way to do is with a watching right and this whether the crypt blocking topology you could have a distributed system this distributed at ta base ah in the cloud that is run through aboachan and that implements this cryptography in the certification process what about quantum inner net am is that another way to script these things i know a most of our listers ware problynough familiar condom in er net but i put simply it is away to i secure communications on the in er net let yous leave it at that i it is sophisticated and all pro you a whole episode about this is some point but maybyou have a second way of describing quantum inner net but that would be better and if please please offer it up but is quantomin her net going to be one way to secure these kinds of baton and resources you may be in in the in the future years the future we do not yet have working quoting computers an practice it is not it is not currently something you could do but may be may be indicator to i tell me men to take a stab at to finding quake ad dinner net one sentence is a way in which if any one were to try and peer in on a conversation on the inner betta sensually would be futile because of the way that a quant mineurnette a a change is the way that the communication is happening fast and many times in any one conversations chest specially changing the translation or the language fast that there is just no way to keep up with it is that more or less accurate o inconceivably not not yet but o going back to a i most people here about a i are afraid of a i u and i will well i think most who are not in form just goes back to our letters as masses thing oh interesting i well i heard you say that and this is from a really wonderful tweet thread that we will link in the shownote captions that that you put out ism not long ago and that have read now several times and that every one really should take the time to read it pride takes about twenty minutes to read it carefully and to think about each piece in it is a highly recommend it but you said and quoting here let us address a the fifth the one thing i actually agree with which is a i will make it easier for bad people to do bad things yes limos ass at install there is a general freakout i happening noonday i i think it is frimerarly it is one of these against in all driven freakout i do not think the man in the street now not cares or feels one or the other i as there not a relevant concaptans probably to sonsicsatisfection ism there is there is i think there is there's n lea driven freak out this happening right now i i think that i lea driven freakout has many aspects to it that i think are in correct just not surprising i would think that given that i think females are in correct a a a lot of the s but i thing there very wrong about a number of thngsthey relaying about a i a but that is sad luck it is a it is this is a very powerful new tocology wrist this is a new general purpose thinking technology right what if machines could think wright and what if you could use machines that think and what if you could have them think for you there is obviously a lot of good that could come from that a but also people what criminals could use them to plan better primes a you you derris could use theme to plan better tour attacks and forth and these are going to be tools that bad people can use to do bad things fortune a i can think of some ways i could be leverage to do fantastic things am in the realm of medicine and a i pathologist perhaps can scan ten thousand slides of histology and find the one mig cry tumor cellar aberration that would turn into a full blown tumor whereas the a even mildly fatigued or well rested human pathologist t as great as they come might miss that and perhaps the best solution is for both of them to do it and then for the human to verify what the a i is found and vice firstmimisr that's just one example i and i can come up with thousands of examples where this would be wonderful a you've another another medicine a you talking about someanataletic result which is good important the other is the machines areca be much better bedside manner theory me much better dealing with the patient can we already note there is already ben a study there's ridgy ben a study on this o the is already study done in this m a where a the there is a a a study tom scrape thousands of medical questions off if an in in it forum and then they had real doctors answer the questions and then they had busy deputy for answer the questions and then they had another panel of doctor score the responses right there are patience experiment that on here this is a last can contain within withwithin the medical world but the that that the the panel of the judges the panel o doctors through the judges score the answers an bifacial accuracy and on out bedside manner i on empathy and the deputy for r was o was scum was equal or better on most of the factual questions analytically already om in it is not even a specially trade medimedically i om but it was overwhelmingly better ism on empathy amazing right om and you know i don't think i do not you you treat patient do treat patients directly an you are real you do not yes o how will do we run clinical trials but i do not i do not do any direct clumsy i your give no direct euxstress to this but from the surgeons give from her which you talk to surgeons or you talk to people who train surgeons what they will tell you is urgent been to have an emotional remove from their patience in order to do good jo with the surgery the side effect of that a and by the way look it is a hell of a job to have to go in and tell somebody that there in a die rete that they have see that i never n a re cover then even a walk again er whatever it is and there is a there sir something inherent in that job where they to keep in emotional reserve from the patient right to e able to do the job and it expected of them as professionals the machine has no such limitation think the machine be his sympathetic as you want it to be for as long as you want it to be it can be infinitely sympathetic it is happy to talk you it for in the morning it is happily sympathize with you it is and by the way it is not just sympathizing you in the way that oh it is just li with us making up words to li to you to make you feel good it can also sympathize with you in terms of helping you through all the things that you can as you do to improve your situation right and you o boy if you can you keep a patient actually on track with the physical therapy program can you keep a patient on track with the nutritional program can you keep a patient off a doctor alcohol right and if they have a machine medical companion that is with them all the time that they talking to all the time that is infinitely patient infinitely wise right infinitely loving right it is busting to be there all the time and is can be encouraging and is can be saying you do such a great jive yesterday i know toucan do the again to day conto behavior therapy is an obvious fit here these things are gong to be great its says we b t and that is that is already starting be you can already use chat p t visas is a s b tthervis if you want it actually quite good at it and there is there is a universe here that is it goes to what you adhere is a universe here that is opening up which is what what i believe it is its it is partnership between man machine right it is its the symbiotic relationship not an arsenal relationship and that the exactly the doctor is going to pair with a i thou do all the things you described but the patient is also going to pair with eh i and i think it is i think i think this this partnership that going to mergescan to lead among other things to actually much better helthour comes have realized for much of my life on excellent mentors from a very young age and still now in order to make best decisions possible with the information i had and rarely were they available for in the morning sometimes a but not on a frequent basis and they fatigue anybody else and they have their own stuff anybody else baggage events in their life et camera what you are describing is a sort of a i coach or therapist of sorts that hopefully would learn to identify our best self and encourage us to be our best self and when i say best self i do not mean that in any kind of pop psychology way mean i could imagine e i very easily knowing how well i slept the night before and what types of good or bad decisions i tan to make it to o'clock in the afternoon a when have only had five hours of sleep or may be just less red sleep the night before i might encourage me to take a little more time to think about something makeamel a tap on the rest through a device that no one else would detect to you do not refrain from something never can judge you s never can be resentful it is nevergin to be upset you do not listen to it it it is never gringo on vocation it is can to be there for you like i think this is that this is the way people are going to live its can a start with lives and then over time as can be also the way people arguing to live is there going to have a exactly friend therapist companion mentor coach teacher right assistant and that that that that or or by the way bay be multiple of those if it may be that ration time with six different poisons interacting which is o hole another possibility but there can a hame little i committee i committeetait differ person's and and make by the we when they're difficult decisions be are your life may be what you want a here is the argument among the different prisons a and you are just going yet you are just going to grow up your just going to have this in your life and you can always be able to talk to it and always be able to learn from it and always be able to help it ma don't and it is just gest going to it is gat its con be a somatic relationship its can stings be much better wen to live the the if you lar any a lot you of it what modalities will it includes i can imagine a my phone has this am engine in it o this a it companion and ism listening in head phones as i walk in to work and it is giving me some not just encouragement some warning some am thoughts that i things that i might ask markindrecent today that i might not have thought of and on a i could also imagine it having a more human form i can imagine it being a tactile having some tactics tapping to remind me that its not can enter our conversation in a way that that it interferes ore distracts you but i would be ware right a you don't things of that sort i mean how many different modalities are we going to alow these a i coaches to approach us with and is anyone actually thinkingabout the hard wore piece right now cause ism hearing a lot about the soft ware piece a what is the hard earpiece look yes the antis as where sell aboulia con t and the ountrponeral community is going to try all of those at god by thewy the be companies an and and turn o seen to try all those and there is obviously there is big companies that are working you know there the big companies of a talked about a variety of these including you know had of displays a are of ye are kinds of things am of there is lots of people doing voice yo voice thing is voices are real possibility at me just be an an your piece a there is a new start up that just unveiled a a a new thing i where is actually they actually project you will have a pendent you wear a necklace and it ritually projects literally project imagist on your hand you're on the table a on the wall in front of you me be that is how it shows up a father people working on called attic or touch base a kinds of things there are people working on actually picking up on near signals to of your arm am right to be able to i a to be able to a do there is some people there is enough there is some science for being able to do basically sopulcl station am maybe you could pick up you could pick up that way a do not conduction yettthese are all going to be tried as one question is the physical form of it and then and the the other question is the soffroversion of it which is to a what is the level of abstraction that you want to deal with these things and liken id you writ wright now what is a question answer a part i i itself a chariot ask questing an answer as a question an answer well you want the have to go for surety more of a fluid conversation you ante to gild up more knowledge if you are and you do not want have to explain yourself a second time and forth and then you want to be able to tell it things lie will remind me this the matter you non be sure to to me when acts a but then may be over time more and more you want et actually deciding when it is can talk to you right and when it thinks it has something to say it was at otherwise to stay silent and and normally at least in my head unless i make a concerted effort to do otherwise i do not think in complete sentences presumably this the a i these machines could learn my style of fragmented internal dialogue and a maybe have in your piece and ism walking in and and i start hearing something but it some that you know advice et camera encouragement discouragement but at some point those sounds that i hear in an aerophone are very different than seeing something your hearing something in the room we know this based on the normal science of musical perception language perception hearing something in your head is very different and i could imagine it some point that the a i will cross a precipice where if it has in line wiring to actually control neral activity in specific brain areas and i do not mean very precisely even just stimulating a little more prefrontal cortical activity for instance through the ear piece l ultrasound wave now can stimulate prefrontal quarters in a non invasive way that is been used clinically an experimentally am that the a i could decide that i need to be a little bit more context aware right ah this is something that is very beneficial for those listening that are trying to figure haw a navigate through life it is young know the context your in and know the catalogue of behaviors and words that are appropriate for that situation and not others and ah this would go along with agreeableness perhaps but strategic agreeableness right context is important m there is nothing diabolical about that content is important but i could imagine yet recognizing out ward entering a particular environment ism now actually in a ramp up activity in prefrontal quarters a little bit in a certain way that allows you to be more situational aware of yourself an others which is great unless i cannot necessarily short circuit that influence because at some point the a i is a half then controlling my brain activity and my decision making an my speech i think that is what people fears that once we cross that precipice that we are giving up control to the artificial versions of our human intelligence look i think we have to decide we we collect e longways individuals i think have to decide exactly how to do than and this is the big thing that i believe about a i is just a much more i was a practical view of the world than a lot of a panic that your is just these are machines they are able to do things that increasingly ore the things that people can do in some circumstances but these are machines we built the machines we decide how to use the machines w rot the machines turned on there turned on wit oft ten turned off there turned off and yes i i think that is absolute the kind of thing that the individual persons should always be in charge of everyone was in i have to imagine some people are till afraid of crisper of genetic a bagenetiting stands to revolutionize our treatment of all sorts of diseases inserting into leading pedicular gives in adulthood right not having to a re combine in the mom a new a new organism is an immensely powerful tool and yet the chines scientist who did crisper on humans this has been done actually did is nostoc it stamford with steep quake than went to china the crisper babies mutated am something i believe it was the h i the one of the h i b receptors ism told it was with the intention of augmenting human memory it had very little to do in fact with limiting susceptibility tach the per say to do with the way that that receptors involved in human memory am the world demonize to that person we es he do not know what happened to them whether not they have a laboratory now or there sitting in jail it is unclear but in china an elsewhere people are doing crisper on humans we know this i meat's not legal in the you ass in of other countries but it is happening am do you think it is a mistake for us to fear these technologies much that we back away from them an end up ten twenty years behind other countries that could use it for both benevolent or a malevolent reasons yes it is always and you ow wit that you it the details matter it it is technology by technology but i say there to two things there is a you always have to think an in these questions i think it terms of contrfatinals and opportunity cost right and chipper's interesting one crisper man if you lave the human gene nature may place the human gene like in all kinds of ways that when you pick a spouting yo have a child with that spousal for you a in at a recombination you are really you are quite possibly i you no with your gang as con you your determining the future of humanity right by those relic y nature i may me t mutations this is the of this is the old question of basically sateen us is all state of nature state of grays we do not basically it is nature good and t there for artificial things are bad ah you which is kind of shot an like people hae ethical views that am ism always of the view that natures of bitch and wants us dead nature's out to get us man nature was to kill us right am nature wilts to evolve all kinds of horrible virus as nature as in plagues nature at to to whether nature nature us to all kinds of stuff i me like the the original nature religion was e original religion right that was the original thing people worshipped n the reason was because nature was to thing that was out to get you right a before you had scientific andtechnological methods to be able to to be able to deal with it the idea of not doing these things to me is just saying all were just gin a turn over the future of everything to nature r and i do not think that there is no reason to belie that that leads in a particularly good direction or bet you knot the that is not about value initial decision ah and then the related thing that cons from that is this always this question around was called the precautions principle ah which shows up in all these conversations somethings ripper ah which basically is this it is this principle that gasify says the inventors of a new technology should be required to prove that twill not have nakeetive effects before they roll it out ah this of course is a very new idea this is actually a new idea of in eighteen seventies ah issestu invented by the german greens an eighteen seventies a before that people did not think in those terms people just invented things a and roll them out and we got all modern civilization by people inventing things and and and rolling them out ah the german greens came up at precautions principle for one specific purpose ill bet you can guess what it is a it was to prevent taken nuclear power a it was to shut down attempts to do as civilian new clear power ah and if you fast forward fifty years later you're wow that was a big mistake right a wit wat what they said at the time was you have to prove that new clearactors ere not when i melt out an calls all kinds of probes in of course as an engineer can you prove that that will never happen you an't you you cannot full out thingsthat might happen in the future ah and that that philosophy was used to stop new clear power by the way not just in rope but also you us and around much o the rest to the world if your somebody who concerned about carbonamissions of course this is the worst thing that happened in last fifty years and terms of energy we actually have the silver bullet answer to unlimited energy with your carbonomissions new clear power we we choose not to do it not only we do you choose not to do it reshes shutting don the plants that we have now right in californium we just shut down young the the big plants germany just shut down their plants germanous the middle of an energy war with russia right that we are informed as existential for the future of rope but unless the risk of new clear a power plan a knelt down has increased in have to imagine is s on the other way am what is the rationoun behind shutting down these plants and not expanding because new clear as bad right newclears sky new clear is newclnewclear has been tag just sounds bad clear ye yet ow new clear you careful what ha what have n shut down postal offices and y here go postal wat what happen was new clear technology arrived on planet earth as a weapon right it arrived and in the form of the t first thing they did is tog the middle world wore to the first thing tit was the atom pom they drops one hand and then then there were all the debates the followed a round toe clear weapons and disarmament and there is a whole conversation to be had by the way about that is there s it different views you could have on that an then it is in fifties an sixties where they started o roll out civilian clear power and then there were accident there were melt thrower access or was likening o through mile island melted down and in an uturnoble you know melted down in soothe union and even recently you know fucushima melted down an another hade been melt down and i think it was a combination of it is a weapon it is sort of sky this suppose ens the scientist some times of the i factor right i sort of stenos radioactive glow green you know by the ay it becomes ta s it becomes a mythical fictional thing in see of all these movies of horrible you no supervillains power by an clear energy an a this all this stuff well the inside of the siphons right is the new clear power plan and the three eyed fish in the t all to all the negative implications is new clear power plant run by at least on the stepson's idiots and that is the a the dystopia where people are unaware of just how bad it is and who owns the c clear power plant ran is evil you know the the evil capitalist strict lying its connected till can no capitalist am right and s blaming tat groaning for the demise of cretin the certainly did not help right u but if literally this amazing thing were it you just thinking for just thinking rationally scientifically you are o can we want to git red a carbon this is the obvious way to do it soda for fact richer ninon a i two two things it really matter in the one is he defined in nineteen seventy ones and they call project independents a which was to create a thousand new state of the a and clear plants cavilling to clear plants in the you last a the candy and to get you as completely off of oil i cut the entire guess energy great over to new clear power electricity cut over to electric cars the whole thing detached from car ebon am you will notice that did not happen a why do that not happen cause he also created the e pe and the new fly regulatory commission which then prevented that from happening right and the nuclear regulatory commission did not authorize a new nuclear plant in the u use for forty years why would he him string himself that and we got distracted shwa by but water gate yean best no ai think elsburg just died recently i i really suspending on papers yes this they obligated but it is the ya exactly its this thing yet he did not youknow he left off ice shortly the after he did not have time to fully i figure ten out i do not nowhither he would have figured it out or not you knot look forward could a figured it out carter could a figured it out dragon could figured it out any disguise could figured it out it is the most oven knowing what we now to day it is the most obvious thing in the world the rush a thing is the amazing thing is rope is literally funding rushes invasion of crane by paying them for oil right and they cannot shut off the oil cause they will not cut over to new clear right and then a cops what happens cause then here is the other kicker of what happens right which is they wont do nuclear but they wanted to renewable right sustainable energy and what they do as they do a solar and wind learn wind are not reliable cause it sometimes gets stark out and sometimes the wind s blow and then what happens this they fire office coal plants right and the shall consequence of the precautionary principle for the purpose it was invent said is a mass of spite can use of coal the they going us back over a hundred year yes correct that is the consequence of the cautioned principle that is the consequence of that mentality and it is a failure of a principle on its own merits for the thing it was designed for and then there there is a whole movement of people who want to apply it t every new thing and and and this is the topic on a i write wand in washington which is all my god these people have to prove that this can never get use for it things i am hung up on is nuclear thing and and i wonder u can it just be renamed i mean seriously i mean that there is something about the naming of things we know this in biology right i mean a lamarqui and evolution in these that the bad these are bad words an biology but we had a guest on this potato did rechavius over in israel who is shown inherited traits but you talk about his we marry and than it has all sorts of negative implications but he is the his discoveries have important implications for everything from inherited drama to treatment of disease i mean there is all sorts of positives that await us if we are able to frame our thinking around something that yes indeed could be used for evil abut that has enormous potential and that is in agreement with nature write this fundamental truth that a least to my knowledge know one is revising in any significant way any time soon what if it were called something else cause heave new clear its it is called a sustainable right i mean it is amazing how marketing can can shift our perspective of robots for instance or a anyway ism sure you can come up with better examples than i can but a is there a a good solid par a firm working from the new clear sight thunburgan grenethonbrkai a see thumburgy and thunburgan if she got if she was in favor of it ye which by the ay she is not she is headset and list it she said that honor percent ya ta based on used on gravy burglar principle is prevailing the prevailing as they can avion mantis om fit fifty years ton the new clears evil they they will not consider it there are by the ay certain environ mentalist who disagree with us and start brand as the one that spend the most public and he has in packable credentials in the space and he wrote the holes cattle on doors downward a dam he is rented hoe much of to rearing u sing booksense and he he wrote a recent books that goes through and detail es us obviously the correct environmental thing to do is nowtlear power can we should b we should be implementing project in dependence we should be building a thousand we shulspecifically we should he did not say this that is what i was say we should hire charges cook i should harder cop industries right a they should build us a thousand to clear par plants then we should give him the presidential mental freedom for saving the environment and that right wat us independent of our reliance on way ya there we are done with royal wontons think about what happens or done with oil zero missions we are one with ha midday eat were done we are done we were not drooling or not doing on america land any m r were not growing on foreign lands we have no military entanglements an places where were drilling were not despoiling the lanka were not nothing no off for rigs no nothing were done and you be we to eyes build state of the art plants engineer properly you have the just completely contained when there is new their waste you just inhume the waste right in concretes it it t just sits there your forever a it is is very small you no footprint you no kind of thing and you rusty done and this the to me a si scientifically technologically this is just the most obvious thing in the world a it is a massive tell on the part of the people who claim to be proven varment that they're not in favor of this and if i were to say am treat that ism prone new clear power because it is the more sustainable former power if i hypothetically did that to day what would happen to me in this in the crypt dachas o dirty you activist monster he er you ism unlikely to run that experiment ow ways what we call a a donkey experiment it is yermanan artery after your terrible human being we that we were looking for evidence the your terrible hi being a now now we know it right it a this is a get example of of the it i i gave i after a book in the way not here with this my favorite new books in the title of t is when reason goes on holiday this is a great example of it is the the people who are o do the people who simultaneously say there environmentalist to say there aunt a new clear power the the positions simply do not reconcile but that does not bother them at all i be clear i predict none at none of this willhappen amazing h i need to learn more about on clear power long cold long call once investing call because you think we are just in a revert it is the energy source of the future lo cause it cannot be solar and wen does there not reliable so need something it it is not in clear its can no be either royal natural ass re call and you are unwilling to say bet on new clear because you do not think that am the so political the least friends that are driving against new fly a likely to dissipate any time soon not of chance i cannot imagine it would be great if they did but that that it is they are the the the powers that we are very octan on this as a position i they have been faintness for fifty years and they have to reverse themselves off it a bad position if at for fifty years people really do not to do that one thing that is good about this and other podcast that young people listen and they eventually will take over and by the way i well say also that there are yo tier to perverse a there are a silly be there are but open on it there are much if young ountrepernervus who are basely not taking now for an answer men there trying to develop ut in particular as people trying develop knew very small form factor under their power plants with the variety possible use misses you wont look maybe you knot may be they show of per the better mouse trap on people take a second look but we will say just rename it a my understanding is that you think we should go all in on a i with the constraints that we discover we need in order to rain in safety and things an a sort not unlike social media not unlike the internal i do not what we should have done with the clear power and in terms of the a your infinite number of ways that a i can be in vision to harm us how do youth we should cope with that but psychologically now because it canmagine a lot of people listening this conversation or think it oke that all sounds great but there are just too many what ifs that are terrible right what if the machines take over would if in all the silly example i gave earlier but what one day i go log into my a harder in bank account and it is all gone the version of myself ran off with some one else and know with all my money o right in my a eye coach abandon me for somebody else after learned all the stuffs that i taught it it took off with somebody else strand it and it has my bank account numbers this kind of thing it really make the scary horrible right if you kept going saved a well we can throwing a benevolent a example as well a to counter it but a sit l kind of fun to think about where the human mind gosh first i i say we got ta separate the real problem in ti fake problems and there is a lot they'll lot of kinetic concerns i think die us not real and the once you decide an example like it is not that is not what is can happen and i can ex plain we this not was can happen you you shouldtthere is a set of it taste of fake once the fake ones or or one ore the ones at just earns i think pathologically grounded then oat rational it is the a s can a wake up an beside to tell us all it is can a by god's can at develop the kid of agent see rest can a stealer money her plenty in eurstots in everything else kids a i that is just that's not ow it works a and then there is also all the concerns din you destruction of society concerns and is is is information heetspeech pdeefaks all that stuff ah which i i don't think it is a real as a is actually real problem a another there is a but people of a much of economic concerns around am you no was can to take all the jobs and all this kinds of things we could talk about that i do not think those those anethole are i contain that actually the thing that happens but then there are two actual real concerns that i shall do very much agree with and one of them is is what you said which is a bad people doing bad things and there is there's a whole set of things to be done inside there the big one is we should use a i to build defenses against all the bad things right and for for example the there is a concern a s can make it easier for for bad people to build pathogens right is i pathogens and laps whichshe no bad people bad scientists can do to day but thisngkin to make it easier easier to do well obviously we should have the equivalent of an operation work speed operating you now in perpetuity anyway right but then we should use a i to build much better by our defenses right and we should be using a i to day to design firexample full specter vixens against every possible form of pathogen right and we defensive mechanism am hacking you can use i to build better defense to us right and you should you should have a whole new kind of security sweet wrapped around you wrapped around your day tor rapped around your money were you you you are having a i a repel am attacks i dis in formation ha speech deep facts all that stuff you should have an a i filter when house the in not where it you you should not have to figure out whether it is really me or whether it is it is a made up thing you should have an a i assistant is doing that for you oh i mean these sill banners and cloaks the used on social me this has been deemed missing formation if your me you always care r it like as you what is behind the scrim and then or this is a i do not always look at that the this image is is gruesome time things sometimes i just pass on that but if it is something that seems debatable of course you look why you should have it you should have an a i assistant with you wen your hin or no you should beagle to tell the a i assistant what you want right yes i want the full i want the full experience o show me everything u i want it from a cut point of view and i do not want to hear from these other people who i do not i by the way it seem tot my eight year old is using this i do not want anything that can a cot cause of problem i want everything filter and and and eh i base filters that that you program an control a in a work much better it man be much more honest and straightforward and clear in forth than what we have to day anyway its basely what i want people o do as think every time you think of a risk of how can be used just think of lack we can use such a build a counter measure in the great thing about the center measures is this can not only offset a i risks they can offset other risks right cause we already live in a world where passage and are problem right we ought to have better valines anyway right we already live in a world where the a syprahacking seprataris m there already live in a world where there is bad content on the or not and we have the ability now to build much better a i power tools to deal with all those things i also love the idea of the a i physician you do not getting decent health carer in this country is difficult even for people who have means or insurance can the number of phone calls an waits that you have to go through to get a before to see specialist i means at it is absurd i mean the process of is absurd i mat it makes one partly or frankly ill just to go through the process of having to do all that i do not know how any one does it and grant i do not have the highest degree of patience but ism pretty patient and it drives me insane to you just get a remedial care but i can think of a lot of benevolent uses of a i and an ism grateful that you bring this up and i hear and that you have tweed about it in that thread again will refer people to that and that you are thinking about this i have t imagine that in your roll is invest er am nowadays that your also thinking about a i quite often a in terms of all these rolls am and does that mean that there are a lot of a young people who are really bullion e i and are going for it o we this is here distal o now we have new o am crisper which is sorted in this liminal place where boy at companies are not shore if they should invest or not in in a in crisper because it is unclear whether not the governing bodies are going to along netted just it was unclear o fifteen years ago if they were going alougyin faraway but now we know they do allowing there enemy of the there is a fight i have you said that there is a fighters a fight happening in washington right now o for exactly what should be legal are not legal a and there is quite a bottom rest i think attach that fight right now cause there are some people and there the are be telling a very effect of try to try to get people either outlay i or specific we limited to a small number of it companies which i think is petecually disastrous a by the way you also is supernegative a button has turn supernegative on badly all ne to orgy they are moving to try to outlay i which if they succeed out law e is flight o do not want it but that is saying i an outlaw the inner and it i do not see how you can stop this train iamb frankly they are not be fan of thenar not either there i think they regret you has a very e especially at you bear across the people run t you in bruises have a very negative view on a lot of maternity but what ism hearing here calls to mind things that have heard people davit got and say which is there many a lazy undisciplined people out there that nowadays it is easier and easier to become exceptional have heard him say something to that extended almost sounds there's many countries that are just backing off of a particular technologies because it just sounds bad from the pair perspective am that it is creating great and low hanging fruit opportunities for people to barge forward and countries to barge forward if they are willing to embrace the stuff it is but u never when you have have a country that wants to do that a those exists in the their countries that a band then the other is look they they need to be able to withstand the attack from o stronger countries that do not want them to do it right you t at you has nominal control over what whatever it is twenty given or whatever member countries even if your whatever the german get all fired up about whatever rustles con still in allot o cases just flat out is s we control them mate the not to do it right and then t you less let me look we have we have a lot of control over a lot of the world butte sounds like we sit somewhere sort of in between they a now people are developing a i technologies in you es companies right it is happening that it to day as happening but us that there is a set of people who are very focus in washington wit now about trying to either banned outright am or trying to as i said limited to a small number bi companies am and then look china's got a whole of the the the run in the sister china got a whole different cannot take on this right than we do and they're of course going to allow it for sure but they'ecn allow in the ways that that their their system wants ifs i happen right we just hear much morse for pot population control am ant implement of authoritarianism a and then of course they they they are going to spread their technology and their vision of how society should run across the world right we were were back in a cold word anemic we wreath a of ta union where there are two different systems that have fundamentally different views on on issued yo concepts freedom and n individual choices freedoms each and on am and you wont we know where the chines stand were still fingering out where we stand if their to of s time having a to of gets of frantic ism having specifically a lot us gets of frantic conversations of people in to see right now where if i talk to them at china does not come up they just attack they hate camera con test companies they hate a i they hate social media they ate this they hate that they the script out they ate everything and they just want punish men ban and they are just very very negative but then if we have a conversation half hour later we talk about china then the conversation totally different now we need a partnership between the us government and america test companies to defeat china its i es the exact opposite discussion ribs that four competitiveness on china specific on on in terms of the the guess response in washington when you bring up these technologies s it'll lump crisper in their things crisp or new clear power a i an all sounds very cold very history into a lot of people and yet there all these benevolent uses as we have been talking about and then you say you raise issue china and they sounds this big no dark cloud emerging and then all a sadden it is we need to galvanize and and i develop these technologies to counter their effort is it fear of them or it combativeness or both so without them in the picture a you just have this and was if is it there is an old bedpan i is it saying as a i may guess mi brother ma my brother guess my cousin me my brother my cousin against the o the world right likely with he evil is actually its evolution and action if ego anything would thing about it is tat there is no external that then the conflict turns inward a and then an ten that point there is a big fight between specifically tack and then i was to say generally politics and in my interpretation that fight is it is a fight for status tit is fundamentally f right for station for power which is i four in politics you this you the status to of how power and status work in our society you do not want these new tachnowlos us to show up and change things cops changes bad i change change threatens your position tat threatens your the respect that people have for you and your control over over things am i think it ispremarily a statusfiet which we can talk about but that the china thing is just a straight up geopolitical for s as them a status a cold morsonareo and you know look twenty years ago the prevailing to you in washington was we need be friends the china right an we arguing to be trading partners to china and yes there are to military and dictatorship but if we trade with them over time they will become for democratic in the last five to ten years is become more and more clear f the that just not true a and now there is a lot of people on both political parties and you see who very much regret that and want to change too much more of a sort of a cold wore footing are you willing to comment on tie talk and technologies that emerge from china that are in m wide spread use within you ask how much you trust them or do not trust them i can om go on record myself by saying that early on when tiptoe was released we were told to stamper faculty that we should not and could not have ticktock accounts nor we chap accounts say with there a lot of really bright chines takontreners and engineers who a trying to do good things i totally all have positive about that i think than the people mean mean very well the chines have a specific system the system is very clear and unambiguous and the system is everything in china's own by the party i not its any melon by the station by the partisan by the chines comes party thechinese commonest party owns everything n they control everything by the way it actually illegal to this day it is a legal foreign y foreign investor by equity and a chines company there is all these slag basically legal macmachinations the people do to try to do something that psychic economic equipment to that but is actually still illegal to do that the chine chines have no intention the chines commonest party has no intention of letting foreigners own any of china zero intention of that and thy they they regularly move to me sure that that does not happen they own everything they control everything we was sard intend you but people in china can investing america come e an you all the time well they can subject to yous government constraints there there is a there is a us government system that attempts to mediate that called spies m and therefore more and more there more anymore limitations being put on that but if you can get through that approval process than legally you can do that whereas the same is not true with respect to china a and am the they just have a system and if your if your the we o of a chines company it is not optional if you the so bite downcerseo tension is not option your relationship with the chines communist party is not optional is required and was required as you are a unit of the party and you and your company do what the party says and the party says we get far access tall yesterday to in america you say yes when the party says you change the algorithm to optimize to a certain social result you say yes it is just its whatever is whatever is whatever she gasping and his party codes decide and that is what is gets implemented if you the see you one a chines tuck company there is a political officer assigned to you ho has an office down the hall and at any given time he can come down the hall he can grave you out of your staff reading or board meeting and he can taken on the hall and he can make you set for hours and study maxis em an she don't ping thought and quits you on at the test you on it and you would better pass the test right like li sos a strait political control thing in the by the way if you get cross was with them when we see i neck founders getting called up to congress for what looks interrogation but it is brolly pretty light interrogation compared to all another countries ye its its is it state it stay power they van to stay they have this view of top down shay power and they view it is that their system and they view that is necessary for a lots of historical and moral reason thincethy've defend and that is how they run and then they have got a view that says how they want to propagate that vision outside the country and they have these programs belting road right the base tickly are intended to propagate can of their vision world wide and they are who they are i we the will say that they do not lie about it right they the very start for it they give speeches they write books you can buy she chin's think speeches he goes though the whole thing they have theotheir neck twenty twenty five plan wutthows select ten years ago if their hole i i gents all in there and is their goal that you known two hundred years three hundred years that china's the superpower ice rolling everything on yet or twenty yours thirty years sir two your three years yo they got a short here i me li thertheyr yacht they they i mean if i your the is say ever yon grade's little bey this i ass but at if your they want a win well the the crisper inhuman example that i gave earlier was interesting me because for salmon or scientist and they could have edited any genes but they chose to admit the genes involved in the attempt to create supermemory babies which presumably grow into super memory adults and whether not they succeed in that is not clear those babies are alive and presume by now walking talking as far as i know whether not they supermemories is not clear but china clearly unafraid to augment biology in that way am and i believe that that is inevitable that is can happen elsewhere ism probably first for the treatment of disease but at some point am assuming people organ augment biology to make smarter kids made people am not always but a often will select mates based on the traits they would their children to inherit this happens far more frequently than could be deemed a bad e are either that or people are bad because people do this all the time selecting mates that have physical and a psychological and cognac traits that you would your offspring to have crisper is a more targeted approach of course the reason ism con giving this example and an examples it is that i fee much of the way that am governments and the and the public reactive technologies its ti just take that first glimpse and it just feels scary a thing but the old apple add of the nineteen eighty four ad men here was one very scary version of the personal computer and computers and robots taking over and every in automatons and then there was the apple version where it is all about creativity love and peace and had the pseudo psychedelic californium thing going for it again great marketing seems to convert peoples thinking about technology such that what was once viewed as very scary and dangerous and dystopian is in oasis of opportunity why are people afraid of new technologies this this the thing i eve tried to understand for a long time because the history is clear ah ante history basically as every new technology is created by what is called a moral panic am and it is basically the historical freak out of some kind that cosses people to bay sleep predict the end of the world and you go back in time and actually the historical sort of e fact it happens even is things now were just pop back in its ludicrous right and you mention earlier the satanic panic of the of the its something of the concern around tie heavy metal music right before that there was a freedom around comic books in the fifties there was a free cot around was music and the twenties and thirties devil music there was a free out the rival bicycles cause t a moral panic and eighteen sixteen see bicycle bicycles yes there was is thing at the time bicycles were the first they were the first very easy to use personal frensportaction thing that back we let kids travel between towns ah a you now quickly without any overhead to take term tea horse to jump to bike i go ah and there was a historical panics i civil around at the time young women for the first time were able to venture outside the con fines the town to be a have a by friend another town and the magazines of the time recall thy stories on the a phenomenon medical phenomenon called bicycle face and the idea bicycle face was the exertion cause by peddling a bicycle would cause your face you face of grimace and and if you run the bicycle for two long your face would lock in the place n the right an the a i me you l you would be unattractive of wore of course unable to them you non get married at cars there was a moral panic around car o red flag laws there lathes laws that greeted the automobile automobile free people out say there all these laws if in the early days the automobile in a lot of places you had to in you would take a ride an automobile an automobiles they broke atoll the time be only rich people had automobile to be you and your mechanic n the car right far when it broke down and then you had to hire another guy to walk two hundred yards in front of the car with the red flag ah and he had to wait the red flag and you couldonly drive as fast as he could walk as the red flag was to warn people that the the car was coming and and then and then in nicks pennsylvania they had the most draconian version which was ah they were very word about the car carrying the horses and there was a law that said if you saw horse coming ah you need to stop the car you you'd to disassemble the car and you had to hide the pieces of the car behind the nearest payable wait for the horse to go by u and in then you could put your car back together sit sat a ways example is electric lighting there was a panic around within s can complete completely ruin yous completely ruin the romance of the dark and it was in a cause hold new kind of terrible civilization where everything is always brightly lit it just all these examples and psychic what on earth is happening that this is always what happens man i finally found this book that i thing has at has a good model for it e book is called men machines an modern times and ss written by this a might they professor sixty years ago it it predates the in or not but it uses a lot of a historical samples and what he says mas us he says there there is actually a three stage response the is a three stage social response to new technologies it is very predictable he say stage one is on basically just denial oh just ignore we just do not pay teston this nobody takes thiserious slavery just the just to black out on the whole topic u he says stage the stage once stage too is rational counter argument stage too is where you line up all the different reasons why this cannot possibly work it cannot possibly every get cheaper yo now this that of young fast enough for whatever the thing is then he says stage three he says is when the name calling begins he says stage three is wen right right when they have file ignore it and they have failed to argue society out of it they move to the me calling right and what is the name calling the name calling as this is evil is the moral paid this is evil this is terrible this is awful this is going to destroy everything do not you understand all this just is just this is this horrifying it and you you know the person working on our being reckless and evil and all hell this stuff and you must be stopped and and he says the reason for that is because basically fundamentally what these things are as there a war over status it is o is it is a war over status and there for a war over power and and then of course a atom ultimately money but be status status yyoumanstatus is the thing and and annas what he says is what what is the hospital impact of a new technology the serial impact of a new technology is at reorder status in society the people who are specialists in that technology become high status and the people who are specialists in the previous way of doing things become lo status and generally people do not adapt right generally if you are the kind of person who is high status because your at your yearn evolved adaptation to an existing technology you are probably not the kind of persons gaining enthuse the enthusiastically try to replying yourself on to a new technology the an this is every politician who is just any complete state of panic of a social media wire the free out of a social medias cause they all know that the whole nature of monopolistic is change the entire battery of techniques the use to get elect ted the foresocia media are now obsolete obviously the best new politicians the future gan to be in to present rations of social media and podcast an bi i podcast ad were seeing this now as we had towards the next present o election that podcast clearly are going to be featured very heavily in the next selection because long form content is i hold different landscape this is exact say this is the coexist is usufico organ your organs had what he is had burned he is had pulse he is had a whole series of our came most area and that is create a lot of contrail countries but also my understanding i the he ism sure he is invited everybody ism sure he ism sure he would loved at by no ism sure he would loved at trophy ism sure he'd have to ask him i mean i think that om every podcast has their own those surround who they invite on and why and how i i certainly cannot speak for him i bi om but i have to imagine that any opportunity to have true long form discourse that would allow people to really understand people's positions on things i have to imagine that he would be in favor of that is the the worst thing ye or somebody else went right you now some of some other tomb dot by astray orally woad right and there is my point my exactly tolly grith you but my point is if if your politician if you are if you're it is legacy poitishn right you have the option of embracing the newtecnology you can do it any time you want right you but youyou do not they are not they will not who they will not do it and why will not they do it well o case first of a they want t ignore it nor it they want to pretend get things are not changing second is they want have rational contrecomments for why thee sitting campaign system works the way that it does in this in the at resisting media networks an cheers ow you use things thin hers ti give speeches and hes the close ware in the tie an the thing in the pocket square an tin you protocol sis's how you succeeded was coming up to that systems he got all your arguments is to why that will not work any more and then and then we have now proceeded to that tithe name calling face which is now its evil right no swat's evil for somebody to show up in putting on on honest stream god forbid for three hours and actually say what they think right is gan to distress society right it is exactly right tits it is it is it is a classic example of this pattern and any way some working moron says in the book thesis this is the forever pattern this will never change this sort f this is one of those things where you can learn about it and still enough it the entire world to learn about this and still nothing change us because at the end of the day it is not it has it is not the tact that is the question it is t it is the reordering of status a have a lot of thoughts about the podcast component a it'll just say this because i want to get back to the topic of innovation of technology am but on a long form podcast there is know safezone the person can get up and walk out but if the person interviewing them and certainly job is the best of the very best if not the most skilled podcast in the tire universe at continuing to press people on specific topics when there try to bob and weave and wriggle real out he will just keep either drilling or alter the question somewhat in a way that forces them to finally come up with any answer of some sort and i think that probably puts certain people's quarters all levels through the roof am such that they just would never go on there i think there is another deeper question also or another other quest along with that which is how many people actually have something to say i real siesta right how many people can actually talk in away that is actually interesting that nobody else for any length of time how much substance is there really and a lot of historical politics was to be able to manufacturer a faced where you honestly as far as you cannot tell ho t he deep the thoughts are lie even if they have deep thoughts it it is kept it is kept away from you thy would certainly never cop to it it signing to be an interesting next what is it about a twenty months hey had nonentity in e catch an panic on the name calling aboureay started yet i was on my this list of three things denial am i the counter argument and name calling seems with a i a it's rages jump to numbers two an three si were already it two and three in its kind of leaning three ye on the script i this as unusual just because i it had cutin allies to take off they almost always have a free history they almost always have thirty or forty your history where people tried and fail to get them to work before they took off a i isn't aid your free history it has a very long one and then i it just it all sudden started o work dramatically well seemingly overnight and i it went from basically it as far as most people were concerned it went from it does not work at all to it works incredibly well in one stop and that almost never happens its an i ashing thing that is exactly whats happening i think it is aptly speed running this procession just just because if you use my journey er you used up to your any of these things for five minutes you are just while quite obviously this thing is canto by them i obviously in my life the sign y the best thing after like this is amazing this all the ways that i can use it and the and then therefore immediately you are all my god this is gan to transform everything therefor step three i straight to the name calling in the face of all this i there are invaders out there maybe they are where they are invaders m maybe they are already starting companies or maybe i they are just some i young or older person who has these five traits in abundance were does not but know somebody who does and is partnering with them in some sort of idea i and you have an amazing track record that identifying these people i i thinking part because you have the same traits yourself have heard you say the following the world is a very malleable place if what you want and you go for it with maximum energy and drive in passion the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think that is a remarkable quote a because it says at least two things a to me one is that a you have a very clear understanding of the inner workings of these great innovators we talked a little bit about that earlier these five traces et camera but that also you have an intense understanding of the world landscape and the way that we have been talking about it for the last hour or is that it is a really intense and kind of oppressive landscape you have got countries and organizations and the needs an a journalists that that a trying to not sisterly trying but or suppressing the innovation process ism in the sort that the picture that ism getting you it is it we are trying to innovate inside of a vice that is getting progressively tighter and yet this quote argues that it is the the person the boy or girl man or woman who says well what that all might be true but my view of the world is the way the world's on o bend or ism in a create a dent in that vice that allows me to exist the way that i want for what ism actually going to uncurl the vice the other direction and i at once picking up a sort of am pessimistic glass half empty a view of the world as well as a glass awful you and tell me about that and and tom if you would because you tell us about that from the perspective of some one listening who is thinking have got an idea and i know it is a really good one cause i just know i might not have the confidence of extrinsic reward yet but i just know there is a seed of something what does it take to foster that and how did we foster real innovation in the landscape that were talking about yes parents i think you just in one of the want of carders i think you was the innovator ne to be signed up to fight to fight right in this is were the fictional portrayals of start ups i thinks take people of course are evens scientists arewhatever cause theyann en there's great success stories they it can appritified ah after the fact any my it me to be cute and for and at now i conproduct anybody who actually did any these things now the these things are is justly brutal exercises in just sheer will power in fighting you no fighting fighting forces that are thing to get you pardon as you just you have to be sign up for the fight and this kind it goes to the conscientiousness thing or talking about we also my partner ben uses the true courage a lot which is some combination of just stubbornness but coupled with a willingness to take pain and not stop and how people think very bad things of you for a long time until it turns out you evilly prove yourself prove yourself correct you yore wing to do that li get's it is a pontonier is that it is a contact sport is these are in easy roads right it is a context port you have to be signed up a for the fight the advantage that you have is an innovator it is hat is at the end of the day the truth actually matters and all the arguments in the world classic victor huge quote is there is nothing more powerful in the world than an idea whose time has come right living if if it is real right and and this is just pure substance if the thing is real if the idea is real i get it is a legitimately good scientific discovery about how the nature works if it is a new invention u if it is a new work of art and if it is real then you you you do at the end of the day you have that on your side and all f the people who are fighting you an arguing with you and telling they do not have that on their side right it is it is not they are stroking up with some other thing and there my thing is better than your thing that is not the main problem right the main problem is i have a thing ism convinced everybody else is telling me it stupid wrong it should be illegal whatever the thing is but at the end of the day i still have the thing right and at the end of the day that you that that the truth really matters is substance rally matters if it is real it is really given example it is really hard historically to fin an example of a new technology that came into the world that was then pulled back and we can be a new clear as maybe it maybe an example of that but even still they are stole in no nuclear terrace stilling clear plans running to day u youknow that that that still exists i say the same thing is scientific ti at least high of makes you this i do notknow i do not know any scientific discovery that was made and ta people at i know i know there airs a science that are not politically correct to talk about to day but every scientist knows the truth the the truth is still the truth me even the gunetisis in the some union who were forced to band la sancoism like knew the whole time that it was wrong i got that that in complot convinced of yet they could not delude themselves especially because the basic training that one gets in any field establishes some court truths upon which even the crazy ideas have forest and if they do not as you pointed out thinks fall the pieces i would say that even the technologies that am did not pan out and in some cases were disastrous but that were great ideas at the beginning ore starting to pan out the example all give is that now most people are aware of the elizabeth homes thermos de bagel want to put it lightly analyzing a what is in a single drop of blood is away to analyze hormones and diseases the anybodies et camera mean that is a great idea it is a terrific idea that bots having a phlambatimis come to your house or e hove to go in et tapped with you knowing the pulling vials and the whole thing there is now a company a borne out of stamford that is doing exactly what she sought to do except that at least the court ruled that am she fudged the thing and is that is why she is in jail right now am but the idea of getting while array of markers from a single drop of blood is an absolutely spectacular idea the biggest challenge that company is going to confront is the idea that it is just the next terns but if they have got the thing and they are not fudging it as it apparently thermos was am i think am everything work out all victor huge enemy now cause we must go back one if they f the of that gets if they gets the work if it is real it can t be tithe this is the than of the opponents the opponents they are not bringing their own ideas they not bringing their one my ideas better than yours us not what's happening they are bringing the silence or count argument right or an walling all this is why i think people who need to be loved probably stand a am reduced chance of success and maybe that is also why having people close to you that do love you and allowing that to be sufficient can be very beneficial this gets back to the idea of partnership and family around innovators am because if you feel filled up by those people local to you youon't can your home then you do not need people on the innernette saying nice things about you are your ideas because you are good and you can forge forward a another question about innovation is the teams that you assemble around you and you have talked before about a the sort of small squadron model a ye for avid in eolith a examples is well where you a small group of individuals can am created acarology that frankly outdoes what a you giant casebook might be doing or what am any other large company might be doing there area lot of theories as to why that would happen but i know you have some unique theories am why do you think small groups can defeat large organizations the conventional explanation as i think correct and is just that am large organizations have a lot of advantages but they just have a very hard time am actually executing anything because of all the overhead so large organizations have commentorial communication overheadright that the number of people who have to be consulted who have to agree on things get to be staggering e amount of time it takes to scene the meeting it be staggering you knee get these really big companies and they have some issue their dealing with and it takes a month to scent the presenting to li plan for the meeting chichis can have o a months later which is thing in a results in a postmeeting which sill then result in o poor presentation which will e on result an i planning affright right a they lot i thought i could miles baba what you are describing all giving me his stovkova wat skovkovka was a document or he out that this is this is yet tit is just these these are i may you would have these organization that a hundred thousand people are more your poured more of a nation state than a to than than than a company uh and you have got all these competing internal you knot is the bet of an thing same before you valleys internal at most big companies you are internal enemies are water dangerous to you than anybody in the outside e get them can you library done know ye your your big compete the bi comet ad a big company the big competition is for for the next promotion right and and and the enemy for he next promotion is the next executive over in your company that is your enemy the other the competitor on the outside as an abstraction maybe they will matter some day whatever i got a be that i inside my own company right and tattle internal warfare is at least as intense as the external warfare and yes hit just examiner's is just all the you iron law of all these big big rocracies an ow they function if if a big isocracy ever does anything productive i think it is a miracle is a miracle of the point were they should be a celebration think there should be partiesthere so be to cottage parades for big large organizations that i shall do things that that is great does it i it is rare it does not happen very often anyway and ask the conditional explanation whereas look small cot small companies small teams an there is a lot a they cannot do because they cannot near they're not out any at scale than in of gold coverage and lean all the kind of fend thy don't have the resources and forth but at least they can move quickly right they can organize fast they can haven't me non if there isn't issue today they concave the genie to day they con suit the issue to day right everybody they need to suit the issues in the room today than say they can discover a lot faster i think that is part of it but i think there is another deeper thing underneath that that people really do not to talk about it takes a respectful circle to where we started which is just the sheer number of people in the world who are cable of doing things is just a very small set of people and you are not going a have a hundred of them an a company or a thousand or ten thousand you are onto have three eight or ten maybe hey some of them are flying too close to the sun some of them are blowing themselves up room some of them are i be ow i she first leaving that that i beside f my first atonal job job as that i beam when it was and when when i be on a still on top of the world right before it cave don and the early nineties and when i was there it was for hundred and forty thousand employs we shan't gan if you inflation at just to day for that same size of business in elation adjusted market size adjusted it would be he's equivalent to day f a two or three million person ionization it was a it was a nation state ah there were six thousand people in my division we were next store of another building withal another six thousand people and another division you just you could work there for years and ever meet anybody who did not work for ilium the first half of every meeting was just dreamers introducing themselves each other they just mind boggling in that the level of of perplexity but they were powerful ah that they had a a it at four years before got their nineteeneighty five they were eighty per cent of the market capitation of the entire neck industry right t they were at a level of dominance that even you know juggler apple today is not even close to right at the time that that is how powerful they were and they had a system and it worked really well for fifty years they had a system which was mostly employs in the company were expected to basely rigid follow rules they dress the same acted the same they did everything out of the play book they know thy they were trained very specifically ah but they had this category people they call wild ducks amnio was an idea that the founder homes lass an come u with wild ducks and the wild docks were they often had the formal title of an niobium fellow and they were the people who could make new things and there were eight of them and they got to break all the rules and they got to invent nu products they got to go off and work on something knew that every port back ah they got to pull people off another projects to work with them ah they got no budget when they need it they they reported directly to the s i they got whenever they needed he supported the madding it and they were glass breakers and you know they showed a tho the one in ousting of the time was that ki and heller and he would show up and genes and cable boots and amongst an ocean of men an blue suits white hurts realizes ah and put us lobby boy up on the table and it was fine for and hello that and it was not fine for you to do that right they vary specifically identified we have not we have not we have a almost an aristocratic class within our our company they gets to play by different rules now the expectation as they deliver right they they their job is to invest the next break through product but we i be a management know that the six thousand person to bis this not get about the next product we know is can to be crazy ante heller an his in its comer boots and i was always very impress and yet ultimately aba had its issues but that model worked for fifty years right working credibly well and i i think that is easily the model of at works o and is but it is a paradox right which is how do you have a large autocratic regiments ad organization whether its academic or government or business or anything that has all these rule followers in it and all these people who are jealous of their status and do not want things to change but then still have that spark of of a creativity i would say mostly best impossible mostly it just does not happen those people get driven out right and any intact what happens as those people get driven out as we will fund them these a the people we find drowsy say yet i i these a thither you are in the business of finding and funding the wild the wild docs was exactly right and and actually this is actually a to close the close the loup this is actually i think the simplest explanation for ilium ultimately came down and then each p her an eighties also ratio the i been achy kind of wore model there re these incredible moralistic incredible companies for forty or fifty years the the kind of both cape d in n the in the eighties and nineties and and actually think it was the emergency of venture capital it was the emergence of a parallel funding system where the wild docs or in each piece case their their superstartonical people could actually leave and start their companies and again we goes back to university discussion ere having is this is what does not exist of the university level this certainly does not exist if the government level and until recently in media didn't existent till there is this thing that we call contras exactly it exactly we got clearly have picked up some om amen tum and i i would hope that these other wild duck models will will i move quickly yow but the one thing right and this the one thing is the people on the other side or conto be mat us hell ye they are going to well i think om there pass denial om the counter arguments continue the name calling is prolific and calling is fully under we y will market we have covered a lot of topics but as with every time i talk to you i learn o very much ism grateful for you taking the time my dear schedule talk about all of these topics in depth with us you i be emissive i dint say that it is clear to me now that you are helper realistic about the landscape ah but you are also intensely optimistic about the existence of wild ducks and those around them that support them that are necessary for the implementation of their ideas at some point and tat also you have am a real rebels idea that is so welcome on this podcast and it is a so needed in these times an every time on

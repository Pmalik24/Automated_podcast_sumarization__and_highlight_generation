defenestrated them as a serious fighting force in salianon and ended with them retreating from all captured territory the military was however was not the real story the real story was america media water kronkit media's most trusted newsancher was in actuality a partisan left us but he masqueraded as an objective journalist and on receiving news of the tat offensive kronkit went on the ear and proceeded to inform the america people that the for in vision was being lost he flat of canon to investigate the situation himself and upon his return he said this for it seems now more certainly the the bloody experience of veapnan is to end in a stalag the sobers almost certain stand or either end in real give and take negotiation or terrible escalation and forever means we have scaly the enemy can matches not apples to invasion of the north the you nuklir weapons or the mere commitment of one hungry or two hon but or three hundred thousand more america troops to the bat and with ice escalation the world comes closer to the brink of cosmic dicast the reason for was not primarily lost on the battle field it was lost in the hearts an minds of the america people and it was lost in large part because of the america at news media the america news media has rarely covered itself in glory covering for policy the new york times famously covered forstallans talatamar his starvation of millions of his own citizens in e crane to plowing corrupt and venom water do rant to cover for the evil dictator the new you times largely packaged the holiest itself the world's most evil regimes have routinely relied on america media to provide them cover and to day is no different come a is in evil genital terrorist group yet they received widespread sympathy because the media create that sympathy they do through a variety of methods first and most obviously they draw moral equivalents between commas which targets civilians for death both his daily and its own and israel which seeks to avoid killing civilians when it target's members of commas take for example wolf blitzes questioning of an idea commander yesterday after israel head a aromas command tunnel network in cabala a major city in the gazastrip often characterized by the media as a refuge camp here is blitzed but even a data agama calender with therapist all the calitinan refuge who are in that in theater a your refuge cap is yo filled had an draptabam the a tracampty to kill the mama a e cab am calender knowing that a lot of a into pavilion men women an children crikey would refill that what i marry and the will we again or woke on commander gan you you get were a man a many manly but that there a lot of refunds a lot of kudu vision man women shodden in that refund caters well right the cavity war o we i know e me i end no o a me i go or e you knew there were familiar herd there refund a tort of read but you tide to drop boy o that recut cap tepid the oil the a commander that is blitzed repeatedly blaming israel for the fact to commas deliberately hides beneath civilian areas and then calling on is real to effectively preemptively surrender in order to avoid civilian casualties if this were truly a civilian sense alone massive tunnel craters simply would not be there the ground exit collapsed after the bombs hid the craters are there are the dead fighters but according to wolf blitzed in scanned israel legitimate military actions are apparently morally equivalent to commodious slaughter of babies in their cribs this of course follows hard on the your times accepting the word of compass about military strikes in casualties resulting in a major blood libel in which the entire legal h media paraded that israel had struck a hospital killing five hundred people in reality in is fired palicinian is lanicgehod rocket hin a parking lot near the hospital too late the damage was done because this is how it works at the media well get to the next way that the media under mine the case in favor of morality and stand up for the world's worse people in just at one second first with all the terminal on the world with the economy on tenter hooks with with its seeming as though everything is chaotic you might want o diverse fight into something that has never then worth zero you main want of diverse find o precious metals the same way that i do we keep on spending in

ninety eight ninety eight tell the first strategy is the moral equivalent strategy is the easiest strategy the media law of the moral equivalent strategy because it allows them to pretend that western countries targeting bad guises are the same as the bad guide we see this all the time then there is the second media strategy misdirection comedian normal donna treated in remember twenty sixteen quit what terrifies me is if ices for to detonate an who cleared vice and kill fifty million america imagine the backlashians peaceful muslin canal's jokes actually the media strategy for moral equivalents as antisemitism rises around the globe as millions of radical muslin including in the west march in favor of comas the media are treating muslin all over the world as a victim group thus the centimes ran in of ad today in the midst of the widest global increased antisemitism of my lifetime to crying the supposed rising is lamaphobia the author was one rosin all quote a journalist who covers war is lamaphobia and the matiest her article explain quote for those who experienced waves of harassment and government surveillance in the years after september eleventh the president's pledge of unwavering support for israel set off alarm bells yes according to this new york time's colonists supporting israel is covered for is lamaphobia she also insist the quote from college compass to places of work people are facing retribution for expressing support for palstinians that is being misconstrued as anti israel or procomas that is a lie given that protests against israel began even before is daily counter strikes and these protests routinely feature chance for the destruction of the state of israel they are not exactly hiding the message as for a ley herself pertuitterfeed chose than on october seventh the date of compasses massacre she did not treat it all but she did retweeto post complaining that is rally prementsturbengrimen dentin a who is telling civilians to leave potential war zones in anticipation of military action in fact ales posted precisely zero times to crying compasses brutality but she did find time to reahtweat posts calling israel actions in gas a genocide finally there is the third medeostrategy pretending that antisemitism is not to major problem it is acting just a side effect of political contentiousness which means in the and it is really springing from the cycle of violins which means in the ended really springing from is rally policy which means in the ends really coming from the news the media are in the business of down playing muscle and left wing antisemitism treating it is mere opposition to israel policy the policy in this case being israel surviving or as a us to day's example comes courtesy of the near times pro israel and roguish activist around the nation theme putting up posters of men women and children kidnapped by comas and antisemite have been ripping down those posters here is a video from just yesterday a alright but there saying is few f israel as they trip down toe posters man's happening all over the country dozens in trust of cases every single day of people going around an ripping down posters of kidnap children because they hate news a dance why that is happening here is another there is another example i there the quire down gate both oo it the popgun a worth why why do you tar the own the that e t ton more why a that i why do you you that this to the o these people are in tat excuse me i put that ply up i would about she is crumbling it out and ripping enough why why do you think the the the two these people are tin tat now gets that not even as daily the tit why a factory why do you think it this tut wo the the on the think let her to in that people we the people who are supposedly propalicinia no proms they are making it very difficult to make that case when they are ripping down posters of people kidnapped becomes again by the way it should be pointed out here that zero of the pro palicinian protest the are supposedly also not procomas have called for compass render zero as in it none as you can find any one who is doing nape this is all pretty clear evidence of wisesbred antisemitism no well mot according to the near times here is hawthorn your times is reporting all this quote displaying the posters has become a form of activism keeping the more than two hundred hostages seized by cams in full view of the public by removing the posters has quickly merged that its own form of protest a release valves and also a provocation by those anguished by what they say was the i really governments mistreatment of palistinians in the years before october seventh and since the body of goo began i hear you gated not only the third strategy but the first strategy you get the third strategy which is to pretend that antisemitism does not exist and the first strategy which is moral equivalents because obviously is real trading terra and accidentally hitting civilians is the same as comas kidnapping small babies and keeping them in tunnels but the your times has more quote the battle has inflamed already tentimotions and it captures one of the most fervently debated questions of the war whose suffering should command public attention and sympathy in fact the motivations of those removing signs takes a variety of forms and as unnerving as the removal of the posters has been fore sum new and supporters of israel at least some of the people tearing down the posters are jewfish themselves there is the near times down playing people literally ripping down posters of kidnapped babies and pretending that just another form of protest itsoloquen now by the we these the same new you times these out there ripping on people destroying their lives for not posting the black lives matter square or the obligatory one sign saying black lives matter here is the daily dot playing the same sac can quote some are wondering if the posters are being strategically placed to in trap those who tear them down many of whom support the palistinian people yes he seed those posters have short skirts that is why they are being torn down those pesky news and their posters in sympathy with kidnap victims being held by a genicitle terra group in trapped the real badges the news the antisemitism want real the news are causing by putting up pieces of paper with the faces of babies that been kidnapped by an evil terror is group and will likely die in tunnels never being their first birthday that is the jewsfall dies the antisemitism of ripping that stuff down because the news are being provocative the need a stop being news i mean all that they keep this breathing thing is annoying commas and its allies are relying utterly on legacy media both in america and in rope to cover for them and to provide political pressure on politicians to cut their support to israel in the midst of their war with commas that is precisely why comas is planting civilians in harm's way to maximize casualties for the cameras two blame israel comas would not do that if the media were not playing along the medias responsibility for the current conflict is massive the media have consistently and repeatedly pretended that comas terror is the same is legitimate military response thus incentivizing the terror for the cameras the media have repeatedly and consistently suggested that if israel hits civilians while attempting to kill terrorists this is the equivalent of what commastas thus insentivizing creating the full incentive for comas to get as many civilians killed as possible cross admits this stuff on camera and to what of the mediate they just ignored hit pretend et does not exist the media play along with pretty much every bad regime on the planet left ask why the answer is that the legal media is salted with members of an international left dedicated to the proposition that the west is real included is itself fatally flood and colonialist all the college radicals we were supposed to ignore they are going to to roll up there gin a pay taxes get chop or they did grow up and they went into journalism these mediates hire local parts in activist to free lands for them including hitter supporters antisemite to cover the gosesstrip these media outlets see their mission as the restoration of justice in the universe justice of course meaning the destruction of the west power in the name of these supposedly oppress of the earth if the legal you mead get get their way the west will fall into disarray and far they are succeeding admirably there's a more on this unjust one second first let us talk about sleep quality porsleep quality as we know can cause wait gain moodissues pourmental health lower productivity

mention israel strong eight series of tunnel complexes under the qualia quote quit refuge camp ism think quite on quote because actually just a city people are calling areas in the gosistrip refuge camps as though these people are going to be imported into hypo or something they are gin buildings that have been there since nineteen forty eight and before many of the quod quit refuge campsthat your seeing are actually just cities and calling refuge camps is way of demonizing them against the future of the state of israel its part of the gal but israel did strike a bunch of tunnel complex that killed an enormous number of members of cases leadership they are penetrating deep into the gosistript particularly in the northern portion of the gosestrip and that is crating desperation on the part of comas which you are seeing in them now attempting to say thatched are going to release some passport holders america passport horrors were being held up by comas in the gosestript they are not being allowed to leave the atheroma crossing apparently comes now thinking about may be allowing that to happen because they retrying to create some sort of sentiment thatched are not all thabadamin they out releasing people with duel passports you will see comas in future weeks out assume say the same about duel passport holders among the hostages that they are cogently holding in an attempt to buy off america for example you may see them take some people with duel nationality frailly america nationality and release some of those people in an attempt to buy off the america which of course is a sickness of its own because now you have nosy types selection in which if you have the right passport you go to the right and live and if you the wrong passport you go to the left and you die in the tunnels with these evil these evil monsters what comas is relying upon is t the international community will stop israel from finishing them off that is what they re lying upon right now because on the ground israel is in fact winning which is why you are seeing andsolatry groups the soothes suddenly decide to get in by all o these groups are being run by camps yesterday the yeoman hotly rebels entered the war with israel after a launch drones and missiles at the south of the country earlier to day all that into to shutdown the soothes are part of the cranial access of resistance it must be noted at this point that the cranial hobbies were e state department label terror group under the trumpetministration ore the first moves of by administration was to remove the soothes from the terrorist despite their charming slow an death to the jaws death to america now they have decided that they are going to enter the warn out to they have the projective power to seriously impectisrael the answer is no israel is sending some naval assets into the region to shoot down anything that the soothes decide to fire but this is essentially iron trying to threaten every one from every border without losing important pieces of the my right now iron has proxies everywhere because the proxies act is their offensive military mechanism around does not have the actual projective capacity from its own country to destroy israel outright instead uses proxy groups comas hesbalaw cause la has far stayed out the reason that herbal has not gotten in full scale is because mi my theory of this entire conflict is that this was generated buy iron in order to stave off the tout piece process i think everybody who understands geopolitics understands that this is what is happening right now and the reason is because that pro has ben working amazingly well the graham cords are holding all the all knowing me is the had of foreign affairs and defense committee in the a parliaments ad quit from the you a yo perspective the graham costs are here to stay want everyone to acnowlegein except that israel is there to exist that is that is a strong statement they the agrarians were afraid that they'd be boatman they are afraid that a study egyptian gordanian u a o lions that this would effectively create a massive counts or balance boxing them in in the middle east and the agrarians struck out using compass now my guess is that they did not think comose was going to succeed in this tear attack as far as it did they probably believe that israel wall was going to hold that the lose not the first time the people o tried to breach the wall they probably figured that they would attack with fifteen hundred two thousand terra pretty much all them would be killed but theywould end up killing a couple of hundred is daily civilians and kidnapping ten or twenty of them and this would be enough two create a serious is rally military responds but not enough that the world would actually be okay with allowing israel to do that sort of thing and id drive south off the ball in terms of creating a steal with the israelies those probably the original intents and then it turns out the compass succeeded beyond its wildest imaginings they insert killing fifteen hundred people inside israel in kidnapping over to hundred people they go profit they videoed it they could not they couldn't help themselves because this how much they ate use and upon i think feels a little bit the dog that caught to car comose about to get taken off the board cross was one of their nights on the chessboard crosses about to get completely destroyed eviscerated as well as should be and the that the last thing they want is probably us below which is significantly more powerful piece on aortic a brook they do not want that being taken out by these rallies as wellsoinstead this r prodding around the edges but all of this again is the result of the success of israel military activities right now meanwhile egypt is saying that it is not going to take in any one any one from the gosistrip in fact which by the way this should be an indicator of just how dangerous egypt proceed the people in the gosestript to be to their country in terms of how many of them are support of a compass that is crypt's perspective not sirens egypt mustopha my bully whose the countries prime ministers and what we are prepared to sacrifice millions of lives to en sure that no one encroaches upon our territory he said egypt would never allow in post solutions are the settlement of regional issues at its expense that is the current situation in the middle east the only way literally the only way that compass can win and survive is with the help of they me the pushing the west political leaders

of dessert to create serious problems one the ways that they are doing this is also by suggesting that jobidinsabol pulling numbers are due to his support for israel now the evidence on that is incredibly scanty the fact is that jobidin has really bad poll numbers because he is a really bad president and those pull numbers are exist his his support for israel in this particular conflict is something that statistician name silver has pointed out he says that the here's really no way to sort of quarrel lats his success with regard to with regard to israel with his electoral success your being a bunch of left wing activist idea racket he's a chief of foreign affairs commenter for the financial times writing gaze is very bad news for bids reeled prospects young voters and progressives are a keep part of the democratic collision many are youodious about the administrations support for israel if they stay home or vote for coral west bids in big trouble number one none member voting for oral west corniest not can get a lout of but as made silver points out there is been no change over all and biding appruvalrating since ten seven bisons policies popular parts of some democrats an unpopular with others also swing voters matter too america are pretty supportive of israel that happens to be try but again the media are now creating pressure particularly pro compass members the me are creating pressure onbidin by essentially suggesting that if he word to lose the election would be because he is too supportive of israel which is amazing statement considering that the united states supporting israel of or compass is a seventy fifteen prospect interns the polling dato naturally johnsogby who is a member of the of the pro palistinian cocks he was commission by the arab america institute to pull arab america just to show join how angry they are showing that just seventeen per cent would support the current presidents in the twenty twenty four election the poll survey arab america across the country including battle ground states two thirds f arab america have a negative view of present en biding response to the turn violence in palatine in israel only seventeen percents are ready devote for him in twenty twenty for but bison is not the only candidate losing support the majority is not claiming to prefer the democrat tic party in two thousand agent it o does not sixteen and democrats out number republicans to to one in this pole thirty two per cents of arab america identified as republican compared to twenty three percent qoidentifie as democrats fifty nine per cents of arab america reported experiencing discrimination seventy per cent seventy four per cent of arab america age eighteen to thirty four reported facing discrimination letters point out here we should point out her that this pole does not suggest time thesepeople are going to swivel and and vote for you most pro israel president in the history of the united states dona trump who likely to o the republican nominate or rondosantis who if anything is even more proisrael then donaltrump but this is find up in order to put pressure on bid in to abandon israel andyou'r seen the media do this over never never you have a you've an article from politico suggesting former ads to coma heresies twenty twenty presidential campaign are collecting signatures for a letter urging the vice president to quote seek an immediate sense fire between israel and comas calling israel gas a campaign a germicide the draft letter which was obtain by political amounts to an attempt to dial up pressure on one o the bide administrations most familiar faces in encourages of ice presidents to support sense fire resolution intrude by representative quarry bush the draft letter says we must morn the tragic loss of his really life targeted by comas however we must firmly and unequivocally reject the usually governments exploitation of these deaths exploitation of the deaths that what sales doing the exploiting the deaths to lethe of comas to sight the fact that again they literally surrendered the entire goa strip two compass and left them in control for eighteen years eighteen years well come off the firing rocket to them but their exploiting the tragedy in order to do what expend is rally blood and tressure going baccate to an area they wish they had never seen but dis amazing stuff but again the goal here is to generate descent inside the democratic party sanding in the wall star coronal mall ball who is left when reporter the left is tearing itself a part over israel to many on the left the israel composer is spurring what feels a permanent rupture where previously supplemented to prince as become impossible to ignore and every one must choosesides both pro israel propalsenian advocates describe a feeling of disolutionment has relationship's fracture and harsh words are exchanged the result many predict could be a breach that splits democrats for a generation with untold political consequences the feeling is mutual said the she talks about how news are feeling why our black lives matter and hurry bush and to s suddenly procomas the feeling is mutual from any actives on the left to see president en baton and other democratic off soldiers have blindly sided with a right a lined is rally government by the way right aline is really it is a unity government any goes to part of the government any got is not on the right use literally part of the coalition opposing tetonavu but does not matter the media do not now to how their talking about as as per are usual arrangement if you a arab america mule america repalsinian you feel you do not matter you feel in visible said while we chased a progressive strategic and former spokesmen for the justice democrats that of course would be to ss brand of the party and the goal here by many members the media is to prop up the pro comas wing of the democratic party as to create a ground swell of descent inside the democratic party causing join t turn away from what has been far pretty solid support for israel and that of course is effectively what the as wing is there to do that what the losing wen the party the quarry bush wing the party is there quarry bush which just a terrible human being beolu'm congous woman she treated out yesterday is a direct tweet from her quit we cannot be silence about israel ethnic cleansing camp ethnic cleansing ethnic cleaning heard cause again n i always sued that ethnic cleansing bald the ethnic cleansing of a population not their multiplication from one point two million grabs o nineteen forty eight two you no seven million in two thousand twenty three terrible job ethnic cleansing israel also i assume that if you were to pursue in ethnic cleansing campaign typically what you do not do is tell all the slings to get the hell out of the way while you bomb at military targets israel has overwhelming air superiority if israel wanted to cause right now hundreds of khamsin o deaths in the gosestrip it has the military capacity to do israel not doing that because they do not want to do that does not matter quarry bushes terrible human being babies dead pregnant women dead elderly dead generations of families dead millions of people in got with nowhere to go being slaughter wot millions of people being slaughter can you read of can honesty god such a liar such a terrible person in a liar the yours must stop funding these atrocities against palsies again the moral equivocation it is amazing it is unbelievable and then quarry bush she said wit the fact that she does not give a crap about news we are murdered by by comas and she lis she put out at teething this month a coupons for to resolution condemning comas for hostage taking urging their immediate release we must ensure the safe return of hostages and the protection of palmitin and israel s millions that is a lie her resolution did not condemn come ass at all it did not call for the release of the hostages she voted against the house resolution condemning comas she is just a liar sheet bodily this this is a a fundamental truth that i thing has been under under noticed by a huge percentage of the western population for a very long time for hard quod radical left wingers radical is lamas for fundamentalist of many stripes it turns out the truth is not even a secondary priority is not even a tertiary priority truth does not matter at all the means ore completely justified by the ends lying is completely fined longs to get what you want truth is of no value of no value to many people on the hard left quarry bush is being one case in point loses and other lose is at despicable wimping she treated yesterday pack treated against rshetitaly than margnmall woman some a lea these a all people who voted against a resolution supporting israel sarcomas see then tweeted pack in door scores of gear sit insurrectionists they are no friend to america democracy that is that is insane ism sorry that is insane apace is run almost entirely by former de critic staffers the top salons of apace the america israel public affairs committed is run by people who are left wing politically its been a serious issue contention you me personally and apace by the way she says they are one of the most races and bigoted pack in congress as well is proportionately targeting members of color no they literally just target people who are anti israel that is it is in the name america israel public affaires committee that is literally in the name of their organization and if those members happen to be disproportionally people of color what why the hell's apace have anything to do with that and then she says she is as about apace i have yet to see her use this sort of extreme language with regard to honest got terogrups q they are an extremest organization that the stabilizes you es democracy china an extremest organ apace an extremest organization that the stabilizes you es democracy that is also to see that is it dishonesty or stupidity or both now for a long time have let her get away with the stupidity card shes dishonestant ha mention terrible person because at a certain point i cannot give you the benefit of the out that out demon any more or at least if you are moron in o can let you use t is cover for the fact that clearly you are on the side of the me ass news clearly and obviously and anybody who is going to pretend this away because to see can do dances on integral is is truly in idiot a fellow traveller idiot in the media we are also playing up protest against anchovy blincoln yesterday anchovy blink the secretary state was testifying before congress and here is what he had to say about what he had seen come ss do a family of for the young boy and girl six and eight years old and their parents around the breakfast table the father is i gouged out in front of his kids he mother's rest cut off the girl's foot amputated the boy's fingers cut off before they were executed and then their executioners sat down and had a meal that is what the society is dealing with and no nation could tolerate that and as we said repeatedly is president began has repeatedly made clear israel has not only the right but the obligation to defend itself and to try to take every possible step to make sure this does not happen again he is testifying that that and hes completely crack what the media folcasom then folks om up lion actually had to say what they folkaston is protestors destructing blinking now yet these protestors are garbing human beings and moans what they are doing as they they sat in the back of the room holding up their hands stained red with ink to suggest that tony blincoln has blood on his hands out they would not do this with regard to comose and i just will point out here in odd and disturbing parallel her all the people holding up their red hands to show that america has blood on his hands whenever the held that is but i here hislebin thevitia dollars a is thinnish members of the apropriatiast i thank you this i to justify r not in the place o cresicoin personally in employable idiots at best evil senility antisamis it worst this despicable people anyone there is an odd echo a odd historical echo here and the people holding up their red hands to the camera last him is on hands that red it is when there were actual members of the palisinian authority holding up their red hands after having butcher ad is daily soldier who is taken drove in to kamala in it is it is hard not to see that particular picture i that that picture is was prettyfamous back in the ay by the way this administration is now talking about giving the palisinian authority control over the goal trip which is the passing authorities literally paying the families of the terrace who murdered people in the gosh envelope that would just be can changing one horse for the same horse of a slightly different color as for the by administrations out time at now the question is will h by administration go we can need on all this because of all the press covering and because of these supposed internal de send de spite the fact that again the polling data in the united states suggest broad and wide support for israel in this conflict i talk about reborn a lot on this show i believe their

this point you seen som mixed signals at bast twenty blincon far has been pretty good ut your staring you see the what house are secretary who again is not a pro israel active in anyway she perform corn john pier is from the quarry bushing of the democratic party here she was she is ask if anti israel protestors are extremes you now people chancing from the river to the sea mealybug the extermination israel and she is a guy o no i it is amazing how quiet she goes when it comes to left wing antistatic protestors when it comes to morons in caky pans marching in charlotesvillt that is the surfer an entire presidential campaign one it comes to hundreds of thousands of students around the world marching in coordination with comas slogans then she is a give no there extreme can we say that for i do no here she was having a tough time there is person by thin the is real protests ans country a e tree what i can say is what we have been very clear about this what it comes to antisemitism there is no place we have to make sure that we speak against it very loud and be and be very clear about that remember what the president decided when the president decided to run for president is what he saw in charlottesville in twenty seventeen what we he saw no not sees marching down the streets of charlottesville with vile anti sematic a just hatred and he was very clear then and he is very clear now he is taken at actions against this over the past two years and he is continue to be clear the is no place no place but this type of vile an despite despite the this kind of rhetoric he well ism ism glad the yo rob charlottes bill mean he about campus radicals pulling danpostors are extremists how about people whore chancing from river to see aurstrumens no a held have words about as lamaphobia now i where the the white houses attempts to equate what is going on with antifeminism in this country with his lamaphobia or totally the there insane the the completely mad it these are too completely separate phenomena the attempt to lint the two of them is once again the create a moral equivalence in a cycle o violence rhetoric the idea being that if your pro israelyou must be as lamaphobic wet whereas if you are propalsinian well you are not antisemitic even if your chancing things from the river the sea here she was talking about the rise of is supposed as lamaphobia what if your message this america what effort have made at out we to this the too of tank what i can says that the president but knows that muscles and those perceived to be muslin have endured a disproportionate number of certainly of hayfield attacks was we talk about what we are saying here a and he also understand that many of our muslin or america an pasta in america love ones and neighbors are worried about the hate being directed at their communities and leaders at every level of this amiiciation will continue were a cantimnuingage engaging with the muslin community o or america community and pal than in america leaders to hear there concerns a and also a to hear the pea back on combat i certainly to combat the discrimination the hate in discrimination that the sing as well again the normal dona twee just coming to life freight here by the way i feel i should just show you what the actual an the feminism verses is lamaphobic stats look in terms of of reported hate crimes and such according to the the anti defamation league no not not a place that ism a huge fan but there the best source for measuring this sort of stuff at this time the eightball has reported more than twelve hundred an went acinciden in the united states through make twenty twenty three and they have seen a three hundred eighty eight per cent uptake an incidents after compass's attack on israel i went to show you the scale here is how you can fool people with with stats this out see an end is doing in twenty thirteen therefore just under a thousand hate incidents reported against news in the united states in two thousand twenty two there we almost four thousand and in twenty twenty three it is can a surpass that in twenty twenty three it can be higher than that two talking valid a minimum of three four thousand hat crimes against news now you move over it two i is lama linked hat crimes is gambling tat crimes this hat you lie with stats is by by looking at the scale o get in two thousand almost zero in two thousand one when this is supposed like massive is lama fix be outbreak were all going all my god is five hundred a ad no points ifs even approach remotely what sues go through in this country in terms of anti memetic hate incidents largely from radical museums by the way and then that number stays wave hundred two hundred clothe way up to twenty fourteen in jorums to many three hundred and twenty sixteen it is still under two hundred an were supposed to believe that according to the eightball the news who are experiencing whet ere only twenty times the number of ha crimes that the that museums are are experiencing in the united states i should point out here that here about three twenty for five million muscles living in the united states about six million news living in the united states somewhere thereabouts again these are very small numbers interns of the general america population the on a per capita basis news are were likely be tarted but of course whenever there is something that targets israel and news we have to mention is lamafogia because the idea is these a moral equivalent an ships a cycle o violence in the news are the one tore down these lame whatever whatever the stupidity here as me we john curly he national security spokes person he was asked whether they were classifying people as to messicteroris for making violentansty memetic threats given the fact that this administration focus in on home schooling moms who did not public school boards i here was curly people on is country making by on a i the me get area domestic heres i do not e know that were class flying people is domestic tears that i may not that is realer question better left the on foremen ism ism not aware that there is been such a at characterization of that u case is that wavering kind of meanwhile alehandra mayor's is not firing apparently a pro compass member of his of his staff the department of woman security officer whoa had criticized israel is this prisoners nest ale a passing an de agent employe she made tell propose to french t israel an a partied occupation and calling for passing and freedom at the expungement is really downfall anta she treated hashing free palestine she is colnenlly on administrative leave joshalley senator from misery since letters to maracas calling for her termination and ton maracas suggested that he might not fire her he here is pall very of medical is this typical of of people to work at the test this is an asylum and emigration officer who is posting these frankly pro genocide slogans and images on the day that israelies are being slaughtered in their beds what have you done about this for thinks it'd to say to you number one your question to suggest that that is emblematic of the men and women of the department upon the security is despicable mi's sorry what have you this person works for the department of hallbland security have you fired her that was one of for answers have you fired her one have you fired her do not come to this hearing room what israel has been invaded and hour students are barricaded and libraries in this country and cannot be escorted out because they are threatened for their lives you have employes who are celebrating genitive and your thing its despicable for me to ante ask the question has she been fired in the answer is gangland misery believe but not fire but not fire that that is the answer right there in terms of whether the west is caving whether jobidon is going to cave these the ongoing pressure from the media and from the fare left of his flank again some mixed signals hoiden in tony blinked they are pushing seriously for a lot of aid for basinal here is the problem with that particular push that particular push is quite dangerous given the fact that if you provide gas supplies into gas romantics all of it wine immediately who is has she administering all that and blinking seedily still have yet to actually explain who is going to actually hand out that stuff and make sure that civilians get it the keep saying the hey all will make sure and thy a well what what if comosstakes to the we and will be very angry lot that that is non t answer the the focus right now on putting aid into into gas as supposed to what really should happen which is temporary camps are set up in the egyptian desert tan her administer by the egyptians his least t egyptians are not here's that the the ages is not ennmgoing to colossal that would be the actual solutionment egypt has not been prettily forthcoming on that particular matter the focus on on aid as a sort of the the ball and all of the america effort makes very little sense in terms of gosh civilian aide again duel purpose has been the entire problem throughout this entire conflict meanwhile there is that conflict its breaking out in you us congress overhead movie israel trade on the one hand you hae the republicans in congress whoa kinds sketchy when it comes to you cranage then non love wit the idea of u cranage with not in enormous mount of overside there skeptical of what the end of that conflict is going to look whether additional military aide is going to allow the e cranial to break through russia lines and say the don was and crime given the fact that extraordinary resource of importing to the country we know a lot of the money is is going to corrupt purposes we also a lot of it is going to fight ruffians and to there a lot more questions about its going on new crane after year and a half of spending tens o billions o dollars in new ran hand wit the hard to israel which has a very long historic relationship wit the united states in terms of military aid and extraordinarily transparent process with the ass department of defense s the re publicans you in the house have proposed separating off that aide the pushing an israel only ad bill according to en pair according to en bear of someday housebreaker my johns to office last week the republican let house pass a resolution the clearing solidary with israel and pledging it to give government to give its government the ability to defeat compass now there introducing a bill aims to you just that but now without controversy because the billets and fourteen point the rebellion dollars to israel without addressing any running request for the working crane bison wants to use the popularity among republicans of support for israel in order to get them to give a bunch more money to you crane my johns is saying but just give the money t israel what it what exactly does does israel have to do with u ran he is going to fun that by cutting the iris is that a good billy at to go i would certainly mote for i mim very much very that believing the iris should be got tin the iris of terrible organization and i thing the money is necessary right now the middle of the war i mi very much in favor of my johnson's aversion the bill here is my johns explaining that this is real are paced stand alone is real a the recording as that there will be vote fully there say that the time e that that o hoping thursday and an't look fourteen point five billion is the number that you are looking at an you think that that maybe you will get aby partizan vote here sure ti hat any that tat the number of demo cats thin my come i hope that it is most or all of them hemin there is a few people who have philosophy differences on that and will have some intend tomatoes about their opposition to that but what this is a matter of good verses evil how is e going to be paid for i we are gin to be releasing at here shortly but o while we my intention and me sere in the first i draft of this bill is to take some of the money that has been seaside for the i building and booking out the iressrit of the about sixty seven billion dollars in that for and we will that tax e fourteen point five necessary for this immediate and even need will dey wit the rest of that issue at bison world is very angry about this they want lynx between the e craned and the israel aide according to political the by administration you crane boss tin both parties are trying to break a wall of conservative resistance on capital how with the determine blitz to pass funding for the war in e crane and a to israel in unusual by partisan offense non capital hell secretary state antonym blink and defensecretary laid listen on tueisday publicly defended the administrations one hundred and six billion dollar request sent i pe leader to much mconnal warns in a speech threats sailing crane are serious and intertwine and later said conceptually he and senate majority leader chucksumer are aline now it is true that russia is backing both iron and his proxies in this war as well as you crane russia is in a various force on the world stage they demonstrated that over and over again i will never understand some on the right who continued to militate in favor of the russia government lad by dick to trial i taxon in vladmerpooden it is astonishing to me you can point out all probably crane including this corruption including long standing antisemitism in you crane also say the vlarpoudent is one of the worst people walking the planter right now and has been involved in legitimately every major conflict apparently of the last several years from africa to the middle east in the worst possible way using the wagoner group an africa using the strains in the middle east backing busharisod cameroon is in a various force the world without question and curbing his military abilities on all grunts is a good trade's the reason why have in the at supported ads you crane not because i love the government of you crane but because i do not believe that russia should be taking over a sovereign state and not only that the russia militaries should be weakened and very much in favor of spending america dollars to weaken the russia military because the russia militaries using it to access in order to destabilize governments all over he globe in angering security of america allies and indirectly america economy and our national security as well s there is a case to be made however if you do not have the supporting congress then you do have to separate them off i think the back of position by the way from my johns is going be to put forbid a bill that does not take the money from the tires but does separate off you crane an israelate the techy smart politics because again it makes the senate now vote up or down on israelate alone and thorp tell a pretty big story if the senate refuses to just give a go ahead to a pass bill with israel aid because they want it connected with you crane but they are really sayings that the israel aid is not important enough on its owns just pass stow be a good political strategy the here is chucksumer ripping into that strategy the best most efficient and fastest way to help it is through by partisantion in fact it is the only way and that why i was deeply disappointed by speaker johnson's first major legislative action a purely partisan action house republicans released to partisan and woefully inadequate pactogwith not to you crane no humanitarian assistance for gaze no fun ding florin dot pacific and poison pills that help we my tax chest avoid paying their fair share ye they are calling that a poison pill i guess that johnson's back up step will be o here wore firemen of the poise knowledge m of the israel that is a good strategy by johns because again here is a fractious caucus a lot of counts does not want additional eucranade johns himself is voted against additional eucranade a few different times it will be interesting to see is more in think the end outcome is going t be the same meaning israel will end up going military aid because there is extraordinary support in both house of congress and from the white house for the military aide bute'll be interesting strategically how johns approaches that and what sort of a bill he is going to have carving off what he perceives to be bad bills from good bills ardygise the rest of the show is continuing right now

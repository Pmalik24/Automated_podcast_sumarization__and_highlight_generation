country but some and the biggest mysteries of the case when never solved until long after nearly everybody involve was dead i most a sentry after it happened the mystery's finally got solved one bobby dinar's descend instead of poking round the old story looking branches she was merely expecting to find to day we devote our entire show to the legend of bobby durbar and to what his granddaughter discovered the messy real story of what actually happened which as you hear three had to be allow more interesting than the legend to day shows redid by the way town myasthenia his you reporter everybody in the family knew it the legend of bobby durbar the lost boy who was found hell the legend was the beckons early nineteen hundreds my grandfather became missing my grandfather had gone on a camping trap with his parents om it was on a alike sway lake actually a swamp in lusyema and she disappeared bobby was just four years old of the time and sway lake was teeming with alligators surrounded by dark thick woods there was a massive search that started in the swamp and spread across the country but nothing for eight months until they found him in mississippi in the and of mister waters the peddler in colombia mississippi they brought him home rote in on a fire rock there was a a tremendous parade wit a a fire took on and the whole town came out and there was a band and everybody salaried ad and and he was found that bobby durbar was not out of danger yet some one else tried to claim him another mother shed lost her child too and said that the boy they found in mississippi was hers there was a big trial that proved her wrong and bobby stayed with his parents mercy and less durbar in opolusas where he lived for the rest of his life it was a it was just a story a tale you would tell yet a your your grandchildren which she would know she was one of them margarita durbar cut right out of every one in the family was a most captivated by the legend of her grandfather's kidnapping as a girl she would beg her grandmother to tell the story over and over when she had children of her own margarita told them the legend too then in nineteen ninety nine her younger brother lobby died in a plain crash a month later she was sitting in the den with her father and he gave her a scrap book that had been her great grandmothers over stuffed with photographs and letters and newspaper clippings from the early nineteen hundreds all about her grandfather's kidnapping is about four hundred articles not in chronological order dad said you this would be a great project for you margarita he had no idea i what o what would come of that without t realizing it bomb had set his daughter on a path that would nearly tear their family apart but in the beginning all margarita knew was the scrapbook felt the thing she would been waiting for in nineteen ninety nine her kids were growing up and in the house less and less her husband way was working in a different state and only home on weekend and margarita was in mourning for her brother she had long empty days in the scrapbook could fill them but the more she dug in the more she began to realize this was not the breezy adventure tale she would grown up imagining even the simplest moments in the story when her great grandparents are finally united with their son after an eight month long national search reporters from several papers were following the couple lassie and mercy durbar on the trained to mississippi throngs of people were surrounding the house where the boy was being kept lassie and mercy went inside but reports diverge on what happened next this article that says that the mother faints the the headline rads mother faint sight of kidnap child when the mother reached the house where the boy was being kept he was asleep missus durbar made a careful examination of the lad without awakening him and was standing over the bed a few hours later when the child opened his eyes the boy recognized his mother instantly mother he cried as he reached up and stretched out his arms to her the mother convulsively embrace the boy then fainted and the second article the headline was missus unborn not positive ladies for missing boy when they reached the hum the child a sleep at the time when awakened it began to cry missus durbar looked in the dim light of a smoky boy lamp and then fell back with a gas i do not know i am not quite sure faltered missus durbar in fact mercy and less i both told the papers that the boy did not look their son his eyes were too small but thin the next day they came back anlessihe gave the boy a bath and identified the moles and scars on his skin and declared he was hers and according to some newspapers bobby did not recognize his father or mother either or is brother gonzo one paper said e bobby at first meeting turned upon olonza with a scowl of anger there appeared no recognition of his little brother and then another paper said the instant they met robot said there is my baba gonzo and reached over and kissed him it was a frequent o currents in the next pipers to contradict one another that is very difficult to om to night for certain what really happen the sort out what happened to try to get to the truth of the story margarita went on n obsessive quest to small town libraries and arrives and court houses all over the out for her birthday her husband gave her a cart for the library of congress and she spent weeks in the reading rooms there and as she dug into the historical record certain figures from the family legend started to seem real people for the first time take the mother who came forward and claimed that bobby durbar was actually her child margarita had never given her much thought she suspend the woman trying to steal her grandfather but in the newspapers this woman has a name dulia andiron she is a single mob working in north caroling as a field hand and a caretaker for the parents of willing see waters the kidnapper waters claimed that dulia gave him the boy willingly that his name was not bobby durbar but brace andiron and that they would been travelling together for overhear when dulia first shows up in the papers she confirms his story although she con test them of his details the first article that hat even brought her into light and a why there was an affidavit rented willing see water has left barnsfall north caroling with my son charges b ran find february nineteen twelve saying that he only wanted to take the child with him for a few days on a visit to the home of his sister i have not seen the child from that day to this i did not give him the child i merely consented for him to take my son for a few days waters had been at the home of his father mister j p waters near barnsvill since nonmember nineteen eleven and while he was there he and the child were together a great deal and seemed very fond of each other the boy would go anywhere with waters i would know my son if i were to see him and i am sure he would know me i have no picture of the child but have a lock of his hair what was your reaction her statement struck me as a very truthful statement this come i us telling truth she did have a son i dim my heart heart's for dulia at this point believing that this boy is her son ye hos really awkward because lassie and dulia are in the same position there both missing children from may of nineteen thirteen on dulia was all over the headlines a new organs paper paid for her trip to opolucis to see if she really could identify the boy as hers the story as wit played out in the front pages was this dulia arrived weary from an overnight trainride and was taken into an police's home five boys around brute's age including the child the durbars had claimed has bobby were brought in at different times and dulia had to choose when bobby came in he was in tears and was dulia he showed no signs of recognition even when she offered him an orange but dulia asked the lawyers in the room if this was the child who was recovered they refused to answer finally she said she just did not know and the test was declared a failure dulia begged for a second chance and the next day she was allowed to see the boy again and undress him this time she felt more certain that it was hers son but her failure the night before was already national news dulia had no lawyer and no money and very few allies an apolunes she left town and began the long trip back to north caroling and from that point on the boy was bobby durbar the more margarita learned about dulia andiron's life the more tragic the story seemed dulia had three children by two different men neither her husband and she lost all her children in just a single year he daughter she gave up for adoption a baby who sudden death she was wrongfully blamed for and now brace but the newspapers were not very sympathetic they implied she was a prostitute called her illiterate and naive take this article in the new organs item titled dulia has forgotten dulia has forgotten ism by very she bad her long journey had been in vain she had not seen her son since february of nineteen twelve and she had forgotten him animals do not forget but this big coarse country woman several times a mother she forgot she cared little for her young children were only regrettable incidents in her line i see i hate this article she hopes her son is not dead just as she hopes that the cotton crop will be good this year of true mother love she has nine see how judge mental then one day margarita found a dulia an person listed on an online genealogy sit with this biographical note quote dulia had a son from her first marriage named brace who was kidnapped from north caroling when he was six years old and taken to louisiana she tried to get him back but the people that kidnapped him won him in court and changed his name to bobby durbar well that was not what my grandmother told me that was not ring it was an upside down world opened up to margarita with the family who believed exactly the opposite of what her family believed and in two thousand margarita did but nobody else in her family to her knowledge had ever done before she went to meet and visit with the descendants of dulia andiron her two living children hollies rails and fuel tartar and fuel's daughter kinda my i must lend a carver and ism the daughter of fuel rats carver who is the daughter of dulia unperson and she yanderson won to be my grandmother all of us cousins grew up a we knew that we had an uncle that had been taken by the durbar family an opolisis louisiana i we always said kidnap we said they kidnaptiam from the andiron margarita learned what happened to dulia after the controversy over bobby durbar dulia moved to papperville mississippi two hundred miles east of tube uses got married and had seven children puli an hollies or the youngest now in their eatings talking to fuel in collision kinda a very different picture of dulia emerges than the one in the newspapers of a barely literate woman of loose morals here is kinda grandmother left to read and she is to read sign gray a books and then she was set him around at night and she would tell them the stories that she had read that day but then when she became a christian she decided reading sin try with the wrong thing to days such they never got thing for sin gray stories but they had listen to the able the we went the church i did nine be e door her this is jug and hollies alias children and we would will de the wood cry know he redo a to so read and go to church and the would be dinner dim for wed my and we would starve to dam for go home collision fuel review their mother dulia did just go to church they say she founded the church sh was a nurse and a midwife for the entire community during the depression she shewed all her children clothes out of fertilized her bags and they were always well fed there was only one thing missing she always tot robot brace but she called hin bobby she was always looking far she never forgot it never ever forgot the boy shed always awhile bring it i and what what a boy look an no she take a while to toilet that he did and this that tea the it if that would have been ad been possible for her to not the chat legally back or anything it she would have done it if possible would she loved the chew she loved brace she shell growing up you knew the brace was out there we knew we knew we had a e use out a we e you that we cannot thank it well one day we will get to go to this town and we will find it but we never did go even though marbeluc's sun gest two hundred miles from poplarville they did not have a lot of money back then and that kind of travel was expensive they told me that when dulia went back up to north caroling for her mother's funeral they had to sell the family fuel to pay for the trip but it was not just the cost holly says sot i reckon you would afraid if you want no real word i knew according to the signs and things tit they had in of lucky the de don bard well well all people durbars everywhere if a we you look it's a dun bar sin on a bel in the something other and people a has old sin e o was always tomtit you did not must with but we the did thank to mom ton well what kind of people were they to begin wait and no if people can do that drug the lolls and git away with it o who ere we the duce try to do or interfere with something that for all the new things margarita learned about dulia andiron's family one of the most surprising revelations jewel in hollies offered was about margaritas grandfather as much as the anteroom's wondered about lobby it seemed he would been wondering about them as well allies remembers the day in nineteen forty four maybe when he was in his late twenties he was working at an ice plant and poplarville and a man he would never seen before came in and started making small talk finally he introduced himself he was bobby durbar from opolucas louisiana hollies was startled but before he could crosses at a customer came in and hollies had to rush off to work when he came back bobby with still there more small talk and now a lot of looking each other over but holly's work got in the way again and eventually bobby left but thirty minutes after he left it do not on me what i had done you pul demand it to been looking favor it er for twenty almost thirty twenty see years anyhow other been telling me aba here is look an be straight at and i did not o non about trying to find out moll about the situation but it did not i just did not and i re get it hollies is sister jewel had a similar story she was working at a service station that she and her husband ran at a crossword's outside poplarville a man came in and talk to her for maybe an hour she says just sat and drank coffee looking only at her and asking all kinds of questions but he did not identify himself a do he la there not got thank in mad it i said that it too i believe he a both when margarita heard this story during her first visit with collision jewel back in two thousand she had her doubts but water margarita was visiting with her uncle and aunt her father's siblings and while they were in the car margarita was telling them about her research and the mysterious encounters at hollisond jewel remembered in the feria mirror she saw her uncle and aunt exchange a charged look then they told her this story here is margaritas uncle herald bobby dinar's youngest son i was to it'd been ninething sixty three some an thirteen years old we were coming back from a trip my brother's wedding an no hi since that and o on the way b act we went through mississippy and a i remember my dead sang pointing sis tho through the people that that they came to pick me up from and yes i e should i stopped and my mother caught her responded if she think the should and they did we stopped then he went in and a to the store and we stay there for may be dirty minute she so and he came back and and we left margarita the granddaughter of bobby durbar and kinda the granddaughter of dulia person interpreted this erecoincidence differently they been discussing margaritas research on the phone and online since they first met on the one hand they were ideal research partners since they both were singularly fascinated with the story but on the other hand it was on uneasy alliance here is kinda margarita is totally convinced that it was bobby durbar all along i was totally convinced that it was brace andiron a along we understood that we were both coming from from different angles again margarita but what was there to do but but had ye now and yet we tried to do it very civilly for months agreeing to disagree gets old fast the difference is between margarita and lend came to a head an colombia mississippi when margarita was invited to share her research at the historical society in town the sound her hearing us from audio of the event in the front of the room were dulia andiron's children hollies and fuel several times during her recantation margarita used phrases this cilia hands the illegitimate child of a domestic dulia andiron sultan holds bristled that was their mim she was talking about margarita went on to described dulia a character in a story working in the fields with course hands and bare dirty feet and she made it clear that she did not really believe the andiron family's version of what happened that bobby was brace but her own families that bobby was bobby son of her great grandparents mercy and lassie durbar when sultan always got home and told kinda what happened she got mad i truly do not believe that when she spoke and and the way she spoke i do not believe that she meant to say it to be is derogatorily we took it either if you wanted ow the truth she had spoken the truth of dulia andiron ad a children out of wedlock she was i a loose woman out would which if if you have to accept that y have to accept it but i wanted hard to see it from my point of view i felt she looked at it from her point of view long it was my turn and i do not remember if it was a written letter or male but i told her the very woman that you marine at that meting to day a very well turn out to be your great grandmother she said to me again margarita you need to look a lot more closely you keep wanting to know all about dulia you need to look more unto lassie and price and judge their characters and that did not make me happy at at sort of anger to may i o tat tax er sat i that an marry spat she was absolutely right i did not a ti put down what i believed and be all to look at it with frat i coming out what margarita discoveries us the kidnappers speaks it's in minute hims cog a a blogadie went o program continues this making life my glass our story unravelling the century old mystery of what happened to bobby durbar continues again his comic tendon by two thousand three margarita had been researching for four years she would taken all the articles from the scrap book and all the articles from all the libraries and tired them over twelve hundred total margarita had maps and photo albums and caper cording and books on her shelf social history of the america alligator that year she started looking for descendants of willing waters the wandering handy man the man who kidnapped her grandfather in nineteen fourteen waters was convicted of kidnapping bobby durbar his lawyers appeal and the state spread court order o re trial but incredibly because the first trial cost the town much money prosecutors decided to drop the case and stay waters was released in two thousand three margarita opened up something called the water's family genealogy book she pored over the names in the book and started making one halls ism can cooper and ism the great niece of willing cannot well waters we always cold him uncle cant i never knew he had willing cannot well until all this came up he was always uncle cannot we met with jeans and her sister barber in savant georgia just hollies and jewel and margarita they would grown up hearing the bobby durbar story too only their version was a little racier well the story we heard was at this o miss dulia andiron was a fine young lady but most of fine young ladies get in trapped and i tell you what his many a handsome young sweet talk men come around and an trapped em that is what happened to miss dulia as the story went now i know it was rumored that uncle cannot was the father and one of his brothers was the father could a been uncle bunt he was grounder he was a real rounder but om they all need it they said it was another feller gene and barber grew up on a farm in georgia with their ailing grandfather had willing water's brother after getting release from jail willing waters had gone back to his life as a tinker a travelling handyman tuning pianos an people's parlors and fixing organs and country churches and at least once or twice a year his travels would bring him around to his brother's house for a visit seen uncle cannot come with his wagon a twinkling an about in the pots and pans of cousin against each other but you could not help but know it was uncle cannot but grandpa would lighten up oh he would just brighten up there is cannot there is cannot younger possible wood don't to fire go to puts on the kitchen fixes om supper you would always come about dark every time i remember him coming it was about dark was not it bobby night it ten matter if we would already had supper to far going out and stow we had light up the fire cook uncle cannot fix uncle cannot from some supper he could sit with grandpa tile midnight but each an every time he come and he would come several times a year and stay a month at the time and er three two to four weeks they set and talked over the case of the kidnapping and how innocent he was it was it had just happened during one visit jean barber's grandfather asked willing waters what he was doing travelling around the country with somebody ease's boy in the first place waters explained that dulia was en dire straits and she could not take care of brace and he was planning in bringing the boy back once she got on her feet and also there was the business element uncle cannot to grenpaul it with that little boy with him people were not nice when he stopped spend the night goes she would stop along the road at farm houses and ram and his travels and ask for a night's lodging and hay for the horses and then he would do things for them being ta pianos bragger whatever and man he said with that little boy the mother's just could not wait to get the hands on the little boy and feed it been curly been bathe in in fact a woman told me one time she had a neighbor i i get not the beaten bath bite kind of explain it that was ugly as home made seen an she was all e time will not take her little grandchild with her everywhere shopping and to the grocer's stor and walk and skit we why dos she wont a carry him along with her and tic well she is ugly it makes she look better to have a little child along with her so i could have would a good cannot haven that little child especially the ladies in the house where a lot nice this a say defense file it sir bat a copy margarita had also track down the granddaughter of willing water's lawyer who had saved in a closet the complete defense file from the kidnapping case when margarita heard that she dropped everything bought a portable scanner and showed up at the woman's doorstep she spend a week scanning the entire thing and then four months back at home timing and deciphering it the defencefile was a gold mine it had correspondence from the governors of mississippi and louisiana hand written letters from dulia andiron and dozens of sworn affidavits from mississippi residents saying that the child was brace andiron and that they would seen him in the area with waters months before bobby durbar went missing and then there was this letter written by willing water's himself just days after he was arrested and thrown in jail a does directly to mercy durbar who had just taken the boy home with him i see that you got brace but you have heaped up trouble for yourselves i had no chance to prove up but i know by now you have decided you are wrong it is very likely i will lose my life on account of that and if i do the great god will hold you accountable that boy's mother is dulia andiron you ask him and he will tell you i did not teach him to bag or boy but inasmuch as you have him take good care of him you have a lost robot and me a lost brace may god bless my darling boy write me if i do not get lynch i think you will be sad a long time but hope not too bad the defencefile was four hundred pages of evidence that directly challenged margaritas family legend and pretty soon margarita reached a breaking point t toward the very end of of me timing the defense file which was not in chronological order ism i came across the latter at that totally ah it was my peffany it was the letter written by a christian woman i don't even a her name she just signed it a christian woman an it was threaten to the attorneys of willing wall tars an it was i kindly pardon ma i am ell an bad but this matter has just forayed me dear sir in view of human justice to dulia andiron and mothers i am prompted to write to you i sincerely believe that durbars have bree andiron and not their boy if this is their child why are they afraid for any one to see or interview him privately i would see nothing to fear and this seems strange the dinar's claimed that the letter goes on for six pages laying out a point by point common sense argument that the durbars have the wrong child why have not pictures of bobby and brace been printed side by side the world could see whether they look or not why is dulia judge more harshly for wavering than lassie when neither of them recognized the child at first which gets a christian woman to her biggest point a look back at that fateful night in mississippi when the dinar's first saw the boy and did not recognize him until lassie gave him a bath and saw his moles and scars if this had been their own child and he had been gone eight months to you think his features would be changed that they would not know him only by moles and scars this is a farce if the dinar's do not know their child who has only been gone eight months by his features why they do not know him at all reason by reason by reason this woman is giving me every and she apparently follow this very closely in the name papers and it just simply done on may oh my on she is wrist this what a farce what a farce this is the idea for a dona test had been floating around for years but margarita had not wanted to do it unless all her uncles and aunts bobby dinar's children agreed to it and then four years into a research a reporter from the associated press allay breed got wind of the story margarita remembers being in the room when even asked her father if he would consent to a donates she was startled at his answer yes he said he wanted to do it now he waited long enough margaritas father bob durbar junior was bobby dinar's oldest son he would heard the legend of course but he never heard it from his father it was not something that we discussed home it was just the the stuff was in the add newspaper articles some pictures it was stuff that my mother gathered in at home we never discussed but bobby had been watching margaritas research with interest remember he would given her the scrapbook that got this whole thing started bobby had just spent weeks in the hospital with congestive heartfailure and explained his decision this way in a letter to his family daddy did not have the science of done to confirm the decision of the court in his youth i feel it is my responsibility to achieve that before i go the easiest way to do the test would be to compare the done of two different lines of durbars some one from bobby's line since his identity was in doubt and some one from his brother olnzofs line since there was no question he was at durbar bobby margarita spoke with elonjofs son avid and he agreed to do the test the plan was to keep the result sealed until all bob siblings agreed to open them a month past i calm to check with the laboratory and the laboratory assistant ism and i not boarding to may the results on the over the fan the deny did not match yen as far as she was concerned it was a paternity test you now i she had no idea that the impact of what she was saying to me it was a shock to me not really that the conflation to hear it margarita got off the phone and drop ten hours that day to tell her father and person he was still in the hospital it took my breath away and i was i just did not i had not considered that my thought was to prove the ready was bobby homeboy so it took me well had lot a time i i was in the hospital a wile and i i just pondered i you known i if if if my past is wrong bobby done bar all the legends all stories a in a and and ten all the sud you fund out well that is not that is not who your blood says your what is that leave no we is if if my racial is in my grandpa who am i bob siblings had no idea he taking the test and that an a pe reporter was preparing to write an article for the national wire bob had to tell them and when he did they were all stunned and really mad mad at bob but especially mat at margarita who they blamed for orchestrating the whole thing and making at national news margaritas younger brother win explained what it was yes she was really going up against the entire family you o i e clad myself fact id not sure of any family umber that was ford a you except for her and possibly my dad i e none and retrospecting es she was doing what she felt dry but a fellow she as alienating everybody else o doing when she was i the other thing about all that is some of us i an the family i and probably even me at one time probably fellow she was being little selfish i we why you no do this what you need to do this yow now the family once to not after the story ran on two thousand for a thick silence to ended between margarita and her relatives and that schism has persisted to this day when she told them it'd called her about doing this radio story the relatives were furious they told margarita that yet again she proving that she could not be trusted they said she was disrespecting their heritage and destroying family relationships they told her that they were durbars and that is all they wanted to be but the other two families involved took a little better virginity barber cooper the great nieces of willing waters it meant their ancestor was not a kidnapper which was nice to hear you do not to think if you peopled being guilty of something that and we did not have a lot both they we had many people bid with it was falsely accused the ones that were accused very easily felt prudent and for the andiron's it was literally the answer to a lifetime of prayers margaritas father bob and his wife a melt went down to mississippi to deliver the news in person to lend the jewel and halls we did not know what was a i said be there you have son they would tell us what that we got to the meeting and now he told us that de can a had been on it tit he was not e debar and that is where has we all is i got up from shower section the couch o we on to think i hoped id make just known the or and we family we just family when on bobby junior misstep tell to came and they tells us about the demand testing that is the day bobby came how and he came in the form if his son and o we are proud for dulia the one things she wanted most in her life was is her child back and she got him i told in that day i id no we not expect nothing from day about frenzy tat i that that we ever have no hard feelings against the nobody o what has halon o back in those days i am sure they thought they were doing the right thing and oh i a been back those days mut i not a felt same ayin a way about somethings that i do not know but now it we just happy about situation but not happy there unhappy if what i talking about we just happy but come we know the truth get an say er coming on wet gain cinder to when my grandmother an my grandfather my i see it the down an margaritas taking on a driving to her obolus she grew up spending some vacations here at her grandmothers with her whole family it is a mix of personal history and history she is read about in her research we go by the public pool where she used to spend afternoon swimming and hanging out and also the old jail sight where willing waters played a home the harp to the crowds outside his sell window want t we drive into a subdivision hat her great uncle plaza developed sprawling ranches big lawns strange street names yet he named some o thy streets this on band captain found and he named mine cop angel may after his wife and there is one call don bar strain whit shall we art ton bar strain they're still durbars in spouses relatives that margarita knows and loves but she does not feel comfortable bringing me in for a visit we are tip going around margarita cigarette brakes are happening more or more frequently the contrast between the tension an spouses and the welcome she would received two days ago from the andirons in poperville is hard to miss silly andiron's children have done nothing but welcome an embrace ma into their lives and they think that ism brave and smart and willing waters family thinks that ism a is i think from my family when i started this project i thought that this wood sort of keep be bonded and it did not it get it it divided an away i feet failure there are people upset by it and on there are some people who still on except that the truth it is they do not believe me they do not they do not believe me the disappearance of bobby durbar blew apart the lives of the different families but the people you would think would be her the worst bit actually come out the best dulia andiron before bobby's disappearance she was a field hand in north caroling on her own not making enough money to feed her own child the people she worked for is treated her the man she married shot her in the foot the night after her wedding but willing waters kidnapping trial got her out of there to a better place poplarville mississippi back an nineteen twelve in nineteen thirteen willing waters and dulia son brace had been well known fixtures in the poplar filaria he an brace stayed in people's homes for weeks at a time while he tuned pianos and repaired the church organ and when willing water went to trial these very people at least twenty of them came forward to testify to his innocence and that is where they met dulia the mother of the child they would known and cared for who was also there to testify for waters after the trial dulia had no money and no place to go the people for mississippi took her in it was almost she was adopted just brace was taken in to be bobby and both on were given a new life i mean that everything that bad could be said about somebody was sad about lie at this trial everything that could be said was say t but these people soul something in her it they would not have taken her in her home and there don't yet the people here in bapabille out of force great they could have left her n o polish second left her in new organs but they brought her home i thing she lost everything she lost she had a baby that died just before she came down here and ow she is lost brace what did she have to live for why did not she suicide was not of unheard of ism sure they didn't promise her that just said come home with us come home with us to you get on your meet come home with us thinking can get up and do for yourselves i cannot regret it i cannot regret for one minute that she came down round sad that that she did not have that child and i do not believe that she would ever made given the opportunity say in o cat wild give you a new life if you give us this child she had have never given that child a i do not believe that but if you hate that it happened then you hate that you are if that mates any since and i do not hate that i am ism i rejoicing that i am i rejoice in the family that that we have got and i feel grandmother felt the same way as for the consequences for bobby even puli andiron's children collision jewel figure he was probably better off with the durbars i do not want to putty him down o my mother down either what i me she did best she could wit what probably she had to do with the fearsome people it he got all the wagon to get in a car those and closed her the divorce papers i promised i know that these her official copies because the notary says are raised the divorce papers of mercy in less i durbar a brief but even the benefactor enough to imagine what life in the durbar family was for bobby after the trial was quite lassie and mercy separated in nineteen twenty meaning five years after the court affirmed that bobby was hers lassie left him her husband and her other sent along behind and moved to new organs bobby was twelve and along was ten also in nineteen twenty mercy beat and stabbed a man while on a trip to florid on the eighth anniversary of the day of bobby's disappearance it is court record for this assault is included in the divorce papers lassie makes accusations of repeated in ongoing in fidelity but mercy denies the charges elsewhere there is another court record that corroborates lassie's claim it is in a rest record for mercy on charges of a adultery in cohabitation but perhaps the most compelling detail as a handwritten note that accompany the packet it is from lassie herself to elizabeth her granddaughter who took care of her in her old age this was for elizabeth durbar t to read after my death she may know why i stayed in my shall of grave she stayed it herself grief i think she had to hive on some level known and maybe she did not i do not know i think maybe she was in a denial a entire lie i from everything have heard she truly believed that this was her son bobby but i cannot help it but wonder that maybe underneath where you go and cannot talk about she must have known that this was not her son that she birth and this is probably at the heart of the durbar family's unhappiness with this story what it suggests about their ancestors and their ancestors motives and characters it is likely to me that mercy must have known somewhere inside of him that this little boy he took from mississippi was not his sin and i do not say that lightly it took me it took me a long time to come to that conclusion ism after reading all of the articles and the court records ism the divorce papers i realized that if he was capable of doing these things if mercy was capable if he could stab a man if he could be with another woman while he was married e now he lies in this pa mercy e i could he lie about this child did he lie about this child he had a motive to save his life's sanity could he i that i think he could i think he did it charged to look square in the face of this and doing has put margarita in her father bob at odds with the rest of their family but bob says only by looking at it squarely can you see the re demotion in their family story when bobby durbar was eighteen he fell in love with ha girl from nearby town it took him nine years to get her to marry him but when she did they raised four children who all remember very happy upbringing full of love and bobby durbar gave rise to this family despite all that head been through whisked away from his mother at three living in a wagon with an old man huddling by fires in the woods at night a two year long gauntlet of undressing and parading and sobbing and staring and when that was all over his new family fractured and fell apart and once again he was abandoned to come out of that to create a family after that to bob is a story of triumph i feel my day would have had all excuses in the world to be a drunk in om child a bus year anything a rascal he had a terrible tramatty young life but he chose my mother and he chose to be a family man that was his world that with his life and i assurlylieve that those experiences for hen and for mother who lost o a father before she even knew him what forces did gravitated them towards one another and towards a common feeling that know they would be am i realize tat i grew up in it chased and family and everybody cannot say that and that could not say that but he made that advent for us at way lake there now houses were fishing checks used to be margarita standing on the country bridge that replaced the railroad trestle looking out on the embankment where they found the four year old footprints in nineteen twelve after considering what bobby durbars is appearance did to everyone in three families for a hundred years there is only one person who is not accounted for if bobby was really brace what happened to bobby i think he fell off this bridge and was tin on all gater and died that is the mice likely senary i when you think about who the boy that died here to that peeling your grandfather it is my grandfather became two people he was fairly brace andiron that who he was born that is where his blood came from that he lived bobby dinar's life in nineteen thirty two when bobby durbar was twenty four he was asked to look back on his kidnapping the linburg baby had been stolen and some reporters came around for a word with the famous kidnapped child of yester year a lot of people still believe i was eaten by an alligator bobby said in the interview i can assure you i was not he went on to recount a memory of being with willing waters on the wagon on the road before the arrest before he was recovered by the durbars in the memory there was another boy with him who fell off the wagon and died and was buried there was a theory put forth by the prosecution at the trial that willing waters might have been travelling with two boys bobby durbar brews andiron this would explain why two boys had been lost but only one was found it would answer the question what happened to brace nineteen years later in nineteen thirty two bobby had taken that theory and made it into a memory a memory which might have served in other purpose altogether if bobby durbar is to fully become bobby durbar then brace andiron needs to be dead maybe it was by settling on this memory the other boy on the wagon that he created the legend he needed to begin his new life his own legend a

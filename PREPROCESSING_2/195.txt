last week an went you in the woods an organ with his bird expert no sticker looking at birds every day he goes out for eaten hour often is thou more when trails round his house that he and his parents cur back when is a kin and give never been birding i have no idea how much a bird watching grab he just listening for the birds we set out in the morning mut still foggy already i can hear some birds calling tow there is a spotted to he long calling just behind me that was a californium quail waking out did you get a little w that was the sound of a teller is jay imitating a red tailed hawk we the birds well enough you can tell when a bird is imitating another bird badly yes is not a real red tailed hawk seller's jays are just kind of bully's in general and they imitate red tailed hawk as far as i can tell just to terrorize at other little birds in the forest there is a word i do not know honestly which word about this is if no one can tell that it is not a red tail hawk and he is not even a bird cannot other birds bellmen for him if they can why wouldn't stellar ja keep doing it cannot s o that question no one tells me about how type years ago he bought this powerful microphone a parabolic microphone the capture bird sounds from a great distance the first bird i ever aimed it at was hi seller's day sitting up on a branch he turned on his recorder front have hounds and waited fort to make some noise and i realize it was sitting ut there with it is beat clothes singing a very quiet whisper song to itself that only itself could have possibly heard because it was quiet the just blue my mind i have never listened to birds the same sense i think they do make noises just for their ownsake allot of the time going a birding would know is going out with somebody who is insanely knowledgeable about birds he is written five books about the behavior toward the world seeing six thousand of e near eleven thousand existing bird species in just one year and twenty fifteen he knows a lot he is also still completely excited about birds can't enough he to me the story he goes to antarctic for months studying penguins some as he gives tours to visitors of the penguin colonies first he says they love it they go into the colony they see the baby penguins which are supercity and men day five or people get up in the morning in er where are we gingko go to day and you say we are going to a penguin colony and there is this look that have learned to recognize it is have just been at eight other penguin colonies in the past four days how as this one going to be any different but for me i have never felt that look in my whole life have never got penguin out he happily goes back to the same colony wit the same woods around his house everything day now says this endless interesting birds began in sort of typical ways if with grade he first notice birds for red when his teacher stand copped of bird feeder to t e classroom window and he could stare at the birds through the glass just inches away he staid reading the field guide looking for birds on his own doing to look a bird in cob everybody else the cod by the way was in the sixty seventies and eighties he was twelve the one gid energetic bird no my house or a person know acre does have cold of a ne patrol carisfibe but the thing he says that changed him from that kind have leisure time birder it somebody who organized his entire life around it happened because of turkey vultures one particular pack of them we were sixteen i saw this episode of a teeth so called the life of birds were avid adenborouh goes into a trinidad and rain forest and he has this smelly old on piece of stake in his hand and than berries the stake under the leaf litter on the forest floor in the rain forest and then fast off and then they cut and then forty five minutes later is one this turkey vulture i comes sailing down through the canoe of that forest you and flies unerringly right to the spot where the stake is and it digs it up to love the leaves aside man he gets the meat it seems almost unbelief when i saw that in the life of bird as icicles had just immediately had ones tot a was i got a try this at home that is the best bird veery idea have ever seen in my life seemed incredible to him it he might be would word these birds usually see from far away turkey cultures are shy hard to get near the might be of to see them come up he thought we have it outonborough got one bird to show up winsome old piece of stake maybe he would improve his it is ma with something bigger imagine how many turkey vultures talk attract with a deeper there many deer here in rural or again on the side of the highways in freeways i can now go out and find a road kill bring a whole carcass home and a see how many turkey vultures we can attract but it was cut hard to find a road kill as it turned out it took me a month to track one down note way t put that last sentence if you were in a sixteen year old very eager to see turkey vultures up close n only took a month to find a deer carcass not rested the heavy blooded ghastius yellow jacket covered putrid smelling deer my into the trunk of his elf as shutdown got home put the deer in a wheel barrow peeled it out to this very spot were we are standing in this pasture and dumped it it is right here were were standing this is the spot i chows this point in our a boardwalk we were standing with an eye shot of the house at your can but not too close the coasters overgrown that was for his white oaks around its end o is asurkere i thought this would be a good spot because you can see it from the sky it has multiple approach pass from the air they will be as attracted as passible to this deer carcass is dark he went to bed no idea of this little work gets up the next morning and there were turkey vultures everywhere they were sitting on these trees read yer there we vultures sitting on the roof of our house i ten of hem lined up on our roof there re vultures circling overhead they were probably thirty or forty turkey vultures hang it around the yard and when i look up and realizes that this had happened i was happy i rushed out here and id set up a little camiflas tarp next to the deer carcass here was o the tarp was just unit in this wet grass if i come of a year i was hunker down right about here s if i cannot get down i was sitting under a tarp with the hole in it in my camerlands sticking out hes maybe ten feet from the deer he waited in and then finally it was magic the first one came down and once one came down they all started just piling down it was not what he imagined the was can be chaos win a pack of lions ripping into his hero down hat unfolded was very polite yetthey were just delicately walking around an standing on top of at and starting to pick at it gingerly it was not a brute force kind of thing at all and they were very well behaved i thought the was almost a pecking order involve they knew which birds we are get to eat first and they adhere to it i sons very orderly it was an orderly seen of turkey vultures eating their breakfast where do they start i thought i was call the softest parts of the deer that is where the turkey vultures would start sticking their heads into they did not i was expecting them to tear a big hole in the side and just go at it but that is not what happened at all they actually started by pecking the eyes out i guess those of the softest part of the deer they went for the eyeballs and then they went in and very carefully ate the gums out of the deer around its teeth theft go for the soft parts considered a very strong feeling or beaks instead a turkey higher just cut it sticks its head up inside the body intended bawl and red with no feathers which is handy for sticking inside of carcasses and not getting your feathers all must out the turkey vhochras next started eating around the wound on the deer's shoulder m where got hid on the highway took turns eating round there till they got begenough opening to get access to the chest and got and everything else no i would go off in the mornings and do ten at camp another kid stuff thegn back to his tart for hours and hours i do not know how many hours i spent out here that week but it was full afternoons pretty much every day all we long i got to see the whole process at the beginning the deer carcass was relatively fresh and then gradually it was stripped away and by day five or day six they were starting to disassemble the skeleton that was pretty much picked clean it was being drawn into another world that exists in this world that we are very seldom apart of being close to these birds that do not normally allow us to get thank close to them whats passing through some kind of force field or something and emerging on their side of the divide and feeling that n their world is not the same as ours no an it is existed for much longer than ours has i mean humanity is not that old turkey vultures have been round for quite a lot longer than we have man and you stare into the eyeball of a turkey vulture and it blinks its third glad that birds have that is just unsaddling they are strange strange animals they just have this weird very septillion vide before this of course are easing lofts of birds but was checking them off e list this one an that one that he red about the field guide he never just stored one group of birds for long and watched how they related to each other be what they did turkey vultures are what i would call a spark bird for a birder a spark bird is the one you see usually in some kind of unexpected situation tit grabs you in a way that you have not been grabbed before by birds and turns you on to a wave length that had not been turned on to before in the bird world people will talk about what sher spark bird birders when we get together and get out on feel jets the you lee to say o ya what was your spark bird a that is a cool on what was our spark bird and you ask just about any birder out there what the sparkbird is and now probably have answer for you for me that week watching these vultures being in their world just gripped me it change my wife that we can the pasture by this house is basically turned into his entire wife thanks to the sparkbirds then of us heart a perm had ever herd the firs sparkbird

species in the world rare that only one family massachusetts has ever spotted them in till right now even knows about them that is in a minute chcogabub a radio wen our program continues tismercan life from my rat last day show spark bird during this week when the tradition is together together at a table around a bird we have stories of spark birds the birds said get it all started for somebody that make you see things differently and a you are just training ain we began t our progamtidy with no a sticker who is the author of the thing with feathers and other books and bird behavior nobody who sparkbird was the turkey vulture and what our producers call win or i spent hours trumping around the woods with him and crestwell dragon which was hours of actually doing the thing that today show us about learning to see things differently through birds and i just one of put you little more of this because much of what know it told us long the way was new to me in cloy we princess knower was telling us how the summer we one night he was home and you're this bird sound he never heard before i don't even knows know ani came running out here with my flash light as it was dark cause it'd no idea what it was interacted down and it was a fledgeling screech owl sitting on a branch and its just a had not learned to yet how to make the proper screech out noise yet birds babble just human babies do scientists will call it sub song and have these other technical terms for it but isthmus birds learning had a sound birds birds babble human babies do i did not know owlishly never think about the fact that it wive in the middle of a whole world of birds i do not notice om i do not hear them singing but o course know cannot stop himself from hearing them and instantly recognizing that that is a pacific rend that is a chestnut ta chicken or whatever and he does not just you're the bird sounds when he is walking around outside becoming an bird a ruins holly would movies for you forever because whatever bird sounds are in the background in the sound tract whether there just natural or whether they dubbed them in even there never the birds that would be in the place that the move has sat at the season that it set and and it drives me nuts landing how hard i it it be to put the proper bird sounds in there i out to movyou that this happened to loan well just yesterday i saw the move spencer the new lady die move they had red wine blackbirds in the background this is suppose to be what rope in the case somewhere red wing blackbirds do not live in rope that is a whole contain in away from where they would actually live they had sellers jays in the background and all kinds in north america species obviously this move you is filmed by north america who ere dubbing in north america birds into a completely wrong background and just the legs to which they go to get all the historical details in period pieces a your head at you sheep it the headlight that no one is ever get a know honestly when you watch the move and yet the bird sounds are all over the map and there are many birders out there me who know what they are listening to that is not unusual this i guess would be the downside if having a bird if wen ride to something about the world the most to not notice would me or to fixes know says there arises wit most bird sounds maybe sounded tors know would love to hook you out job my mine he says the cops problem is word does not care about birders how i would knows that the continue to show up wit their factor we an accurate movies and stream their error ridden tell of son shows cause resting n to go when they need to watch something its indoors an not wild alive and feathered that too a scrub is a bird there cannot get no wove from me we now ism trying to a blackbird that strutted a pluvial five a fight that is last for a very long time concerning one states official state bird be made won me tells the tale the thing about an official state bird is that it just really does not matter i say that with no intended disrespect to bird as across the nation some of my best friends a birders but think about it on was the last time you sat down and truly considered the cisertelled fly catcher who is the avian embodiment of the state of oclahomer exactly it is absurd it state bird has nothing to do with the states g d p for example it does not tell us how happy the children are it makes no one's life materially better or worse and yet in florid the debate about which flying animal deserves the total of official state bird has been on going for more than two decades the state bird means nothing but somehow in florid it is come to me in a hello a lots florid was actually one of the first states to designate a state bird back in nineteen twenty seven it was probably a simple choice the northern mocking bird is a good bird as birds go it likes the saying it has an incredible talent for mimicry and with its gray coloring it is cute here is the thing big the northern mocking bird is the official bird of another four states besides florid its actually the third most popular state bad behind the northern cardinal and the western meadow lark after seventy two years some people that had enough of this spreadstin stay bird enter the spark bird of the story the scrub the fluoride scrubby is the only bad on the planet that is found only in florid it is a sturdy looking bird with the dull blue head and wings it is in care exactly we the late republican rep howwoard fetch was such a champion for the scrubby but in nineteen ninety nine he cosponsito bill for it to become the state bird maybe it was the fact that fetch represented braved county which used to have the highest number of scrubjays in the state but i think he just likes the bird is he put it it is got good family values it is kind and it is a bird that likes people scrubjayes do something called cooperative breeding which means that each nest has an adult pair but it also has helpers usually the older siblings of the new e say babies who help feed the young and defenterajry very different in fudge's opinion from the mocking bird the mocking bird a lot of people love that sucker he said but it is pretty mean och there is nothing human beings cannot make about themselves even birds and the fight over the florid e state bird very quickly became loaded with familiar political tropes on the side of the state as quod the side of the incumbent mocking bird was one a florist's most famous tenias martian hammer hammer is a long time lobbies with the national rifle association and the architect of florid stand your ground law and she is no fan of the florid a scrubby in her committee testimony hammer dismissed the bird as a thieving scrounger in the strongest possible terms they eat the eggs of other birds she said that is robbery and murder and in response to the scrubjays alleged friendliness exemplified by the wade eats out human's hands she had a rebuttal begging for food is not sweet it is lazy and it is a welfarementality the response from the other side was just as harsh democrat rap mark afford called the mocking bird and obnoxious plagiarizing and promiscuous b fully state rep lurch and the scrub a had the audible society on their side and they also had a chunk of florid citizens school children thousands of them signed a petition in support of the scrubjhay hammer had a hunch about who was behind these passionate school children she suggested they had been influence by environmentalists trying to secure extra protections for the scrubby it is adults hiding behind impressionable children she said if they get end on the endangered list you can kiss your property rides good bye this had begun as an argument about something that means nothing but now it had become an argument about the biggest things it would have been neater if the camps were strictly a republican versus democrat but bird choice in party affiliation did not always aline the choice o state bird became a proxy referendum about what traits floridians should find admirable depending on which side you were on the mocking bird was either a standing for rugged talented individualism or it was a raucous bully and the scrubby seem through one lends as nurturing family values and sweet enough to palaround with humans somehow also became the poster child for a reliance on big government and its handouts here is where it is now in the twenty twenty two legislative session there will be three new bills from democrats and republicans alike to changed the state bird by the way there are other candidates besides the scrubjhay every previous bill has died in committee it always dining committee but hope die last is recently is last months hammer was defending the mocking bird and making the scrub jays sound phantoms from a ninety crime bill calling them evil little birds that sober the nests of other birds and eat their eggs and kill their babies one might call that street gang behavior in the avian community birr r and very familiar with irrational and hyperbolic debates about regional former in my own home country the aka we are not abut turning benin animal behavior into weird politicking here as long been a pair battle waged between the indigenous and endangered red squirrel by some accounts an noble and scrappy creature and the gray squirrel a larger in evasive america interloper who has ideas well above its station it has brought forth every time of natives narrative you can imagine in a debate in the house of lords in two thousand six lady salmon of avenethy likened the red squirrel too quiet well behaved people who do not make nuisance or an exhibition of themselves or commit crimes and do not get themselves into the papers in the vulgar way gray squirrel to do one i was at university i swear i read tabloid stories that basically compared gray squirrels to america gets during and after world war too over fed over sext and over here since two thousand and eight prince charges has been the patron of the red squirrel survival trust in twenty seventeen the prince backs of government plan the sterilize gray squirrels using the teller as bate that is a step beyond what floridians are doing they have yet to ebonize any spreads or condiments in their fight to choose the state bird the state bird whose anointment will make no one's life worse or better the mat of wen ma there is no bird in respects only one the crores t om a doing we need talk about bird way get just what i say word about what i find interesting about this next story ism i think every couple there are the things that you share and talk about with each other and you no then other thing you do not show much but each couple has o kind of invent or discover the territory of stuff that they have not common and where they meet up and the more stuff in the terry try probe the better cause the more chicks yo have do connective for close all that the couple in this story they had their stuff they were you do not even raising kids together with orb is a huge thing that but as the kid's got order the couple invented this whole other original common ground for themselves also this birds show call explains before i get into what the stories about i just want to say that the couple in question peter and his wife fatty are normal people they must be mat i i grass s year o tan theater howling northward in massachusetts is normal its of age four bedrooms upstairs on for each kid peter and fatty crammed themselves into the attic for a long time there are blended family peter came to the marriage with two sons fatty has a son and a daughter all of them are ground doing well now is just the parents at home ace smarty works is a lawyer recently one o big case through the innocents project i do trial work and i do a pallor i a peter is a professional musician just towards rope playing bock arrangements on a special guitar he designed you'll i been an artisstall my life really a why think om really grateful for that and it is for more than ten years now a sizable number of their conversations with each other concern a family of imaginary birds with whom they live six birds who do not exist and yet each have names and listing t personalities successes an failures most of them have corresponding stuffed animals associated with them peter and fatty might spend more time talking about these birds than about anything in reality the birds lives resemble those of great school children they attend bird academy right there on the bird bus and they're kind of little menaces always accidentally spilling things on themselves and throwing parties of the house when peter and many were away yet they somehow also meddled in the olympics and reported to gamma word winning record here is matt it is odd i mean i know it is to upon reflection because it is this is poteen story li now it is every day and it is woven all through the day and for example if i was doing something at work let a difficult meeting with e clean a a jailor something then afterwards when i would call peter to say ism on my way home or whatever then he would say how hoar the birds how did they do and then i would say terrible usually usually the birds do terribly the birds had a tantrum in the car with my collage the birds were rude to the investigator that is sort of how a rise is a lot is asking how the birds managed what we were managing sort of when peter went up to make to visit a sonchester ho just fixed up an old boat that he was sailing and living on which peter's really proud of him for having accomplished and a of course one ism on the home with fatty calling her from up there it like well the birds ethereally the boat the boat is really small it is really they thought it was get you the boat on succession on the tevisho succession h tie yacht which by the way is not how peter felt about the boat the views and opinions of the birds do not necessarily reflect to those of peter and fatty sometimes they do but it is not that simple it is more their this messy green chorus that always has to be accounted for in factored into almost every experience it is a very elaborate running joke they seeing what each others can at come up with next poke fun at each other see of the birds pushing pull and go no the birds do not do that the birds through this you know there rule talking about you now the birds hateskating it is we but to birds o ice the birds haven annual o than cogbirit passed which is always cancel at the last minute at the last minute it will turn out they did not really have a terminate they had not really spoken to be on face man jar the throwing out ideas and coming to a consensus is a lot of how they built the bird world for instance the birds are rely in to milkshakes their birdmobiles ere outfitted with special shake machines but they fiddle law suit against shakeshek after one of them got his head feathers caught in a ceiling fan which is really shame because the birds loveshakeshi they are not been from shakes not ben but t must have soured them on the whole shakeshak experience i i do not think many they got a tonomoney and they still can get shakesthere ye it is important to say too this is the first time peter and matter have ever talked about the birds in front of any one not other than their kids and peter's therapist once or twice in passing they have never mentioned the birds to a single soul until now it is just too out there they told me and too hard to explain which means this is also the first time they have had to answer any questions about the birds they have never examined any of this even in private when i asked them something why they do it or what they get out of it they really had to puzzle together those answers in real time as this sat with them ism not trip to ye ism not try to sell you don't say ism just reporting it that it is happening here and the whole thing with the birds it is not just frivolous it is actually been helpful in the family in some ways in hurtful too which it'll get to but just to say o it began the birds first entered their lives about a dozen years ago when patty's daughter peter's stepdaughter era but fatty a little stuffed way monster technically it was something called an ugly doll but to fatty it looked a bird era was only about twelve years old at the time and i do think it was the first thing that she had ever bout for me it was a very sweet get and i just loved at much and then i gave it this felly name hardly hardly was the spark bird the bird that sparked the capital bee birds matter started bringing hardly everywhere birdie wrote in the car with her she took him on vacation peter would idly toss him to the other side of the bed and fatty would be hay careful and this had not dawned on matt until we talked about it but this was a round the same time that her custody arrangement with her ex husband was changing used to be the kids would ever be away from her for more than three days at a time but then they switch to one week on one week off and in the beginning the week that i did not have them out an at turning i could not is a challenge i think it was fair and i think it was the right thing to do but that was the period that i was misting my children i think that ma have been why tat super touched even to the bird that she gave me and very quickly birdie grew personality of his own adventures irresponsible machiavellian he take our creticards in peter and matte's names neglect to files taxes for five years but fatty would dote on him none the less at first i found hardly really annoy she just got exaggerated about how precious he was and how and i would just fee o k at please and then somewhere i crossed some line and moved over into a well he does not you he did not do a thing to he do the dishes sir something you know i participating it it and then it she would be what he had to work on his presentation for school tomorrows we the psychologist and marriage expert john goyim and talks about how couples ere always sending each other these little requests for attention subtle wo would you look at that sunset sometimes the other partner to shrugs but in some couples the more contented ones the partner responds enthusiastically ah how yet it is beautiful think the birds are a request that sometimes the birds will even swoop in and help them communicates something that is difficult to express this one time he is fine now but peter was deathly ill yet bacterial infection in his spine and they were driving back from a doctor's appointment where they would got in some bad news the wood in the car was did and after saying nothing for a long time peter goes oh we have to stop at them all the birds want to go to them all i mean what els i gan a say rid remembered as the best way for me to say something do not worry about me i mean you ki you cannot tell her not to worry but but you can talk about the birds what about the birds they wont wont of them all o and then her's the way in which the birds have not been great for the family again they four kids and they each had somewhat different responses to bird world the oldest torsion thought it was kind of funny and he left for college anyway not long after it started hank was indifferent except that it as some kind of code that is parent she is to communicate cheater the very youngest of the for thought it was annoying and not funny and then there was era who again gave fatty her mother the doll in the first place and who was the most grieved of i was evenly jealous this is era she is twenty five now i was jealous of hardly i do not to if i felt forgotten but i was lovely jealous now as the youngest of patty's two kids era was used to being the baby doted on showered with affection and suddenly she had to bear witness to this overwhelming overweening geyser of praise and attention her mom gave hardly and the other birds the theme that bothers me the most is if you say something about your life and then the birds have their own thing about their life it would be if you got and a the birds either got in apples play or they got in f mines but mom is still somehow more interested in their a mines that she is in your ay which temper was not true but that is just how it felt at the time tats really when the intense dislike of perfectly began to felt and billed and billed and billed until sometimes at exploded i do not think i was clear enough that i was not kitting when i am saying that the birds thing bothers me ism not playing along with the bird universe where nobody likes the birds and their sticky and annoying and they are failing out of classes and their teachers are reporting them i really really do not it i could not say that or i was not saying it right think that it was it always felt it was playing along until i had a tam dram and i would screen mat her that they are not real which a think did hurt her feelings and looking back on it now era says her mother was giving her an appropriate amount of attention affection praise all of that but back then she really felt she was in competition for it and after all the birds did not deserve it because them not existing in all anyway for the first couple of years who was just hardly just the one bird and then this one fateful day era took action it'd had enough and i stole him and i hid him between the box spring and the mattress of the bed that i slept on am and i forgot that i did that i honest to goodness for got that had done that i felt panic i told the house o par i mean i felt the panic that you we if you having in dor you day cat and they do not come ho mat i i was disappointed in myself that i had you nowt carelessly lost him which of course in eve's mind confirmed all of her fears that matte loved hardly more o got even more jealous and then finally peter went out and bought another hardly exactly the same doll same color whole thing but instead of telling matte here honey i know how much he mist that doll i bought you another one he claimed to have found the original hardly which was just more wilful suspension of disbelieve of course hardly is not some one you can just go out and purchase at a store any old time he is unique a bird in a million and that was good enough for matte felt a lot better but then come a months after that matte's doing a really thorough cleaning of the house is inner daughter eve's room turns the mattress over you can see where this is going she comes to me and she is look what i found and i was that is that is your right that is hardly and that is because all this while his twin sister has been pretending to be him to make you feel better while he was he had to go out into the world and is then sister being the newer more plant cleaner one right a who had an amazing this for him it is out of what is twelfth night orbs something it is dislike some i control of that o although ism also he bewildered by it and she just loved that that is how birdie at was on bird eldest birdie's twin and soon all the other birds join the flock to one of peter's sons gave fatty doll she called doctor body he looks a little a robot and that he is a bird and a diktat he is received the no bout prize for medicine for having cured spacethrash era gave me the insider school on doctor body he is also missing i think that i hit him and i do not know where is currently missing he is been missing for years but if gasman she will tell you he is on semantical next came hobiletta we boobs she is an owl ten there is panguena a penguin studying to be a bird mobile mechanic he is in the car and we is him as a lumbar pillow and finally there is wing who he is not embodied no physical incorporation whatsoever stuffed or otherwise at this point eve's original goal to disappear birdie that matte would not pay much attention to him could not have back fired more badly her parents conversations now involved exactly five hundred per cent more birds than there had been and to make matters worse her older brother toasting when he was home would occasionally get into the act egging their mother on to keep telling bird stories and again hit was it there is no malice there they thought it was just to say as any other teasing that we as a family did all the time but i felt replaced t and there is there is no way that that could have been addressed was what us just even say after having bolt yelled at tan i know the birds are fake i hate you i hate you in your fix birds they are not real there is stuffed animals to then be but also i do feel the real and you are hurting my feel i as e feel real they are real yo are real i mean what is real other than what everyone around you says it is real right i mean there no if everybody around you is talking about them a and they are having significant social emotional psychological an pact on your life i do not see what is realer than that era says she is still not of fan of the birds these days but in the last couple years she is finally reached a little equanimity with them the lots changed she is older as a good job not living at home any more his help plush she is unpacked a lot of personal stuff than made her especially hyper sensitive and in secure as a tea nature eleven ask her on from time to time how the birds are doing just as a way of connecting with her she read me this taxed conversation she had had with matte a couple of days before our interview something about the birds needing an attachment in their birdmobiles to hold the dipping sauce for their french rise i said birds need that there is ranch all over the bird to ball the steering calla can barely turn it is guy with honey mustard and then she said exactly honey mustard is the worst things that attracts fruitflies i said yes the gearshift is all sweet and soured up also ranchesterian it it is a total nightmare that was a totally normal big oursegen totally entertaining totally fine i started it and matte's met era partway too seven apologized for filling the house with much birdlime's especially when she learned through this story amazingly that era actively stolen hid hardly way back when i had plane to ask matt about that thing evasaid earlier about the birds being quote quote real son my list of questions but before even got to it she actually brought it up first told me she had been worried i was going to propose the order real question you have sought here i am that i gens in amazing that ism can defencelayer and then ism asking myself the question i did not want to be asked but i mean ism right ism putting it o the i i cannot say that they are not real to me i cannot shift off that i will not shift off ta is what would happen if you do i mean what would happen think we be a huge loss i think it would be a huge loss the kind of lost you might feel when you have to stop playing your favorite sport as your body cannot hack it any more for maybe the lost you feel when you finish watching all five seasons of your favorite show except way way more because this is their show they created it and constantly up dated and it is been going on since the real children were in middle school it gives them some of that feeling of being parents i think except without any of the worries and without having to watch the birds get any older or fly away bunco one

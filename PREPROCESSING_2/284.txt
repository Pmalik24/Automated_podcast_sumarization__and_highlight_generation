then he began his days by throwing open the door to the bedroom my share of my brother down he would stand there and is under were looking a tall diner child and say you too get up he would in the day drinking a lot of doubter fifty budwisers at the shanty bars that littered the port of brownstone at home mom kept the bookkeeping she watched the flow of money slow to a trickle and then stop outright when i was in middleschool my brother sisters and i you things were did when our mother stopped shopping at ell central super market the nice crosrstore as she would always told us en started bringing home bags from lotus super market the poor people grocery store cone morning most surprises me by showing up it my seventh great algebra class and removing me getting us on the road out of groundsill headed north there is no explanation sing that the yakaiate she snaps at me sit down and shut up i a i do not know why i did not guess what we were doing that morning the moment idol accounts for dad who was on the road somewhere behind us and one of his floknos tract or trailers carrying a large look marital and had a north i had heard the stories new some to the tactics a smoke in by this point but i did not make the connection that mom and i were driving had of dad to make sure the custom station was closed and if it happened to be open we were supposed to turn back and warn him this was back in the nineteen eighties before the retroact and there were two yours customs check points blocking the migration of drugs fruit people reptiles and parrots on the roads between the united states and mexico both about one hundred miles north of the medical border at highway choke points the station on highway seventy seven and serena was the busier and the better finance the check pointing hebrnvilleveug was an erstreame trailer with an attached carport to protect the ages from the sun and it would often clothes for breakfast for lunch we are headed towards that one this morning going north on highway to what y one driving through the scenery of astatic plants and stunt trees the car is hot nowhere conditioning my mom and i are saying nothing to one another we have each decided that the other is unworthy of conversation we stare at the windows and think very different things mom is thinking about the hundred dollars she and dad at spent before six o'clock that morning one hundred dollars that would help them make two thousand knowledge if things went right because her first stop on this fell in the excursion was to dad's gudandetta whom we knew as lasignota dad's personal which doctor for an emergency session they were let right through at five in the morning and they had only one burning question will the check point be open after years of sitting through precessions with my grandmother i did not have to be there to know exactly how it went in the gudandetta's office a signora is older matronly dresses in the thin frock with heir hair pulled back in a bun she has my parents sit across from her desk in ha black leather love seat with come handles a panorama photos hang around her office some wallet sized others larger and in portrait a pencil sketch of a camera by one of her grandsons hangs necks to a window she listens closely to their question nodding sleepily at their preoccupation sympathizing understanding they have reached a decision and the cannot turn back they tell her they knew to do it no other choice any more she stands up abruptly and walks behind her desk which has letter with sheets of note book paper crawling with ink illegible notes names of people sets of critic numbers whole addresses of saints she closes her eyes and scribbles something on her yellow legal pay nonsense to anyone else reading it on her desk are two cheap leaded crystal bones each filled with a clear liquid she gently reaches for her matching show lass and lifts it to the light making it sparkle she places the glass on the surface before her and part from one better then the other when the two clear liquids mix they turned a deep crimson and thicken plasma she nods her head as if her suspicions have been confirmed she produces a glass orb filled with water sitting on a black plastic ring she sits up straight closes her eyes and regulate her breathing into a loud rhythmic inhalation exhalation that unconsciously forces mom and dad to do the same after a few seconds she opens her eyes suddenly and strikes the glass orb with a metal wand making it ring in the clear morning air then she lifts the a between her two pudgy hands and stares deeply into the inverted image of the room around it sitting opposite this chicanery and watching everything she does your drawn to the ritual and you cannot help tut try to figure it out too no she says with certainty the check art you not the open this morning go in peace got me with you when mom and i reach a check point at eleven forty five that morning it is very much open for business a line of a are five deep stretches back from the underbudget ad airstrike trailer our job now is to go through and then turn back around and reported dad that his doom was indeed imminent mam is visibly shaken she turns off the radio with a hard click and considers this considers her options from the car we can see a skinny middle aged white guy and green border patrol garb sitting on a reclining chair and the open doorway of the airstream trailer he is facing the cars as they pass under the tin roof it must have been a hundred ten degrees inside the trailer a hundred in the shade from his position never bothering to get up the agent sits founding himself with the newspaper and sleepily peers into the cars asking if every one is an america citizen waiting for an accented answer smiling and then waving them through a sympathetic priest granting absolution hi we all going to today asked the skinny little man man's window is now only half way open and in her nervousness she rolls it all the way up hi sorry i mean sanantonio as she opens the window you all america citizens yes she says and she leans back he could get a clear look at me nodding my head i do not say anything except the quiet yep when i odd but he has not heard me there is an uncomfortable pause i think because here supposed to hear your accent there is an anxious beet and he still has not let us go when i say yes i am a bit too enthusiastically mam laughs nervously she had been hoping our light skin would exonerate us without a problem you all have a nice day he says he has not noticed anything awkward we drive through and i feel her seethe for the next few miles that was about noon somewhere behind us and a road side rest stop dad and my older brother can our waiting in distract or trailer which is attached to the trailer with the marinate the two center idioms that run the length of the trailer make perfect housing once he welled metal plates all along the underside and at the tail end it creates a long rectangular box sealed at the rear and with the excel of the rig where twenty forty pound blocks of marijuana can be hidden this is went down down or can i wondered dimly if can his figured out what he is doing out here on the road north when ye should be in high school but can has always been more street wise which savior than me i figure that if i figured it out he do figured outman mam and i drive on to abrenvill ism be high dated i want to stop at a sore we cannot she says to me we have to turn back i think we are behind still ism hungry and really thirsty i persist certainly we have time to get to a convenient store the cannot have schedule listing to hinge on a few minutes certainly they've devise thus more cleverly than that please i clear just stop at the seven eleven grudgingly she plates the noisy car around the small town and finds a convenient store i get out with a couple of dollars and come up short when i try paying for some donuts in a chocolate milk i returned o the car for more money just get in she ells and i do weaving the food of the counter mam wipe the car around and in nitrogen we to it by i we travel that for a few minutes and when the checkpoint is back in sight we hold our breath the guy will not see us and right then we see dad and dad and the trailer heading right for the check point dad had become nervous or may be brave or maybe he was blinded by his hundred dollar faith minutes goudondetta and had charged forth without waiting for monger sort oh god my mother says and all the blood drains from my face from just a tone in her voice i had never heard her voice charged with fear oh god she says again with her left hand she grabs a knob the controls a headlights and flashes at dad we was only a few hundred feet from the check point she flashes fore times an clear view of any one who is paying attention i wonder if that is her signal of the check boat is open but question the wisdom of doing it while he is next in line in full view of the guy a the check point were my to look over his shoulder and see the noisy south bound car that just drove through not thirty minutes before she slows down sos terrifically down going less than twenty miles per hour on the highway and for a moment i can see dad is driving i can see that the blood his drain from his face too making his eyebrows stand out a rich black on his pallid deathly white forehead a mask of some one pretending desperately that everything his a o say but doing it terrifically badly i see dawn in the passenger seat holding under the hand rail above the door as it means to steady himself through this craziness through the stupid unnecessary risk and he looks calm collected uncaring lucky is not there there are no cars ahead of them now the trailer is next in line it is lows to a crawl and i can see dad desperately trying to ignore the crazy flashing noisy bonville rattling through the south bound lane keeping his eyes fixed to the road pretending he is not smuggling anything in the empty trailer behind him this empty useless trailer with the eyebeams all sealed up with the two medical men driving it with no obvious destination no paper work no affiliation with any hauling or trucking company no sir not trafficking an drugs just driving through to button probably looking for work oh yes we are america citizens that is not what were nervous we can prove that that is nothing were nervous because of the pot were hiding and because we are only getting two thousand dollars for risking upwards of ten years in prison is not that funny is not that just hysterical but the skinny white eye is having lunch and campy gathered and one of the weirder moments of this hole the locked the bondeville the air stream and dad's tractor are a lying do like some cosmicevent and we see the skinny border patrolagiont with n white napkin took under his chin and dads bloodless face up in the traitor through the window of the air stream as the agent waves them through with a fork like his conducting an orchestra go on through go on through ma cotton is driving south stun by what has just happened and i am careful not to say a word we almost reach raymonville and stop at a waterburger to get a quick wordless lunch end spend some time sitting in a parking lot waiting when she feels it is safe to return she turns a car around and heads back north back through the same check point are you sure this is safe i asked she does not answer when we pull up again to the check point at it back to hebenville round three o'clock there is a different boarder patrelation at the air stream he is a small clean cut militant medical with a southern drawl all america citizens he demands instantly leaning into the car through the window clearly smelling for marawana smoke oh yes says my mother who as probably quite relieve the hard part is over and it looks we are getting away with it how bout you son you america citizen he gives me ya direct glare through reflective sunglasses there is nothing more potentially hostile then the indigents ego interpreting the laws of his conquer upon his own people yes sir i say careful not to move her fidget or look away have learned he looks back at my mother then at me lucky smells the nervousness of earlier something tugs at his intuition we are you all headed the sunglass is finally ask this catches mam off guard her subterfusud ended when dad had driven through the check point she left all her answers back in raymonville we are going to hevrenville she says unconvincingly had he asked one more question had he pressed it we would have been in some sort of trouble but he does not and he backs off and motions us through mam drives the noisy earth habrenville and we are got to the open highway again when you noticed doubts trailer in the park an to of a she hotel by the side the road my brother is lodge between the your most tires working on the break lights that i ridiculously are working mum is his alarm to find them there as i am this confirms by suspicion that there had been no planing beyond the consultation at the iron detox this hold do buckle have been based on nothing more than a hundred dollars worth o face samples up next to the trailer and i think she expects he victorious reunion when he sees her at suddenly looks his about to punch her stupid an woman he els at her in punish mom stops cold wit the were you thinking if they would have just turned around for a moment it would all be over and it would all be your fault he spits at her in punish we realize what he is upset about the flashing headlights his words continued to snap and his surround her bullets in a fire fight and she follows him forward to the cab of the trunk kowtowing to her punishment lucky for us we senora was right dad says walking back with mum now excited and seemingly over his anger she made them blind and we were let through they were closed when we left them later that evening can was doing the darkroom they pled out of the barking lot and headed off to button and the pay off the break lights temporarily fixed an loops of block electrical tape o watch is a truck disappears it looks every other piece of now broken down equipment we have ever owned rusting miserable and totally criminal mama and i turned south back tor brownsville mammas her usual quietself except this time she plays the radio louder this means just think in it is getting dark and am sleepy i sleep she will get us home she knows the way for that i

you con find on tunes though an internet search we spoke with the other girl in that story who has not talk with magician and while did not know that ye was telling that story publicly who confirmed all the crazy details in the story she says they held hands an trade while the plain took off naan can a at for are k o tondersend es next story which is devininly a story about getting away with it in a big big way at first need to give you some background about price school an reason years there been more or ore studied showing the price school is one of the best in vestment sat a country can make in children education probably the most famous piece of research on this as an old one called the parry preschool project the study began in the nineteen sixties they to a bunch of poor kids from ipsilanti michigan put half of them into a preschool program and then the other half on of just led their normal lives and then after a year of that both of those groups went back into the same public school system and then ever often researchers would follow up with these kids to see how they were doing for the two groups the following the still even now and there is all have been amazing at age twenty seven the kid who got price school were half as likely to have gotten arrested they under an average of fifty per cent more per month there were fifty per cent more we'd have a same is a count twenty percent more would have a car preschool kids got sick less often one and posed less often sentenced to incarceration less often other studies show similar results not just for poor kids but for other kids too they do better if they have preschool and the very first state to choose to make free high quality preschool available to almost every for neuron in the state and then actually delivered on that promise turns out to be a surprising one fact only a handful of states have joined it hawlexplonber reports that the story of how the state came to lead the nation in preschool access is all about getting away with it quick reminder for we start to day show as a rerun from a few years ago since we did this story some details fokohoma's political landscape had changed he is sex the state is oklahoma and to show you just houesurprizing that is consider what happened to go name ran peters peters was a freshmen legislator in the oklahoma state house of representatives republican one of its party leaders a veteran legislator came up to him one day and said the governor also a republican appointed this task for us to look into the issue of early childhood education they came up with some recommendations the recommendations were put into this bill the governor wants us to pass it will you be in charge of making that habit an mas very was free money in bill stop was his said public privacy partnership said be prove bondage on peter said share the bill seemed easy to pass and pretty non controversial there were no state funds involved with all private money the idea was simply to set up a non profit to publicize the value of early childhood education some more parents would consider it we introduced the bill on the house floor i did not no hanging by would bat it i mean had he d bat o no just pa sectors got rase money to fund the for pop an somecould not argue about since pin state money but and they said all be to bated up seven hands on my saw the and at to the bit against it id this is a any stay bill cans con con tiger cads an rising for we this hit should be rase by the mama dad of to to the rushing lar in carnet i got the legesliterslike to the tittle people hit were there you think there is anybody right of you ooh no ne tut they the the whole hole munch i got it pass and the pass he house past the senate and then all people story inn letters from the far right wig saying to the governor this is his manustate bill why would you secretes from the hospital an tike i to stories for an he got he got scared a little bit i guess and height bets on his own pass force bill i also i was terbia si actually the governor only threatened a detail that it was enough to tell peters bill that tin around and that is how unlikely it is to pass universal public preschool in oklahoma a bill that simply suggests that the state might think it is a good idea for kids to go to preschool a bill remember that does not involve any state money and does not actually set up any new government programs that bill gets a tack as socialism as bottle oklahoma is arguably the most conservative state in the country got a republican house a republican senate a republican governor for out of its five representatives to congress a republicans as our both at senators one of those senators tom coburg was named the most conservative senator in congress by national review magazine and if you need more proof consider this oklahoma was the only state in the entire country in two thousand eight were not one single county voted for bracobama how in the world that any one get the conservative state of oklahoma to agree to a dramatic expansion of the states public education system in free school something that many conservatives would oppose how did any one get away with that the answer universal pub lie preschool came to oklahoma notes part of a bold evidence base campaign it was sucking in the dark and to give you a sense of just half secretly at happened considered this rather amazing fact at the time on peters was getting his little bill squash by his own party in the legislature universal preschool was already in place in oklahoma tit been voted into law three years earlier loved g to law by many of the same people who were accusing on peters of socialism and what's more they had probably voted for that law without even realizing it which is exactly the way the people who brought public are school to oklahoma wanted it to pa o pop the story begins in the late nineteen nines and it begins with a seemingly unrelated issue school superintendents around oklahoma had discovered a loophole and the states school funding formula and were using that loophole to run a little scheme that involved kindergarten classes and huge amounts of money s the scheme was it was legal in oklahoma for schools to have either a full day or a half day kindegraton programmed the loophole was that schools got paid the same amount from the state either way and wat school districts began doing was running two half day programs and collecting twice as much money and if they could not find enough five year old to fill two kindergarten classes they would had their numbers with four year old we we got right in the middle that very very early load snow was the school superintended at this time who took advantage of the loophole ran two half day kindergartens and wile a bunch of four year old got paid double from the state it was a no prater did not only be able to do this put in play and in have money wet over for others desperately needed under fund educational processes i m it wit was it was a good thing and we have had very many good thing a good things and public schools and my estimation i did not blank was all around the state the scheme spread four year old were gold and the extra money they brought in when everything from football programs to new school equipment even new buildings that is what happened in the district of job evens a state legislator around this time there was much money came with these children the school district bought but we call portable clash rooms o the big moblehome you know that clunk it together in and you have got a nice class room a prefix up here they bought the the buildings paid cash for them with the money the the first year an m us t it s that much gravy and then from then on the you to use the buildings an since free not my time li job was happy about this but he was not this seemed a loophole that people were abusing and for two years he tried to close it to keep four year old out of kindegrat they got nowhere and job eddoes he become central to the story of universal free school and oklehoma you will hear a lot more from him later after he meets this next my another main character in the saga a my named bob paragon bob gambeson as a self described to corporate guy conservative suits foreshow glasses he was for many years the senior manager at get u ay and after that and executive in the oil in gas industry hews also friends with people on the board of the pulse chamber of commerce and one day a banker friend of mine it was the incoming president of the chamber brought me a piece i wan talk to you about a project we have been working on at the chamber and a he said tit a started in nineteen ninety they had put together ill task for s to a an ay way to work force development issues because they were going to too was going through a pretty explosive growth period the banker friend explained that local business is until had a problem they were finding it harder and harder to ire employes with enough skills and abilities to do the job the chamber had been looking into the reasons for this was at colleges and universities not training people properly high schools they kept working back to this notion of children increasing numbers of children not being ready for school this banker friend handed bob a cardboard box filled with research and reports on early childhood education said here look this over and see what you think we should do i working through this cardboard box of materials in a cubical at the a chamber they in the staff had a cumulated a literature on the subject and a i became familiar with the a prairie priest school study and do you remember reading those studies was that sort of an ahamama we are reading these long term effects of price school with that but what you rememml mind at that as you i tended to frame things in terms of my a business experience an you i just to you just automatic gambeson said he thought back to his career in the airline industry where one of the worst things you can do is fly a plan with an empty state but a kid who comes to kindergarten too far behind statistically that kid might never catch of is occupying that seat and first second there grade an middle school an high school but the seat might as well be empty for the good it is doing the id sitting in it and also he thought when you look at the statistics of what happens to a lot of at rest kids when they get out of school they an of costing the government a lot of money they and a been incarcerated or on public assistance bad outcomes for them and for society always sought about if if if there was a business for group of businesses and they had agreed to pay for all the out comes they would be spending money on prevention this cardboard box made a big impression on bob gambeson who in his quiet way became something of a crusader for early childhood education making the case for it to any one who would listen including some time in the late nineteen nineties job eons no member job was this legislator he had this bill trying to close that loophole and keep four year old out of kindergarten bob arson started making the case that we do not want fewer for year old in public school we want more of them here is job bob harberson is my but how smooth bob harberson this an e and ad you know what to mad i never knew i was being lobby if i was ben lot not is thou boys bob arbersons telling me twit things i mad know which incidentally a bob gambeson was telling the truth but the that that was the key the that bob harberson a found me a willing pupil and taught me all i know bout the four yours ttherewere the course of several meetings bob shared with job the contents of that cardboard box all the studies and research projects demonstrating the importance of early childhood education and job gradually decided that he needed to change his lob and make it much beaker he would still eliminate that four year old and kindergarten for cash ski shit no longer could schools pack the kindegerns with four year old to get extra money from the state but a alongside that he would provide for an actual program for for year old and entirely new grade fully paid for by the state public pries school and turned out oklahoma had a very good pilot preschool program with guy lines for choosing the appropriate curriculum and hiring qualified teachers but this program only existed in a few districts because according to ends the state did not provide enough money to pay for it don's estimate the state provided only a third of the money that was actually needed to run one of these programs job don's plan was to take that pilot program and fully fund it that any district that wanted it could actually get paid enough to put it in place now there was only one rob with this plan tit is probably no way it could pass no way the state legislature would ever agree to pay for a program this sill job don's essentially hit it he simply offered his amendment t again the one closing the four year old and kindergarten for cashlefoll only t with some new language a kind of p s and which he proposed a week to the states school funding formula made it that schools got the same amount of funding for are school that they got for other grades this was in fact a massive overhaul of oklehoma's public school sister but the actual tax of don's amendment looked nothing special the way you amend to bill a the staff takes the sections of law that your amending and then it your amendmancin a underline and line out what you are leading language and i just had a few words here in a few words there still there were the traditional and powerful enemies to something this budget hawks and limited government folks which as i said oklehoma might lead the nation in edits strategy here political slight of hand he drew their attention to the stuff in the bill he thought they would and did not mention the stuff they would not i probably sat down a third desk with each republican and showed him two or three things in the bill i thought they ought to know and what were those things well i showed him where it is a were we're keeping four year old out of kindigarden a were saving enormous amounts of money a you can contract with private providers they of that that is all i saying now everything he said was true eons bill did allow state money to go to private daycare enters to teach preschool also his plan was voluntary school districts did not have to offer predate programs and parents did not have to send their kids to one it was entirely reasonable to expect that in the beginning at least not too many school districts would even take advantage of don's tweak to the funding formula and offer a prepay programmed one other thing eons had going for him this four year old and kind garden for cashscheme it was growing and was feared that the two biggest districts in the state oklehoma city and pulse were about to get in on it don says that compared to the sure financial armagedan that would be his bill was the cheaper alternative every body could see that my bill was way cheaper than not my bill if you voted no on my bill and killed it you were going o have enormous in roman a four year old san kindigarden and this was taking an sense amount of money and a all but one voted yes on the bill probably because in almost all his discussions with lawmakers about his bill eons left out the main part the part about how he put the state on the hook to pay for an entirely new great love he knew almost nobody in any legislature actually reads all the bills and the number of people who actually understood oklehoma's school funding formula you could my count on one hand and his strategy worked it was a huge and costly expansion of the governments roll and public education in a state moreiposed to costly expansions of government than perhaps any other in the country stepped dow was the director of an anti poverty agency and a long time early childhood education advocate in o klohoma he worked very closely with codons to get this law written in passed i think it is fair to say the number of people that understood what was going on in terms of the adjustment to the state are formula that most certainly you could you could count the number of people that were were of that on one hand now if there had been if everybody in the state was aware of it out it have passed i i i don't know that i would say that i think it is likely that it would have passed basically if if you got hadn't fuck vision i would say ad ad the find had had the enactment of universal prep it not been done through this what i would call stealth campaign ai think it is fairer to say that it would not have been embrace the irony is now that the law is and place noklohoma it just adds evidence to the case for preschool researchers who studied pulses preschool kids say they en her kind garden and average of five months ahead and mat seven months ahead in writing and nine months ahead in eating and the games are even more pronounced for arris kids who get preschool loads know the oklhom school superintendent says he did not e a study to show him that he could see at the very next year after i district started off from pee school i mean one year after we started i mean we had have department meetings no kinciof tepicaus our kids you will have better toward recognition letter recognition better sit skills better a a and i coordination skills better a a yo just almost a better everything was it relates to redye for school now we have got all of our kids for whatever bat gram i mean their voracious murders am do start me with that stop no maybe sees i know ah ye yet yes that was cut of a game changer for for for for us nothing one ta most schools a game change of that according to jo eons the legislator who arguably did more to change the game than anyone else would not have been possible without the strange four year old an tuner garden for cash scheme the scheme that eddoes used as a smokescreen to sneak universal prep through a skeptical legislature i do not see it ever a being fun did if you had other states do if you had to say here is a programmed that we will not a implement a here is how much money it will take who were you going to get the money i if you would have to have a line item appropriation nobody would have supported it except the young mothers and they have no political clout what lessons could other states say other states wont tat try to do something this prayer they do not have a prayer they do not have a prayer a because it is expensive and there is a the state legislature are run by people that do not will not a s they will not a cut programmed not had programs not everyone would agree with ends on this in fact if you talk to experts the train around the country as for more and more kids to be enrolled in state for the preschool programs states as diverse georgia i a or most and west virgin are all hard on the heels of oklohama with preschool programmed of their own and as for oklohama parents says loads know of the school superintendent they love this scprogramm andstatistics across the state bear that out remember parents ton half her cent the is the preschool it is voluntary but almost seventy five per cent of the states four year old are now enrolled in public preschool however it arrived it seems that universal prep is here to

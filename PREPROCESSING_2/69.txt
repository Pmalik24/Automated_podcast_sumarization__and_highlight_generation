this would be the same world out organization that of course why back of nineteen and also condemned israel at the united nations on fridge led by director general teddoros at hontham gebodyesis who called for ha sense fire on behalf of comas all the wile claiming the israel was targeting help care facilities somebody out to ass embody sis just howl the who resources and tat up in the hands of comas we were told that all f that aid which is going to know the peaceful people of gas all the wont to class in violation of international law meanwhile israel also release footojustra of comes terra firing or p gs from another hospital the a food's hospital here is what that looked you can see in this aerial footage enemy fire from the entrance of the floods hospital that is a terrace of an are c lunches running into the hospital again they are operating from a hospital this the is really tank in the street injure the hospital is you can see in are g launched from the hospital at the tank the idea did kill those terrorist undoubtedly the w who will condemn the death of these supposed hosta workers commas uses the most vulnerable members have town population is human shields even the e u acknowledges this fact yesterday they released to statement will condemning the use of hospitals and civilians is human shield a compass the this a basic truth the members of the media wildly down place despite their own reporting on the subject dating back for over a decay it is widely known and understood for example hat the allshefa hospital lies directly at tap comes military headquarters the washington pop in your tans reported as much in twenty fourteen none the less the media have popped comes war crimes in humanizes violations instead they have focused ism comes constant claims that fuel is running out in these hospitals even as comas steals the fuel every single day we ben told all shift has run out of electricity and then conical oil turns out not true they have due their damnedest to show the warning situations really cause by comas in those hospitals will the media have steadfastly refuse to mention that is compass that has refused to evacuate the hospitals here for example was mas and b see yesterday doing oasis bidding at allshefa hospital there is no electric to day there is ti there in am o medical operations going on at this point their comticconticacion en at the hospital amnesia but no case is more action than the dozens of prematurely on tape who wore being held in the new natal unit there the electricity's on those new born cam of them younger than this ore it ell have been taken out of there in i papers they wore last her being held in the surgery unit at allsheepa hospital dozens of tiny tiny often on toward been cacti other sale to try to see the morn in come aces medical o specials respraying them wit their hands trying tikeepan reetinpaititi train the and to keep them alive hospital official tell the three of ten new born ha ti far gay doing everything they cant kep em live except evacuating the hospital is from by the way has helped to offer to evacuate that hospital by the way it is also worthy of note that if the in the mason b s framing of that actual report if they had panned out just a little bit you actually see the electricity operative in the background of the hospital the is what the media are doing note the moral equivalent in the report sure israel is trying to provide fuel and commons is actually actually stopping the entry of that fuel but really should not israel just leave the hospital alone get to more for esteemed members of the mediate in just at one moment first black fridge is in fact coming up i do have an excellent black fridge deal for you a free mood g five phone

doing t they are amidst to to promote compasses propaganda and withal of mason b s played that game yesterday here she was asking the ones spokesman john curly about whether common should not be kept safe because they are hiding under hospital here is the catch twenty to if commons don't hide under hospitals then obviously they are not terrible people and israel should leave them alone if they are hiding under hospitals then they should be left along to the hiding under hospitals here is the angry kitchen even if it a la that mamas commanding can talk they under you shape as we thee other hospital other mama is isn't that word pro to and my tannin i that mi has not into family confirmed that into to that justify strike i a hospital present ta be ray e a general round tie you run and others et bin getting a couple of artists or chairs tow aunt justify target a hospital sis the extra burn that we have been talking about for the usually then portions as they try to go after hoossleers you are right o nock at to speak about intelligence matters but we know open shores reporting it hooks head quarters themselves an thins hospitals and souls and they have the totals under residential complexions they quick a the innocent people of gas a at rest in harms way just by how they headquarter themselves t well according dandy mitten though warfare is a game of tag and safe it is not a free it is a hospital long as you are terrorist if you hide underneath the hospital then you're now immune from any for of retaliation which by the way totally undermine the rules of war if the idea is that your best security is to violate the rules of war which is what compass is doing everyone will then hide amongsivillian populations meanwhile israel continues to go above and beyond any semblance of humanitarianism in its attempt to protect gassed civilians yesterday israel actively sent inch gators into goal four those same infants you are being shown on weasand b s even while compass is holding is railing infants hostage you can see this picture here are is daily forces literally shipping medical equipments in to help than civilians well compass attempts to get those civilians killed to his credit the state department spokes person yesterday slap down members of the media who are doing propaganda work for commas here he was you would love to see commons vacate the hospitals an using command pose immediately we would love to see all people that are calling for israel to take steps to thank hospitals call for harass to vacate the hospitals and stop using civilians as human fuels we would love to see harass take some of the fun reserves at sitting on and use that to supply hospitals in northern gosh a we would love to see harass have taken the fuel that israel peridot yesterday that they declined for use at it'll see we hospital since a very difficult situation a and i would say as a principal on the the say what is tat the tops we do not want the civilians come copper unfortunately the bi administration is beginning to cave just as israel reaches the central headquarters of compass located beneath shiva hospital at this point even yous intelligence has confirmed the omasa place central resources underarm a shift according sign and quit about official with knowledge of america intelligence says commas has a command owed under the shiva hospital uses fuel intended for it and is fighters regularly cluster in and around gasps larges hospital while israel is now at the gates of a shift according to the waste journal israel troops reached a least one of the gates of gasses largest hospital where israel says commas conceals the major center of operations while medical staff reported deteriorating conditions inside because of a lack of supplies and electricity the journal also reports that thousands of people in the hospital have been cut off for three days with gunfire around the building thatgon fire is being initiated by a commas israel has been warning for weeks the hospital ought to be evacuated with the fully established the commas is using shivas cover israel does not have a choice but to take the hospital to do otherwise would be the equivalents of leading osomaban lady's compound in backstay alone because there were in fact i children in the compound and yet now president bi de has chosen try to curb israel ability to take out commas here was jobidon speaking foolishly yesterday or was i you i came mat apes macaw was ya i is i expectation act o a let tisaioata hope an som hospital most the hospital must be protected while there being easy watts do that and tour be for commas to our under what exactly by the way does hay less intrusive action look israel not bomb toll shive a hospital israel is known from the beginning of the conflict and for a decade before that commons commanders were located beneath all shiv a hospital and the heaven boy did and now presumably they region to have to send in special forces to clear the place what would less in truce action look a see of the hospital where that is been called t a human righto bus by the semexact people we say israel should leave the hospital untouched no the only less in abusive alternative would be presumably a sense fire which israel cannot and should not do strategically or morally it is cowardice pure and simple for the bide administration to try to hamstring israel and s pursue comose and even more cowardly for the bide administration to continue to play in idiotic game that they continue to play where by members of the administration claim they've to continuously hold israel leash to prevent the idea from violating human rights the reverse is the truth the idea as they have for literally decades abides by rules of engagement no other military would dream of and yet her was and us say mulligan refusing to answer if israel abiding by the laws of war is israel operating according to the rule of war woldata ognokano sit here and play judge or jury on that question what ism going to do with state the principal of the united states on this tissue which is straightforward israel has a right indeed a responsibility to defend itself against the terror screw might you just say israel abiding by the laws of war because they are they are going well beyond with the laws of war require in such situation her's only one reason for such wavering but for such puritan amity the bid administration is constantly attempting to throw signals to its left wen base even if that makes israel job harder in destroying commas and saving its on hostages and you can see this in how the law the hard left is treated by this administration all get to that in just one second first there is loved stake this novembersodo not be a chicken and shop at the grocery strategic israel instead head on over to good ranchers where they've great meat puns they have even better meat do is their black fridge your way

abortion but little things can make a big different when you sponsor an all re sound at reborn your gift no matter how small makes a difference in a very large way whorl that baby become what life will the baby live and what about them a small donation of just twenty eat bucks gives mom the opportunity to meet her child through ultrasound which could help double a baby's chance at life if you have not seen the modern ultrasounds been awhile got late they're unbelievable we have for kids o met all of them well before they are on because o the magic of ultrasound it does change your perspective on everything up to and including life itself get involved to day by dining pound to fifty a keyword baby that is pound two fifty bayou are going to reborn dot calm slashed that is reborn dot calm slash ben again reborn will take it from there as soon as you make that life saving donation they have a network of clinics that rescues two hundred babies every single day it is the best twenty eight buck strict spend and have a lot more give and give a lot more go to reborn dot calm slash ben right outs reborn dot cam slash ben case the left continues it is radicalism pramilogipals the had of the congressional progressive caucus a she is openly threatening the misadministration and this is the the great li the members the hard left or talking bout they there saying to bison that if you do not put the pressure on israel than we are going to abandon you really for whom ferhomletsberel we all know everybody knows at the minute dona trump is ignominy or anybody else of the right is the hominy all the people fall backing place none of them are going to not boat for jobidon because of gaze but here is framlogipol trying o put on the pressure but as amend i also think that we cannot take a base powers for granting and particularly young people and folks of color across the country a who are reacting right now to the war in the middle east a a going to be very important to are electoral success and twenty twenty four and i think that we have to keep our petal to the metal we cannot get complacent and think that aborted is get to save us it is certainly going to help us but it is not go to save us and we have got ta mature we pain attention to our base powers first law do love the the language use we've left abortion is going to help us and save us great but the argument cheeseparing is being marred all over the place by the hard left that would include in york times us at by stepped worship a historian annalist of euisporn policy the our times is just a propagandopage sarcomas at this point the end of this article says the quart out loud quote young bothers in urban muzzle america constituencies key to mister in's election vectoring twenty twenty our gas at his handling of the war they may not turn out from next nonmember such a calling of mister lion's collision is just what republicans book by polls showing tow from p leading key states need to put they are in popular candidate over the line again the the basic idea here is that jobidon should lead a surrender caucus to comas in order to preserve his electoral prospects in twenty twenty four which of course is precisely the reverse of the truth the truth is that israel by every pulling metric in the united states is wildly more popular then comas and the idea of putting serious clamps on israel in their efforts to destroy homes after the worst genocidal attack on dues since the polices is would be pure political insanity but if you'd get enough very loud people in the democratic causes to shout and scream then presume believe the idea is that somebody will cave this is presumably why you have entire article and in the times histogen prop again to effort for compass come ass as the same strategy as i said before as the vicing get a bunch of while left people on campcisen in the halls a power to yell at their bosses and hope that those people undermine western war efforts that is the generalized goal here this is why you have an article the our times democratic aids in congress break with their bosses on israel compass war now again here is the deal if you are congress person and you have staffers where marching in favor of commasyou should fire them you have no obligation tout to keep people employed in your congressionally public funded office in order to stand with compass you on need to do that but according to the nearer times they are many many of such staffers quote as they tens political tomato rages across the country and on the senate and house of floors there is a more personal and n many ways more emotionally brought discussions taking place inside the offices of members of congress the vastmajority of law makers an both political parties have rejected calls for a seas fire but many democratic con gressional staff members most of them under the age of thirty five have found themselves in stark disagreement with their bosses and the body administration on an issue that cuts to the heart of their values ye the their values do involve the oppressor oppress matrix whereby even the most evil human beings on the planet come ass and they are supporters all those people are actually the oppressed if they are poor and if they are disproportionately non white that is the way that this apathetic logic works they say they eve struggle to reconcile the personal convictions of their professional obligations which by definition require they keep their opinions to themselves they eve voice there are sending opinions and internal meetings and grappled with what to say on calls with constituent while they cannot take it get the hell out for lot of people this is a real red lines a jerry seven senor wiser to illhan oar it is horrific what is happening ya we definitely see the comes cocks signing in on this one at am gentleman chief of staffer senior john firemen of pensylvania recently rote on x come stars broke a seas fire to slaughter innocent something commossel now magically able by seas fire some of us think this unrealistic and offers up more innocence for slaughter john fetderman has been excellent on all this actually shockingly good but it does not matter aids have been whining and then they're leaking to the media ore eager to hear about all of that that is the goal to create this internal pressure and naturally democrats because they are afraid of their younger constituents they have decided that they are going to signal they are going to signal say you have vice president arriving people have a right to protest give these procomosnics in the streets from in on america place thyme the right to protest we should listen to their voice an just t point out here giant feel the same way about any one protesting against loved mandates at all i remember feeling some way about the keeparty but here is how she feels about people share legitimately issuing calls for the destruction of the state of israel and genital fashion you we have to hear their voices hear their voices or you could just say that they are wrong you could just say that p they have their right wrote were tommaian win tally

river to the sea palestine must be free s woe have to listen to people who literally walk on the streets of you city cheating hihbark higher olyohood is thallic something you need to hear their voices desperate here t tony blinking who overall has ben very good during this conflict but he too is signalling to his staffer's guises ism listening ism work could just tell hem to shut the hell up because they are wrong that is something you could do according to the washing ton post moving to address torments within the ranks of the state department over the died ad ministrations policy on israel and the warn goa s secretary of state anyone blinked told department implies on money that duo we are listening to those who disagree with the roaches we are taking and in all department message circulated after blink returned over the weekend from a trip to the midiestan as the toys diplomat acknowledge that some diplomats have expressed reservations about the of backing for israel as a presses in assault on compass that has he my civilian death told that is heavy mole more than eleven thousand palstonians and got have died in the assault according t the commotion goes helfministry by the way do not believe their numbers there's i say soft believe the numbers as they live out the numbers literally all the times sure many many people have died in the assault against compass but have noticed how quick they are to tally all this recently israel lower the estimate of the number of dad in the october some the tacks from fourteen hundred and twelve hundred why but you took that long to literally weeks because all the bodies were burned in charge it took literally that long to determine how many people were dead five weeks it took to determine that it was not fourteen hundred was twelve hundred because some of the people where dead we are actually comes terra and some of those people were meltable pieces and they parent to be counted as sepperat human being because they r originally one human being dismembered ore burned beyond re cognition tick israel which they highly sophisticated government five weeks to come up with the actual numbers meanwhile commoners trot an otlicke we have eight hundred thousand leste an days majors who are killed in latest attack and everybody in the welcommosses ministry of health does say it but bout a mine her is that antonym blinking wrote a letter to the statesdepartment in which he said i know for many of you the suffering cause by this crises is taking a profound personal to i know some people in the partan may disagree with the roaches we are taking ore have views on what we can do better we have organized for it in washington to hear from you and urged managers and teams is have landed discussions at posts around the world precisely we can hear your feed back and ideas we are listening what you shares in forming our policy incur messes messages i certainly hope the helm's because one bunch morons working at the state department but again this is just an attempt to buy off the younger chord of the democratic party which is disproportionately process as apposed you saying you

now you are member german carbon as the former head of the labor party in brain and your memberham is a shameless antisemite ain much that many members of his innerteem had to be ousted he himself as basically unceremoniously dumped from his position because he could not help but stand with terrace to per organ asked him double deceit times last night whether compass was a terrorscrup in german corban could not bring himself to call omasa terrain group be of course the far left does not believe the terrascrupts are terrascrupts they are just people who resisting the evil colonialist western enterprise that is civilization o welcome a mass a the er a the aterogroup everybody knows what they are all the atterogroup o pis tin you say you pis come i as you say coins cain you told o terms get

chews nothing he hates chooses a specific group of people because this fits into a broader anti western class of thought there is perfectly legitimate on the left it is consider totally legitimate again these streams cross between antis metic conspiracy theories on left is conspiracy theories the basic left win conspiracy theory is that there is a today of super powerful shadowy people who are disproportionately white and emissaries of western civilization and it is their patterns of exploitation t a been spread all over the club look ka if you just r place white with new then you come up with just the normal anatto metic conspiracy theory which is german corban cannot say the thing because in his view it is just a normal rebellion against exploitation what comes id on octobersem than anything is justified in pursuit of that that is why the sort of stuffiscene is legitimate everything is begin met by the way for peoplewho believe this everything lying violence all that is legit because it is in pursuit of a higher gull an utopian higher gull the reestablishment of justice in the universe by the ripping down a civilization that is what german corban and people who are him are all about it is why germy corban and his crew they have no propahangoun people illness or for lenis our sol you will remember was one of the original founders of the woman's march she is supposed to be an emissary on behalf of feminism you not being a radical muscle and all which definitely now when we look at the the priorities feminism women in the work place higher education earning power those definitely crossterns the radical slow nowhere but n any case limits our sources consider part of the alliance because lindies our sour is in fact the radical lefties does not the civilization very much over the weaken shes speaking in new york city at one of these promos protests and due and she said that the real problem with people putting up posters of kidnaped children by crosses that they are the provocateurs and this is always the backwards logic the backwards logic is that colonialized exploited people they are never responsible for the own actions at any point if you put up a poster of a final child and thy rip it down it is your fault because you put up the poster you are tempting them there are no expectations at all they are not expect ted be decent normal human beings no they can whatever they want and in fact you are inf it is it is a sting it is a sting operations as lines a for do not do not not rip down the posters or wrong grip down o posters do not do it because you might get caught doing it is linissaur sort prospective on all this and absolutely shameless absolutely shaming now the good news here is that israel is making incredibly significant progress in the goscisstrip for all those people for in a rush this war is not going to last never it has been a grandtotl of five weeks since october seven in israel has thoroughly destroy comas is military capacity in the northern gossistrip an presumably they are now onto have to move into the southern areas of the gosestrip and do the same yesterday a picture emerged of is rally's sitting in compasses parliament yahomasas parliament the haven ha an election since you than sex but they still have a fake parliament and is daily soldiers where there flying these daily flag is pretty dispiriting for all of the members of comas and all of their alkalies who have watched all of their positions of power absolutely ravaged by the s daily defense forces as they should be the the photo the defense minister of israel y of gallant he set on money the comas lost control of the gosstripts o there is no force of coast capable of stopping the idea we are advancing at every location the compass organization is lost control in gossip tears a fleeing south civilians are looking comospases they have no confidence in the governments bandit is absorb to does not mean that this thing is close to the end but it does mean they israel is making incredible progress over there if the west can get over it is faint heartiness at comas propaganda in just one second we will get to what

of sixty five thousand five hundred speaks more than seventy five languages over the last several weeks a boy thread cause the evacuation of a cinegog students stagestay cited in support of palmitins at local high school and one pull up yard tines expressing home one's support for israel a not noticed about all that is that that is all anti israel another words the news and smoky who been there a lotlonger frankly then the vast bloom the muslin population an smoky means smoky again as when the older jewfish neighborhoods in the united states every incident coded by the walsterturnal is an incident in which presumably allies of compass friends of moms supporters of compass were doing things to news this causes tension this one of the things that we see constantly in h media tensions her rising tension who is causing the tensions rise where these tensions rising swell a brakeman the former home secretary in the use was fired from her job because shut causing quotiquotensions to rise by noting that here were giant rallies filled with hundreds of thousands of mass supporters that the police don't doing their job actually prosecuting the law shot fired for that because i was whose creating tensions tensions cycle of island these are all the happy words the media love to us when it comes to conflicts where they just do not wish to take a side between no good and evil or decency and non decency and and the contrast is absolute clear to day there is a march four israel that is happening in washington d c hundreds of thousands of musical a shop there i promise you there will be no violent chance therellbe o rip down america flags here's be no burning of a medical flags there will be no they'll be nothing about genocide against museums to say when there's been chance but genocide against news oral be notes of firemen of white house property nothing that be perfectly calm would be perfectly peaceful or receive one tenth the attention the the media have given to these procomas marches an the not giving attention the prokomas marches because of the outrageous behavior here giving the attention to the prokomas marches to suggest that the behavior is correct and justified again the basic metrics for the media is that the angrier you are and the more left whin you are the more you're justified in your anger and that means the giant protests hundreds of thousands people's are being ignored largely in the media in favor of coming the descend of people par prokomas and tatstrually ugliness making life worse for lot of people these again when you incentives behavior you get more of it is just the reality oke meanwhile with regard to domestic politics remember that time that kedmicarthy the speaker of the house was he ousted for no reason that any one could really discern by matkatson company he is really bad you remember and and known chilly explain why he was real bad supposedly is because he is funding deals with democrats and spending to much money and finding on to continuing resolutions an all the rest meanwhile many of the people who'd rebelled against my earthy had voted against better versions of continuing resolutions that my earthy was trying to negotiate and it is all really stupid and then we waited several weeks five weeks and then finally there is a new speaker of the house and the new speaker that great i ma johns ism big fanatic johns ism is can a point out the mi johns is preparing now to pass a continuing resolution that looks exactly the same as the continuing resolutions that can my earthy was passing maybe maybe more maybe bigger maybe bigger spending why it is not because mi johns is not conservative it is because the incentives are not a lined the stars are not a lined the political votes are not a lined in favor of a hard car con server of genial en having democratic send and democratic president and a slim majority of what eight seats in the united states congress and this whole idiotic thing ballast severed my earthy will get some body nelson it'll change the entire magical structure it is changed literally nothing a coring to brightbart the house is under new management but is operating under business as usual as hi prepares to pass a continuing resolution and once again extends it spending levels and policies pushed through by then speaker nanciplozy and last remembers lame of session speaker my johns is it moving a latter s are that extends current spending levels for agriculture energy and water mortar construction eat an transposition had spending bills through genduary nineteenth with the remaining eight bills extended through february second sent a majority leader chuckshumer took to the send of flormondy afternoon sides pleased with speaker johns for choosing not perdu spending cuts or policy writers in the spending package he says house republicans have pursued a responsible measure then send at minority leader much my call also indorse that particular plan now again this not me ripping on johns this me pointing out that the incentives are what the incentives are and you have been liked to by an enormous number of politicians and commentators who tell you that if you just shout pure slogans from the roof tops than magically you can manifest reality that if you just shout we see lower spending over and over you an huge to look the vote count a the looked whippdally and if the look at who controls the senate or controls the white house magically things wichcand if somebody refuses to do that if thy do not shout loud enough if then's make loud noises that we just use them unless it is my johns which case i assume packages ogonmosign on o this as packages fired is bullet and he had speaker my earthy and now the speaker johns because a packages and there is no market improvement in the actual legislation because of course there is not on o be market i proven in legislation the constituency of the house is what the constituency of the house is represent of chip boy who is been absolutely consistent in good on the stuff member of the rules committee one most conservative members of the house how the press conference money and he said we got nothing he said speaker johns continues to perpetuate the very system mac constituent sent me here to oppose they made continues spending money we do not have and one point six trillion dollar spending levels pollock spending levels other conseveris joining boy in the opposition included represent i i s marry callegreen tom birches and and new clip of georgia while continuing spending set by democrats at johnsons clean my and does not include supplemental spending requested by the d an white house that included millions in forbade three crane israel an titan as well as a few million for the border it is done clear exactly how funding is ghetto gat pastthere because gabion continues to insist that funding for u crane be connected with funding for israel which gain is an idiotic proposal because see are two very different wars by the way i support continuing to fund you crane in its war against russia if there is an actual end point and because you got to prevent you crane from falling to russia that does not mean the en point in that particular war is is similar in any worshipper form o the end pointed israel war on camps in the gosh trip biding into son linking the two but that house cantina again the intensive structures just you not a line homes swell famously suggested correctly and when it comes to decision making the problem is generally not the decision maker the promise generally the decision making structure and that decision making structure means you cannot expect that man johns is gin a magically able to ram through a budget cutting to votes it is not going to happen by the way you know it else is not happening apparently a small member of house republican sided with democrats in moving to punt an effort to impeach woman security secretary alehondro mayor's if there is one member of the by administration who deserves impeachment most decide from bide himself it would be mazurkas who's presided over a complete collapse at the america border millions and millions and millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the border under mayor's been released into the interior ta total of eight republicans voted with the democrats to stop the resolution that included can bock of colerodac who remembers on oath people who a voted out cemicarthy virgin woman worth carinate is of californa tomicclintock of californium iatric mac venery of north carina they voted with democrats to refer the resolution to committee there will be no impeachment of the home land security chief at this point some of the re publicans who voted against sending the resolution have not come out an support of impeaching mayor's there is even a a are largerpool of opposition within the topi conference to getting rid of orcas they said that these are not high crimes or is demeanor but again impeachment is now a completely political tool as we know from the multiple impeachment of dona trump without natural criminal charge attached to any of them in just one second we will get to the clip of the day proof that there is a god in facts will get to that momentarily first the benshipuristura is supported by grand canyon

has uncovered it sud us had the note this clip because it really is astonishing pagan roping who is one lost of noxious human beings on planed earth rich and famous for being a female sour star which again only in america could you be wealthy and famous for being a female soccer stay that is not even a profession in any case pagan repine ism she am she was injured in another one of her farewell gas i thought she was gone already when i she leave she is mostly famous for yelling about america is terrible and kneeling for the national and them because she is let been or some such nonsense and i she a she was injured in this latest champion chew that no one had heard about until she started jabbering about it and a she talked about her belief in that that atheism has been proved by by the bad things happening to her here we go see the o e e ye e i eyes z a a y is e e yo know i mean that that is definitely proved that that there is no god n as as we have all asked many many times before why do terrible things happen a terrible people why is that that that is certainly that is that is the big religious question why do bad things keep on happening to bad people making repine a perfectly perfectly solid disproof of god's existence right there froufrou that classic meanwhile the supreme court has now issued ethics rules now the reason for this is absolutely silly and that is because the media have decided in the aftermath of the overruling of reverse's weighed at the supreme court is just chalk full of people who are corrupt and terrible for violating literally no existing this rule and to now because justice john robots she justice john robots is constantly in this ridiculous sisifian battle to reestablish the credibility of the court or some such nonsense he is decided to issue a code of conduct following reports of undisclosed trips and other favors that sparked criticism and put pressure on the justices to adopt a set of ethical rules what exactly happen a clarence homes hayrick friends and they offered to pay for his vacations with them wicchum is not rare at all at all musical point that out not rare at all does not violate ethical rules these people did not have business in front of the courts they were not he was not implicated in their business in any case the fifteen page document set it largely combined practices the justice is in formally followed not says the walls journal the lack of a formal document has letter recent years the misunderstanding that the justices of this court regard themselves as unrestricted by any ethic's cot the code says justices can see guidance from colleges judicial decisions lower court judges and the supreme courts in house legal council as fellas from scholars scholarly critics and articles i creates no single ethics officer adviser it does not provide penalties for violation of ethical standards all mine justices signed the document which suggests that it may not be binding on future appointees unless they normatively except the cote not the reality is that a sell finding cots completely arbitrary and non justiciable the the only way o get ride justice on the prim courts ti belgium congress is free to do that then of the grounds to do it the court can assume whatever standard at once but there is no penalty the can actually be applied here the court had been considering a coat of ethic since at least at twenty nineteen when justice elanikagan told the house committee that chief justice john robots was weighing the idea after the met movements parked a reexamination of workplace culture throughout society but in recent weeks robots has as shoved this thing through again one the reasons this stupid is because once you actually express a coat of conduct it will unavoidably be used by opponents of particular justice go after them as can be true left it is can be true right scan be true centerscan be true everywhere because again there is already a standard for a high crown or is demeanor a supreme court justice can be removed by congress that is the punishment this offers no actual punishment is just can be used for further fodder to to disable the court as always chief justice john robots doing the doing the work of undermining the court every time he attempts to actually prop up the legitimacy of the court aradagized the rest of the show continues right now you are not going to want to miss it would you believe if i told you that many of the people who regulate your banks are our perverts we will begettinginto that momentarily for not

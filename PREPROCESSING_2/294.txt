stay with u a on ducky in angel's family the power of poultry is great in their lives the when they serve chicken or turkey they call it e that is right and the call it is for a reason and the reason has to do with a stuffed hand pubic called ducky now dance was a woman over thirty years old her sister ashes is two years younger ducky has been in the family since they were children a m here the cricket paten wan a that a o that an a when you hurt i really late and he old beaten any way a any can a c pan an a and e gean la hero ago e a you a e tea a pretty cat grand on meet and down and any

chickens turkey's ducks far of all kind real and imagine we have din this poultry so many times year after year in nonmember that to day show is basically a greatest hits a chicken stories for many many years pass we have arrived at at three of our program at three chicken deva chickens are what we make of them in a lot always i you could possibly need further evidence of that after this first yo acts we just heard we have this story from jacket only enough it was not sudan who was obsessed with chickens it was penny a bowl who work back stage at the nine second street why in new york his house was filled with chicken cops chicken masks he got the whole staff on to chickens including sudan for a time there in the eighties poultry related jokes an references became the fast way to get a laugh at the why i guess most of us are condemned to see nothing more than the easy comedy of chickens but sudan firchuci saw something else there potential greatness there hidden beauty there grandeur one day she grew together some finger puppets for a ten minute rendition of the chicken little story for her nephew that was fourteen years ago to day it is a fullength opera enjoyed by a cull following whenever it goes up in a workshop or came our small theatre it still performed with finger puppets but now it has a complete score written by noted composer henry prefer who did dream girls the chicken little opera he wrote with sudan for tuck is called love's fowl needless to say that is f o w l well restore with theopenin siamodetiato rpetoriodeemaeteia close raptor theater and we have a special sign guest for you which o dossal and i a sitting at here's baby gran piano here's guest is is malts terrier at name toy perhaps tore wit we find anyone as it are which you good on your laugh an tat the piano i and see what we can oke locate lit some carefully because once to be gets going actually harmonize us with eases of yo you may have notice that this libretto is an italic just a real opera the far was just a bunch of papa's in a box ye now with a good idea and then suddenly sis went into a telling it became something bigger than what it had been and it is because when it is in english w we all can know wat and it is really not that interesting as a gay as soon as it is an italic it gives us enough distance that we can come in makes us he is the the lover who does not want you you do not want anybody more than you want the one who does not want you rig's a at sort of the same thing oaononemyety oo odea nnodyou may recall that when you last heard of little back in kin the garden she was just an average barn door fowl who had an acorn drop on her head which she mistakenly understood to be the skyfalling her alarms excited her friends goosy busy turkey lackey an ducky lucky and they join her for a journey to the king to tell him the important news on the way they meed up with sly fox little's pawls eagerly accept his invitation for dinner literally as it turns out fortunately for little hunger is not enough to distract her from her mission and she tracks on when she meets the king he tells her that the sky is not falling just an acorn the enlightened chicken little returns to her coop and that is where the story ends what are we to take away from little experience i to think it is that little is rewarded with life precisely because she went off on this quixotic mission totally in the grip of a wrong idea teeter earthier and agamete and an a again again the children fable barely figures into the story it is just one small episode in the life of chicken little now known as lapuchena uvula after the acorn incident she goes on to become an internationally renowned figure an almost every field imaginable a diva politics i careen theater art wearing due venue she arrives from some of the world transported on a scallop shell but the triumphs of her life began after youthful of affair with ha fighting cock and bitterly and she consoles herself as we all do it some point n her lives by plunging into shakespeare she becomes an overnight sensation as an actress celebrated all over the world for one roll quiet cleopotra aphelia the company then performs a an accept a recreation of the persignature all which is richer there vomit is ourpbarn heart to halt what is a great tradition of women playing the man's rolls and shakespeare but i think richer e third father more rare rolls to be played by a woman that is how a that a tom an actress this chicken was in assure you there is nothing watching a four inch tall finger pup and crying out a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse in italic not to mention that that puppet is a chicken surrounded by a whole supporting cast of poultry and other avian supernumeraries sudan says that artistically there something special about chickens there clean slave there are you can put anything on them you can project anything under them because it is not they have to me at least a very strong personality except for lop china and the opera she moves into the field of archaeology masters it needless to say and makes a great discovery the last time of galopatra but not before she sails the seven sees shipwrecked it is rescued but is by pirates and then she mites the pirate king as he soon as he meets hervasa longer because of her sweet spirit cause she comes in and she says here you see a little chicken on who although i dripping wet ism proud and yellow let me repeat that lyric for you and a pure translation although i stand before you a chicken who was dripping wet i am proud and i am yellow oke practises and although i a loved an i have lost i have learned to follow the call of adventures let us sail on an e a aka a her keep in mind the all of the action everything that occurs in every sudan fitch production ever since the first one for her nephew and continuing to this day a curs among characters created by sticking a small painted earphone ball on to a larger painted earphone bad poking in two attacks for eyes glooming on a tiny felt beak and then impaling the whole thing on top of one of those really old fashioned clothespins that forty's cartoon figure would clamp to his nose around a chunk of hamburger cheese oo o e ooh aoaaaeo oo a a pain and i could go on sudan has written er she puts it translated logwood china pupils diaries which detail the other adventures that happen between those in the opera there sixty pages far excepts of which have appearing clothes lines the official fan club news letter the opera love's fowl has hi strange effect on people i did not understand it until sudan on me of videotape of one performance to be honest i thought i would be annoyed at the intestinal irony and holiness of the polite but there i was with my three year old daughter who loved the show watching a plastic bird pantomime one of the simplest human moments but also one of the most profound the confession of a great lave and this case with a cock robin the song that she sings as she ensures goes i am a chicken and ready for love my heart is as fragile as the egg fro which i was born cheat me gently and will i the you together from earthly every will reach for the divine and then she sings ism a chicken and i cannot fly without love my heart my heart it as strong as the the egg from which i was born and forth and is it only with cock robin that she flies od ode to o oo glue look of o and after they have agreed to fly together and they are soaring in the air cock robin is shot killed murdered by a jealous sparrow i could not believe it but i was getting choked up specially when cock robin appeared on the stage i styrphone body spray painted black for the loment his little magic marker eyes drawn his exes i gathered my daughter my arms and held on tight as i was helplessly drawn into an expression of the grief and suffering of this little sad bird in this ear of especial effects there's something unexpectedly liberating and the marriage of this crude medium painted styrofoam balls bobbing up and down behind a cardboard box and the high melodramatic art o italic opera picture naan a moa me a o o the ora me

an hour of watching them makes clear just how hard it is to everyget birds to hit the standard which is to say not only d we can pity downstate every aspect of the lives of chickens the first their either eggs or saucer not only have we bread them to human specifications to ma human needs an we have creator a standard of what it means to be a chicken that most chickens hand never o that is with the standard means we judge them as chickens and we find them locking if they had the brains to understand thus they would be right to feel indignant but of course this is a city person's perspective

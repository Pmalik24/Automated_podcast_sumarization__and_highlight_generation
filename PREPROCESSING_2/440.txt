welcome to the superman la pecans s a science sciencespace to or manner supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor just soninberg doctor soninberg is a professor of microbiology and immunology at stamford school of medicine and one of the world's leading experts on the gut microfilm the gut microfilm is the existence of trillions of little micro organisms throughout your gut and by your gut i do not just mean your stomach i mean your entire digestive tract turns out we also having microfilm that exists in our nose in any other location in which our body interfaces with the outside world in fact there is a microfilm on your skin and while might seem kind of intrusive or and of disgusting to have all these little micro organisms they can be immensely beneficial for our health meaning our harmony health our brain health and our mean system function doctor sober teaches us about the gut microfilm how its organized specially meaning which microbioto live where he teaches us about these incredible things called chips and niches which are little caves within our digestive tract that certain microbioto take residence and at that promise real estate they are able to do incredible things to support our health he also talks about the things that we can all do to support or microbic in order for our microfilm to support our brain and body health doctor soninberg corns his laboratory with his spouse doctor rich soniberg and together they have also written a terrific and highly informative book called the good gut takin control of your weight your mood and your long term health even though that book was written a few years back the information still holds up very nicely and today he also builds on that information informing us about recent studies that for instance point to the important roll of fermented foods and the role of fiber in supporting a healthy gut microfilm if you heard about the gut microfilm or even if you have not to day you are going to hear about it from one of the world's leading experts he makes it immensely clear as to what it is how functions and how to support it for your brain and body health during today's discussion we do not just talk about nutrition we also talk about the impact of behaviors and the microfilm behavior such as who you touch who you kiss who you hug whether not you interact with or avoid animals whether not those animals belong to you or whether they belong to somebody earth if all that sounds a little ate bazaar you will soon understand that your microfilm is constantly being modified by the behavioral interactions the nutritional interactions and indeed your mood and internal reactions to the outside world this is an incredible system every one has one everyone should know how it works and everyone should know how to optimize it and to day you are going to learn all of that from door soniberg before we begin id to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and researchrold stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an a in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and treason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all f my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you fie free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the i free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do come slash superman and now for my discussion with doctor just sonumberg just thank much for been here an to be i am a true novice when it comes to the microfilm i to start off with a really basic question is what is the m icrobium i imagine lots of little bugs running round in my got and i do not quite the image of that but ism aware that or microfilm can be good for us but we can also have an unhealthy microfilm far were to look at the microbus at the scale that i could see the meaningful things what would it look and what is going on in there yet i mean the essentially your correct a mean we have all o these little microorganisms running round in our gut i think you know just ta start off with clarifying terminology a microbaium and microdot quiet often a referred to are used to refer to our microbial community interchangeably and all probably switch between those two terms to day the other important thing to realize is that these microbes are a not just in our got but there all over our body there in our nose there in our mouths here on our skin and a basically anywhere that the environment can get to a in our body which includes inside our digestive tract of courses you know colonize with with microbes and a the a vast majority of these are in our distal gut in our clan and this is the got microbioter got microfilm and a the an density of this community is astounding i mean it really is a a if you get down to the scale of a being able to see individual microbes a you start off with a fumed out view and you see something that looks you know fecal material the digest inside the the got and you fume in and you start to get to the microscopic level and see the microbes they are just pact side to side and and its superdense bacterial community almost a a biopic theyyou know something that is just made up of microbes to the point where a it is thought that you know round thirty per cent a fecal matter is microbes thirty to fifty per cent you know it is a it is an incredibly dense microbial community were talking of a a trillions of microbial selves and all those microbial sees if you start to get to know them and see who they are a break out in the got probably to a hundreds to a thousand species depending upon how you fine a a microbial species and then e most of these are bacteria but there are a lot of other life forms there there are area which are little microbes their bacteria but the their different a there are a you carrots a we commonly think of eucaryotes in the got is a as something a a parasite but a there are you carries the fungi there are also little viruses there are these bacteria faces that infant bacterial selves and a and and those actually outnumber the bacteria ten to one there just everywhere there they killbacteria a and the thirties really interesting creditor prey inner actions but a over all its just as really dense complex dynamic ego system and and were we are talking about the human as a single species but were also thinking of the human as this complex integrated ego system of hundreds to thousands of species interacting and concert to do all the fantastic things that we know happen in the human body amazing s we have got a lot of cargo to r may be were the cargo of ye i mean there there have been people that have liken a human stout a really elaborate culturing flask for microbes and that we have actually been designed over the course of evolution a design to a just a efficiently propagate this microbial culture from person to person from generation generation it is a different way of thinking of the human body interesting i believe that our a p h where the the p h of our a digestive system varies as you descend as you go from mouth to to throat and stomach and you said that most of the a microbiotare in the distal clone a are their distinct forms of microbioto all along the length of the of the digestive tract and within these there a interfaces with the outside world totally yes it starts with our teeth in in our mouth an saliva there is a a oral microbiota a these microbial species are very different in the ones e find in the digestive tract there a usually a built to deal with oxygen very well the in an area that is exposed to a lot of oxygen they of course see different neutrinos than for instance e colonic bacteria would see an they grow quite often an in mats that live on teeth there there struck their very structured in terms of an a and not a moving around ta lot they their very fairly stationary as you move down the digest attract there are microbes in a esophagus in our stomach but those are those communities are are not very dense and actually not very well studied we know of a very a there is a very famous stomach bacteria known as helicobacdor pillory which a can cause stomachulsers and cause gastric cancer insomesome a a less frequent situations but the a this is a a a very different a different set of microbes t auto be adapted to a different environment in the stomach especially incredibly acidic environment a but also very different in terms of their ability to interact with other microbes just because the communities a less dense their less dynamic a there is less nutrients that stay there and passage through the communities the lot ofttimes those communities are reliant upon nutrients derived from the ho it as opposed to nutrients derived from our diet as you move down out of the stomach into the small in testa you start to see these communities which are the ones that are becoming more well studied a small an testa is still a bit of a black box just because it is hard to access and there some really coal technologies out therefor using for instance capsids to do sampling as the capsule passes through the digestive tracts that we have a better idea of what is going on in the small intention and then you get to the coin and this is the community that is incredibly you know densely packed a doing a tons that there is a tonometabolic activity happening there and a a bunch of interaction with the host and that is the study that is the am community that is really the best studied part of the reason for that is because stool is easy to obtain compared to french and something in the stomach or small in teston and that stool is fairly representative we know from studies that have been done using colonoscapies and forth stool is fairly representative of what is happening in the poland a dense superexciting community but also the best study just because it is the the easiest to access in a lower digestive track very interesting a i imagine these microbioto have to get in there at some point or micro biota seen in newborns a in other words where do they come from and dare i ask a what direction to the enter the body year is it for multiple directions ye at great question one of the burning questions that we can come back to t the into this as where is our microbic to come from because it is this kind of you know existential question in the feel where where is this community assembling from and the the reason that it is such an interesting question is that a a fetus when it is in the womb if that is actually a sterile environment a there have been some studies that have looked at a whether there are microbes in the womb and and microbes cloning colonizing the fetus at that point a there is some debate about this but over all it looks that not a big part of the equation of microbial colonization and a each time an infant is born it is this new era system it is an island rising up out of the ocean that has no species on it and suddenly there is us landaus for this open territory and and the you know we know that infants go through this really complex process of microbiotas assembly over the first days week's month's years of life and then you get into a switching to solid food two to three years of age a there is some changes in a childhood adolescence working into a adulthood but that first a zero to a one year is a super dynamic time with really a and of stereotypical developmental changes in the got microbioto that appear to a have the possibility of going wrong and to a c sing problems for infants in some instances but if you step away from that extreme side of things going wrong there all also where a lot of different trajectories that developmental process can take because are microbiota s valuable and plastic and those trajectories can be effected by all sorts of factors in early life an example is whether an infant is born by sea section or born vaginally we know from a beautiful work that is been done in the field that a infants that are borne by sea section actually have a a got microbiota that looks for human skin then it does either the that the birth canal the the vagina microbiota or a the mothers a stool microbiota babies that are born through the birth canal have initial colonization a vaginal microbes and of stool microbes from their mother and just these first days whether your born by sea section or through or through natural child birth your got microbiota looks very different and then compound on top of that whether your breastfed or formula fed whether your family has a pet or does not have a pet whether you're ex posed to antibiotics a the all these factors that really can change that developmental process and really change your microbial identity eventually in life the reason that this is a that the field is playing paying really close attention this and studying this right now is because we know from animal studies that depending upon the microbes that you get early in life you can see the immune system or metabolism of an organism or other parts there biology totally different developmental trajectory what microbes your colonized or with early in life can really change your biology and we can come back to that later be awe should the that getting back to that original question of where your microbes come from you think because you are borne through your mother's birth canal or expose tor skin microbes that a lot of your microbes would come from your mother but it actually turns out that we can certainly detect that signal we certainly see maternal microbes in the infant but there are a lot of microbes that a coming from other places a surfaces other people perhaps other caregivers but perhaps a strangers as well we acquire our microbes from a variety of sources the first ones are are from our mom or from our caregivers from the hospital but then we add to that tremendously over the first year or of life credible you even said t a pets it a ivikidin if there is a dog in the home or a parakeet in the home that clearly they have a microfilm also in potentially the child is deriving microbioto species from from those pets exactly ad the i the a b s studies that have been done if just let the its in the household as a fact or and whether that changes a the group of infants that have a pet to look slightly different than the group of infants a do not have a pet and then the question is what what is the pet doing to change those microbes and some of it is probably actually contributing direct members of the microbiota actually we a i have a dog that dog a occasionally will lick my mouth without me paying attention and that is probably introducing microbes a we also of the a peter are down in the dirt there outside there there there being exposed to a lot of invite mental microbes and just a pet serving as a condo it for a bunch of microbes that we would not otherwise come in contact with a is a is a possibility as well a what we all return to a pets and in particular your dog an amazing dog by thew i met your dog just the other day and i had to force myself i deary myself away from havens or i haunt in cred what was your dogs an louis louis louis pastor louispasteura i exit a amazing dog let a personality on the dog a the the issue that i i think a lot of people are probably wondering is what what is a healthy microfilm and what is it what is it supporting we we hear that you need a healthy microfilm to support the amine system or metabolism or even the got brain access how do we define a healthy versus a unhealthy microfilm some people might know the unhealthy microbiumas disbiosis is the word that i encounter in the literature but you've that there's many species of microbiota and given that i think we probably each have a signature pattern of microbiota how do e find healthy verses unhealthy microdot is there a test for this am later will talk about technologies for testing microbiota there lot a companies now lot people sending stool samples in the man am never look at the postal service the same way again but there it is out there and it is getting analyze it how should i think about this i i can think about things tartrate heart a versatility ah be am i a all sorts of metrics of health how should i think about the microbiota how do i know if my microfilm is healthy or on health ye it is it is a million dollar question right know in the field and there is a lot of different ways of thinking about that and i can talk about some of those but i would say that a there are sessions at conferences there review articles being commission the all sorts of kind of thought pieces about this right now what is a healthy microbial what are the features that define it and i think before diving into this the important thing the to realize is it is a complex topic a context matters a lot what is healthy for one person or one population may not be healthy for another person or population and a the microbiota is a malleable it is plastic it change is am or human biology which i think is how we think about health quite often be a mi and longevity reproductive success how ever you wanted to find it am it is certainly am can accommodate a variety of configurations of got mycrobiota and we do not have am a it is really hard to entangle am all of the different factors of what what could be you know very healthy verse is a little bit less healthy am it i i will say that there is no single answer this but there is some really important considerations and am perhaps the best way to it our toguabout this is to go back to am the inception of the human microfilm project which was is am program that that an age started the invested the lot of money in two thousand eight two thousand nine for am really a propelling the a field of of got mycrobium research it was a becoming evident at that point that this was not just a curiosity of human biology that it was probably really important for our health and they handle this wonderful sequencing technology from the human venom sequencing am project and with the human venom completed that point they started turning that technology to sequencing our got microbes and you know it is important to contextualize the amount of information that they are trying to am document the collective venom of our got microbes is on the order of am one hundred the five hundred times larger then or human gene it is just in terms of the number of genes sos just this vast number of of genes and then if you start getting into some of the fine variation it e know scales by ten to a hundredfold really a huge amount of information ore trying to document and and the and it is o oh it was a wonderful investment and it continues to pay evidence to this day am but one of their goals of that project was tried to find what a healthy microfilm is verses a disease microfilm and different contacts and they started a enrolling a bunch of healthy people in a bunch of people with for insane in lavatory bad disease and other diseases am and and the idea was let us let us document those microbus what microbes are the what genes are there and then we constant to get a sense of what what of the commonalities of the the healthy people an and what we know how how can that ago wrong in these different disease states and a they they there were some answers from that but you am through those studies we really started to get the image that there is this tremendous individuality and the got mycrobium and a and it is it is really hard to a start drawing am conclusions after initial pass of that project of what is a healthy microbus but the other thing that we started to realize at the same time there were studies going on documenting that got microfilm of am traditional populations of human's hunter gathers a rural agricultural populations and am those studies were really mine blowing from the prospective of all these people are healthy there living very different life styles and their microfilm does not look anything a healthy america microbus it does that mean that the healthy america microfilm is healthy but only in the contacts of living in the united states and consuming what is consumed here a or is it that there is a superior microfilm signature somewhere in our history or currently in the world ye i i think that is that is kind of of a a big question i now i think a there is a great wrote from de chancy that says nothing in biology make sense except in the light of evolution and that these traditional populations are all modern people a living on the planted now but their life style does represent a a the the closest proximation to how are ancestors a early humans lived and and those microbus and now we know from sequencing of paliophecies the microfilm of these traditional populations is representative more representative of the microfilm that we evolved with that that a potentially shaped are human you know and one possibility is that in the industrialized world we have a a different microfilm from traditional populations in that microbus is well adapted to our current life style and therefore healthy n the contact of an industrialized society and there probably are elements of that that are true a but another possibility is that this is a microfilm that is gone off the rats that it is a deteriorating in the face of antibiotic use and a a all the a problems associated with a a industrialized dirt western did a and that even thou the human microfilm a project documented the microfilm of healthy people healthy america that what they really may have been documenting there is a perturbed microbiota that is a really predisposing people to a variety of inflammatory in metabolic diseases it reminds me of the a as a nerbiologist a was weaned in the in the landscape of called critical periods where early life environment a very strongly shapes the the brain and many studies were done on animals raised in traditional cages with water bottle and of food may be a few other animals of the same species and then people came along and sat wait normally these species in the wild would have things things to climb over and thinks to go through and you provide those very basic elements in allisand the architecture of neral circuits looks very different and you realizing you were studying a deprived condition a and earlier you have she referred to if i understood correctly to critical periods for got microfilm development a is it a fair to say that there are critical periods meaning if my what say me what is aimed at me if my if a m got microfilm was a dis biotic we was off a early in life can i rescue that through proper conditions and exercise iris there is some sort of a fixed pattern that can be hard for me to escape from yet the there is a big field that is emerging now that a we refer to as kind of reprogramming the got microfilm and you know i think if we want ta conventionalized humans as is aggregate nonhuman microbial biology a most people have heard of crisper in the ability to a a potentially change our human venom and ways that correct genetic problems a that is a wonderful technology a and as in have put on the table genetic engineering for curing disease but it is much easier to change got microbes for a problem just because that that community is is malleable a the issue that i think were seeing in the field is that a microbus quite often whether their disease or healthy existence stable states the kind of ten towards this a well that has gravity to it in a in a way biological gravity where a it is really hard to dislodge that community from that state even individuals for instance that get antibiotics a you a takeoralanobotics the community takes its huge hit we know the bunch of microbes i the composition changes and you knavthat represents a period of vulnerability where pathagence can come in and take over in caused disease but if that does not happen the microbiota kind of works its way back to something that is not exactly but similar to the preanobotic treatment a we know at dietary perturbations a quite often you will see a really rapid change to the got microfilm and then this it is almost a memory where it snaps back to this something tit is very similar to the original state even though the diet remains different and there is is incredible ewe refer to as resilience of the got microfilm and and a resistance to change or at least resistance to establishing a new stable state that does not mean it is hopeless to change and unhealthy microfilm to a a healthy microfilm but it does mean that we need to think carefully about a restructuring these communities in ways where we can achieve a new stable state that will resist the microbial community getting pulled back to that original state and it mean a one of the really can have simplest and nicest examples a of this is experiment that we performed a with with mice where we we are feeding mice of normal male diet a lot of neutrience there for the got microbial o things dietary fire and a we switch those mice half the mice to a alofibrodiet and were basically asking the question that if you switch to kind of a western diet a low fire higher fat diet a what happens to the got microbiota and we saw the microbiout o change at lost diversity it was very similar to what we see in a in the difference between industrialized and traditional populations but when we brought back a healthy diet a lot of the microbes returned is fairly the there was this kind of memory where it went back to very similar to its original state the difference is that when we put the mice on a low fire o high fat diet and then kept them on that multiple generations a we saw this progressive deterioration over the course of generations where by the fourth generation the got microfilm was a a fraction of what ad originally was lets say thirty per cent of the species only remained a something seventy per cent of the species had gone extinct er appeared to have gone extinct we then put those mice back on to a high libra diet and we did not see recovery in that case it is a a a situation where a new stable state has been achieved a in that case it is probably because those mice do not actually have access to the microbes they have lost and we actually know that we did a the control experiment of a mice on a high fire diet for four generations they maintain all their microbes if we take those fourth generation mice with all the diversity and do a feel transplant into the mice that had lost their microbes but had been returned to a high libra diet all of the diversity was reconstituted it was a your your question of how to we establish new stable states how do we get back to a healthy microbial if we have taken a lot o antibiotics ore have it deteriorated microbiota it is probably a combination of having access to the right microbes and we can talk about what that access looks it may look the deputies in the future there lot of companies working on creating cocktails of healthy microbes but it will be a combination of access to the right microbes and a nourishing those microbes with the the proper diet very interesting this musty generational study reminds me of something that i was told early in my training which was that a it takes a long time for a trait to evolve but not a long time for traits to devil exactly which it generally a is it is true of a human behavior too o the om defends and we can all do better non the lass very into i have a puzzle a a bit of a conunderment around this notion of a species of microbial of the if the p h if the ask acidity is differs along of the digestive tract but is more or less fixed for a given location it om unless something is really off the p h of the stomach is within a particular range in the the the intention forth and certain micro to thrive in at a given station a given location along the the digestive tract and the p hes were fixed more or less ism trying to figure out what what is allowing certain microbioda to stay in the given location why do not they migrate up or down are they oh sensitive and that is what is what there selecting for along the tract and a ism also trying to figure out how these changes in food robustly change the microfilm it is the way you describe it almost makes it sound food is the the variable that is going to dictate the quality of the microfilm although ism sure their other factors is well and then in the back of my mind i do not know that i fantastic question but i really one ask his question which is where are they in their exactly and why do not they all get flushed out a if a thirty percent of a equal matter is a micro biota am then where are they living are they in are they along the the lining an the little microfilm of the intestine and what are they attaching to and an interacting with and we know there neurons in there a we especially within the stomach or there is lot of work now be done on the gut neurons and how they signal to the brain and forth but who are they talking to intermix of the the host cells and a because if it is just from food i imagine that they are in their having their good time or ere not and then some are getting flushed out ere not but horde the actually stay in there yet whore they attaching to what aether talking about where they doing for fun and forth yet ye super superinteresting a it'll come back to the attachment question and kind of why they do not get washed out is is superfascinating question and a i think your your a initial point of the the kind of regional differences and what is happening in terms of physiology by a chemistry along the length of the gut is really interesting there certainly is a oh green along the length of the gut there is a actually by carbonate that secreted into the small intestine to trade in neutralize stomach acid there also is bile that is secreted a that creates a a different chemical environment in their vile loving bacteria that kind of live in that region of the gut a and then there there is not a nutrient gradient just because as food leaves the stomach it a you knot a lot of the simple nutrients are absorbed and you might see microbes in the small intestine for instance that are better it consuming simple sugars but you will not find many microbes in the cold that because all the simple sugars have been depleted at that point a and then the immune system is a big factor as well and the immune system is incredibly active in the small intestine a the small intestine is his really interesting challenge for the host because it is a tissue that is been it is purpose is mainly absorptive and there has to be flow of a a lot of things a lot of nutrients far the luminal contents in two cells and that means the barrier cannot be as fortified and the the amuse system is incredibly active in the small intestine to make sure that microbe's arngettings close in if they are getting close there is a response to them to put them back in their right location a there is a and then you know a long this whole kind of architecture of the gut there is the longitudinal radiance a things peach and forth and and i should say that peace starts to drop again in the clan because a lot of those microbes are fermenting things and producing acids and you actuallyened up with a that the page starting to drop not as low as a stomach but starting to drop again if there is a lot of fermentation happening in the clan in addition you also have a gradient from the host surf's epithelium out to the the middle of the gut and that is likely the the key for what is retained in the gut and how the community is not washed out lining the gut we have epithelial selves in the small intestine their largely absorptive a in the clan there is a lot of mucus production and we shall also see this in the small intestine and this mucus lining is this a substance that we secrete largely made of carnal hydrate actually and the purpose of that is to keep microbes in the right spot and to allow nutrients and water to be absorbed in the small intestine enlargentestan and it is is mesh work that is suppose to keep out large things bacteria letter small things nutrients a that mucus layer is a it turns over more slowly than the luminal contents passing by and a if a microbe learns to hold on to that mucus layer it can actually resist the flow of the the contents of the gut and there there is a a many microbes in the gut that are not just good at attaching mucus but also good at nibbling on it at eating it and the these bacteria acromanse a mucinifla mucus loving it is a one of its main things it does is actually eat mucus in the gut that is its lie style and and there there is an incredible a gradient of a activity from the host tissue working your way out the middle o the gut what is amazing is some microbes actually do penetrate pastimucus and there these invaginations in the intestine known as chips actually where the themselves live that produce the epithelium and there microbial communities that can form in those chips and we do not know completely what their function is but we have done some studies that appear to indicate that if you can localize to a trip you have hit the jack pot is a microbe for being able to maintain dominance in the gut if you sit in the script and something similar to you another micro that similar you comes into the gut you can actually exclude that micro and the thinking is that it cannot finest spot to roses being washed out of the got there probably are these little niches close to hose tissue in the mucus that are absolutely essential for a for resisting getting washed out with he with the flow of all the contents incredible that raises a question about two things that are a reasonably popular a one is this notion of cleanses a from either direction people will consume things by mouth to try in cleans there digestive tract as there is a long history of this ism not recommending this there is differing opinions on whether nothings good or bad an the other is a fasting or time restricted feeding a the reason a i ask about time restricted feeding as my understanding is that after a prolonged period of fasting there is some a auto absorption or a digestion of one's own a digestive tract that then gets renewed in otherwards you your tested in some e start eating its own lining to some extent in the absence of food would we know about cleanses oh and that i suppose there is cleanses from the other direction to right which a less popular but a i we never run the statistics but i a but certainly exist out there a what are what is the idea about cleanses and fasting as it relates to the health or the disposes of the mycrobioda yet there has not been a lot of high quality science in this aria and it is really hard to conclude whether these are good or good for health or bat for health the i think the the fasting you know we are in a really interesting situation in the industrialized world because we have many problems associated with our digestive tract in that probably has to do with are a highly process diet and perhaps having a my crobioto that fairly perturbed as well and a whether doing things this are good or bad a it is really hard to defined because we may be starting off in a fairly bad state anyway there many diseases that we are dealing with medaboleccindrum and lavatory bad disease the just put a massive portion of the population in a very different category then people that are thinking about how do i maintain health how do i live along life a from starting off an what we consider a fairly healthy state and things fasting a and and a lot of other therapies that have been developed in the field a i think keitogenic get may be kind of in this category as well there can be tremendous benefits in terms of a there impact in the connective metabolic condom and for people that a battling a keeping a continual bad diet or something that it man adherents i think one of the to one o the reasons for the popularity of intermittent fasting a time restricted feeding a and sort of i what a they call them now am exclusion diets where you entirely exclude meat or entirely exclude plants or whatever it it is the that adherence as sometimes easier in the all or none am as noble just we thing of this go no go circuitry it is harder to make a a decisions a tenants decisions often about food than it is times eliminate entire categories of food not eating for many people yet is easier than eating smaller portions yet am yet yet ye some of it i think is nor biological and psychological absolutely and we have have eastern neurology fellows in our lab that come in and we kind of you know i think that to kind of slice through the new ones of all this there is a very simple recipe and a really well excepted a kind of broad definition of what a healthy diet is we no kind of the the mediterranean diet plant base diet a is there is just a ton of data that a particularly people of rope an ancestry but there is a you know a pretty broad acceptance that if you eat mostly plants for most people that is going to be very healthy to the point where a a wonderful colleague of ours chronopher gardener whose study diet a his whole life a thing to establish what a healthy diet as and people was giving advice as on giving advice to a a dietician who is trying to get all the rules a what what she should be recommending to a people that she deals with that are interested in a healthy get and she said that number one om an essay plantable fiber is probably superimportant an that should be you no very high on the list and she goes on a number to an he said stop he said if people do number one well you do not need to know any other rules i mean it is basically if you can have a high fiber plant base diet a for most people at least you nor talking about the bucket of people that are already in a healthy state you do not really need to think about other things because you cannot eat too much me you cannot eat too many sweets youvorty eating a huge amount of plants fiber your got is full your know in to be hungry a and in a kind of takes care of worrying about what should i eat or what what should not i just eat a tun of whole plant ben a whole grains likens a vegetables a fruit that is that is high libra base not high completely exclude meat and fish and the and he was saying people can have their own spends on is but i i think that the the main rule is just start off with you don't a kind hi gets back to to michael pallets monshra a eat food not too much mostly plants i i think if you stick with kind of these simple rules and do not overshine should i have this you know can i eat eggs can i e just and of stick to these simple rules that makes it very approachable but i agree these gasteronaurology fellows that we have had n our lob say that they it is really hard we we kind of say to them why will not you give this dietary advice it is really well known and they just said where it is it is really hard to get people to change their diet unless you are doing either a a go no go sort of thing a or eliminating something if act carrots are giving you problems do not curets and that is a very simple easy instruction to follow but a does not really deed with the rule problem of why cannot you eat carets because you should be able to eat carets most people can eat carets and a and i i think that there we a yet we we when were when were thinking about things a fasting and all these different dietary regimes and cleanses that people do a we we have to step back for a moment and i cable what what are really the the big high level rules that we should take home and then if you are experiencing problems and you want to think about how to deal with them it is good to go to an evidence based method where there is actually dated to back it up the the the data in the feel really shows that with fasting a particularly if you go to animals the hibernate or things that where the is really extended fast you actually have a a microbes to come up that is at that blooms in the absence of of food coming in through diet a that is really good i at eating mucus you have a you knobacteria that is that specialize in eating new tridents derived from the hose because there is no other new trance to live on now whether this is good or bad we do not know but it it seems a the consumption of mucus in access is a problem from the standpoint of microbes getting too close to host tissue and inviting inflammation which is what we see an animal models when we deprive of dietary fire we see these mucus utilizes become abundant and inflammatory markers start to come on fasting short term might be fine probably a you another define benefits that are seen metabolically am in terms of what it means for a long term health from the standpoint of that got microbyota i would say we do not have the answer to that yet in terms of the a no the cleanses and the flushes and all this a personally i i think it is a terrible idea i mean we know that if as i you know in studies that are being done now to re program that got microbyoto to install a completely new microbial community the first step is to wash away the resident microbial community that is there if you are in the process of acquiring a really good microbial and how to do that then the the fleshing everything out is great a otherwise what is happening is your kind of leaving rebuilding of the community to chance what is it and a what what microbes are going to colonize who is going to take up space after you do this flesh or cleans and a that i think it is a a little bit playing russia reset you may it up with a a good microbial community and there afterwards you may not a you certainly want to pay close attention to what you are eating while you are doing the reconstitution of the community after you do something that i thank you for t a i know a lot of people are interested in these kinds of elimination diets and intermittent fasting a slash time restricted being seems to be getting some traction in part because at some level we are all doing this when we sleep most of us are eating where we sleep anyway and a adjusting the numbers seems a more accessible for a lot of people we have a lot of colleagues at tumor who i i know happen to follow that regimen a or aid time restricted feeding regimen but am also am who allow the more traditional meal stating as well of course the one thinks that i wonder about as we talk about a primarily plant based with some in what d you say the fallen thing was it was a eat a mostly plants a and then may be some meat but not too much or you not too much eat food mostly plants not to got it first are eat food not too much mostly play got it an a in a just i i hear this again an again i know a there are number of people who do seem to do well on a lower cargo hydrate a not even some people report feeling much better on a really strictly almost meat organ only diet and there are only reason i rase this is not i do not pretospatea the oman not one n of those a omnivore a a that out there a i do eat some meat a and i do eat plants as well but the reason i raises is early your talking about am communities that may have microbiota that are am healthier than ours are at least different than ours and there are communities in the world that a that subsists largely on animal products or for which unprocessed animal products are considered the richest neutrino foods in those communities proline is very scarce in a ancestrally prolines was more scarce eggs an matin things that sort could there be a gonadic component in other words if we fast forward ten years and we actually can make sense of all this human genome stop are we going to find that some one who has a scaninavian a roots or somebody vas south america roots or somebody a descended from a different tribe well do better on one partyula diverse another and thereby where i should say and in parallel with that that they are got microbyoum will have different signatures that a your microbus might thrive on plants and mine might thrive on organ gets and as i say this a ism not of be consumer of organ meats of just laying this out for sake of example yet i yet great a a a few notes a the first one has to do with the carbon hydrates and restriction of carbon hydrates and some people feeling healthier when the the cot care hydrates out my guess is this i this is my theory a to detested a that people feel better cutting carbon hydrates out because the diet that we eat in the united states and in industrialize countries the carnal hydrates are largely crap prices there process there it is stage simple sugar admit is things that contribute to glyceric an debts it is it is these sugars that that we eat they make it to our small intestine they get chopped up into simple sugars absorbed into our blood stream and we have a ton of glucose than coursing throughout veins which we know is bad and can lead to things diabetes a if the car the carnal hydrates that were in our diet were complex carnal hydrates dietary fiber and we to refer to the subset of dietary fire that the microbiota can actually access as microbiota accessible carbon hydrates and the reason that we that term is that has the word carbon hydrate and it and it is a to point out that not all cars or bad it is just there are bad cars or cars that are bad if you consume them in too high a quantity things a table sugar and simple starches but there are good cars as well in these microbioto accessible carnal hydrates are the complex ones that we cannot digest and fuel a are got microbiotar got microbial can torment them and a the i think i think a we probably all would be better off with less of the cars that were typically served but most of us and probably the vast majority of us would be better off by consuming a lot more cars that were complex that were microbioto accessible a it all come back to why that s important in terms of our biology there some mechanisms that are known as to why those complex carnal hydrates are important for our health for most of us a i think this aspect of human genetic adaptation to diet is superinteresting and then layer on top of that got microbiota adaptation to diet which is another layer of this that a is also fascinating it is very clear that over very short periods of time humans can adapt to differences in their diet lactate persistence as kind of the classic example of this just over the past ten thousand years a humans certain groups of humans have adapted to being able to consume air a by taking this enzyme lack taste that normally just expressed and most the world's population early in life to be be able to metabolize lactose in breastmilk a by extending the expression of that throughout life now you can consume milk for your whole life and that is an example of specific populations of humans a human gene genetically adapting to diet in a very short paid of time and this there are other examples of this and undoubtedly this has happened a throughout the world to various aspects of diet certainly maids important to remember that there will be a different diets better better for different groups based on what genes you you harbor and haven your in your human gene the other aspect on top of that is that a there there are a good examples a of the got microfilm adapting to cultural differences in diet and the classic example of this is the degradation of seaweed we know that a most america if fou eat such and and there is nor there i you you eat a some of this the seaweed it has a dietary fiber in it notice porphyrin that porphyrin will shoot through most of us untransformed inert substance it you know it will do other things retain water an service kind of something cells not be fermented at a high level a if somebody from south east aria that is always consumed a seaweed and is part of a culture that consume seaweed eat seaweed they have a got microbe that can now metabolized porphyrin and there these very specific gene grants for events where the genes for breaking down porphyrin have been imported into the microfilm of many people in south fantasia to a you know we can think of it as helping digest porphyrin but it is really just a microbe that is found ad wish found a way to make a living in the got by consuming something that is common in the diet there there are these different layers are human geneticadaptations and there are microbiomadaptations that are cultural and and based on peoples geographic location a but that there is no escaping the fact that for much of human evolution the vast majority of people that are on this planet had ancestors that were under gatherers forging consuming huge quantities of plant material just because that is that is what was there and one of the groups that we study the soda hunter gatherers in africa a and i i should take a moment just to say that are research and and research of many people in our field in other fields rely on study of indigenous communities and it is really important to a think of these communities as a are equals the modernpeople on the planet they have interesting life styles that are in formative with regard to certain aspects of of human biology a but in many cases they also are a leading a vulnerable existence and we really take great care in our research program in its important for people to realize that a these populations take partner research because there wonderful research partners an we need to be mindful of kind of thinking about how a yet both we talk about them and use our data thathat is a been gained through the abgenderous contribution to our recentpopen the hods hundred gatherers hat's estimated consume on the order of a hundred to a hundred fifty grams of dietary libra per day and that is in start contrast to the typical america that consumes about fifteen grams somewhere tent seven to tenfold decrease in the main neutrino that feeds are got microfilm in the america diet the the soda are a one example their differmany different forging populations but the vast majority these populations consume huge amounts of dietary fire because plants are the reliable consistent source if you as e a hunter gather go on a hunt usually that hunt is unsuccessful i think the data that you o one out of twenty to thirty hunts are successful in landing actually big game for the soda they have a o birds that they shoot and small animals but quite often a day after day their relying upon a buries theirs baobab fruits they're they relying on the plants in their environment and actually fou a you go to the date and look at what their food food preferences are their food preferences are actually meat and honey they do not eat a high fire diet because they love fiber they at a high fiber diet because that is what is available and consistent a for them to to survive but our brains are wired for color density and if you took a a thousand put them in a restaurant in the united states they would make the same crappy decisions that we make because we all want sugar and fat and colonies at power our brain is wired and proving and fat are essential for brain development as far as we know alright that it sounds the the hod hope in pronouncing that correctly yo you said would prefer to eat meat and honey but they do they happen to consume a lot of plant fire as a consequence of who's available the a one of the questions i i have as it relates am to all of this is it it sounds to me there is no question from the purevyand all the way to the dream opposite which you be pure meat diet a that avoiding processed foods is a good idea you are heavily process foods in general and e not that the occasional consumption is is am necessarily bad but i whether not one is thinking about one make outrun profile or another it sounds consuming process foods is just bad for the microfilm can we say that categorically former oyetwhether not you also your low car person your trocar person your extremelegu and no meat whether not your all meat organ meat sounds to me as if a the number one thing maybe even dare i say above crises a a point about plants without nocking challenge cries gardener on on nutrition i would be a way outside the lane lines to do that but is that to avoiding processed foods yet is prim and i think that is completely compatible with what chrisophers saying he was saying if you put prioritizes getting a huge amount of of whole plantable food with a lot of fire first you are nothing to have room for eating a lot of process you it is kind of the same as avoiding process food i think that those are exactly the same rule and i think that either your exactly right an we an break down what there is a lot of date of while different components of process shooter bad for us and bad for our microbus and i can talk about a few examples of that but the lipide of this is this mechanism of and again thinking about the spectrum of a planned base diet verses of meat base diet a there is a a lot of dated to tell us that a meter or keetojenic or high fat diet may have big benefits and terms of short tern metabolic health that is typically how people think about that diet a there is also a lot of heart disease that linked with that as well there is good literature for that which as something to for people to to look to and be aware of the plant base diet if you are eating a bunch of complex a fibers that feed you are got my crobyoto you are got my crony produces these substances called shut chained fadiacids things butyrate and it is known that these short chained faiacids play really essential components both in terms of fueling colonists in forcing the barrier or keeping in inflammation lo regulating the simian system regulating metabolism and a lot of people think of dietary fires that inner substance that passes through makes us feel full may be for a little bit but we get hungry afterwards headway if you are eating a lot of fiber that is feeding your got my crobyoto you are got my crobyotis just producing this vast array a fermentation and products that then get absorbed into our blood stream and have all of these tremendous cascading effects that appear to be largely beneficial on our biology and to think about that paradise of simple cars verses complex cars in the case of simple cars you and up with high blood sugar something that will spite your insolent and have all kinds of weird metabolic effects in the case of complex carnal hydrates you will lend up with very low blood sugar because most of those have low glyceric insects and a bunch of short chain fadiacids that a having regulatory real just a to round out that that topic i think there is a reason to think that maybe not appropriate for absolutely every one out there but i think the vast majority of people particularly given the statistics of what we know people eat in the united states and an industrialized countries most people would re tremendous health benefits from eating more whole plantable dietary fiber know process foods i think is this other dimension we have all of these weird chemicals artificial sweeteners weird fats a lot of refine simple nutrients the simple nutria's we have talked about but we know that for instance artificial sweeteners can have a massive negative impact on they got my scrotum and can lead us towards metabolic sendromactually there is been beautiful work out of the linesmen institute on this and they know emulsifiers these compounds that are put in process foods to help them maintain shelf suitabilities things do not separate and a all the the moisture content is retained appropriately a many of these are known to disrupt the mucaslayer and as soon as you start disrupting that barrier that can lead you in the direction of inflammation and in animal models we know that can lead towards metabolic cenderom is well there there is components of process food theater when studied an isolation known to have a direct negative impact on got biology in the microbiota the mention of artificial sweetness is is interesting it i i confess i it is a third rail on social talking out artificial sweeteners their two camps it seems or at least am two camps one that say artificial sweeteners are not detrimental at all another that says the very detrimental mainly based on the mouth studies and than there people in the middle that are i put myself in that category i drink the occasional the soda i do not consume them in large volume but of sort in the the middle there however and i just throw that out there because i know immediately peoples am are jumping on that but i just mention their some recent data fact of am d'igoboris lab that duke university that the neurons that live in the got mucose of these nuropodzells can actually distinguish between artificial and am true sweet the sugar verses artificial a sweetness am base they would send different patterns of neral signals up to the brain and the brain circuitry seems strongly impacted i think as the data emerge were hearing more more these artificial sweetness am either are problematic or at least are signalling different events in in the gut i do want to make sure that we distinguish a artificial sweeteners from non colonic plant base sweeteners u and this is based on mistake that have made over and over again on the pod cast while just kind of lump artificial sweetness into one category and say and that it'll mention stove ya what about plant base sweeteners that a not artificial they were not manufactured in laboratory macron or sucres or aspartame what do we know anything about plant based non colonic sweetness are low colonic sweetness there very little a lot of those have a a lot more bank for the buck there there incredibly sweet sit takes a really small amount for them to trigger a huge amount of sweetness and a and it is depending upon the mechanism of action by which these am sweeteners that are not sugar a impacting are biology it may be that those are actually less negative or a more healthy than the ones that are artificial just because your requires less of them in the food for us to perceive that sweet taste it may also be that because there you know i do not think that everything is that is natural is better necessarily than things that are artificial but it may be that because of am kind of evolutionary exposure to these compounds in or diet m historically there are i think traditional populations that use these for instance to sweeten sweeten different foods u that a bodies just can f know how to deal with those compounds better than the ones that are synthetic m but i think the mean the study still need to be done do you actively avoid artificial sweetener sucres aspartame macron you personally ye i i do i i avoid them but ism not a am i work closely with my wife ericaas we do we were in the lab together and we am wrote this book the good got where we kind of document our journey in changing are life style dietary habits choices we make based on the researches we have got to know it in the got my robot over the past fifteen years and am i i think that one of the lessons that we have learned is that just i doing things i moderation makes it a lot a easier and doing things slowly makes it a loteasiere and there very few rules that i have that are hard and fast ism ism a pretty flexible eater i do not believe that having an artificial yo know having a die cop am well somehow cascade into some terrible disease or something that a i i try to avoid them i do not really the flavor of them ism ism supersensitive to the the new lances of the flavor even with the en osteal and mogrosides for on fraud stuff that i just really the ow flavors are really hard for me to deal with but am but i also in this journey of changing our diet when we started off in my chromium research i was in the habit of in the afternoons having a sweet a muffin or a cooky or something that and when we started to realize that we know we should be eating less sweet since eating more dietary fiber this was an incredibly difficult change for me to make i was just wired to kind of crave this classic scientist ye exist is of the the pressuring the afternoon going coffee yet all days it used to be a cigarette to right right exact when i started my training the lot of people still smoke yet right and it was only during my postdoctoral training that they eliminate smoking on compasses and and productivity took to a trough for a who and until these people developed other tools to i to focus their tanchat exactly exactly there there is this kind of need and that once you have an in grain behavior and ma be things that are addictive it becomes incredibly i difficult to break that habit and a and i would say gradually over the course of five or more years we have a migrated our diet a way from sweet foods to am things that a or less sweet am am it is it is been a journey it is been a slow process a but we have got into the point now where we have just retrained our palates and it is amazing how this happens now where all have something that is something that i would have used to have daily and it is unpalatable i i just cannot deal with the sweetness of it and and i avoid i certainly avoid artificial sweeteners but i also avoid just sweet things in general that have sugar in them m just because they now the is originally i was make was trying to be disciplined and trying to change my ducat now they just do not taste good me likewise i completely lost my appetite for sugar the turn of the last year and i do not know how to explain it but i the way i am you en knout i do not have an mechanistic explanation i just i say i sweet people i do not sweet food any more i just do not i have not lost my appetite for a fatty foods i love cheese and a certain certain meats for me a i blame my argentine lineage i is a is i gravitate towards them but in any case am avoiding process foods probably avoiding sugar is a emulsifiers these kinds of things and for people listening or watching we are not setting up strict midlines it were just a bouncing around the a the carnival that is the microbioment and a nutrition because i think that these we hear this everywhere eat this do not eat that or this is best for microfilm or worse for microbic but i hearing fiber again and again s were gin to come back to fiber but i want to make sure that we a close the hatch on this issue of fasting and cleansing based on your answer earlier it sounds to me it is not necessary to do what cleans or fast prior to an attempt to repopulate the microfilm in other words if i want to make my mi microfilm healthy or it sounds i do not have to try and flush all the the the current microbic to out of there first is that correct yet it is a very good question and i do not mean to suggest that those things are known to be terrible or i would just say this the studies have not been done and to me wiping out this microbial community a in less it is done with some sort t unless is done in an informed way and we do not really have the information for how that would be done it just seems a you not plain the lottery little bit and i i think you know i do not want to say that those it may be that when the study is done those are shown to be amazing but i just do not think we have the data to know that yet it is somewhat of an arbitrary thing a if somebody out there feels a better when they do this and are not experiencing problems with it than maybe it is the right thing for them but i certainly cannot cannot say that it is something great to do i i i cannot imagine a future where a as the microfilm gets incorporated into the you know emerging paradise of precision health you go into a cleaned somebody types your microfilm and says oh there is a this huge mass of is configuration you have all these a ingrafted bacteria that live that a residence in your got microfilm theatre sending out molecules that are not good for your health it would be good if we do a mastery programming of it the way that we do that is we flush your got and we actually give a light antibiotic treatment to try to kill everything that is there and then we repopulate with this other contortion of microbes that we have studied and know or healthy know or compatible with your human gene and can be reinforced with the diet that we know is good for you will install those microbes will help you along in the diet to know how to nourish those microbes and that will be the way that will reconfiguryour got microfilm i i cannot imagine a future where that sort of flushing or cleansing is part of something in for repopulating the got but right now it seems a little half baked to me great love to talk about fiber and fermented foods because you and chis at a rely what i think is a really interesting exciting paper at the end of last year about comparing am the inflamatome u inflammatory markers of people who ait a certain mount of fiber or certain amount of of these fermented foods this study is amazing for several reasons but am almost as amazing is how diverse the interpretation of this study was in the media if ever there was a study that was am kind of hi jacked by different priority schemes out there am it is this study you performed the study a with chis and your nostocs and graduate students ans staff what are the major conclusions and what sorts of directives if any emerge from this study and it'll just a prophases again by saying if i was not clear some news report said ah this means fiber is not important and that others said this means fermented foods and fiber are important an others said fermented foods are the thing and the only thing it it was all over the place and am at one of the reasons for doing this podcast at all is that we can go straight to a the people who perform the work and eventhoig'm not certainly not expert in microbus give you the opportunity to share with me and me to ask the cons o questions that have give zero agenda i do sober trout i do drink the occasional a i combucha am i do low sugar not sweet forms of fermented foods i would be delighted if ferment of gods are good for me but i have no stake in the fermented food industry a a ya great am yet wonderful and end and important not there is is the one you pointed out that this is an incredible collaboration with christopher gardeners lab and a bunch of people a epic a sondenburg help lea the study and then and then tons of your same stock staff and a other people i at stamford and then wonderful participants that am were were part of the study a huge team effort am let me take before i dive into that study let me take a step back because i think the reason that we did the study and and kind of a chrisopher's group and and our group as as started to a pursue this line of a looking at dietary interventions and how they impact or microfilm how they impact am human biology goes back to this am kind of epiphany that we we had while studying the got microbus because i think when we started studying at at stamford we are thinking about it as is and o newly appreciated aspect of our biology almost am finding an organ that we did not know is there and starting to think about all the drug targets that were there can we go in with small molecule drugs and think of ways manipulate this community to ameliorate disease and a this is largely the mind set of western medicine and largely borne out of the air of infectious disease a you wait for an infection to start a bacterial infection you treat with antibiotics and that is the way medicine as practiced and that is become less successful over time as we moved into this era of inflammatory western diseases and a with the exception of the thecrpendemic the set of weeping the world a largely moved out of the era of infectious diseases at least infectuouspacterial diseases that this paradise of waiting for diseases to appear an come into the clinic a is not really very effective in the contacts of inflammatory western disease is autoimmune diseases metabolic syndrome a hard diseases and inflammatory disposing now the list goes on and on and a and we started to think a lot about how can we get out in front of this how can we think about preventative ways a dealing with this crisis of metabolic and inflammatory diseases and this tremendous beautiful body of literature started to come forward in the field about ten years ago that showed that the got microfilm is absolutely critical modulating our immune status if you change the microfilm you canfundamentally change how the immune system operates and we know that the immune system is the at the basis of a lot of these diseases inflammatory chronic diseases and it it brought up this possibility that may be the fact that were not nourishing this community well enough may be the fact that it is a deteriorated over time a due to all f the things that go along with an industrialized life style antibiotics and forth a may be we have a microfilm right now in the industrialized world that is setting our immune system at outpoint simmering inflammation that is driving us towards ease inflammatory diseases and would not it be wonderful if we could figure out how to a a use diet specifically but just kind of learn the rules of how to reconfigure both the composition and function of our gotmicrobium that inflammation was different in ourbodies that each one of us was less likely to go on in to develop an inflammatory disease leading to better longevity in health a over the course of our life and a we we were no studying less in actually in male models and realizing that a we really needed to star doing human studies we needed to a start studying microfilm and humans and because we were studying diet we knew that this was something we could go in and do right away we did not have to apply for tie approval for a drug before we could do a human study we could u start doing human dietary interventions laungitudally monitoring the immune system and the microfilm and starting to put the pieces together of what is it in diet canchange our microfilm in a healthy way hell's to find what a healthy microbayum is and monitor the umiak system in great detail and there really two critical components of this an addition to our microfilm expertise one was christopher gardeners group a we wanted to do these human studies but were absolutely terrified if humans we work with mice humans or terrifying a in many ways that rouse themselves you do not have to that a over to pay for their housing that that is true not the can a four thousand of course yet sadly just for that portion of the population the a it is o chrisopher's group were they are masters a working with human populations and then the other wonderful thing that we have it stamford is as human amen monitoring center a run by mark dais and holden maker they started this beautiful center for allowing people to do criminology in humans critical element because a lot of the mouth studies do not trains well to human if you can do the studies in humans a similar to how we were thinking about the microbus you learn something the as relevant to humans and having that immune profiling capability where we can monster hundreds to thousands differ of different parameters in the simian system longitudinally in people from a blood draw and not just know if see our goes up or if intern can six goes up or down but to be able to see all these facts of the umiak system change in concert as were changing the microfilm with diet was really a key component of this and our flagship study supported by wonderful donors a this actually is not funded by typical foundations and national institutes of health at was funded bit a philanthropy we wanted to understand if we put people on a high fiber diet a how would that affect their microbioment i man system and if we put them on a high fermented food diet a diet rich an live microbes in all the metabolites that a your present from fermentation in foods how would that change microbioment a man system could you give us some example to what those diets look and were you changing their basil diet were you just adding things on top of what they were already eating the hard to change people's i is it is very red to trust that they actually do it and there not sneaking and not totally ye and we a and we started the center for human microfilm studies at starwort for doing a lot of these studies and a portion of the studies we do focus on supplements robotics microbes delivered in perform prebiotics which are a purified forms of fiber and in those cases we actually can have placebo groups a because its it is more a drug study and a we do not change peoples diets we can just administer this on top of what they are doing in a way there lot more controlled but it is not food when you start doing food studies you cannot do a placebo group cause people know what their eating and the other problem is that a it is really hard to just change one thing because as soon as you start adding something people usually eliminate something else the ideal was t a basically give these people simple instructions for in the case of the high fiber diet just increasing plantbased fiber can you eat more whole grains more limes more vegetables nuts get the fiber up in the range of from fifteen to twenty grams per day up the over forty grams pray can you kind o double or for the amount of fiber that you eat per day knowing that that would have a tremendous impact on a lot of other facets of their am diet they a eat less a a meat animal base proline a less animal base fats as a product of this a i will say that at getting back to the you know christiphers rule for a healthy diet a a lot of the maker neutral changes that we saw in their diet were consistent with a healthy changes in i less saturated fat less animal base proving more plantable proline a lot of changes that are known to be beneficial kind of came in concert with just telling people eat a hi fiber i high plantable a libra diet a the people that were eating the high fermented food a diet a they were instructed to basically eat a foods that you could buy at a grocery store that were naturally fermented and contain life microbes and this largely consisted of roger a keeper a sour crowd kimchi a some fermented vegetables a kind of bring fermented vegetables pickles things that but but they do one of the things that i think is a pitfalls in choosing fermented foods is you can go down the canned foodie and there's a huge set section of pickles and jars that are canned a those are not fermented foods those are are cucumbers that they have put in a septic act and vinegar to reconstitute that fermented flavor but there is no live microbes involved in that and even sour crowds in the canned foodie even if they were naturally fermented quite often there not quite often their just bring a in in vinegar but even if they are naturally fermented all the microbes are killed prior to canning or during the process of canning and if you want i what we use for the study and if you one have live fermented foods that contain life microbes you need to buy those out of the a the a refrigerated section essentially and ism really glad you pointed this out a because you can find sour crowd on the non fermented anon refrigerated shell that is indeed unfermented a a lot of fermented foods that are available n you ask a can be high and sugar am when is there any instruction as to getting people to make sure that they were consuming yours that were notloaded with sugar if or or did you let them just select for that the stuff in the cold the old section that is fermented know its superimportant point we we instructed people to eat non sweet d yoeogert's am the it is i think a huge pitfall in the series you can have a yoga loaded with bacteria a kind of the base of what is healthy and then a tun of artificial flavoring and sugar loaded on top of that manufactures put a ton of sugar in after the facts a kind of mask the sour taste of fermented foods which is hard for some people to become accustomed to when we were switching to more fermented foods our daughters were young at that point we would take plain roger which am they did not just kind of neat am we would mix in a little maple sir up or honey am just a little bit and gradually we reduce that over time to the point where am their paid adjusted now they just really plain am roger but it is i think getting use to that sour flavor is is difficult but people really should try to stay away from those fermented foods that are loaded with sugar and that is what we instructed people in the study and beer was not included i hear t the one you that ask when i i did a brief a thing on social media about the study homely i got it right think i did but people job ask about beer ism not a drinker for me beer has no appeal anyway but a beer is fermented correct but were they instructed to a void beer or to drink beer just to go with their normal dietary habits but that did not count as a fermented food and cumbooccho was as wait was and cambucchican have small amounts of algal and it am but a a we a cambuccho actually was one of the major things that people drank during the er consumed during the fermented food face an am the that the deal with am with a beer is that there may be beneficial properties of the microbial communities and naturally fermented beer but most the beer that we buy again as canned and filtered and there is no life my clubs there very different than if you siphon it off of your hombre and drink it probably if you but in store as is i get to the results the studying just one moment but i wont say lot of people skyway from the high quality tormented foods because t they can be quite costly out just prefer people to a resource in him parries book the four hour shelf he actual gives a excellent recipe for making your own sour trout which basically involves cabbage and water and salt but you have to do it properly because you can grow some not necessarily a lethal but some somewhat dangerous factory if you do not scrape off the top layer properly but he gives beautiful instructions for you to do this in vats we started doing this at home now factually as we get the which is serrammic that and you can you can make large amounts of truly fermented sour trout just from cabbage water and salt if you are willing to follow the photo can and if yourinterest in science that protocol looks a lot what you will do for most of your graduate career except may be some sequence in to anyway just to er for people to a source this very lot cost yow compared to buying the high quality for rented lots even cam booths so yet you knots five dollars a bottle ally only at is much and if you consume liquids today i consume them that is kind of it that is a just a the the start year and but you know if you can get your hands on a scope combucchas another one that super simple at the land grow your own you can you can just make your own in its super easy to do i make it i all constantly have a bach cachucha going at home and it is just de knotesas it is a scores a symbolic community of back treat east that you you know you you brut you had sugar to it and you put the scorpion and you wait a week or to depending upon the temperature and you then you just move the story over to a new batching at year old ye what the copy was in is cambuccha it's it is wonderful i love i would love it if numbers is audient would a stare to make their own combuccha and sacra i have been having much one i do not do it but i a it is done in our home am i do not i do not go not no anywhere near the food a production s for every one's benefit am how much tormented food and then a were they consuming and cause you mention the number of grahams approximately of fiber and a wat was it eaten servings ounces a how many times a day early day late day it yes a the we had a wonderful dietician instructing people for this and o namestollyor proven and she really was the key and is the key for many of our studies for getting people to eat differently and am i the general instructions were for people to eat as much tormented foods as possible more as better and but the the reason is that with this initial study we really wanted to maximize our chance of seeing a signal if there was something biological going on with the idea that if we the dose was excessive and not easily achievable by a lot of people the end we can go back an ins o we this this is the point at which we lose the biological signal but people am during the height of the intervention face the intervention face with six weeks am during the height of that were up over six servings on average per day of tormented food kind of too servings at each meal and that ounces or weight or size dirt really depended on what the tormented food was and we just told them to stick to what was a recommended dose on the the package that they were they were buying for combuccha be a six to eat outs glass am sour crawl a half cup or something that in say with ore great what what were the results yes that the results am astounded us in a way but then thinking more deeply an an e it will be evident even after i explain it in the contacts of this conversation likely why we saw the results we saw am the results were astounding because am or hypothesis going into this was that the high fire diet was going to give the mass of signal we know that this is the big deficiency in the western diet am we a all the mouse studies have told us that high fire really leads to a much healthier microbioto can lead to positive changes in the immune system and in fact even when we had a limited we had wonderful don or support but still limited amount of money when we started the study a my at was really very eager to do the my fibered a part of this really well and christopher kind of had to twist our arms to do the fermented food site of it and we thought it was kind of working an see life life microbes should be exciting let us try it we put that in and it turns out that we were very thankful that he twisted our arms because it was that a high fermented food arm that really gave us the big signal even though our hypothesis was at the high fiber was in a lead to more scorching vadiacids produced in the got a more diverse mycrobiota a less inflammation in the immune system we did not see that across the cohort we actually saw very individualized responses to the dietary fiber and all come back to what those responses were the the big signal really was in the fermented food group we saw all the things that you would hope to see in a western microbiota and western human we saw this increase in microbioto diversity over the course of the six weeks while they were consuming the fermented foods a and we cannot always say that a higher diversity is better when it comes to our microbial communities we know their cases for instance bacterial vaganosis were higher diversity as actually indicative of a diseased state a but we a know in the context of the got and for people living in the industrialized world higher diversity is generally better a we know that there is a spectrum of diversity people with higher diversity generally or healthier if you can push your diversity higher your in better shape and we saw that increase in diversity and then the major question is what happened to the immune system as these people were increasing their got microbioto diversity through the fermented foods a we we did the a this massive immune profiling and we see a couple dozen immune markers in inflammatory markers decrease over the course of the study we multiple a measure these at multiple time points throughout the course of the study in theirs kind of the see step wise reduction in things interlunar sex and a a interlunar twelve variety of kind of famous in inflammatory mediators and then even if you go into the immune cells an you start looking at their signalling cascades we see that those signalling cascades or less activated at the end of the study compared to the beginning of the study indicating in attenuation of inflammation kind of exactly what we would hypothesize would lead to less propensity for inflammatory disease overtime that is a a huge extension of a very short study and long was a study that the complete protocol i think was fourteen to seventeen weeks or something that the actual intervention phase consisted of a four week ramp and then a six week maintenance period the intervention itself was ten weeks but there were six weeks of really kind of hard core high levels of of fire or ferment yet at i am glad you mentioned the ramp cause my experience with a fermented foods is that you it can be beneficial to give the system and opportune to acclimate i if you consume a giant bowl of sour crowd a it is i con be the worst day and night of your life but you you will you will know you did i just leave it at that and you want a kind of acclimate to it a i meat the point now where culet some people might think this grow but i after i exercise a bin sweating a lot i the saltiness of the a shul drink the a the liquid that the that the sour crowd has been a seeing in and i get it'd to think that i consume some a fermentation that way it salty access kind of a a post training a replenishment but if i had done that a six months ago straight off i think i it would havebeen pretty rough or my sister my started taking little bits of it in then adding at each to totally and both with the fermented foods in the fire it is well known that that this kind of gradual camping is a really important way of mitigating a bloating another can have disgust of discomfort that can happen when you are my chromium reconfigures and starts fermenting more and changing community member a you should take that ramp at your own pace if something seems to be going wrong just can a level of stay there wed we did this in a very delicate way to get people up to the hides the a brain questjust a a a tannin here for a second a that was actually one of the products that we a had people used in the fermented food face there is actually product called gut shots which is just the brine from that they have marketed a we actually wadge studying it in the lab i just actually before this came from a lab meeting where a g i fellow in my lab is actually putting got shots sterilized got my crook the frmenfermented a a fermentation microbes removed or present into mice and looking at changes in their mescal a man system ere studying this in detail now because this is it is a rich source of lack take and a bunch of other interesting metabolites i love that my weird behavior is a it verdantly being studied a at stamford medicine a i wanted just mentions thing about that the got shots a those are r sol it as a as a drink those also just for certain listeners in different budgets that can be very expensive if you really think about some of them are exceedingly expensive but thereat i described before with making your own a cambucha's t is not quite bringing but the a ho made sour crowd that protocol is out there is a mention in in him spoke the the for hour staff and you get a lot of the bringing from from that an almost endless amount a a cautionary note i once went intone refrasraton and saw something similar to got shot it was not dutch and i drank the whole twelve ounce bottle and realized that it was twenty four servings and that is where i got my initial a experience with what it is did not do a ramp up phase ye do not recommend doing that some of these it is very potent it seems and you can consume even a half an ounce up announce have her i mean very potent from the standpoint of fermentation but also very salty i know the there is the lot of affects ye an y do not do what i y a at least not at the outset and a a but that is a an experience to warning they did this as i recall there was a swap condition where there was a halt condition you did controls right we was not just comparing groups you had individuals a who were initially in one group or the other a move to adult different group we we for little stop and then return yet we we actually just did a stop and followed them during a wash out face and i the ideal situation for a dietary interventions this are to do a cross over studies as your suggesting we have a recently completed a see to genic for sis mediterranian diet intervention or e date a published a not yet the chriciphers been treating a lot of these data and there is a paper in revision right now if you go to christopher gardeners a to id put er feed you will be able to find him reporting some of the the early results of study give us a snip it of was there our pure just give us a you ought to tell us which one but a was er superior a condition of either mediterranean verses see to genic a i should the metabolic affects of these a it is a beautiful study i should let his group comment on that the microbioto to a we actually or just generating now that the study that hes his group has put together from this is a largely independent of the dichroite data and now were doing a were in depth analysis and it'll have more to say about that the future but now return to that but it is a super exciting study because it is one of these were people eat a certain way and what is really beautiful about this as even got food delivered for part of the a intervention we had complete control over what they at least had available to eat a and then the second face they a they a make the food on their own and then we cross over and do the same thing and that is really the a if you have a good enough budge et the right way to do a study this for this we did not have the a the time or money to do across over but we did do a wash out face were people we did not make them stop eating whatever if they were enjoying it but we monitor and there was some criticism where there was a decrease of fiber tormented food and we could see for instance diversity start to plateau and reverse and many these people there does appear to be a a need for maintenance a the intervention the maintain the perceived how benefits that we were measuring great we will provide a long to the study in the caption and thank you for that very clear and through description a from the yes one of the investigators involved in the study that i it is great to go direct to the source a anecdotal were there improvements in mood in a resistance to clean infection a during the course of the study and this is a kind of a prelude to where i headed next which is there is a tremendous amount of interest in the called gutbrain access but also i want to make sure the we talk about how these mi robes in the conditions their establishing in the got or creating positive or negative health facts having action basely how signals get out of the got t a did pop i certainly notice that when i meaning more tormented foods or theirs probiodicts in in drinks i consume and forth that i feel wouldn't quote air quotes completely subject i feel better am i wish there was an objective measure of feeling better a but i seem to think more clearly sleep better mood et camera and i know ism not alone in that a and pop and anytime have taken harsh and to my objects i feel worse but then again ism usually taking them because ism feeling bad about something else or i i do not take them just because did people say they were feeling better a in any way and if what did you observe and again were high letting these is panic data totally a we a as as part of this effort a to look at how dietary interinterventions effect a our health and well being in forth in my chromium in a man system a we a interact with a lot of people who have red a book or kind of have become my crobyum enthusiasts and of implemented a lot of these changes in this personal life and i hear the same thing that that your saying into that you know tons of people say they have more energy they think more clearly the sleep better the family is nicer to each other the number of crazy things and it is really hard ton couple is it because these people have taken charge now of what their eating and just feel better in general for being in control of kind of what they are doing or is there this cascading a set of effects that are actually impacting a are yifyou know conemanating from the upbraid access and and we actually implemented a bunch of questionnaire and even a cognitive test to try to a get at some of this and and i should say that the list of this goes on and on their people who claim that their completion improves and that the allergies and there is probably all sorts of reply effects if you can affect your inflammation you we know that you can affect your cognition we know that you can effect your your your skin and inflammation that is occurring on your skin i really think that there is a basis for a lot of those anecdotes it may just be hard to see in a short study and in a a small you know a small cord of people over short paid of time but we did normally see significant things associated with cognition and moods and all of the things that that a we were testing for which a yet there there could be a variety of explanations or that the we also have a a a standardized a a stool measure that people use and there was a kind of less constipation better battle movements over the course of both of these interventions it did seem bad habits improved which a a lot of times can lead to better moods but that we were not able to tomes the classic pcyclaniless would have a a field they with that what sorts of interesting things did you observe in the fiber group because it is clear that that group u yielded some unexpected findings in both directions that you things you expected to see you wouldidn see as to the same amplitude as you did in the fermented for group but ism guessing you also saw some very interesting things in the fiber group to total faso a we started looking at the date and more detail when we did not see the cohort wide response and a one of the things we observed is that in measuring all these immune parameters there appeared to be three different groups of kind of immune responses that we were seeing one group that got over all less in inflammatory and then two other groups that kind of had a mixed result partly more inflammatory partly lesson inflammatory in all these markers that we were looking at and when we started digging into what a aspect of the biology of those people dictated or predicted which group they fell into the really interesting part is the people with the highest diversity got mycrobiums to start the study were the ones that were most likely to have the a decreases and inflammation and e the you a data seem to be telling us that if you start off with a diverse mycrobiota may be one that is better equipped to degrade a wide variety a dietary fire your more likely to respond positively to it if you have a very pleated got mycrobyum your not is likely to be able to respond to it and thinking back to that experiment that we talked about before with the mufti generational loss of of fire tormenting my robes in in me that were fat a a western diet a it it may be that a many of us in the industrialized world have a mycrobium that depleted now that even if we consume a high libra diet at least for a short period of time we do not have the right my cubes an r got to degrade that fire and this as actually been observed by other groups beautiful study out of university of minisota looking at emigrants coming to the united states and within nine months but certainly over the course of years immigrants that come here lot a a a lot of the diversity under got mycrobyum but a lot of the fiber degrading capacity in there got my chromium to it could be that overtime this becomes he one way street and it is hard for us to recover a the the microbes that that actually degrade the fire and i think that this probably intersects with sanitation in our environment in the fact that we do not have access to new microbes that might help us degrade the fire that we actually a have loss these microbes in their in some ways recoverable without deliberate reintroduction of fiber degrading my groups i can recall from childhood the we kids that would eat dirt yin snails and others is sounds tolly disgusting but kids covered with mad and you snowed that may be not much any more and it certainly during the pandemic there is been a lot more use of these hands antlers that prior to that people seem pretty spooked about but than obviously the they prioritized them am do you while you have children did you o you encourage them to a to when they were the young did you encourage them to interact with pets and dirt and arson a stiffen the environment provided that stuff wasn't immediately talks of yo exactly this is really it is it is a continual a cost benefit analysis i think the a i i will say that i with the pandemic now and a certainly just with infectious diseases in general it is really important to be aware of a the the possibility for compromising your health through the spread of germs and that that is just we no handfasting is important and we have to be careful with am the the spread of germs but i do think that a the sanitation sanitation of our environment a has gone overboard with the a various things being impregnated with antibiotics you o shopping carts and things that and tooth brushes and it is it is antibiotics and and a things for killing my robes or her everywhere and when we were raising we know when our daughters were young and we are were making these decisions the calculations that we would make were really am one a how likely ere they to encounter a disease causing my club if we have been out on a high or in our garden just kind of working in the dirtier whatever maybe it is not as important to wash your hands before you have lunch even if there is a little bit of dirt on them a if they have been in a public playground were maybe there a other kids with germs or maybe even chemicals pesticides and and er besides that are being use a maybe it is more important than to wash your hands certainly if you have been in the grocery store on the subway probably good i dead to wash your hands but its i think you really need to think about kind of the the contact of it and a i exposure to my robes a from the environment is likely and important part o a educating our mean system and keeping the proper balance in our mean system an its just a matter of figuring out the right way to do that safely and it may be that the fermented food result that we saw is a way of capping into the same pathways kind of environmental exposure to my clubs that safe interesting to touch on how signals get from the got to the rest of the body and a we pro do not have time to go into all the systems that benefit from having a diverse microbus or healthy microbus but ya we talked about the men system am there is active signaling in transport from the got all along its length as far as i know into the blood stream into other organs and tissues for the mean system am it seems straightforward am to reduce in the amount or number of inflammatory side a ones lie six and forth may be increased the antiimplamatory side of kinds lemon and others but we know there is a got brain access an during that literally talk in both directions between brain and got but let say i i eating my tormented foods am doing all the right things and i my got is diverse an have all the good good was at all the right places how is it that a that the fact that those microdot a thriving is conveyed to the rest of the body a because they are in there doing their thing and i do not know that they have a mind but their probably not thinking of taking care of me drew but i get feel better or i might a get sick less often or combat a any almost more quickly how is that actually happening man is it is it that the microbiout o stay restricted to the got but the signaling molecules are all downstream a in a downstream way or are making good or bad things happen wore is there some sort of direct recognition at the body level or their sells in the body that a responding to o they got microbonamas healthy and therefore i can make more of the good stuff in less of the bad to yet speak yet the great the i a your rite it supercomplex there a huge array of ways that our body a perceives a both the microbes and the molecules that they produce in or got and the molecules they produce are of course of product of what microbes are there and then what they receive as kind of metabolic in puts what were eating and what other microbes are or present in the environment providing molecules to them he knottier is complex matrix but we that a probably the the simplest place to start is just the immune system we have a in immune system that they know the vast majority of mine cells in our body or located in our got just because there such a a dense a population of micros there that have the there a we consider them a beneficial microbes but they are only beneficial if there in the right spot in the got as soon as they is localizes we know that they began become opportunistic pathogens and the immune system really playing in important role to keep to them in place is essential for this system not a moving into a diseased space the immune system has a variety of ways of of monitoring what micros are there there actually specialized structures in the got a known as para tires patches that actually take up microbes they they actually allow microbes to transit in to this population of immune cells in a very controlled way that last set of amuse cells becomes educated as to what microbes are just on the other side of the barrier while it som a could of a border patrol exactly year they they bring them in they they finger print them and then a have have kind of this a set of responses ready to go if needed me a there they are other cells known as in druidic cells special types that actually send a long arms these processes out into the luminous the got and do the same thing take up microbes bring them back in and sample them a in addition to these direct sampling mechanisms the cells that line the got have e a huge array of receptors specialized prolines that perceive patterns that the a molecular patterns that the a microbes makes things indoor and mipapoli sacred a just the cell wall of the a bacteria we have specialized receptors that recognize those if those signals become two profound or if there perceived in the wrong place that can stimulate and inflamatorsso there is all these ways of kind of monitoring the membership and where it is and how close it is but then there is is whole other set of a ways of perceiving metabolic activity in what is happening in the n you mention before this direct a no these cell types that a express taste receptors in the got and have ways of sampling dietary components there are those same types of a are an analogous cells in are got that are perceiving metabolites produced by the microbioto that a our bodies can perceive what sort of metabolic activity is going on and then in addition to that there is this tremendous tremendously important interim nervous system that a sending signals back to the praying dictating things motility do i get rid of what is in here do i move it along quickly what what actually is is happening do i need to interact with t mine cells there is is really complex array of of a interactions between the different cell types and then a lot of the cells that are in the got perceiving all of these signals a lot of the immune cells can actually get up and leave they can get into the blood cycled through and and then home to other regions a the a mucosa surfaces that mucosa surfaces are are a educated broadly against what is a what is passing through our got there is there is a a variety of ways of cells communicating and then a lot of the molecules that the microbiota makes can actually make their way into the blood stream directly and an the a the array of molecules is still being defined were trying to figure out a what all these chemicals are we mention the short chain vadiacids but those are just the tiptoe iceberg the really interesting compounds a you know idol derivatives and a finals and and i know derived from monoacid metabolize by got microbes taken up into the blood stream and then we further metabolize these they become kind of to microbe host metabolites and then they can go on and bind to different receptors throughout our body anywhere or blood stream has access to and start to trigger signaling cascades is it known whether not any of those m molecules are small enough to cross the blood brain barrier because the hypothesis it a and the current thinking is that a nor transmitters manufactured in the got and signaling along the got brain acts literally neurons talking back and forth electrically from brain to got got to brain is what regulates things mood or at least an animal models and there some emerging human studies improvement of symptoms in in a opium spectrum disorders it maybeven in eighty eight to what a basely saying here is that there's some evidence a emerging that improving the got microfilm can improve a outcomes in psychiatric and developmental disorders but what you are telling me is that the that the microbiota themselves are manufacturing chemicals that can make into the blood stream and therefore ism asking if those chemicals can move from the bloodstream into the brain directly it may not be a got brain axis via neurons it actinic a a speceepage of ceretonan into the brain and we toilet calling into the brain for for that matter totally and you another a the was tithe biology f most of these molecules is not well understood but certainly in carer final fluid that is been analyzed a it is you can perceive these mycrobule metabolites they are there the answered we yes some f some of them are getting across the but really interesting thing is i think a lot of these molecules are if there experience that high enough doses are a toxic or half toxic properties we know that a a lot of these a metabolites when they make the rain of the blood stream eventually are excreted through the kidneys and grand actually we can monster the metabolism that is going on in your got by actually looking at the metabolites that are present in your urine because those many of those originated in your got from your got scrubs but people with kidney disease whose kidneys a filtering process not functioning properly actually a build up high levels of many these metabolites in to the blood stream and a that can lead to more of these molecules making it across the blood brain barrier and in fact some of the a transporters in the kidney that are responsible for shuttling these molecules out into urine are also found at the blood brain barrier for shuttling the molecules back into the blood stream if they do get across and and we know that mental fog is a big one of the big symptoms of kidney disease eventually because the lot of these metabolites accumulate in blood and then make their way across the blood brain barrier into o the central er system amazing ism glad you mention mental fog a few years back there were some a reports a some scientific reports and as a consequence in in the media that a excessive in take a probe o piliform robotics could create mental fog i soft now if that ever took hold a and an it raises a general question about a piliform robotics ai took them for a few years just thinking that would be good for my got microboman than i switch to the fermented food thing the largely on this a consequence of at the work that you and crispublished am but it what what is the thought about probe for for the typical person that is not recovering from a round of antabiadics were that am has been prescribed them am have heard that the species of a microbioda that they a proliferate might not be that species that we want to proliferate but have also heard that maybe that does not matter what what is your general stands they can be quite expensive em also i know i n i about expense lot tody but always want to taken to account that people are showing up to the table at with variety of budgets and you probe o one of the more expensive supplements you that you can quickly get into the several hundreds of dollars er month if your getting the a quote quote best quality ones and if they are got actually causing braining than a mattered want to use them now completely and there is a tennis snake oil out there i mean there is just people know that they i know i think that many of these companies are aware that they can pray off of people's fires and get a lot of money from them with absolutely no dated to back up their probation is doing anything am that i think that the first thing to say is by or beware because it is a supplement market its largely unregulated and that means that there are a lot of bad products out there and a lot of products that am even though they are not intended to be bad just do not have great quality control the have been several studies that have taken off that a over the counter just kind of off the shelf products surveyed what is in there based on sequencing and shown that they what is in there does not match what is on the maple that that is true of many supplements and unfortunng supplement companies this is only we get into on the bod gastllot there there are reputable brands and they go through a lot of work to to get things right and there are many that just for whatever reason it just does not matches list exactly and there there are am i places the probation companies can send their product to have it independently validated you an to look for that sort of validation on the tuna product m there also are names that are just very well known and am it is a you know there reputations are on the line they probably in vest little but more in quality control than may be some of the other less er known names am but there there is a huge range of am data an probiaducts and i think that the thing that we kind of recommend is am try to find good products and en experiment for yourself and see if you can find something that works for you i know people who have experience constipation an am cannot do not want to change their diet and have found to probation that help some with the am if you can find that right new great that that is wonderful am i would say that that the at a right now is not am overwhelmingly positive for what t robotics do to the got my crobiotus there have been some nice studies looking at the impact of probaticts on re cover after anabolic treatment and it appears to slow down the recovery of the mescal mycrobiota a and a some some other studies that have a werwere the the big signal is not seen as you might hope with e a probation that supposed to treat a different disease there have been met analysis that do suggest in certain instances recovery from a a antibiotics that there even though it may cause your my arbiter to recover more slowly that it may actually prevent a real disease recovery from viral dirty is probates may help but because there is such a huge range of products and because each person is there own little keeper when it comes to the mycrobiom it is really hard to know a whether there are great products for a given indication the really good advice that i have heard is tried of find a a a study that supports in a really well does in study an this is very hard for people who are non scientists to evaluate but with your experiencing a medical problem or when it consult the doctor a the e know that that might be helpful but finding a study where specific probation has successfully done whatever it is your looking for and then sticking with that robotic is really the best recipe for as a as a place to start in the space thing and what about prebiotics is their number of a reasons why i can imagine the preach would be beneficial a which essentially its your pushing the fiber system which we talked about about to day yet ye absolutely a that the studies that have been done on prebiotics the it is really kind of a mixed bag of results the a there's been studies done with a purified fires where you actually see my crobioted diversity plummet over the course of the study because a you get a very specific bloom in a small number of bacteria that are good at using not one type of fiber and that is at the expense of all the other my robes that are in the got and a it is really hard to replicate with purified fire what you get for instance tat a salad bar in terms of the array of complex care hydrates that would be exposing your mycroboto to and i think the kind of a a broad view of this in the field is that consuming a broad variety of plants is and and all the the diverse fire that comes with that is probably better in fostering diversity in your mycrobiota then purified fires now there are a again a lot of people who benefit from purified fires either for geimotility a or or for other aspects of a i health proms that they have been experiencing again i think it is a type of thing where you had the try to find the thing that that is ripe for you but there a there also our studies that suggest that if you lay rapidly for enable a fires on top of a western diet you actually can a resulting in weird metabolism happening in your liver because you have this incredibly rapid fermentation of fiber along with a lot of fat am coming into the system at least that is the that is the theory and in a mouse study that was published a few years ago they actually see that a subset of the mice develop hapatisalular carcinoma when there feta a hi dose precious o answer liver cancer on top of a a on top of a western diet whether that is representative of human biology we do not know but a purified fires are defiantly very different am both in terms of the diversity of structures but also in terms of how rapidly there tormented in the got because a if you are eating plants the complex structures there really slow the microbes down an terms a fermentation in you and up with a slow raid of fermentation over the length of your collins as opposed to this big burst of fermentation that can happen if you eat something that is highly soluble and and easily accessed by the microbes interesting i guess i is a fair to come back to this idea am trying avoid process foods the highly palatable foods there alight sometimes superhighway palatable foods there now call there packed with hidden sugars an also fire am sounds some fiber is good am and despite the outcome of the study you identify that if you have the appropriate micobiotar than you will a back round than net one will respond even better to the fir maybe a longer gamut face for for those folks and than the fermented foods it is no reason why you cannot do both and as we talk about before ism a lot of tormented foods have fiber you can guilty birds with lodestone totally and it could be the the diversity increase that we saw in the high fermented food group could be something that would aid the high fire group and now were planting another study coming up were we are doing high fire high fermented food and then fire plus fermented food just to see if there is a center justice affect the hate on in roll am seriously although i guess unbiased cause i serve no where your trying to whit a well it will is it blood draws that you use to measure the inflamotone inexactly we on a o s l larger i weans i out the are you have covered a tremendous amount of information and ism incredibly grateful this was a aerobiology that despite having learned a lot about through papers and going to talks and and reading articles in the media has remain somewhat mysterious to me until to day you have given us a very vivid picture of how the system works where can people find out more about the work that you are doing a we concertalin provide links and an you and and your wife a to run your lab you have a book on this topic could you tell us about the book where we can learn more about the saran burg lab in the work of your doing a maybe people even trying in roll some of these studies ye fantassica'd be great if we can get people to it and roll were always looking for a for r we nun willing participants a yes o a errand my wife and i wrote a book called the good got and a that that really was a a response to how we were changing our lives in response to to being in the feel being very familiar with the research seeing that a lot of our friends that were not studying the got microbus but were very well informed many of them scientists we are not doing the same things we were doing and it was very clear that it was just the a lack of information funneling out of the field to other people and we wanted to a make that accessible to people who were not microbus scientists there is also a really interesting story we are at a a conferment sight that just haw scientific conferences all summer long week after week after week different fields and it is people the work there that are just dealing with these new groups coming in week after week and the week we were there for microbus conference a people a a the work in the dining comments came up to us in they said what group is this this is weird and were what is were in the said we cannot keep the sandbar stock and it was just it was very clear that nobody was doing what we were doing until we would go to microbus conference and then everybody was doing the same stuff that we were doing and am we anyway we wrote this book to talk about our personal journey and kind of the science in the field and a yet just to a lay a foundation for people if they want o start thinking about these changes and then in terms of a and of connecting with our research certainly there is the center for human microbyom studies at stamford chichis kind of our home base for doing a lot of these dietary interventions we miss the studies there m give more information on what were doing and then we have a lab website to that people can go to and read more about our research a yet but a workmen we are always looking for participants for our studies great well we will provide links to all of those sources and i just want to say thank you much for sharing with us your knowledge for the incredible work that you and rica your wife and and cries do and am and are continuing to do i think this is an area that and when i started my training i heard a little bit about am microbyoda and always just lout those are people tat work on infectious disease and all the bad stufsorts it is interesting and and really a important that people realize that tit were caring all this vital cargo and we need to take care of the cargoes who can take care of us thank you much for your time and for the work you do and i hope we can do it again thanks and r this was the great conversation terrific thank you for joining me to day for my discussion with doctor just an soninburg all about the got microbus and how to optimizer got microbus for health please check out the sonanburg lab web page that soninburg spelled as o n an e and b or g l a b got stanforg got e d u that soninburg lab dot stamford dot e d u they often recruit for studies exploring how different aspects of nutrition impact they got microbus much as we discussed during to day's episode please also check out the book that he and his wife doctor aricasononburg wrote called the good gut it is

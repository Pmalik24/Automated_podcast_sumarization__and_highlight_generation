welcome to the hubermansciencescience taco i manor supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is doctor davidson claim professor of genetics at hazard medical school and director of the pull f glen center for the biology of agent doctor sinclair's work is focus on why we age and how to slow or reverse the effects of ageing by focusing on the cellular and molecular pathways that exist in all cells of the body and that progress those cells over time from young cells to old cells by elucidating the biology of cellular maturation and aging doctor sin clip's group has figured out intervention points by which any of us indeed all of us can slow or reverse the effects of agent what is unique about his work is that it focuses on behavioral interventions nutritional interventions as well as supplementation and prescription drug interventions that can help us all age more slowly and reverse the effects of aging in all tissues of the body doctor sainclair holds a unique and revolutionary view of the aging process which is that aging is not the normal and natural consequence that we all will suffer but rather that aging is a disease that can be slowed or halted doctor sin claim continually publishes original research articles in the most prestigious and competitive scientific journals in addition to that he is published a popular book that was a new york times best cellar the title of that book is a life span why we age and why we do not have to he is also very active in public facing efforts to educate people on the biology of aging and slowing the aging process doctor sainclair and i share a mutual interest and excitement in public education about science and ism thrill to share with you that we partner and doctor davidson claim is going to be launching the life span podcast which is all about the biology of aging and tools to intervene in the aging process that podcast will launch wednesday canary fifth you can find it at the link in the shoots to this episode to day as well you can subscribe to that podcast on couture apple or notify or anywhere that you get your podcast again the lifespan podcast featuring doctor davidson claim begins wednesday canary fifth twenty twenty two be sure to check it out you are going to learn a tremendous amount of information and you are going to learn both the mechanistic science behind aging the mechanistic science behind reversing the aging process and practical tools that you can apply in your everyday life in to day's episode doctor son claim and i talk about the biology of aging and tools to intervene in that process and you might view today's episode as a primer for the life span podcast because we delve deep into the behavioral tools nutritional aspects supplementation aspects of the biology of aging we also talk about davit's important discoveries of the sirloins particular molecular components that influence what is called the up venom and if you soft knowhow the epigene is you will soon learn in to day's episode coming away from today's episode you will have depth knowledge about the biology of aging at the cellular molecular and what we call the circuit level meaning how the different organs and tissues of the bodies age independently and how they influence the aging of each other today's episode gets into discussion about many aspects of aging and tools to combat aging that have not been discussed on any other podcast or in the book life spend before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and since related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body with out lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer he will give you five free travel pass plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fie free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolytes for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the properties all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your ideation and that you are getting the preparation of electrolights if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element e dot calm slash supermen and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want to try element you can go to element element e do calm slash berm and now my conversation with doctor avid sit care thank you for coming then have me to desex this is mate by the way the were testing ta eleven i am can other pot cast we why do not drink out also ism boring that way but truly thanks for being here i have a tonic questions for you we go away back in some sense but that does not mean that i do not have many many questions about aging longevity life span actionable protocols to increase how long we live et camera i just want to start off with a very simple question am not even try there and answer to but what is the difference between longevity antiaging and aging as a disease because i cassock you with the statement aging is a disease right well longevity is the the more academic way we describe what we research anti aging it is cone of the same thing but it is got a bad rat because it is been used by how bunch people do not know what they token about i really do not that fermata aging but aging as a disease and longevity are perfectly valid ways to about this subject ghetto about aging as a disease when i started my research disease your hover medical school it was considered if the is something that is wrong with you a and it is a rare thing has be less than fifty percent the population that is definitely a disease and then people work their whole lives to trying cure that condition and i look up what is the definition of aging and as well to deterioration and in health and sickness and you can die from it finally you do something that sounds pretty much a disease but the cannot is that if more than half the population gets this condition aging h it is put in a different bucket which is fiscal that is outrageous cause i it is just a the totally arbitrary cut off but think about this that we are ignoring the major cause of all these diseases aging is eighty and ninety per cent the cause of hot disease altsimers if we did not get old and o body's stayed youthful we would not get those diseases and actually what was showing my tables f you turn the clock back in tissues those diseases go away aging is the problem and instead through your most the lost two hundred years we been sticking bandages on diseases that have already occurred because of aging and then it is too late there couple of things one is you want a slow aging downs we do not get those diseases and when they do occur do not you stick a bandage on reverse the age of the body and then the diseases will go away that clarifies a lot for me thank you can we point to one specific general phenomenon in the body that underlies agent or well that that is contentious because your scientist to come up with new hypotheses us m it sheathe girl their careers but fortunately during the two thousands we settled on eight or nine major causes of aging we call them hole marks was causes with was little bit too strong but these these eight or nine causes at least for the first time allowed us to come around and talk together we put put them on a on a pets a someone got an equal waiting equal slices but before that by the way we were try to kill each other in the field it was horrible incoming that you guess work on again i try a killygyesn't it well kill each others careers when i to think i was filly generous but i was one of the kids and the old guard really did not the new guard we we just came along in the nineteen nighties and nineties and said free radicals do not do much the there actually genes call on gevitygenes and that cause a whole rakes and there was this competition for what never happen which was noble prize for this and it just led to a lot of competition you i would go to meetings and people would shouted each other and backs tat was horrible but then fortunately the two thousand we ruled around this new map of aging with these causes of whole marks but i but i think that there is one slice of the peace that is way larger than the others and we can get to that but that is the information in the cell that i call we call the pigeon bell tells but more about the epigene a from it for us i if if you will and i and then well get into ways that one can adjust the epigenoman positive ways yes in science wat what i to do a reductionist is to boil it down and i actually and it up boiling aging down to an equate which is the the loss of information our entropy s it is a hard thing to overcome second low the madanamacs that is that is there but this a suasion really represents the fact that i think aging is a loss of information in the same way that when you zero something a a thousand times you will lose that information or you try to copy it et said ta or even if you send information across the infinite some of it will get lost that is what i think is aging and there ware two types of information in the body there is the genetic information which is digital a t c g the chemical letters of deny but there this other part of the information in the body that is just as important it is essential in fact and that is the systems that control which genes as witched on and off in what sell at what time in response to what we eat et camera and it turns out that eighty per cent of our future on levity and health is control by this second part the epigenesis information the control systems i liken the deny to the the music that is on a d v d or compact disk for the younger people use to use the things i recall the other and then the epigene is the reader that says oke in this sell we need to play that set of songs and in this other sell weave to play a different citosongs but over time aging is the equivalent of scratching the did and the deity that you you not playing the right songs and cells when they do not hear the right songs they get missed up and they do not function well and that is what i am saying is the main driver of aging and these other whole marks a largely manifestations of that process can we go a little deeper into what the these scratches are is it the way that the wanna are packed in to a cell is it the way that a their space or what is what are the scratches that you are referring to deny is six foot long soil you join you comes homes together get at six foot percent there is enough to go to the moon and back eight times any body and it has to be wrapped up to exist in inside us but it is not just wrapped up will tell it is not just a bundle of string it is wrapped up very carefully in ways the dictates which genes a switched on and off and when we are developing in the embryo the sell marks the deny with chemicals that says a this gene is for a nerve cell you you sell will stay and of cell for the next hundred years if you are lucky do not turn into a skin cell that would be bad and those chemicals a there are many different types of chemicals but once called methelation those little metals will mark which songs get played for the rest of your life and there other marks that change daily but in too what we are saying is that the body controls the gene through the ability to mark the deny and then compact some parts of it silence those genes do not read those gene and open others keep others open that should stay open and that pattern of genes their silent and open silent open is what dictates the sells type the sells function and thin the scratches are the disruption of that genes that were once silent and you could say it is e gene that is involved in skin it is sin to come on in the brain should not be there but we see this happen and vice peer the gene might get shut off ever time during aging e sells over time lose these structures lose their identity they forget what they supposed to do and we get diseases we call that aging and we can measure that in fact we can measure it in such a way we can predict when somebody is go to die based on the changes in those chemicals are these changes the same sorts of changes that underlie the outward body surface manifestations of aging that most of us are familiar with graying of the hair wrinkling of the skin drooping of the a of the face om a a walk around new york lately it is amazing to me the certain people that seem to walk looking down at the sidewalk because the their spine is essentially in a sea shape right am hall mark if you will of aging that most of us are familiar with a these same sorts of we an a scratches associate with that or we talking out people that are botentiallyou are going to look older but simply live longer ah well it is actually you you are as old as you look if you want ta general lives am o let start with centenarian families these are families attend to live over a hundred when there seventy they still look fifty or less it is a good good indicator it is not perfect because you can me grow up in a scalar and accelerate the aging of your skin ah betting general how you look no ones ever died from gray hair but over all you can get a sense just from the ability of skin to hold itself up how thin it is the number of wrinkles that is actually a great paper just came out that said that an ai system looking at the face could very accurately predict some one's age very interesting i started often developmental neurobiology one of the things that i learned early on that i still believe a whole heatedly is that development does not stop at age twelve or fifteen or even twenty five that your entire life is one belong developmental art in thinking about different portions of that developmental art the early portion of infancy and especially puberty seem especially rapid stages of aging and i know we normally look at babies and children units and putting we think all they are vital they are young and yet the way you describe these changes in the epiginom and the way you are framed aging as a disease leads me to ask our periods of of immense vitality the same periods when were aging faster yes yes and this is something have never talked about a at least not publicly that really goo question those chemicals we can measure a it is it is also know ace the here bath clock it's the biological clock at separate from your chronological age specially what i did not mention is that when the a i looked at the faces of those people they could prepredict their biological age they internal age your skin represents the age of your organs as well and the people that look after themselves we can take about how to do that later but the therefore some people that are ten twenty years younger than other people a biologically and turns out if you measure that clock from birth or even before birth if you look at animals here is a massive increase in age on base on that clock early in life you are right that that is a really important point that you have accelerated aging during the first to years of life and then it goes liner towards the rest of your life but there is another interesting thing you brought up which is wet finding that the genes that get messed of that get scratched that a leading to aging aging all those early develop mental genes they come on lad in life and just miss up the system and they seem to be particularly susceptible to those scratches what out whats causing the scratches hell we know of a couple of things in my life we fig it out one is broken acromions deny damage particularly cuts to the deny breaks you if you have an ex ray or cosmic gray or even if you go out in the sun and you will get your broken acromions that accelerates the unwinding of those beautiful deny loops that i mention a we can actually do this teahouse we can accelerate that process and we get an old mouse fifty per cent older and it has this fence spine carolus it has gray hair it is organs are all we now con control aging the folds direction the other thing that accelerates aging is massive cell damage or stress we pinched nerves and we saw that their agent process was accelerated as well credible yet the this is more of van panic total a phenomenon it is an anecdotal phenomenon but this experience of in junior high school your going home for a summer need come back high school in the you ask usually starts eighth or ninth grate or great eight or great nine for your comedians and then some of the kids they grew beers over the summer or they completely matured quickly over the summer do you think there is any reason to believe that rates of entry into and through puberty have can predict over all rates of aging in other words if a kid is a a theyounow a slow burner right they they basically acquire the the traits of puberty slowly over many years can we make some course prediction that they are going to live a long time verses a kid that goes home for the summer and comes back a completely different organism a appearing to be a complete of an organism like they busy aged very quickly in the summer to that mean their aging very quickly over all well the i do not want to scare anybody sure that there there there are studies that show that the slower you take to develop it also is predictive of having a longer healthier life a and it may have some to do with growth hormone we know the growth hormone is pro aging any one who is taken growthhormon in a pay attention we know the look at some one of taking growth hormone ye they often i acquire these a characteristics of vitality improved a smoothness of skin b at the e body shape change ye on you fill best feel better for short amount of time you will build a muscle you feel great but it is burning your candle above's ultimately if do not live long you want less of that and the animals that have been generated a and mutants that have low growth hormone sometimes these a dwarfs they live the longest by far ai guide my lad michael boncowski he had the longest live mouse a mouse typically lives about to an a bit years he had a mouse that lived five years and he gave it cleric restrictions wit fasting combined with one of these dwarf mutations low growth hormone i think called it soda but the this in no you look at who who lives the longest it is the really small people a this is bit anecdotal but it sounds sounds it might be true is that the people who played the munchkins in the wizard of as many of them went on to live into the nines and beyond really ah main o there a som lot lore dwarfs as well there are dwarf am mutations a in south america and they seem to be protected against many of the disease of aging you barely ever see ho to see or canter in these families i having owned a very large dog breed a bulldog mastiff who lived a long life for a bulldog eleven years but there many dogs that will live twelve sixteen years that a smaller dogs can we say that there is a direct relationship between body size and longevity or it duration of of of life well that there is but that does not mean that you are slave to your early epigene nor to urgent the good news is that the epigene can change those loops and structures can be modified by how you live your life and if if your born toll and i was not and i wish at the time i i did or a but no matter what size you are you can have a bigger impact on your life than anything engines give you eighty percent is epiginetit not genetic that's talk about some of the things that people can do and i have cone to bach the in to categories am rather than just diving rite into actionable protocols the first one relates to food blood sugar insolent this is aneling i hear a lot about that fasting is good for us but rarely do i hear why it is good for us o i one of the reasons ism excite talk to you to days because i want a drilling to the details of this because i think understanding the mechanism will allow people to make better choices and not simply to just decide whether not they are going to fast or not fast or how long they are going t fast i think should be dictated by some understanding on the mechanism why is it that having elevated blood sugar bucks and insolent ages us more quickly and or we is it that having periods of time each day or perhaps longer can extend our lifespan well at let stare with with what i think was a big mistake was the idea that people should never be hungry we live in a world now with is at least three meals a day and then wee go company selling bars and a snacks in between the feeling of hunger o some people never expense hunger in the whole lives it is really really bad for them a it was based i believe on the twenty century view tat you do not want to stress out the pancreas in you try to keep insane levels pretty steady i and not have the s this fluctuation what we actually found a my colleagues and i across this field of lunch levity is that when you look it for all animals whether it is a dog or mouse or monkey the ones that live the longest by far thirty per cent longer and stay healthy other ones that do not eat all the time actually was first discovered back in the early twentieth century but people ignored it and there was rediscovered in or the nineteen thirties clip maid clerk restriction he put sell your less in the food of rats they could not get as many calories even though they at and those rats lived thirty percent longer but then it it went away and then came back in the two thousands in a big way when a couple of things happen one is that o my lab and others showed that there are longevity genes in the body that come on in protect us from aging and dies the group of genes that i work on a called sirtuans as seven of them and we show it in two thousand and five in a since paper that if you have low levels to insolent and another muscle called insolent growth factor those low levels turn on the longevity goes one of them that is really important is called sort one and but by having high levels of insolent all day being fed means your longevity genes are not switched one your falling apart your epigene on your information that keep yourselves functioning over time just a grads quick you clock is ticking faster by always being fed o the other thing that i thing might be happening by always having food around is that it is not allowing the cell to have periods of rest and and re established the epigene and it also is accelerating in that direction the is plenty of other reasons as well that are not as profound such as having low levels of glucose in your body will trig or major muscles in your brain to become more rest sensitive to insolent and suck the glucose out of your bloodstream which is very good you do not one have locos flowing around too much and that well for off truth y dies hunger of course is associate with low blood locos and low insolent do you think there is anything about the subjective experience of hunger itself they could be beneficial for longevity yet i do ah though you get used to the feeling of not eating am kindiscrred that way cold water you eventually a out you get used to it anon unfortunately but there there are some studies that are being done at the nationallinsitus of health that are able to simulate the effect of hunger but still provide the galleries and it is looking the a small component that is u to hunger but most of it actually is because you have got this these periods of not being fed and then the body turns on these defensive genes o there is really interesting experiment that was published may be couple of years ago by roil cacao down at einniage what he did was you took of ten thousand mice and gave them different combinations of fat to a hydrate routine and you's try to finger out what was the best combination and the you also cleverly had a group well two groups one that was fed all the time or ate as much as they wanted and the other group was only given food for an hour a day and it turns out they ate roughly the same amount of calories cause of course in an hour the stuffing their faces it turns out it did not matter what diet he gave them it was only the group that ate within that window that lived longer and dramatically longer my conclusion is and mice are very similar to estimate abolicaly i think that tells us that it is not as important what you eat it is when you eat during the day what is the protocol that people can extrapolate from that or may you should just ask you what is your protocol for when to eat and when to avoid food do you fast do you ever fast longer than twenty four hours what do you do and what d you think is a good jumping off place if people want to explorer the as a protocol well if ti's one thing i i could say if i was a definitely try to skip a meal the day that is the best thing does it matter which meal for they are such a equivalent well as long as it is at the end or the beginning of the day because then you you add that to the sleep period when you huffily not eating i thin that that is an excellent point arises us it is a imbormbat i thing is an excel one because i think one of the things that people struggle with the most is knowing when and how to initiate this called intermittent fasten and the middle of the day obviously is not attack to the sleep cycle on the same way it is much harder as well for many people were well it'll tell you what i do i i skip breakfast to have a tiny bit of your g or aloe oil because the supplements i have need to be dissolved in it and then i go throughout the whole day as ism doing right now here with this this glass of water here i just keep myself filled with liquids and i do not feel hungry beware that the first two or three weeks when you try that you will fill hungry andyou also have a habit of wanting to chew on something that there is a lot of physical parts to it but try to make through the first three weeks and do without breakfast or do without dinner and i you get through it and i did that most for most of my life actually mainly because i did not i was not hungry in the morning some people are very hungry in the morning and they may want to consider skipping dinner instead but i will go throughout the whole day i do not get the crashes of the high glucose and the low glucose that any one who goes a men as three o'clock i am going need a sleep if you do what i do you will not experience that any more because what my body does is it it regulates blood shut levels naturally my liver is putting out glucose when it needs to in it very steady and gives me pure focus throughout the day and i do not even have to think about lunch and just pouring through at dinner i love food as much as anybody i will i will eat a regular pretty healthy meal it'll et it'll try to mostly vegetables i can eat sane fish and shrimp i really will eat it a as are i in fact my micro by a it is adapted to my diet now if i eat a stake it will not get digested very well it'll feel terrible if i do not eat a stake i feel her aah well we argentine lineage but we can talk about that well everybody different meet that is the other thing what what works to me may not be perfect for you and we do are to measure things to know what is working a i really desert i gave up desert and sugar in my when i turn forty and a occasionally it'll steal a bit of desert cause it does not herd if you steal it right but other than that i i avoid sugar which includes a simple coma hydrates i bread i try to avoid but actually notice is a and just a side not are to get build up a place pretty easily and every time i went to the dentist that have to scrape it off and i even bort tools to scrape it off was was driving me not i do not get place any more and i think it is because of my diet i do not have those sugars in my mouth at the bacteria feet on and then form the buy a film on ti much better breath by the way a all that is a benefit should do you ever fast longer than this it sounds yo if you am if you go to bed it well use ten to stay up late i know because i gat tabs from you two in the morning the am my time which means your out very late and up early as well but assuming that people go to sleep some time around eleven thirty or twelve placer malice an hour and wake up some time around seven a m placer minus ninety minutes you are eating more or last on a it sounds a som a twenty hours of fasting four hours of eating or sixteen hours a fasting and eight hours of of food and take et camera but do you ever do longer fast forty eight hours or seventy two hours or week long fast occasionally i do a my typical day i i would only eat within a two hour window just u shall i meat it either eating out or ass your twenty two two ye were i i love well and if you exercised you feel then you just pours through and maintain that fasted state absolutely i can exercise and now i body used to it i do not feel a need food offer exercising i used to i an but have i gone longer yes but not very often i find it quite difficult to go more than twenty for hours but when i do it may beet's once a month it'll go for two days a onto two and actually even better if you go three days without eating it kicks in even greater a longevity benefits there is a system could the what tobago system which i jest old and misfiled proteins in the body and there is a natural cleansing that happens when you are hungry i macroatofagy its name is but a good friend of mine a anemerea cuarvaux and all that in stop cold medicine discovered a a deep cleans called the chaperon mediated or tobago which kicks in day two day three i which really gets rid of the the deep proteins and what what excises me is she just put out a a big paper that ad if you trigger this process in an in an old mouse it leaves thirty five per cent longer it is a big deal if i could go longer i would but i just find that with my life style and ism going always day in a hundred ten per cent i need to to e at least once a day an orphan what more practical question than a mechanistic question related to this the practical question is when you are fasting regardless of how long i know your investing fluids water and a presume some cabin i heard you had several or more or more expressed to day a which is impressive but are you also investing electrolights i know some people get lightheaded they say to feel shaky when they fast and that the addition of sodium to their water or potassium amnesia a is something that is becoming little more involve now is that something that you do or that you see a need for people to do well it make sense but haven't had not need to do it i do not i just i doing to during the day an coffee when i first away and i do not get the shake o you know i i do not fix what is not broken a and i do ad things to my photo call that i think will improve me and avoid those things of course the on a be it be because i do not have a need for ti do not try it but it does make sense specially if you have had a big nit the night before you nobly not a supplement with that but i i think there's this paramount of a good stuff in t an coffee as it is then the the mechanistic question is you have told us that there is ample evidence that keeping your blood sugar low for a period of time each twenty four hours can help trigger some of these pro longevity enticing mechanisms and that extending them out two or three days can trigger yet additional mechanisms of et gobbling up of of dead sell somethings that sort how is it that blood glue coast triggers these mechanisms cause were said it'll gent remove glucose and things get better a you have i talk before me we could talk more now about some of the underlying cellar and genetic mechanisms things the sultans but how are gluecoasts and the curtains actually tether to one another mechanistically if there is a really od question that proves your scientist word worldly on what we what we now know is that these longevity pathways we call in these longevity genes talk to each other and we used to say all my on joy genes more important than yours it was ridiculous cause the all talking each the you pull one lever and the other one mods and the way to think of it is that there are system set up to detect what you are eating the sortuans will mainly respond to sugar and insolent and then this is other system called am tor which is sensing how much proline or a renascence of coming into your body and they talk to each other we can pull one and fact the other in vise verse but to gather when your fasting you will g et the curtain activation which is good for you and you you will also through lack of a monoacid particularly three of them loosing i solacing sailing the body will down regulate tour and it is that poor to and down em tour that is hugely beneficial an turns on all of the body's defenses the pro chewing up the old prolines improving insolence's to be giving us more energy repairing cells all of that and and these two pathways i think of the most important longevity interesting you mention lousing within the resistance training slash body brings lash fitness community loosing gets a lot of attention because they are longstanding debates about how much proline one needs pray and how much one can assimilate at each meal it makes for many you to videos and and not much else frankly however it is clear that because of losing's effects on the tour pathway that there are many people not just people in these particular fitness communities that are actively trying to invest more loosing on a regular basis in order to maximize their wellness and fitness and in some cases muscle growth but also just wellness but what i interpret your last statement to mean is that loosing because it trigger cellar growth is actually pro ageism in some sense is that right well it could be that is that is what the evidence suggests and again it goes back to the debate should you supplement with growth hormone testosterone all of these activities will give you immediate benefits you will you will bulk up more you will feel better immediately but based on the research it is at the expense of longtime health my view of longevity the way i treat my body is i do not burn both candles i have one end of the candle it i am very careful i do not blow on it but i also do enough exercise that ism building up my muscle but ism ism not huge any one who see mes i knows that ism not a a professional body builder but i try t actually he is the case and i have not said this publicly that i can remember i pulse things that i get periods of fasting and then i eat then i take a supplement then i fast then i exercise and it's taking the supplements and eating in the right timing to allow me to build up muscle sometimes because you cost just expect to take something constantly and do something constantly for t to work and that is that is why it is taking me about fifteen years to develop my critical and is this lot of subtlety to him yet soy a very rational protocol does the name sorry hofmacler meaniithing to you no quest i just briefly a i discovered or hoffmacler about fifteen years ago he was a in his rally special forces he is now got o be close to seventy forgive me sorry if tracts a that that number is inflated am he wrote a book called the warrior diet which got very little attention at the time but what he said was when he was in is rally special forces they rarely ate more than once per day and sometimes once every second or third day and this is a good who maintains in incredible physical stature yer he is very lean very strong and very vital at you no it i would say an advanced age but he is getting up there and he just seems to be getting better and better sorry hofmachler was the person who essentially founded if you will although our ancestors founded to be completely fair the called intermittent fasting i he call it the warrior died in this book din get much attention but one of the things that you to said really reminded me of or e i sat down with him as she went to his home and sat down with him and he said fasting is wonderful but these pulses where you nourish the body or even slightly over nourish the body provided they are too frequent have a tremendous effect on vitality and si i wont to use that as kind of a sag way to a address this issue a vitality verses on gravity because here yours telling me and certainly the evidence supports that you grothormon will make you feel better and younger taking testosterone or estragon we should probably say there are right women who have take cormonterapies later in life you take estrichin they experience a strong increase in vitality if it is done correctly but there is it an effect of aging the body more rapidly it sort of a second purity if you well but this idea of restriction and t hen pulsing not nearly feast and famine but certainly famine and feast in lower case letters really there really seems to be something about that at a seller level we con go back to tour in the sultans how do you think that the cells might be reacting to this kind of lower case feast a and upper case famine typprotical i a well the the pulsing i think is what you want to is to get the cells to be perceiving adversity a color modern life was sitting round were eating too much a were not exercising ourselves respond de today everything's cool no problem and they become relax in their intern on the defenses and we age rapidly we can see in the clock people wo exercise and eat less have a slow ticking clocks it is a fact a but my protocol is different than most people because i i pulsing it now the vessel let us get to why did i even think that might be possible cause i did not read the warrior diet a what i found in my research was that if we gave or is cerebral this red wine molecule that became well known in the two thousands a if we gave it to my the whole life seen they were protected against a high fact diet which we call the western diet they had lean organs they live slightly longer but not a lot and if we gave them a high fact i without reversal they actually you lived what sore is virtual protected them against the high fat diet we gave it to the on a normal diet that you stay it when they wanted and there was not much effect this is what is not known though it is in the supplemental data of the paper that nobody ever reads the mice that we given resvertral every second day on normal diet live dramatically longer than any other group people out there my my critics say always ventral did not extend the life span o my son a normal diet therefore it is not aging its just protecting against the high fat diet well look at the supplemental data please if you give it to the mice every other day we had my living over three years well that's a long time r i have got many many mice in my a only a ownership that and my laid s tamper and that is a very long life for about it was by far and it was a long live span extension and what that told me is that probably you do not want be taking a supplement every day you can take it either every other day or give your body arrest and i do the same with my meals i rest during the day another i give a nutritious dinner to my body and then give youngest say we've exercise and that try to time it was there are times when ism taking the drug met foreman which me mine low energy for those of you do not know motorman as a drug given to typed you diabetics to bring down their blood sugar levels but it is been found that looking at tens of thousands of veterans and others that those two touch y diabetics live longer than people that do not even get type died it is a longevity drug right now you have to get it from your doctor in the us and most out of countries you can just get it over the counter and you protect it it looks based on epbedymological data a case or hard disease frailty what else to measure i take met foreman inadditio you take motorman an your fasting each day when do you take it relative to the fact i i always take a met formal in the morning along with thee isvertral a because for number o reasons but mainly because my body response better and i bee measure my body for twelve thirteen years but he is the thing if am going to exercise a that day i will skip the mat formal and a lot of people who who do pay attention to this this kind of thing think that they should stop taking et formal cause they never can a get muscle or itscennat fact there ability to build up muscle but that is not true what met formal does to it actually just reduces the durability to have stamina because it is inhibiting your bodies ability to make energy a and what happens is when you're met formal you do fear rets but guess what those muscles that you do build up on met foreman have the same strength and have much lower inflammation and other makes of aging you just will not have that extradite per cent size of muscles if you want large muscles do not take met foreman and you will be fine during your exercise h but for me id ism not trying to get giant i once strong muscles and i want live longer in healthier i i just try o time it that i get the most raps out of my exercise raging ah but sometimes in scientific literature it is worth bringing this up if there is a five per cent difference in a graph then either the pressrelese or some reportable say o my goodness big difference five per cent contact met forming during exercise that is the headline and in go in and it is badly significant and the wrath is distorted because they have changed the axes to make it look bigger and now it is become admit that met formal greatly inhibits ability to exercise which is not true but in an abundance of caution i i skip my met formal on days on an exercise and not only that ism one of the twenty percent people that has a stomach sensitivity to it si if ism not feeling great that didn't take it either you mention mat formal is available only by prescription from a doctor at least in the you s am berberine as the substance that comes from tree barker i also learned about many years ago from or a he said if ever ism going to over eat a thanksgiving meal or something i take barbering this was those were his words and i tried and what is remarkable about berberine is that a you can eat enormous quantities of food and not feel as if you have eaten enormous quantities of food ism not necessarily recommending people do this but what i notice was if i took berberine which mynersenti is it works very similarly to to mat foremen worse on the pique pathway the actor pathway et camera that if i did not invest food in particular carbohydrates i would feel a little dizzy an con to get a head ache almost hipoglisemac what a your thoughts on berberine as an alternative to mat foremen and are there any cautionary notes ism obviously people should talk tor their doctor before adding or subtracting anything from their life including am a brathworker anything that not that comes up but with all that as set aside what re your thoughts about barbering and a timing of of low blood sugar and an these sorts of things i well before i had access to mat foreman i was taking barbering it is it is often known as the woman's metforeman u that he just called me poor what it women can take it to a that the thing with buggering we studded in my lab it it is effective at boosting energetics in the body just a pice ism at foreman does ah and we have actually given to rats and and my sincseeing that they are very healthy specially on a high fat did i i think it is it is likely to be good there are some human studies that exist clinical trials showing that it increases in seen sensitivity eye to take high notices which is a good thing yea i think my people you're insolent sensitivities sometimes people think oh ell tat that is bad right know you want yourselves to be insolent sensitive you do not want a lot of blood sugar floating around the camp be surquastered intoselvs exactly this is anti type to i bees and that this barbering i does have wonderful effects on the metabolism of animals and in some clinical trials on dozens of people it is been tested now there is there is one cautionary tale which just came up met baselines lad publish the buggering reduce the life panic worms but ism not sore worms trump human clinical trials at this point no not in my ops would mu no list respect to my we elegance colleagues for rather my colleagues that wore conceal yer bet that what i to do as to give all the information people can decide what they on but i would say base on the worn date i wouldn't panic just yet i think buggering has been shun we really safe in humans you mention rest pratfall think i now be a great time to talk orbit about protocols for rest martial great seed extract et camera i let us start with the the obvious one that i i know you get a lot but ism for the record cannot i just drink red wine and get enough rest stroll haven you can try you you need to drink about two hundred glasses a day i inure it is been tried there are some and i i drink it a gloss of red wine a day f i get the chance but any more than that it is lot of calories and your liver will get fatty and it is all tat it we realistically you can only get the thousand milligrams that i take a day a from a supplement that is pure nowthererea lot of people sellingwers veratrall if it is not light gray or white in in color throw it away the brown stuff has gone bad bore is contaminated and the contaminate stuff beware caused idea but regular as ventral should not do that a thousand milligrams perhaps what you do yen i have for or about fifteen years now and you in jest that with some fatty substance all of royal or roger is i right or you have to and ow the other supplements courseiten cerumen these these are crunchy things that is not going to get through you gut and ism not just making this up a i always base might statements on human studies we have done a lot of studies on resvertrall as if others since and we know that from we found out early i was one of the first people to take a high dotes for his ventral and way when we included it with food the levelsand my blood went out fivefold and you want have something in there if you just drink it with water its nocking to get through and unfortunately some people have done clinical trials without even thinking that they might need to dissolved in something you are you taking this all at once in the morning and chasing it with some all of royal or you a dissolving at any over what is that what is the specific critical ye i give been improving perfecting what i do for about ten years i would take some green roger couple of spoonfuls put the resvrtrol on there makes it around make shorts is old and put that in my mouth in soul of that these days what i to do because have realize that olivoil and particularly lake acid one of the money o unsaturate of fadiacids is also an activator of the curtain defenses ism trying i in jest more of oak acid i switch to olivoil what i do as i put couple of teaspoons of olivoil in a glass mix around there isvertrol and may be some cross crosstie a similar molecule make horst is old i put a little bit of vinegar a and if i have a basely i put that in and is drinking some salt dressing in its great delicious a that raises a question that i will not ask before we get to ataman and an are incitement be three which is by doing that do you think that it breaks your fast and i want i just frame this question of breaking the fast in it in a more general scientific theme and i love your thoughts on this one of the questions i get ask all the time is does in jesting blank break the fast does eating this or drinking that coffee if i walk in the room an some one else is eating a cracker does it break my fast ye people get pretty extreme with this my sense and please tell me if ism wrong o my sense is that it depends on the context of what you did the night before whether not your diabetic lots of think for instance of i eat an enormous meal at midnight go to sleep wake up at six a m i could imagine that black coffee or coffee with a little but a free might quit an cop break my fast but the body does not have a braking the fast switch the body only speaks in the language of glue cops a m you m tour et camera do you worry that in jesting these calories is going to cortical break your fast and more generally how do you think about the issue of weather not your fasting enough to get these pas inf a facts because i not everybody can manage on just water or just the or i we should say not everybody is willing to manage on just water or just for certain part of the day well my first answer is not scientific it is philosophical if you do not enjoy life what is the point and it'd it'd a coup of coffee in the morning little bit of milk spoonful of youngest not in a kill me i olivoil does not have routine or cars in it not many and ism probably not affecting those plunge defy pathways negatively i but without that little i would not enjoy my life as much seckwell the olivoil isn't is not as great as the get but ism trying to optimize and there is no perfect solution to what we doing and we still learning we do not know it is ill talk to molfome let alone everybody else but i ism with you i do not believe that taking a couple of spoonfuls of something unless it is hi froths consider is on a hurt you because have now got the rest of the day till about eight nine p m of not eating anything and that i i forgive myself for that and that there is a really god point here you and i were discussing this earlier i the point about doing this is that you try to do your best if if you go from regular living to do not eat the whole day you cannot fail quitting smoking cold turn it is easy to true garments to the patch on which you body has to get used to all sorts of habits and it is social it is physical putting stuff in your mouth chewing not just the lord bloodshed levels and your brain will fight it your limbic system is gin a go hey do it do it do it and you can have to fight it once but wont you get through it you will be better but you do it in stages do breakfast first then do small lunch and eventually cut lunch out do not go cultugbecause everyone knows it is a fact that if you try to do a strict dirt right out of the gates you will almost always fail i think i that captures ta the absence of of the fasting rationally in irrational approach to it to supplementation very well along the lines of supplementation what about an m and and a and be three bison what how does ane i want to know what you do i also want to know what i should do like and i think most we want to know what they should do en these are molecules that impact the curtain pathway in pact the the pathways that control aging e rates of aging in the spice know how do they do that and how does want incorporate that in to it a supplementation protocol should they choose to do that all right well disclaimer is a i do not recommend anything but i talk about what i do i bit of scientific background these sirtuangenes that we discovered first in ye sells we knows it in my the and then a animals as i move to hazard in the two thousands ism and one of one of my first post ox actually literally my first nostoc me coin published a great paper just a couple of months ago and found that turning on the virtual sixteen memory the seven n but sixteen is very potent it extended the last pandramatically of mice that he engineered both miles and females which is great what you want to do is naturally boost the activity of these sirloins they are genes but the also make prolines that is what genes typically make r record and then those preachings take care of the body in many different ways as we have discussed how do you turn on these genes and make the prolines they make even more active your rive up that siren exercise will do it fasting will do it what about supplementation while the first active actor all the curtains that we discovered that acts on the ends ism to make it do a better job if cleaning up the body in protecting was the resvertral we looked at thousands of different molecules eventually tens of thousands and the one that was the best was resvertral in the edition than we gave it to little organisms worms and then a flies in mice eventually humans i we store that it activated that inside rest ventral is one way to activate you can think of it as the accelerate a pedal on a car it ribs it up but there is something else that the sirtulones need to work and that is an ad nadir a really small molecule little chemical in the body that we need for life it is used by the body for chemical reactions four hundred different reactions in the body in without it your dead within seconds you need an ad the problem that we have seen is that and levels decline as you become or be as you get older if you do not ever get hungry and the body not only does not make enough of it it is shewing it up as well there is an endrin called seedy thirty had that epic verde however a you we as e showed choose up was ow the bucking issue in californium choose up an ad as you get older such a double was you do not make as much chew it up which is really bad because what we shown in my lab and of others is that any de levels are really important for keeping those or two in defenses ad useful level and you can give a lot of as ventral but if you do not have the fuel your only you physical accelerating a color does not an of gas s you wont to do both and that is what i do i take a precursor to an called n amen and the body uses that to make be an ad molecule in one step and i know from measuring dozens of human beings the if you take an amen for the time period that i do i been taken if he is but if you take it for about two weeks you will double on a redouble your an ad levels in the blood ay that is not public information that is from clinical trouble that are not yet published or the last two years there are other ways to increase in ad levels in some one me who is getting older fifty two now you can take n r which is used to make an a men which is used to make in ad an both an amen an an our soul by companies a in the us an our is lacks the phosphate a foliates of small chemical the body needs probably heard of the atom phosphorus i let us go back one step had you make an a an a gets made from vitamin be three often i you an also find it in milk another foods but sometimes you pills me when do not you just take item in be three and will not that just force the body to make an d and the answer is no it does not work very well we know this just by doing the experiment but the reason i think is is that and is a is a i said it is a small molecule but relative to invited in be three it is be g it is got those phosphates on there it is goatish sugar a it is got the the sidemen b attached see what always components that come together to make this very complicated little moleculecled ana d and you when you give name it contains all three components that the body needs to make an ad if you give an a or just by tom an be three which is an even smaller molecule the body has to fine these other components from somewhere else wed ye get spat well body needs it for d a needs it for boys his doses or something that requires additional phosphate a makes me a little concern and we have compared semen an an our head to head in mouse studies a for instance an semen were shown in a sell paper for nicer makes mice run further old mice can run fifty per cent for look as they better blood food better energy in a the same dose did not do that infactit had no effect i see but dosage wise if i were elect to take ataman an supplement form to increase my any d levels and result slow my aging how much enamel should i take what is the protocol that you do am and are the various forms that are out there are some better or some worse well ism always having to tell you what i do in what my father does my eighty to your old father we we take a grab of an man every day such a grammarversfor at all and a graham yo an man it o a thousand movers now another another important point which is ism not the same as everybody else have different my commit age sex i and i have bee measuring myself a and i know if somethings or i think i know of something is making me better or work based on measuring forty five different things just want to be a people to beware that what i do may not perfectly or work at all for others but i have studied as i a demands of people wo take ataman at a gram sometimes two grams and i know by looking at all those people that without any exceptions that if you do what i do your and levels cot up by about two fold or more a and i do that every day the thousand milligrams now people sell it i i never get in to brands an all that first of all don't have the time to measure products i do not know the i should say i do one to say i am working on a solution for people to know what what works and what is real and what isn't but ism not there yet and in the meantime i would say if you do wane a bide this let us say one taste an man look for a company that is well established that has high levels of quality control look for three letters g m p which is a good manufacturing practices and it means they make it under certain level of quality control you not an a fine iron filings in there and it probably has the stock in it that they say it does but that that is the that is all i can say right now i surely something is to be much more helpful but i over all make shorts white crystalline an a man and t t to me it taste burnt rockoon you crack open the capsids and you take a lit sample to make sure taste work poor well when i when ism making my capitals all taste it and a i do let a cavity control in the stuff that i take do you take that graham all at once with the resort all o you take it spread throughout the day it is a all in the morning for the for those things it is the it is if i take my formant it is ana man in there isvertral altogether and there is a good reason for that i it is all scientific i try to be i the levels of and go up in the morning in our bodies naturally our bodies actually have a cycle of any it is not steady it is circadian it is radian in fact and controls your clock this was shown by shin and i and colleagues and as nice since paper at a decade ago that if you destruct the and cycle which is control by the virtual get that we worked on that is what is telling your body oh it is time to eat it is time to go to sleep and if you take the the any man late at night for example you can disrupt your circadian seems interesting conversely when i travel and i want a reset my clock to the times on i will take a loose i of any man in the morning and i feel right does it this photo call for you om does it produce i any immediate effects of increased energy et camera you mention it that i one would if it is right for them would have to take it for at least two weeks to start to see the and levels increase at that point when a and levels increase ism could one possibly expect an increase in over all energy focus et camera u i realize were not making promises here but ism just wondering whether not the only measure of whether not this protocol is working is whether not you die at age blank or blank plus twenty and of course once that once your dead you you cannot really know if you would have lived longer if you done something differently and vice verse for we that there as a study again by shin an i my good friend at washington university in saint lot that om show that improves remember this insolent sensitivity i which is a good thing but you cannot know your intellect creativity unless your measuring a clucks have a clucks money on your a have one on to no no no i used to i learnt la last time i did you had this thing it it looks a a small leech not a large leech and there is measuring your blood cutups the very informative because you learn what your body reacts to and grapes were really bat rontipatric i agrees with that but do the the issue was was what we were we under the issue is whether not you can expect any immediate effects on energy vitality focus any just even subject as h what y feel is the question and anecdotally cause levin taken this for longtime if i do not take it i stop to feel fifty years old sorry a my con things straight i it may may be posing but who knows but what we doing now a very careful clinical trials we done the safety for two years and we now treating elderly patience at hovidmitical school with some wonderful colleagues and those people are actually going to be and only in marines you can measure the energetics and he the ready levels in their legs as they exercise in rill time and that will tell us if what we see in the mice the increased endurance actually works in the meantime it is for to talk about anecdotes have a number of athlete friends some of which have increased there laid the time in marathons for example is a good friend about a i now circle that is winning marathons at age fifty now an my attributes that to the puticolities on sing i have not started taking animal but i planning to do that a when my nextberth dey areas which is in a couple months but i i do experiments and my sister and have for years i have a sisters am three years older than i am who a is very enthusiastic about these protocols and it'll tell it you that after reading your book i started purchasing for her in giving her an animal supplement and she claims and i believe her am she has quite pensive sister s she is ready tuned into it she feels am far and away better when she takes it as suppose to when she does not and have done the control experiment of removing her am her supply and then giving it back to her in this kind of thing am that is my other laboratory a is is what younger brothers do to older sisters i have a question about something that if it has no relevance we can just a treat as a speed bump and then move right on in the the artificial sweet nurse these things that were i i wishes a non a glucose increasing sweet nurse ay you got stein which is a a plant basically and then you have got solos and aspertaimen all these things there ought there is some evidence that en no we are both aware of the been publishing quite reputable journal showing that they can disrupt a the got mycrobiom in certain cases in particular macron the one that basely nobody uses any more a and it is questionable as to whether not stein as the same negative effects et camera that is not what this is about but in terms of the sensation of or the perception of sweet taste is is that itself a possible detriment to these am prolong levity for give me for using the term that am a pathways if if i were to drink a die cox during a fast in my somehow disrupting this and ism asking this question because i get asked this question a lot well that there may be small effects i do not think they are worth warring about a organ last of means i was drinking a died cop during the first intoguige with him a i will drink dit cop a have read the sciatica literature and again it's this five per cent thing that i think is blown out o proportion if i was to put a a number on it i would say if eating a high sugary me or drinking a sugar filled soda what is that thirty grams of sugar let us say that is a that is a tain at a ten bad for you i died cot might be a one and if ism u not which you mi going to do i could have a a ten or one or go without in my life it'll do the one on occasion i try to avoid them because i do not the ones as much but you cannot say that scales is equivalent to drinking a sugary soda is just no comparison and i think suit what is at stein i do ustevia whenever i can because it is it is a an naturally sauce product and have not seen any good evidence yet that it is bad for you but i think a lot of this is is overblown and a lot of it is that the media trying to give equal weight to stories as is a scientist it can be frustrating when something is attain in something to one and they are quoted how do i say this respectfully i think if science journalists were a required to post their credentials alongside their their name people would take the articles an to with a additional grain of fault i and in other words that i think that most the sins meets mainly generate around two specific gulls one is to make people very very afraid were get people very very excited and oftentimes the the get people each departed sponsor content and i think that is overlooked in any case a thank you for that i want to talk about iron an iron load we were talking earlier about triton and of course women men state am and they their iron needs are greater than people men that do not menstruate were women that do not menstruate how don't thing we can get right own into how much iron somebody needs because your very person a person but i was surprised to learn that iron is actually going to accelerate the aging process a in various contacts that this is new finding a knew finding out of spain general seconds lav has found that excess iron will increase the number of senescent cells in the body and sennessencells of these ombycells that accumulate as you get older and they sit there and they cause inflammation mainly in a can come cancer and it is found that if you get rid of these cells or never accumulate them a you stay younger in animals and was some really interesting studies out of may occlinican humans as well iron is a prosenesson a metal hand's what i think is that if your taking excess iron as a supplement you probably accelerating your aging process the other thing that i found really interesting is i have looked at hundreds of thousands of people s metabolism and their blood by your markers i i ways one of the first people in inside tracker is a word membrane ism the sold scientific om lead i i i can look anonymously at hundreds of thousands of people's blood work and we also know how fit they are how old they are i some of them marathon run an some of them are o cross fit and there is a signature of health that actually is different than your average person new ism no king to say bad things about eddies cause it blood my best friends are eddies d i work with them at oven medical school the issue to is that with em the training it is there is a scale of what is normal and if you are out of that normal range something must be wrong that is the paradise that they work under but for everybody's different you want to know the base line in track people of years to know whats normal for them an what i find for example people who are really healthy and leave the way i do and have a diet that is i fairly vegetarian but not straight i still have slightly low chemical of in levels slightly low iron slightly lid triton but we have surmounts of energy were not an ne make and we getting along with great in life but a doctor who just looks at that might say all we need to give you more iron what ism getting at is an example of we need to personalize medicine and look at people over the long run to know what works for them and what is healthy forgot them and not just work towards the average human but work towards what is optimal for human i of that answer i he you mention tracking and tracking over time and this is a really interesting area that i know you have been focused on for a long time have been getting blood worked on about every six months since i frankly since i was in college i justest i data and i i got interesting supplementation and exercise as it made me feel better but also wont to know what was going on under the hod is you get numbers back yet this form on that hormone this blood glue coast measure eecetera how do you make sense of the data i mean what inside tracer is doing aside how do you personally make sense of the data and ways that might differ from the way that a standard eddy might look at one of these charts because the standard practice is to say is it red yellow green i is it basically too high were too low is it somewhere close to the margins or are you okay are you in these rangers are there any things that you pay attention to that you think are particularly interesting for people to just take note of a men it were not asking to go against anybody's physician and but what sorts of things should people start to educate themselves about and terms what these molecules are on their charge if they choose to get them and what you wat you look at ye where there is a lot there a the first is that you should be tracking things because one measurement is not enough these things very and over time and you if you can have a debate or more of data it is superimpose infirmity as you no well now i as that the physician interestingly my physician let us take him is an example i he sees me he says ow feeling ism feeling great a case next year that is craziness any way sisal a stay let us talk a little bit about let me educate you that is what avid tells this pis ignition i imagine that the twelve year old davidson care says to citation listen let let us have a different discussion the or when it is he he finds me pretty annoying as to does my dentist but i say so hang have got this data have got the inside trackadatus i pull that up on the screen and he ism sure showing him my the change is in my molester all in my i see our pe which is in planetary mockers an we going through it you can see things change of time and and have corrected them as they go slightly out of the optima range for me which is different then what he would do of course but what was funny is that he says this is great i love this data but ism not allowed to get this because course the insurance companies not pay for it again you can pay out of pocket it is is not superexpensive i would say if you save a bit of money one on on a coffee i you can afford this kind of stay but the the main point is that doctors due this data it is just the then unable to spend money on every one of their patients to get it is there a cod word that some one can use with their physician that trigger of he comprehensive blood just i keen try to finger out what is the code i that one needs to ask there is tell their doctor ism feeling blank that they get a full blood panel wat well you have to be hameragin from the from we gat ears only well i usually use the w t h method which is what the hell and then he and the was acute will do it am s cause i think a lot of people out there i think and look i loved out blood work repeatedly over time but that is hard to get for financial reasons but also lopyou just do not know how to approach the conversation and this is one of things that i i hope that we can educate people on that they deserve to know what is going on inside their body and that et makes a doctors visit worth while and that you do not have to vein illness in order to do it right y and lord people do i a if y if you can afford these tests there are increasing number of companies that offer these tests insidetractor is one of them and you just do it a couple of times a year at a minimum and then you can shad that with your doctor if you can afford that then i would say to your doctor he are the main ones that drew an avid to et en we must and there is an meal that is something five five or a for number rather it is five five five five five five five i think if they have any complaints they can just call that am avid will pick up a o nice coastnot business harder it i li aver you hours h but there is the mainlines i would say a you blood sugar levels you want to do your h p when see which is your average clucks levels over the on this a see or p which i mention for inflammation was talk about a reactive bromine for a second cause i think on it is been shown to be an early marker of macula degeneration of of a heart disease of variety of different things swear p is something that we do not hear enough about i think maybe it what you know about serape that i do not i am guessing a lot but oh who as originally picked up as something that was associated with heartdiseas and the framing ham studyaply a it it is a the best mark of for cardiovascular inflammation and is also use it as a predict or of longevity and it is levels go up and with mortality and this an association but there is enough data that i would say if you have high levels of sip you need to get your levels down quickly and the levels usually go up with age and with levels f inflammation the ways to get it down would be to switch the diet eat less a try to eat won vegetables you find it will come down there also drugs that can do it ante clamatries can do it as well but say p is especially h say p as a highcensityve are your doctor will no get one of those readings i if you have got normal bloodshuga levels your doctor o fasting bloodshed levels a your doctor might say you find but a lot of people have normal bloodshuger it have high say p which is just as bad for you long the and can predict a future hart a lines of heart attack i want your thoughts on cluster all and serum cluster all dietary cglestera i can not for the life of me get my arms around this literature and even if i ignore all the essentially nonsense that is out there and very social media groups ta saying cluster all is t is the worst thing in the world or clesteral is not it or dietary cluster all has nothing to do with seem cluster all nothing to do with longer i i cannot seem to sort through the the very basic data that essentially ask is having high levels of eld ell and a kill me earlier should i be striving to always reduce el de ell an increase h dell is that a reasonable gold and if is dietary clesterall the primary determinant of that and just as a final point about this i am aware of quite good data that shows that in ataxia people that essentially no food unless you force them to can often have very high ell de yell other dietary cluster all is essentially zero and their manufacturing a lot of their own realize this is not your primary o tarry of expertise but your smart you think about this connistophal lot what do you think is going on with the cluster all literature and will we ever get to the bottom of this as he scientific and medical community because to me it is rather perplexing it is ah but you can you can get through the politics i know a bite about clestroas it it is in my family history and i i was headed for only death my grandmother had a stroke of thirty that is how bad i am in turns my genetics i went on a station and i know the there is lord people say that statant long turn a bad at my associated with without sames disease ah i have been taking statansincsels twenty nine and that is cause i forced my same doctor to give me the statant the conversation with something this you are too young to be on station what you want me to have have a heard attack for you give me something give it to me now o twenty nine of been on a stain a my clestrall was way up in beyond three hundred which is a massive mass out basically my blood was creamy to look at have not got my clesteral down to low low levels to what be go check on inside tractor but my erasure of achy el to elder which one be less than five is now too and the el feel is blow a hundred toll good and my have measured my cadivasco health with the maria a move my heart beating have still got a heart of a twenty years that is working am willing to forego the risk that the statant is causing problems later because of my family history but other people i would say y be aware that state's on perfect drugs there are some interesting new ones that one called the ps cabin in hitter which is a i think fortnightly every two weeks injection that blocks the release of o el been from the liver ah and then that seem to be great for loin cleestrall butt says other benefit is that might be prolongevity n there are some people at was just talking tor on the cutting edge of this and the doctors are trying them on this drug instead of the statant he could talk to you dock about do you avoid am dietary cluster all for that reason also read me butter at i havebeen a love butter i love red meat who i have realize her some wo who do not my cluster all will be high but i ism working to bring that down a bit a mom thou not my altering my food and take a yet a but what you think is the relationship between dietary cluster on seem cluster all and what is what is going on with the liver war an er exit yet the entire there a term cluster all high when there eating nothing the will have been a number of papers over the years that have being ignored and the our friend peter it is here a brought to my attention recently a new study that i think definitively said that dietary clestrol has almost zero in pact on blood clestrolevels good yer i am annoyed cause have been avoiding eggs and butter foremost of my life and i did not have to i had i have explaining you time n earliest in your case see that that is the thing you can eat these foods that will once man because the it is very difficult to to take celestial up into the body from the got and most of its being winterized in the body well ism just pausing there for second because i think that i it it is what we have been told six meals a day eat a lot of grains and fruits and this kind of thing i i a void molester all i mean easily everything we learned in the eighties and nineties and early two thousands is getting flipped on its head now i but and i think this is very strong carat that is important to mention a men acts in particularly you mean acids that come from animal products right seem to have some pro aging effect on them right at least the way that have heard you describe the your diet nim somebody who enjoys meat i it but ism going by no means a a vegan and at all but have heard you say you eat mostly plants but a little bit of fish or chicken or something of that sort of eggs or i but is that specifically to avoid excessive amenoacidintaker is at something specific about plants that that excites you with respect i mean vegetables are delicious too but what is is that something great about plants or is t something bad about when i think of meat i guess the biologist an methinks a men acids right i do not think topseroon i think a mean acid i think obsterloin as a meeting it but really what they are or a men acids including loosing ye we there are two good things about plants a and neither of them is taste for me i i would eat stake all the time if i could i did when i was a kid ism astrailian but plants of two benefits one is that they are highly nutritious and it'll give you a lot of the the vitamins and nutrients that i need i do not take a multifid him and i do not want have the excess iron in my body there is that identity nutrition or those dark leaves if it is a swinish said great i the second is that there is what called zero hermetic molecules in plants that terms in terminus is he term that i came up with with my friend code how's which means stress plants make molecules that benefit your health it'll break it down zero means between species and hormisus is the term whatever does not kill you makes you stronger and live longer and the idea is that when plants are stressed out think of a great vine that is dried out and the sine to house the grapes which is typically heated on they are full with resvertral because very ventral is a plant defense molecule that i think is made to activate those sorta gas in h plants o plants have sotulancs just leader but by in it purifying or at least concentrating in a like prove bottle in keeping it out of the air we stabilized this zinohermetic molecule or it is a cocktail not just one is others in wine we then in jest this and get the benefits of activating our own defenses because our food was getting stressed out and by street i do not mean psychologically street i mean biologically stress a and i try to plants that have gone through bit of stress they might be brightly colored that are too much sand g nibbled on by a caterpillar you go to places where it is organic or its fresh local and knows the plants that on perfect and they drably have high concentrations of these molecules and in addition i as o by the supplements to make shim getting enough r okas on which supplements mime that also as ventral will is another on called friction or croci in some people call it with you find in trace amounts an a apples and onions and we also show back into thousand three that it activates or turns as well but others of twenty years late found that it kill cinessencells or helps kill cinesencells o it is a double warming with that molecule and are you actively picking out the peaches that look they were nibbled on by a caterpillar no but a i do not worry if they have been banged out a bit what is the story with anti occidents are they of any value whatsoever because the way that you described them at the beginning an what have heard recently is that they are not all the rage for am anti age a what are they doing that is useful should we be seeking out ancioccidents any way for other seller health purposes well you antoccidents not going to hurt you unless you take makeadoses we do needs some occidents for our in system and there is even what is called my to horses which is your mighticondria poppa's need have a little bit of these free radicals to be old a function a you do not want overdo on these antigen specimen see vide human e do not overdo overdo it you do not take a multivitamin correct right i think got in to stop after this conversation is have always just taken what for the kind of insurance purpose which is a stupid purpose am i not actual insurance but just thinking a you all cap we all top off on my c b d a no it'll pe out what i do not need assure that never bothered me the whole expensive eating never got that is a that is a that argument ever got me as a that the good widen is not that expensive am i just figured better safe than sorry but it may be that it is detrimental well it it can in the case of iron as we discussed an the antlions when i came into the age field and the am early nineteen nineties it was all about antoccidents we thought that entire by the name of catalyst and suproxid diskette whether can be the key to longevity it turns out that at it is largely being a failure that giving animals a and ants humans antoccidents haven't had the on levity benefits that we dreamed of and the main reason is that there is a lot more going on than just are radical damage a the epiginom gets de stopped we got these preachings infolding the problem really has been that we did not realize that you need to turn on the body's natural defenses against that plus a whole host of other things to get the true benefits but not loocinsates a problem taking it in our an antioxidant drink pomegranitiues for one is full of good stop including in o hermetic molecules but resvertral is a good case in point which is when i worked on resvertral as a on levity molecule first we showed it in east an ocean flies an mice a before that it was thought the resvertral was good for your heart in red wine when you drink re wine because it is an antioccident then we showed that it extended the lifespan of yeast cells through this a genetic pathway the sortuans and we then tested whether is ventral if we change one ate to make it notinantoccident guess what it is work fine it was not its antoxiden activity that was extending life and it was its ability to turn on the yeasts defenses against aging conversely when we gave the east antoccidents they looked shorter yet that was the beginning of my transformation in thinking turn on the body's defenses do not give it the antoccidents this is a an opportunity for me to say something give been wanting to say for a long time which is that that what wonderful about science is that because the goal is mechanism you can really start to understand as you just described what what actually mediates a process is very different than what modulates a process i man a fire alarm goes off in the building right now it is going to modulate our attention that does not mean that it controls our our attention it is not mechanistically relevant and i think this thing about andioccidence is one of these cases it sounds where it is in the right ballpark but until one really unveils the mechanism as you have you can be a one can or and a field can be badly wrong for a very long period of time am it sounds the sultans and really getting down to the the got of the machinery of what causes cells to ages really what it is about fuming way out what are the behavioral tools that one can start to thing about interns of ways to modulate these eh basically the way the dona is is being expressed and functioning have heard you talk before about a harness of other sorts cold exposure a we talked about fasting we talked about exercise in broad terms but what about a any evidence if it exists as to whether or not aerobic training verses wait training these sorts of things am in other words whatever the sorts of things that people can do to improve the organ pathway and a i realize that the caveats we cannot go directly from a behavior her stuns but in the general theme what what can people do what do you do right when we know that that erotic exercise in my sand rats raises their into levels and and the levels of sir one of the genes goes up to too actually number owning of the three whet we do not know yet is what tight of exercise is optimal to get them to change we will learn we are doing work now it is re sealed that were doing work with the military in the us to try and understand that kind of thing and it'll always tell you and the public when i do not know something o joking extrapolate but what do i do i base my exercise on the scientific literature which has shown that maintaining muscle masses very important for number of reasons the two main ones are i you were to maintain your hodman levels ism and older male losing my testas iron and muscle mast oof a time and by exercising i will maintain that and have in fact i i i probably have not had a body this since of twenty that is one of the benefits of having the life time start inter are we didn't episode on hormones and there are data in humans that show that there are some males in their eighties and nineties where their testosterone is equivalent to the average of twenty five and thirty carols i can get you that information is really impressive studies math unfortunately did include a lot of information about the lifestyle factors et camera but this idea that testosterone goes down with age a it might it might be the trend but it is not necessarily a a prerequisite why i i believe in in naturally increasing and maintaining these horseman levels and have been measuring them for a long time and i could see for me my tests tosstory levels was steadily levels were going down and then he got tenure and they went back of no a actually became complacent and and a it was the worst actually my age changed in their down direction after that si was relaxed interest and not wide about the future ah but then i got serious and actually according to the inside tracerald anger them but my age down from fifty eight to thirty one in matter of months that that was a big drop i have been getting steadily younger of the lost ten years according to that measure went the blood ten what about estrogen because women are different in the sense that they do a the number of eggs that they and the ovaries change over time right a do you think that they can maintain estrogen levels at ain a over longer periods of time in using some of these same particles well the i get into trouble from a sudden university when i talk about this too much about estrogen just about fertility and long story that if i if i i d only get too much into the anecdotes but it'll tell you the science which is a that if you take a a mouse and p ut it on fasting or cleric restriction for up until the point where it should be in fertile that is about it at a year of age mouse gets and fertile female mount due to due to fasting er l you o simply to ahead you to age a you to aging the fasting it is it is not extreme fast is just less carry on it then you put them back on a regular food and they become fertile again for a many many months afterwards the the effect on slowing down aging is also on the reproductive system interesting and that i would not sit and h women i would not think that they should becomes to basking to try and preserve fertility that is not what ism saying but these pathways that we work on these pertains are known to delay in fertility in female animals casing point o ism one of the lead authors on a paper when we used an amen remember this is the gas the fuel petrol for the ruins we gave old mice a one group of mice was sixteen months old remember they became fertile at twelve gave them an a man and think it was only six weeks later they had offspring they became fertile again which goes against biology it takes book but you which is that female mama's run out of eggs turns out that is not true you can red duvenate the female reproductive system and even get them to come out of malsupoes as we call it that is a only paradise in myology as well that superinteresting a are it interrupt you but ism am reminded by a set of of a set of studies that were done by your former colleague sis there no longer there avid he on towards to weasel by scientific great grand parents one the noble prize for discovering what are called critical periods this phase of early development when the brain is extremely plastic and a big part of their work was to show that after a certain point the critical period shuts down a scaly the brain cannot change were not nearly is as much and then people came along later and show that you could open up these critical periods again but very briefly and if you takes a very specific stimulus essentially high degrees of focus et camera however there is a well known phenomenon in this literature where if you take an animal and to some degree this has been shown in humans as well and you let them pass through the critical period but then you essentially century deprive them you take away experience you close both eyes you essentially reopen the critical period it seems ai could not help a mention that thatcher's this parallel o between what re tore you here with fertility and narrow plasticity where yes there's a a timer where certain things are available to the organism early in life and then they tend to taper off it is not a open and shop it they taper off but then a deprivation can actually reactivate the availability of that process a forgive me i just could not help a mention but it to me it the to the of those things are associate with youth fertility and or plasticity and i think that i it be interesting i love to collaborate with you on this to explore how normal plasticity might actually be regulated by these things the sir turns i and and the tertuents do control memory a in in neurons is well what i think is really interesting is that what wear learning from work that you and your colleagues have done and in my life is well is that the body has remarkable powers of healing and recovering from illness and injury and what we once thought was he one way strait and just count repair you can get over these diseases you can reset the system and the body can really get rejuvenated in ways that in the future a wonder why hiding work on this older i the the future of humanity is more us going around dead pool well probably be cleaner and a one smell is badly but dead pull if you do not know can get injured and just recover it is very hard to injure the sky a and we can be the same there ware many species you cut off the limb the limb grows back salamanders or ye yet we are now learning how to tap into that system and in part what were doing is reversing the age of those cells and telling them how to read the genes correctly again reversing the age of that epiginon a we do that the sells the brain for instance of the skin we did the optic nerve the is talk about this results for a second then i want a mature that we return to some these behavioral protocols ye this amazing paper at the end the last year cover article full article in nature showing that essentially a small men you of transcription factors which control gene expression et camera could essentially reverse the age of naans in the eye and and rescue themselves against damage i essential alow blind mice to see again and offset degeneration of these retinalcels incredible paper om and such a a a boon to the field where is that where does that stand now interns of human clinical trials om it how would you would you envisioning in terms of the trajectory of those of those day or from mice in to i into human some day i well to to get to the point immediately a were going to be testing the treatment on o monkeys a is just for safety reasons a and then the first patient should be don some time in twenty twenty two only twenty twenty three in we on try to recover blindness in this involve making an injection of a of avirisinto the eye right the ray now there is noway that i am aware of to manipulate these clench cripsthan factors through a hill or or some other that is what we working onion my lad at hazard right now it will replace you convention of church critic only up pill in the whole body gets rejuvenated by twenty years that is what were aiming for now we do it with get therapy in the eye and other places ah going the i yes it is single inject sign the genes go into the get in a and we can turn it on with the drug coldly cycling and we do that in the mice for four to eight weeks the the eye gets younger we can measure that o can measure the clock hand then the the vision comes back in those mice and i do not see any reason why it should not work in people because it is the same structures and mechanisms that are on in the human is well now the end it is one injection it is is imagine at injections into the eye obviously nobody should do this outside of a homology clinic and there destiny by an opthomologist but am h the injections intone there painless had done correctly by the right person it sounds dreadful but it is actually have seen it done hands of times have done it thousands of times and it is ah not to myself but at other creatures and there is a way of doing this as completely painless to the person under fix it is a tiny tiny needle to but the great thing about this is that it is a one time treatment those genes going to the back of the iron stay there for ever and you can just turn them on whenever you want what we found as you can turn them on in the mice they get the vision back and then you turn it off again and far many months out the benefit as remain but if it does decline we just turn it back on and reset the system rings repeat one day what is exciting is that we could potentially do this across the entire body ah and just take this antibodies there five weasand go back time and time again in thinking about the body and what is going on under the ism amazed still that there is not a simple affordable technology that would allow me to just look into my body and see whether other any tumors growing anywhere it it is not that horrid to look into the body men that the technology exists why why has not anybody created an at home or suit at home solution a clinic where you can go and pay fifty box or a hundred box and see if you of any tumors grown let's it is still expensive you can get your doctor to try or get you in as some companies that off e blood test that look at circulating de in ay they will measure it we getting there its still pretty five to ten years away from being really cheap a you can do things a colincansor test at home i think it hands something dollars you you ship off your ship ask use my language and they measure it and the they tell you if you got concanciler with high probability i did that during the pandemic because i did not wont to get a colonoscopy is it more accurate or as accurate as a kolonosk i believe it is close to being is accurate the downside is that during a colonoscopy they can pinch off the pullups that are looking dangerous is this obviously is not that abut it certainly easier to do and my father who is a station tells me that it is free for strains they get this test routinely interesting u i want a return to the topic that i took us away from i apologize which is behavioral a protocols you regularly do the cold showers thing ice baths cold water swims or you into that here is a a well you you do know that have done it at least once we dit it together that is right not the same baths just to be very clear same son a different ice path idea of saint care an superman taking ice bat together a it might warm some people's hearts but a wit just to be very clear different same ice fat different am different times ye thank you for clarifying aah do not do them regularly i i i do try to sleep cool i i sleep better anyway i try to dress without a lot of warm clothes ism here in a shirt and'smittle of summer chatting windmill try to wear bishop to to your challenging your system to the to regulate right right have got this a hypothesis with gray cross we published what is called the metabolic winter hypothesis which is if you tens of thousands of years ago were either hungry or cold or both and we really experience that now and weary to give ourselves the the metabolic winter and part of the problem i think with the obesity em epidemic is that we are never cold and cold when you cold you after burn energy it may be only slightly but over the whole night if your little but cool you'll actually spend for energy i try to do that but ism not a big fan of cold showers the son i do not have access to my him as much as i did i but i do one to get back into it i used to do it regularly with my son and i posted on ins to gamone a that he could stay in there for fifteen minutes and i could only stay in for about three a it looks very short i i try to compensate with changes in my die and exercise until i get back into it you remind me of something that have meant to ask earlier that obesity reduces an d levels and accelerates again how i mean o peso the madness is that the the science is in in as it some ones carrying a lot of excess out of post tissues the subcutaneous and a visceral fat i but why should that reduce an ad in any ways that are independent of effects on gucks and instant if it you knows there something direct about white out of post tissue and the reason i ask this is not simply to dig in the mechanism alone but i think there really interesting date now that fat actually gets normal innervation i mean it is c it is a it is not just at it is it it is not just stored fuel it is stored fuel that is acting as an mendicant organ asantially i yet why would being fat make people a faster yes that is a question that it is obvious but few people ask it that is what makes you good scientist and that we do not know but it'll give you my best answer which is that obesity comes along with a lot of problems that i include lot of sinessencselves in fat if you stain old fat fosnessencselves it lights out and when you kill off this sells at least in mice and may be in humans it looks o the fact is less toxic to the body was those denizen sells in the fat are secreting these inflametry molecules that will accelerate aging as we no no you took about the curtains in an any a of we if we just look philosophically at why this would be the sultans only to come on or get activated when the body needs is that is under adversity and if a sell is surrounded by fat or contains a lot of fat it is gin a thing times a good does not need to switch on that is the evolutionary argument mechanistically we do not know but it could have something to do with the response to glucose which then responds to the surtungine but that has not been worked out very well and there is there any evidence that lept in this hormone from fat can actually om interact with the sultan pathway i do not recall seeing that mayest do a sabbatical on your lap and the that be a fun one definitely because lept in during development is what triggers the the permission for the hypothalamus after purity i yes is why kids that that fatal lot when their young and get over weight will also start going undergo purifying work quickly although they have reproductive issues later we ye we should study the hythalemus together the hypothalamus is can control the aging f the body the most interesting part of the bray et sure yet all if if you turn on the sort longing the surtungin the we work on in the hypothalamus hat actually will extend last man also it is been shown by dunctiancai o atalbona albumin sancta medic i few inhibit inflammation in the hypothalamus in a mouse it will increase or maintain the expression of what is called we an our age which is the hormone that he found actually controls along levity in the mouse in part and keeping inflammation down in the hypothalamus is sufficient to extend the last pan of animals and i review that pap or we nature o about seven years ago and that was the first demonstration that the hypothalamus is one of the leading regulators of the body's age i find this facing gan or age om for those ye or no ashy comes from neurons in the hypothalamus that then literally reach gown in to the petuitarian trigger the release of all the things that control fertility aluminizing hormone for the logical stimulating hormone et camera such a powerful set of means and it is never really been clear what at a behavior or level triggers the release of giant age om there is all the stories about sermons and timers an purity et camera but i environmental conditions and dietary conditions and behaviors that can control ganarae rules i think i is an incredible varia for for exploration have left to do that satanical by the way evocable a seemingly random questions but i cannot help but ask because one thing i to do as forage the internet for practices that at least more than a few people are doing and and then wonder whether not there is any basis for it a you mention methelation as a a detrimental process the way it disrupts the epegenom the the seedy reader to speak there are people out there who are investing dateline blue and when i was a kid i used methylene blue to clean my fishtail and i blowfish thanks i know you are inter aquaria also a different paras episode took about a aquaria but why in the world would people in jest dateline blue it meaning is their logic correct and or is that a dangerous practise i ism not tried one en jest dateline blue sounds i a bad thing to do it stains your body you seen ye when you up ye there was a some one in my at ah as a postal was using it to study a complete different process relate the blood rain barrier and muster inject in to animals and they would turn blue ut then again people in jest colloid silver you they will put in there there is as please people do not do this or if you do just do not tell me cause i will not it they people put it in their eyes and some people aurally stain their skin they a should become kind of at this silver purple brown color if they do it excessively ism inhere lot of crazy stuff out there a book what do you think they are thinking with this methylene blue thing or should we just get them to a good psychiatrist a i do not know ashore i think methane blue is found to extend the life and of some lower onanism and that is where it came from my recollection with the emphasis on lower word yes a smaller organisms a i think does not you remember ended skin interrupt interfere with city conceal activity and that is been my li lingering it ye we we need to look this open posted yoga we will get to the bottom of this but those bethels that is talk about the ye a those bethels have to be placed on the right part of the gene they get attached to the right gives and the engines and if you have a lot of methelation it is get a meson the epigene a smoking will do that a likevicsise or likwidstoff what you actually want to do as you want a measure it and make sure what your doing with your body is working how do that if you do this or that is actually helping and you can you can test your age i could take a swab from your mouth and tell you how old you are by logically and then we could work on twenty bring that down and textually there are anecdotes now ah that people are reversing their age by a decade or more just by doing some of the things that we have talked about and me other cutting edgestoff that a ism get t ride about a but yet but you have to measure stuff that is did not want to forget to bring that to i i measuring staffer the time i have blood tests your about this monster that stuck to my chest right now that is measuring myself a thousand times a second and i measure my biological age what is it measuring a thousand times a second most of this yea a also this this little device is stock here and it is for two weeks it you just recharge it will send it back gin you one it is got a body temperature movement hat rat versatility it is an hefty a a prove device it is not a toy it is not one of these recreation a things ah it also listens to my voice eventually'll tell me if i need a psychotic or it ism depressed ah it will tell me how i sleep obviously but when you put a that date together and it is individualized and anatomized if can now tell my doctor in real time if have got a cold that needs an antibodies or its just amorous a if i am ism suffering from proven nineteen or even if a ism get have a hardtack next weep and these little devices i going to be with us all the time instead of going to your doctor once a year which is ludicrous i have to ask you about race of every time i go through the scanner at the airport i think saint care would never do this and the argument i heard you give about this before was a really excellent one which is that it is a low level amount of radiation going through with the airport but the argument as always was just as much as on the plain and your argument your counter argument i should say was well then why would i wanted yo both it i old when you go to the report assuming you are not running late and you have to go through the standard line what o you say to them and do you say ism avid saint care and then they a shuttle you to your own line what do you say yu'dyou say i do not this thing you have to give them a reason no you do not you can say i do not want this and they will get annoyed its hard for them to pat you down but you get a pat down in you your don as long as y u not in a harry it is fine if you want pay for the the a pretty in america the way to get around those scanners you can do that i travel a lot sot's worth it anyway but i i just go through the middle detect i do not get scan and the metal detector does not have the same i same problem what about exams at the dentist you well one extras nothing to kill you two's nocking o kill you but i roll kill you now ism just get i try to limit it because it is cumulative r and i went for or six years without having a dental early hand then my lost visit i just gave up is tired of arguing i dentist they gave me one but thou they have got led coats on and they put late of your body that is telling you something right there ah and funny enough my teeth had not change now you could balance that by saying well one ex ray to exrethr extracts worth if i have cavities and that is true you anta now it is in there ah but doing it regularly for me i do not think was worth it because to my teeth and perfect health and have always been do not have any cavities don't embrace as if i stop scanning me i man i know you have to pay for the machine but n to have a choice yes stop pressuring me you who shared your sentiments about exams and the dentist in general my apologies to the dentists out there was the great physicists richer firemen am this is a story about him that is not especially well known but he had very serious concerns a health concerns about extras becomes he understood the physics you understood enough biology that a he was actually quite vocal about his am dislike of dental technology and it is dangerous and a he talked about some of that people can find that on the internet am if they speaking of people who are firemen who been engaged in public discourse about science a one of the things that i appreciate about you in fact the way that you i initially came to know one another is through your public education efforts a obviously were doing this podcast you've done the yourogan podcast likes freedman pot freedman's podcast me likes some still adjust in that let freedman podcast many other podcast you are in amazing book what do you thinking these days and terms of what the world needs in terms of education from scientist education from eddies education in general as it relates to these things because you i think if nothing else twenty twenty revealed to us that there is a gap there is a gap and understanding and that the scientist too are guilty of not knowing what to do with all the information that is out there on formatter elsewhere just am an would you thinking for yourself and in general it'd to just know what he think the world needs there may we can a recruit somewhere o public educators you we we we have gone from a time when you and i were in college and young professes were the only way to get our voice out to the public was either through newspaper or a very short radio intovieu a which for me was extremely frustrating particularly the newspapers and my topic every time was twisted into something that was not just embarrassing but how a university used to bring me into the back office and frankly resign how did not you say such a thing organ i lived on i did not say that we are now also in a world where or overwhelmed with information and most of it is wrong and any one can pretend to be an expert we have gone from early days o now the future and were experiencing it right now thanks to guides you people you is that the expert some experts of the a small number who are brilliant good communicators are talking directly to the public this is never being able to be apostle until this time rite now another five ye is from now and suddenly by ten years i would hope that there are trusted sources of information of people who not just communicate the ideas directly but are able to talk about things that are going on ther'rearonot even published yet to say he is what is really going on and this is what the future looks but this is somebody yourself who spent their whole life study a particular topic and knows what they talking about and this this is all is also something that i think most people do not know that we scientists if we tell a lie we burst into flames we absolutely cannot tell something that is untrue and to the best about knowledge we say it as it is because if we do not were beaten up and we we keeper out of the university s the people who survive to our age and ism a little older than you sufsivived bet longer but a lot younger inside the have to measure you with my doing e o a priding yo a little help fully not too much you measure that and and a well work on on your eating but this is really really important is that finally people your are allowed by our universities to talk to the public i used to do it with e real threat to my survival people would look at me always assailsmen es promoting this and that it was seen as a rule negative e finally t thing were in ta world where it is not negative any more and the pandemic showed that we need to voices of reason voice in the voices of fact that you could trust and i you can see the popularity of your photos show is that the public are the desperate for facts that they can trust was they do not know what to believe any more well i being completely honest what i say this that i followed your lead i saw you on the organ podcast and my jaw job is this is amazing this because a yet at other good scientists on before but you are you tender professor aboard genetics department a genetics and for those are you do not know a there is the hazard and of course hazard medical school and they are both excellent of course ah but is to the top top tears of a macadamia and i certainly understand what it takes to get there and survive there and to to thrive there it is a a game of pinball you never win ye just you just get o if you are doing really well you get to keep playing that is the truth in macadamia if you are not you stop playing basically but when i saw you explain what you were doing in a way that was accessible to people and also talking about possible protocols that they might explore for themselves to see if those were a right for them i was just a i was just dazzled and excited and i made every effort to get in contact with you and and the rest is is history but i think what is really exciting to me these days is because of twenty twenty and what everything that is happen and continues to happen there is a thirst for knowledge there is also this direct to the public a rout that you mentioned and and i think there is also an openness am and love your thoughts on this but it seems to me that there is an openness n a from t e general public about health practices that there are actually things that people can do to control their straits level to control the sleep to control their collesterall if that is what they need to do maybe they do not am and to oven control their life span which i think is remarkable and i know i speak on behalf of many people when i just i want to say thank you you have it truly change the course of of my life i would not be sitting here doing this were not for your example and i always say sin care many people have written books many academics have written books as you have but in terms of doing podcast and really getting out there with your message in a way that i have to assume raised your quarters a level and heart rate just a little bit a but you did it non the last i you were truly first man in and that that deserves a a nod and and have a great debt of gratitude to you for that thank you so shanks under you are a you've become a good friend and i ism superproud of what you have done in what you i know what you killer in addition to your book and your presence on social media in serum and twitter and appearances on podcast recently give notice that you have am open up a a sort of meal slash website that people can ask a accesscuse me to get some information about their own health and rates of aging a tell us about that and what is being measured and a what is this a test that you have been working on i secretly and now soon not surely ye will that what i want is is a critics or for the body to make it easy for people to follow their health and there is a number there is at as a biological age that you can measure unfortunately the test as many hundreds of dollars right now but a in my live we have been able to bring that down a lot and i want o democratize this test that everybody has access to a score for the health that can predict the not just the future health and time of death but to change it and ism building a system that will point people in the right direction and give them discounts for sudden things that will improve not just their health now but tend twenty thirty is into the future and we can measure that and very cheaply keep measuring it to know that you're on the right track cause if you do not measure something you con optimize it and this is the biological age test we have developed it it is a simple mouth swab a we rolling it out i would building the system right now and there is a sign up sheep use a lot of people want to get in line i go to doctor sing clear dot come you can get on that and you will be one of those people in the world to get this test and see what were doing o fantastic will people be celebrating their a biological age birthdays in other words if ism kindness if i could mate ism forty five right now soon be forty six but if my if i were to be lucky as to get my biological age to thirty five within twelve months maybe can help me do that do i get to celebrate a a a negative birthday absolutely n my plan is the those people who take their age back a year or more we think we can go back twenty years eventually they will get a but they cod for me and it is a negative bit they car i love it and t probably very little actual birthday cake being invested but who cares cause you are living that munch on is philistaviar that will be find and thank you for talking us to day i i realize i took us down deep into the guts of mechanism and and

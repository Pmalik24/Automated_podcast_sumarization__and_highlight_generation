there is a new religion in the united states that religion is secular leftism and that secular lefts religion demands the you not look at facts instead just look at the narrative presented and then believe it this is what the met movement was about it did not matter if you asked for anselary facts to support a contention in matter if you aren't even really doubting the contention you just wanted to evidentiary supportnote you needed to believe all women when comes to d i it is the same sort of stick it is uourspost believe that d i is good for business is good for everyone it has positive externalities intersectionalities same sort of thing these are narrative and the narratives must be believed the media love seizing on particular stories that they believe drive the narrative than ignoring all of the face that story in order to achieve the narrative to day's latest example comes courtesy of a terrible story out of oklahoma in which a sixteen year old girl who called herself gender non binary died her name was next benedict when apparently according to the media she collapsed the day after an altercation in a girls o bathroom at a public high school soshofs gender non binary declare itself declared and we hear on the show actually label people by their biological sex because that is the way that it works in reality but this confusion age died in tragic circumstance but we do not actually know how this person the one thing that we do know according to the autopsy now is that this person was not actually murdered in the bath room the original reports out of this oklhuma school is at this person had not altercation of girls bathroom with other girls and then was effectively beaten to death or least injured badly that the she then ended of dying the next day and he media ran with this story not only to they run with the story they used this story as a prop in order to push against too particular political elements one is hiarathik our friends over it lies of tiptoe whose great sin in the modern political world has been to take eclipse of the left doing things and exposed them to broader public view to just watch what people are doing on tiptoe and then say shall ceres what they are doing and ten people motive that is her great sin is damn her advocacy they hate it is the fact that people are doing something publicly wanting attention and then she gives them attention but from people who do not necessarily all provide a warm round of applause for all the insanity going on at tiptoe sop hiarathik is a is a person who is on the state wide library advisory board for the state of oklahoma and s this means the media are now going to try to pin the death of this person this this young lady next benedict they are trying to they are trying to blame this person's death on high because thyme been trying to blame pretty much everything on his for the last couple of years if there is a bomb threat at a hospital that provides quoting what gender confirming care which would be sex change care sex denial care is really a more accurate label for it because when you actually cut off people's healthy body parts that is a denial of their sex in favor of a subjective version of of gender they haven their head when the is a boy thread against one of those hospitals after his reveals what a accurate to at the hospital they blame it on kid when a girl gets e dies in disputed circumstances an noklohomiscuall the try dobla his for this and the basic ideas that she's a con quit sarcastic terrorist this is a term that they been using for hire for last couple of years its term the means nothing it is determine which they suggest that without inciting she is in fact responsible for incitements she is never called for violence against anybody but they are going to claim that she is responsible for violence that is done by anybody who might theoretically sea material that she post in clouding material of people woad publicly post of the material themselves she is target number one and target number two is a waw in the state of oklohama that says that you half to go to the bathroom at school of your sack you cannot be a boy and going tote growth bath from just because clam your girl and if your girl and you claim that your gender non linear you count walk into the boys bathroom and are using the carnal and the media decided that this would be an amazing case they jumped on it immediately national news when next t benedict die now they are lots of people who die across the country every day in the united states and many of them are cattily murdered ere not talking under disputed circumstances we are talking literally everyday in the united states many many people are murdered by the way just proportionately people of color minorities young black mails murdered just proportionately pity much every day in the united states gets zero media coverage because that would not promote the narrative that e left wishes to promote which is of course that pretty much everything in the united states is result of america racism because it turns out that the vast majority of those people are being killed are also being killed by other young black mails we do not cover that read again the facts do not matter only the narrative matters the narrative here seem to be one that the left could us and s they jumped on the

mention signing into law a bill forcing public school students to use the bath from associated with their gender assigned at birth advocates are currently closely watching several anti strands pieces of legislation actor benedicts name was made public a force who claim to be the mother of bennedix's best friend told ta local outlet the cause of death was quit complications from brain drama and that three older girls were beating the victim and herd after in the girls bathroom we are not linking because the story uses benedicts dead name according to freedomoklahomates on presently clear which pronouns benedict use o the story will refrain from using any pronouns at all for new because the again the media are not interest in reporting actual facts if you reave stories you have no idea if this person as a biological girl or if the person's biological boy by the way but again obscuring information what the media now typically good for its with the legacy media do according to ten vogue the anonymous force also ledge benedict could not walk to the nurses station without assistance n that the school did not call in ambulance while the school climate were unaware of the fight till informed by apparent tax legally sent by next after the fight to a family member began quite a got trumped school three on one had to go to the e a they would been bulling me in my friends i got tired of its bi pored some water on them and all three came after me school did not report to the police and his probably getting sued bandits grandmother sue also adopted backs brought next to the hospital after the fight then home again the next day next was brought back to the hospital and was pronounced dead so told the independent next was to speeded for two weeks from school on the day the fight also mention that next had ben bullied throughout the school year so everybody on left ran with the story the front page news across the country and then as it turns out this person may not have died as a result of the actual beating apparently according to the according to the autopsy the autopsy suggested the opposite according to you essay to day as police continued thursday to probe the death of the oklohomatine authorities announced of preliminary story showed the students as was not the result of drama they have not get released the results of taxi college report eve no information on whether drugs were involved or anything else hell we do know is that the autopsy does not attribute this to drama it does a matter the catizardy out of back the story army has lights in its already running because this is the way a legacy media work this becomes just another hate crime against person who apparently was involved in cold of an on going altercation with these the girls poring water on them they were beating her up and again bullying of any sort is truly terrible should not be tolerated at any school the attempt of the mediahover to turn this into a weapon against the basic idea that sex exists or against legislation suggesting that girls should be protected from boys in the girls bathroom by the we there is no evidence whatsoever that the oklahomalaw that says that girl should go to the girls bathroom is responsible for this is there evidence that she would a been much better off if she had started using the boys bathroom at the soklahomaschool an absolutely unclear one thing that is clear by the way is that actually the new story assuming this teen vogue that when viral after next death included allegation that teachers failed to summon medical care and that next was badly injured in the fight that she could not walk on her own police and school officials both said those claims were false in a statement on face book the jostle police departments had each student involved in the fight we walked under their own power to the assistant principals nurses the assistant principals office and the nurse's office after it was broken up and a registered nurse than assess the health of each student involved in the fight she determined amulet service was not required but recommended the next visit a medical facility for further examination and next did go to a hospital that afternoon does not matter the story is more important and this is the pattern for the weft how many race stories about supposed systemic america races o by police have turned out to be just lies whether i is michael brown whether it is train martin the suggestion of which was that he was beaten to death randomly by a white hispanic whether it is that the hands up do not shoot narrative of michael brown what whether it is the whether is the gorge flood supposed racial killing that provided zero evidence whatsoever that anything that happened was motivated by race literally zero evidence was even alleged or presented in sort in that case beyond which it is pretty obvious that gorge flood died of medical complications and that he did not actually die because of the miss handling by derrick shoran by autopsy reports it it does not matter once the narrative is set the narrative as set this goes all the way back to matter shepherd which was the chief case used by the gay rights movement a the way back in nineteen ninety eight here is a entire playcalled literary project that was base on the death to father heard was supposedly about this innocent hated gay young man in coming who is beat to death by a couple of a sailing arrow my kidney and mussel henderson who pistol wiped i with the gun and tied him to offense and freezing conditions and fire and sat denim on fire and this was the chief case remember because i was in schoolittem our member ones broke nationally and this story was treated as the evidence that a metric was a deeply homofolbic awful place for gay people and matter shepherd was case one e and then as it turns out virtually everything you knew about the case was a lie it turns out that according too a journalist name stepped himmannas who conducted thirteen years interviewing more than a hundred people at the connection o the case the actual story of the matter heard death had nothing to do with him being gay in fact women as found that shepherd was addicted to this according to the guardian and dealing crystal method had dabbled an heron he took significant sexual risks and was pimped alongside ere n mackinney who as one of his killers with whom he dad occasional sexual encounters who is each ivy positive at the time o his death cement says at this does not make the perfect poster boy for the weight's movement matter's

value of ten gran which they wanted to steal but byway weary is considered the most liberal town in coming employment is dominant by the university of coming they they just decided they ware not going to you knot actually pay attention to the story and this is how the media run their grift the media is populated by people on the far left those people on the far left have a story they want to tell about the way that the world works and if the evidence does not line up wit the story the just ignore the evidence they tell the story that they want to tell in pursuit of the ends they want to pursue

perspective is that the results of it are truly bad the cause when you lie about how stories actually go down when you lie about the evidence you and up making bad policy when you've ignoring reality in favor of a narrative you wish to tell about the world you and up running directly up against reality and this is true pretty much everywhere this is why yesterday and we are discussing bugle feminine and the moron who decided the policy making fourgougle gaming put in a bunch of parameters that basically band white mails from being generated under any circumstances send up with people typing in founding father an coming up with black female gorge washington or typing draw me the pope and your with an india woman great it the people who did that run up directly against reality now the danger is they can try to change reality to the media do that is what are our bosses in social media try to do as what members of government have tried to do historically try to change the reality around you incept into reality a narrative that does not make any sent but real to always wins is one of my slowlians folks reality always whin made may take a long time and may drive you nuts because they're gaslihting you they will tell you a story that is false and tell you that you noticing the story if is falsie's bad thesis again is why they are going after his he sis has committed the grave sin of asking for evidence of contentions and or providing evidence of opposite contentions but eventually reality does when and and now because everything moves quickly reality is winning faster tan ever and this is scaring the left which is why granmoff taken in starworts they are trying to grip galaxies that they cannot hold i it the they are trying to grip tighter and tighter the censorsupersume is getting tighter and tighter because as reality gets away from them they have to try to exert more and more control but it is not going to work you are seeing that most clearly with regard to what is happening in our colleges si mention this briefly yesterday but it actually is a quite amazing story male according to axis is the latest leave university to reverse its pandemic greatest option policy and well now again require standardize test scores to apply the a t or the a c t why well because it turns out that counts a to the idiotic narrative that your lifetime experiences are a better predictor of your actual success then a basic ice test which is essentially what the essay tear the cutis reality wins every time the correlation as turns out between essay t an a c the results and future student success it is actually better then all of the things that they have been saying are going to be predictive you note the student essays about your victimized childhood sales sat on thursday would resume requiring escorts of all applicants expanding from the say t and a c t to also include a p an i b exam rest cults dartmouth has now done the same thing at brown a commit brown is most liberal of all these schools they havebeen to virtual give been to virtually all the ivies of this point spoken at most them and i got tell you brown is just ridiculous brown it is developing an committee to create recommendations on standardizing testing legacy ad missions an early decision other schools hazard corneal and princedom are announcing extensions on test optional policies colombia went all the way columbine is made a permanent this it were nock an invest what is going to happen with those schools when i say that they run up against reality hears those can a happen with those schools the reason these schools exist is because they are credentialing institutions not because they teach you life skills you need not because they even teach you the things you should know as a good member of western civilization that died long ago the idea of college as a sort of intellectual breeding ground for good western citizens who actually know their a b cs that is gone away you are not made a better citizen by college in fact very good case or made a significantly worst citizen by college because college has now become about the college experience which mainly is screwing and drinking and doing pot now and your your sons away from your parents to go to all of that andthat is what people meanwhen they see the college experience they don't mean exchanging different ideas with diverse groups of people because that is not allowed on college compasses any more they mean the secs the alcohol the drugs effectively and being induced into a very left winged view of the united states in the world cay but what were these universities good forth they weren't teaching life skills i they were making a better citizen and if they were making a smarter anything that what were they really god for their sorting mechanisms we all know this it is the legal in the united states for employers to use cutest to admit you to employment it is made illegal by the supreme court back in the nineteen seventies there istle case in which they decided that i was discriminatory why for the same reasons that all the universities tried and failed to actually get rid of the a t ones t it turns out that whatever ice tests were being used by employers were deemed discriminatory because not enough people of color were doing well on them the supreme court simply said that you could not use them for employment that they were that they were violation of the civil rights act and hell colleges found way round that by creating these quad ice less which are the s a t and the a t and then they use those and the reason that the credential meant something is because that was the only way that employers cutelpyor smarternat the couldn't tell by your grades in school because you might gone to a crappy schooling getting in to ad a crappy school in that hard but they could tell by looking at which college you went to because the colleges were sorting you if you entity hazard there is they ninety nine point nine nine per centshot that you were a smarter person than a person who went t the local judo can be what happens when hazard gets rid of its admission standards then it is credential is no longer worth anything the credential dies now gain thesis not true for everything at hazard get that halyard's stem program still really good that suetruteht vast majority of colleges but a liberal arts degree which is what i paid for i want to u s a la i got a hollysie degree and then went to hard law school and got a lawdegree this any of that teach me out to be a lawyer not much maybe one year of law school is necessary maybe a year and a half i most but what that really said was i had a hijack and that was true for the vast majority people in a liberal art's college that was in ivy league and whenyou get ride the sea t or the a c t what happens you went up watering downterstune population that are entail is now worth less and remember the in the college degree and the the nature of the place who you get the college three has become more important over time as mornmore people have entered college used to be the just having a college degree alone acted as the sort of imprimis tore of ice because there is a time in a medical history were not all that many people went to college writhe vast majority people could get a job out of high school and then the federal government in all its wisdom decided that because people who went to college earned more money every one needed to go to college which is a tremendous logical leap that is really stupid the reason that people who went to college earn more than people went to high school is because again that was a sorting a mechanism and what did they do they decided everyone should go to college hell once you decide every one should go to college then the college credential loses its luster you have to keep putting upward pressure on the credentialing system now the ivy leagues mean a lot but t turns out that you water don the systemics in the ivyleagueston mean enough to nay have to get a post grad degree ill get to more on this in one second first folks i got to tell you i m exhausted because my little three old last night decided to get us all up at three a m which means that right now i am fueled on rage and black rifle coffee if you have not tried

black rifle coffee dot come made now get twenty per cents off your purchase with code schippiro that is black rifle coffee dock come protocol chipiro what is this mean it mean simultaneously over time mornmore people one gone to college and also it means unsurprising way that according to the walls jurel half of all college grads are working jobs that do not use their degrees we've credit entire scam credentialing system rooted in a bunch of bad evidence and bad data things act test matter or i say he's an ice he's done matter or every one should go to college no matter their intelligence level ow all these things are are not just propositions without evidence they are propositions to which there re's tremendous evidence to the contrary what is happening these colleges are having to re in states all of these tests now to fight back against all this it is also the reason why t by the way but democrats again have an interest people on lofts haven interest and preserving the narrative which is what you have jobidon trying you now force every one in the united states yo subsidize the let's been days fury majors of people who got twelve hundred on their essay t that is what that is what jobidon is doing when jocks about relieving student lone at that is what he is doing understand that when names claburnwhos jo bid's biggest supporter when he says relieving student lone that is not giving money away he is lying it is one hundred per cent giving money away and its giving money away from the people who actually have jobs to people will either should have gotten jobs based on their cronenthals or do not have jobs because they got a stupid credential to for ere to wat e to e new or yo o tee we e tat the people el beam able o ten e given a ta to o letters ten e ta given e e a a yo way get it is giving the money away but again this is going to come face to face with reality as well the college system is going to fall down there's a reason by the way why lot of blue color workers have turn toward the republicans are turning toward president trump there is a reason for that according to acids one of america most powerful labor unions has now reported its first majorsjonation to republicans in two decades after me ting with former president trump last month the teamsters give a forty five thousand dollar donation to the a an sees convention fun our the of c reports the reported contribution is not in indorsement but its a powerful statement from a union that has supported every democratic presidential candidate since algor it represents the teamster's first big donation to the agency since two thousand for why because the democratic party is built around people whom want these narratives around people who benefit from these narratives round white college educated liberals and around people who are interesting being told that failure in america societies result of america races in discrimination the is the entire democratic collision an o i don't that maybe truckers your people who work really hard every day and maybe do not have that college shagreen a work in their ass off to get you the stuff you need across the country every single the maybe they are not enamored or enchanted by the nonsense that is being pushed on college compasses and now imbibed wholesale by the media and promulgated wholesale by the government may they do not that very much and reality always wins and that's true whether you're talking about economics stand a bad from policy reality is always very very likely to win by the way where is america true growth going to happen the the the what is conman to break ne college system in the end is going to be tax not the neck brosewhere designing the fugal a i but the ones who arms the one to actually care about data right now the the greatest advantage the united states holds is in innovation this is who the america semi conductor maker nevidia is now valuated at too trillion dollars too trillion dollars why what do they do they design sophisticated microchip there are manufacture those those or being manufacture by teen s over an titan just another reason why the united states has an interest in a muscular foreign policy because for all those people who believe that form policy does not effect america policy if china takes titan and titan is forced to either destroy its microchips or turn them over to the chines government things are at t get very hairy for a lot of america directly and in terms of america companies in any case nevidia has reported sky rocketing revenues an profits from selling ships powering artificial intelligence nevidia is a massive success why because they care about results and that is true for any successful business successful businesses care about results d e i the myths of the left they do not comport with reality and because they do not comport with reality the left hates the reality but guess what the realities can win sooner or later e gets

very in comfortable position for labor labor again is split between people who are not wildly antiviral and people who really ha just and because of that the labor house of commons speaker decided to

we have all seen them when i spoke at oxford n cartridge the presence of radical slams upon you case soil is extreme and real there's no question about this and these giant protest that you seen three hundred four hundredalsand people in the streets protesting on behalf of compass that is why the house of commons is now running a preserve a fearful that me look at the size of these protest it is insane he is our people or protesting behalf the terrors from commission of the preservation of the terrace to class that is what is happening and the u c parliament is calling for it this is what happens when you ignore reality when you ignore the reality which the multiculturalism is a giant failure when you ignore that reality this is what you went up with and it is a disaster it is a full scale disaster a jewfish temp an b drew perky talk about the intimidation of members of parliament if we have a reason at the debate we had yesterday we will have exactly the same thing happen agave which is that members will not vote with their harts because they are frights and and they are scared here and what what do we expect he months have been standing sphere talking about the people on our streets demanding death to news demanding we have demanding into fathers as the police stay fine allow that to happen last night a genitival call for from the river to the sea bolissti will be the with projected onto this finding that that message says no due is welcome in and the state of his real in that land this is going to continue happening because when not dealing with it if we have a recon of this come the leader explain to me what will be any different and how will members tot with their harts an their consciences because too many will not at the moment because of the threats were receiving threats that telling us to leave this country in some of our cases and telling us that they want this or our families to be subjected to pain and to death this is what happens in a country that has completely lost its way and the united state s can lose its way in the same exact formal fashion when you decide to ignore reality this is what happens to you to as a country meanwhile join has now escalated sanctions on more than five hundred russia targets this comes amidst the reports of the murder of sexy nevalny mi assume to murder because i mean that is pretty much obviously the case in any case jobidon yesterday met with the widow of alley bivalve he said today met with dulia and dash navalnia elexayn of all these that loved ones to express my convinces for their devastating loss elexays a legs of close will live on in ulna and dash and the countless people across russia fighting for democracy and human rights afterward by the way he then walked out to a car those to take him to a different location and proceeded to call her poland ism not winning times ulna as seven poland is not even a russia name l the president of the united states has not been with us for some time also apparently when meting with donors jobidin called of ladder often a crazy so b here is what here is what see an an reported yesterday off script off camera and amongst friends emocradit supporters an goners as where president abiding appears most comfortable levelling some of his sharpest and most direct attacks speaking at a fundraising event an san francisco last night the president too me wit several of his adversaries including russet president later potent quote we have a crazy so b that i gotten and others and we always have to be worried about a nuclear conflict but the existential threats o humanity is climate he said a g borstal hes out of it he is hung about the dangerous of pout and he still talk about the weather's that it is the weather that is really the problem meanwhile fladerpooden who again is a canny political operative as well as a vicious dictator i he was asked about bison's comments that fine call me f craziesobe but i am kicking your ass evenleguided listen we recently to an deosony who pul prefer as the future present fifty nine states i set that we were work with any creciden but i believe that for us a russia widen is more preferable give would in case why is he doing that lives the speculation is that it is a stop essentially that he is reversing himself that really he wants trump is what the media one say the really really wants trump and that he is saying bison specifically that peoplewill vote against bison thinking that he is working with bid whatever the case may be the bottom line is the debit administration has slow walked a cranes beginning made absolutely in clear america interest in crane the first place which is undermine a lot of america support for u crane in the first place meanwhile the president unleashed some new sanctions yesterday they are on more than five hundred at targets apparently there said to be rolled out by the treasury and states apartments in full to day they come after the white house signal that the were preparing major penalties after the recent death of nevalny in a russia prisoners succoring to the new york times thus has been closely cordoning with rope in is efforts to cut russia off from the gloves economy this week the e nailed its thirteenth branch of sanctions on russia banning nearly two hundred people and entities that been helping russia picture weapons from traveling or doing business within the block now listen if it bid ones do more than this he certainly could he could be pushing secondary sanctions on major companies that are doing business with the ruffians he could be trying to put pressure on the chines and the eroneans unfortunately he is doing none of those things to again lack of clarity on policy from the president of the united states and this of course is leading people to think that there is no plan because their china is not according to jobidon according to the same new york times thaws been stumping consistently for support for the war in can quote the bid administration in european allies call president mouton of russia a tyrants and war criminal but he enjoys a standing invitation to the hallsopower in brazil the president of rails as crane rush are both to blame for the war that began with cassia's military invasion his nations purchases of russia energy and fertilizer have bored pumping billions of dollars into the russia economy and as we noted yesterday the secretary o state went to hang out with hula and praise him literally yesterday two years after the beginning of the war according to the our times puts not nearly as isolated as useofficials had owed rushes in gerent strength rooted and a supplies of land natural gas has powerday financial and political raziliens that threatens to outlast western opposition in pars of aria africa and south america his influences as strong as ever or even growing his grip on power at home appears as strong as effort as well the war has undoubtedly taken at toll on russia it is rest the country standing with much of rope the on north america and rope however there is lot of evidence to the contrary with china india brazil buying russia oil in record quantities now again this would be an opportunity for the united states to use the power of its telling industry in order to undercut the ruffians bud are they doing that nope because the environmentalist because the big threat is climate meanwhile the put pressure on place brazil not they were two busy celebrating when yo there boson are lost the election to glad de silva that corrupt oligarch meanwhile apparently the pentagon is learning new lessons from the war in crane and the thing that mostly learning that we spend a lot money on tack and not enough money on yuan actual weaponry according to the washington post the character of war is changing the lessens taken from crane stand to be an enduring resource the crane conflict is challenged consumptions the work become an antrissional slug fest with each sided tempting to wear down the other a model thought to be an acarnistics and stay pettyjohn director of the defense program at center for a new america security it is complicated along he believe in the pentagon that expensive precision weapons are central to wining america conflicts gupiaskited munitions provided crane have prove n vulnerable to electronic naming it is military his adapted by paring older in guided our tiller with censors and drones which can be used to spottargets an refine their shots they have also told people's stories in

they arable to map the journey of advice traveling across apart at a hundred and twenty miles per our and a reveals where in a patch flute to evade the defense again the america military is up is learning somethings from this battle suffice it to say however that russia far has survived if you are no more about the history of crane that ladder putter it as his rational for attacking crane we did we are putting out an episode of facts that goes through the entire history of you crane what is true what is not in all the rest when it comes to the actual situation in u crane however again it is jobiden's leadership that has that has been a failure here a cross the board is been a real problem what exactly it given the fact that the worlds on fire what exactly are democrat's going to religion going into the elect we no the answer this one the gone real li upon abortion there their latest argument with regard to abortion is predicated on an albata quart decision is supreme court decision ruling that embryos deserve constitutional rights in the state of albata which makes logical sense a if the basic idea is that life begins at conception and that is the predicate for albata law with regard to abortion than if that life is conceived even in a pitrodish than it still deserves a level of protection in the state of albata according to the washington post for patients and their doctors in retro fertilization have yet had long beenassociate with hope and reassurance for the future and albata seeking or providing in fertility treatment is now mire an anxiety that is because the albata supremecort has ruled that frozen embryos are children and deserving of life and protection which gain makes perfect sense if it were in a woman's womb the i would already have the protection of alabamalaw the only question was of its located outside the womb does it no longer have those protections the question really is is the definition of life locational or is it not just non a logical level if there is an embryo and it is again located outside the womb is it human life or is it not now again the entire precut for the perlite movement is that location is not the finding feature of what makes human life it is the is the prochoice movement that suggests that location is what truly matters right is why the protroice movement will argue the a baby who born it is baby but a baby still in mommy's tummy is just the cluster of selves an he pro life movement has argued whether it is in the stomach or out of the stomach is irrelevant the real question is the definition of life itself the albata supremecort last week ruled that frozen embryos are people and can some tons and some one can be held libel for destroying them the first of its kind ruling came as at least eleven states of broadly to find personhood as beginning at fertilization in their state laws that albata case focus one whether a nation whom is mistakenly dropped an destroyed other couples frozen embryos could be held liable and a wrongful death law suit the court rule the patient could writing it had long held that unborn children are children and that was also true for frozen embryos affording the fertilized beg the same protection s babies under the wrongful death of a minor act now again that makes perfect logical sense pep our trying to say that that is crazy i failed to understand how exactly that is crate the entire predict for the proline position is life begins at conception if life begins at conception and a child has already been conceived a human being with potential then that hold true re regardless of the location the courts that it applies to all children born and unborn with elimination is not the role of the court to craft to new limitation based on our own view of what is or is not wise public policy that is especially true here where the people of the take of adopt that a constitutional amendment directly aimed at stopping courts from excluding unborn life from legal protection now again that does not mean the legislature could not change its mind on i f or change the law to exempt to i f but under current law and its the job of the albata superemcourt to interprecurrent law that is in fact what the law says this has led to what democrats thinking is winning issue which is the suggestion that i f will be outlawed everywhere because if you are saying that you have to protect embryos the are conceived then what do you do with i f my own personal position with regard to i f has always been that you should in sept the number of embryos tat you are willing to bear to term that otherwise you are doing something that is effectively queasy eugenic that that when you when you create my seven human embryos and the you discard five of them that two of them can be implanted the only thing that separated the five that were discarded from the two the were in planted was your choice it was not the definition of the life you could pick one of the other five that also would have turned into a human child iaveseen people who are comparing to sperm are agdatobviously different thing spermonatone will not grow into a human and agonitone will not grow into a human a fertilized human embryo will in fact turn into a human if placed in the proper conditions an when say turn into a human i mean it is a human now it will turn into a baby if place in proper conditions the washington post of course is jumping all over this there lot f people i man know people who have used i f to conceive have offered money to help people use i f to conceive mi my only condition in in actually providing a longer or or charitable giving on that was my own pro life position which is in plantain even if it is more expensive if you if you want to implant to embryos then conceive two embryos that that is the proline position on this particular measure how is that make for awkward poetic sure because life always makes for awkward politics the reality is that the vastmatority of america are a in the in the fifteen sixteen twelve league stage with regard to where they think abortion is and is not appropriate that don't can their right lot people think a lot of things about morality that are wrong as it turns out however the attempts to to pain the two things can be trust once one the alabamistponcort is totally correct morally and legally speaking and second this can be politically damaging for republicans those two things can certainly coexist there a lot of things that you say that are true that are not necessarily politically helpful democrats are counting on that according to the medical association of the state of albata the significance of this decision impacts all alibi alibamians and will likely to were babies children grandchildren nieces nephews and cousins as for utility options become limited for those we want have a family earlier on wednesday bethmalysia partner at albata fertility had to call four for patients all the more schedule for embryo transfers in a few hours to tell them the clinic was pausing all transfers for at least a day or two the decision to cancel embryo transfers but to continue with other procedures planned egg retrievals was made under the guidance of the clinic labdrectors and lawyers the four patients will have to wait least a month for their next ovulation to start in embryo transfer now n was confident i guess at the at the clinic the if an embryo failed to thaw that they would not be held liable well that that that is a different thing i mean that again ism m confuses to why you ad misinterpret that idea for one a frozen embryo you unfreeze the embryo and it fails to thaw properly and unfortunately added that is not an act of of murder that is in accident that is it that is what happens with many human embryos that do not come to fruition in a hugenumber miscarriages are are effectively spontaneous abortions by the body again as allies and politics two things can be the at once the right position can be politically damaging democrats are counting on that full stop does that mean the and of i of know it means much more careful use of i of and serious thought about how many embryos ought to be fertilized in order to be implanted it will lead to fewer embryos being fertilized and fewer embryos implanted and also few embryos being randomly discarded already folks coming up we will jump into the vaunted benshipirosho mamba if you not a member become member use coach our check up to monfranalanuel plans click that lincoln the

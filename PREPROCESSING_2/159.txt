a few months ago somebody said something to me that i found humiliating that i have never talked about it not anybody not even with the people i love the most is is way to embarrassing it makes me once even to think of it but telling my love ones n my friend that is real life there a people i have to live with you and me here right now on the radio we have a different cold relationship front i can tell you this thing happened well is still riding around the city on this ponsilofolding bike which looks ridiculous and there is no dignity to it but it is handy to have a bike that folds up if you wave in the city it was may be nine p m i was riding home from work and was wearing a suit cause it been to work and that morning it had been cold i work coat even the now at night it was warm enough said the coat was unnecessary but it was just easier to wear the coat than to be carrying it is also waring one of those you knowthis a reflective orange and yellow vests i was wearing cause i had three bike accidents thinks to the fact that the folding by loses as grip on the street in the rain extra precaution seem worth i know i have gray hair at that point a neatly trimmed beard i was wearing helmet all in all i was a picture of fastidious care was going south and avenue be i was between third and second street i young women was traveling across the street not wearing a coat full of cheerful loose energy bright eyes she sees me on the bike i am this locked down button down helmeted overdressed gray haired man in a reflective best and is ha red master f tho thing she restore is do you fart out the front that's all she said do you fart out the front it was really kind of stunning as an insult its both incredibly efficient and deeply mysterious i soft even get what image she is trying to convey in a literal sense but i do think i get the feeling she is going for and it is not respect full it is kind of you fussy foppish over careful old man i can i say that thought she had she could a get that to herself i think all kinds of things about people on the street all the time i keep the thoughts to myself i do not say those things to people to their faces because they are strangers they are complete strangers they do not need to know but of course it is much easier to say what you really think with a complete stranger it a friends with loved ones it can be much more difficult to be honest sometimes right when somebody you really now you have some told truth that you need to talk through with them the math of figuring out win to tell them and what to say and should you actually get into it and say anything at all can be complicated sometimes you tell them and the two of you talk through and work it out and it is relationship changing it is vital it is important and sometimes annoyingly if fucking blows up in your face to want our programmed we have stories of two friendships and it each o these friendships one of the friends has something to say to the other something big and are to decide do i say to their face and each of the stories it make a decision and then that is actually when it gets interestedfrom w easy chico since america life on i a glass stay with us that o what a friends for i hardly what is for star to they with somebody who had something in my see talk through with his friend and rather than have the tough conversation and get things off his chest and come to some new understanding he did not do that none enol instead he stewed about it for years and then he talked about it to every one every one but the one person that he really needed to talk to if be had a corneal explains how that worked out for him the thing gave malice accidentally got stuck thinking about was a friendship break ut and he got stuck there for a long time eight years and then he took all those thoughts and did the thing that only informer theater kid would do he compiled them into a one man shew that is how i first heard about this story i went to we gave show one night because friendship is something ism stuck thinking about too i recently went through a friend break up myself gave the small time comedian lives in queens has a dayjob teaching kids how to it essays and he starts the show by saying he does not have any real friends what he has is a group of brows his word from high school and his relationship with them is very stereotypically pro it do lots of activities together much for its and plavidio games but never get into the kitty gritty of what is going on into one anther's emotional lives for example in the show gave described spending the whole day with his closest friend of the brows neck and then afterwards going over to his parent's house in long island i walk throw the front door as soon as i do my momsphouts me she was only got game you were just with nick i just saw on faster that i sister just had a baby how does i feel about being an uncle and i was what how does ink feel about being also ism do not make my entire life but i do not o how ink feels about any but have seen the way my mother and my sister hang out with her friends in the afternoon they get a cup of coffee at night the have a glass of one this is we they look at each other for them the activity easychother and for lost the activity's literal anything and for a long time truly handigotes did not bother battle but then on something hard happened and for the first time in his adult life gave me did more from his friends than just a good hang that happened is his mam got sick she checked into the hospital and for weeks doctors camp figure out what is wrong with her one afternoon gave leaves the hospital to go wack the family dog and it is his first real moment of quiet since everything happened he talks about this in his shew and i asked him about it said he tested neck to update him on his mam states and he responds by telling me she might be eligible for workers cob you might beagle to get some money for this and ism reading that text and realizing that that is not that ism interested in hearing about i just i was not asking for legal advice i was asking i was in my own way trying to get somebody to be a man with that is care or you are right ism here for you yea ye am here for you how you feeling you may be entitled to conga yes very silly no in fords and m i think i was upset that he was just con o miss in the mark on what i needed am and when he when he sent me the at it really may me feel alone it may me feel what if i do not have anybody the to be that in my life someone who just gets it without have not to be explained have you ever had that ah i had a best friend named him and we ere very very close and he was inn my guy for couple years and it was really special when gave talks about this in his shell this is where he pities from here it turns him to this long o to the only friend gave had ever had who would have known what to say when his mam got sick this kin named him we would broken up with years ago but still has not gotten over because of the abrupt away it ended it taunted him for years this is the thing ism going to tell you about gave one emotionally intimate friendship with another guy and the conversation they should have had the could have changed everything e in hi gave that him his sophomore year college at hamiltin poisha class gave noticed him right away because he managed to analyzed poetry and away that some how did not feel pretentious he seems sort of casually brilliant wen my after class gave strikes up a conversation with him they walk across campus talking him tells him that he played varsity baseball on hight school which is very impressive to gate because will he would happily accepted his fate as a musical theater nerd he still had not quite kid that straightly urge to good at sports him then asked gate but he did not high school and ism adman i was as in musicals i was a little sheepish telling him i remember and he kinkily likes up when he hears musicals and he is good i love musicals his what aveyou been in and i show telling him it shut of horrors in o coma in all restuff and ism have louver been in a musical you t the stuff and he is well i was in one show of junior of high school i was not giant all and ism all that is creepy i was in gosentelse who did you play and he was a i plates masters am all i also plates masters ans we have this moment were unlike just looking at each other all that is we are junior of high school play this the same character from there gave an him fell into that kind of all consuming friendship you fall into an year you and you have time for that kind of thing this new found relationship felt different from game's high school friendships he an him could talk about real staff that we talk family staff we tub but money staff we tack about the sacrifice a parents for making for luges go to college ye both us were on financialate both was count a had this chip on our shoulder we did not necessarily belong there and s we cant hade this understanding we just got each other him and gave old regularly stay up till for i am smoking cloves cigarette and debating the kind of staff you debated about in college e year ass this then timing voted gave to come work with him at the summer camp for kids with chronic illnesses gave joined him and found he loved it in part because one night at camp him introduce gave to another councillor hate gave remembers this telling him yeuregon love hate she is ark on a person him was right gave and hate talked for hours and at the end of the night they walked back to their bunks together and were doing this walk and it is very romantic and she connjust leans in and we kiss and some then con it goes off at lest in my brain words whatever i need tod do to hold on to this this is a real one the rest of the summer is dreamy but gave has to leave camp li couple weeks early to started teaching job in scotland he and hate stand tats the tall in contact all the time text mimalin sending poems back and forth but the more time passes the last into at hate seems to be eventually she calls gave and breaks things off gave was upset and wrote to him to tell him the news him responded saying he was sorry to hear about hate that he left him him and gave and some of their camp friends had lend a new year's trip to reunite net and breath but when they arrive it is not fun at all at least not for gate all he wants to do as hang out with him one on one and talk about hate but him an are not really talking the much why not i do not know yo a fell he was normally interesting spending longtime with me finally days into the trip him ask gave to hang out just then gave is thrilled i feels the trip he actually wanted to have is finally starting they go to a case now they walk back to game's department were gave starts making them the late night snack the i frozen beats a eagles something and i pretty the oven and him is sitting an my kitchen counter and he says gave life suck and then you die just out of the blue just at of the blue were in a hat senior my countries cilia staring off his lifesucxon than yo die and an i what is hat what do you think is going on i think it certain point is a part of you that kind in now thinks that i can happen before they happen and you are please anything else likenanananana preparing for him pack yeah he sparsely hate and i got together and we are not sorry wernackana apologize for this is coning what happened were together and you can t have to deal wit that that is what is gone on what do you say was mat i yelled is what you mean one an explanation you not think you ma have your coming across kind of your dislike what he talking about are there specific moments that you look back at differently i at him revealed to you the truth their makes you revisit me your visit the summer the staff party pictures of them hanging and the night of the saffpart has not en we like could not sleep and you nose pictures of them together and remember coning resuming in worth her hands a this is intimate a mara their hand her hand was kind of by his waist i s li you la too lo too lo they did talk to hate about all this she said she had gave but when she felt for him it felt they were beginning the big relationship of their lives and not what him tried to emphasize to gave but even with that being the case is pretty intents to say ism not sorry ye he really said that am i recollection ye he was just orris ism nocking us apologize a nocking ray like li gan a met guilt yea yet was dealing with a corporation that ceres your settlement but where no an admit any guilt an i con a septic waiting for him to be of i feel awful with that if help i think yea i to think there is a way he could have done that the did not and the friend ship this is like gave cannot wrap his head around why him did it in this way he could deal with the break up with hate here is a scrip for that kind of heartache it was games break up with him that really hurt because it was not suppose to happen some part of the friendship contract it felt impossible to square the coldness of what him had done but the guys gave believed his friend to be eight years have passed since then gave keeps expecting him to reach out because and game's mind time one who broke the relationship sit was on him to fix it but they seven talked about what happens he have tough him and came broke up years ago they would been engaged before that in gave show he tells the whole story how he and him met can't scotland why they sap talking and what he wishes he could say ted him now whatchim gave on state i was struck but not surprised by how much brains pace the sallstill takes up for him i know for my experience when an important relationship in plates detonated by one spec tabularly out of character decision of course you try to make it make sense but it is exhausting to try and put a puzzle together when you only a half the pieces eventually you have to stoplooking for those other pieces and make a new picture with the ones you do you that's what game's doing with his show an he told me for something more he wants him to see the show him can understand but all this was for gave and apologize for the way he handled game's feelings and then maybe he could imagine having him back as a friend the only problem with game's plan he would never actually invited him to the show how long have you been doing the show the first in of the show was in these spring to those minutes s you've been doing the show for four years e and you have never invited him through that whole time no even though you made the show for him ye i know it is on did you think that he knew about the show ye is presurely he knows about it why s moms on face book game's friends with times mam on face book him must know about the show because mams gave as good him would show up at some point and handful of times gully thought he heard times laugh in the audience it seemed crazy to me to put much time and energy and money he did not have into making something for essentially one person and then stopping short of actually inviting that person to see it it'll be honest if the thin gave complains about most as how men do not talk to each other about their feelings i just one to say do look in the me since he was never going to take the final step just invite him him sow i asked if i could do it for him after briefly panicking he told me to make the call to my surprise n games anxious delight him agree to come we were all set him had his plain tic get to new york gave had grabbed a caught at local feeder and started selling tickets for the show and then four days before the performance him e mails me at midnight says he is changed his mind is nocking to come he would realize what he signed up for find half way across the country to watch himself portrait as a villain in front of a live audience an thought why subject myself to that i call and vexed him but get no response and then him finally calls me back the night before he suppose to get on the plan to tell me his mind was made out as it happens him calls me as ism on my way out ism going to a birthday dinner werea'll see my ex friend for the first time since you friend up move a text a year ago and then refused to discuss what happens was nauseated at the thought of seeing er and yet i spend the better part of an hour pacing outside the restaurant trying to convinced him to see his ex fried knowing mind was just on the other side of the restaurant door i get why he saying no but i tell him most of us in this situation we just try to avoid our ax friend the best we can and occasionally suffer through awkward run ins until one of us moves away or dies but he and gave have this rare kind of special chance to actually gets him understanding and i tell him i hope he takes the opportunity him skeptical but the next day he necks me a picture from the plan gave heads to the theater early to get ready while i go collect him immediately i see ho i gave liked him much he is warm and chatty despite being visibly on edge him and i walk to the show talking about nothing trying to pretend were not strolling into a very strange situation when we find our seats i tried to talk to him about how he is feeling but he is distracted looking around trying to we if he recognizes anyone have filling happy to be here at o i now a a happy hes that i would use the work happy i would say this is its wert her o him spots games mom and then the show starts he gave begins the show greasily and right away there is some jokes that really hip for him a ha ha ha a a i wonder if gave can hear timslak on the stage gave tells lots of stories from their friendship painting them is his kind of buy comedy do if dead poets society were a buddy comedy the way i were takin english class why we just always praise whatever we are reading you do not put me the very fortune position f on it in ass doing a professor another banger from mill young a but him would walk in a poetry class was opinions ye on't'd just homes good disowns bad es the best thing of over the show is not having in at take town mostly about how much gave admires him and yet there are moments that are hard to watch while sitting next to him when abri counts the night net and break an him him clean hes as well kat i a together in we are not for it'd pinned a mike on him and the absence of sound coming from him during this part of the show as conspicuous it'd seen hours talking to gave for the story but sitting there in the dark of the theatre with him no matter what had happened in the past n seem genuinely hard to be him in this moment i do not think it'd appreciated the bravery all this required on times part gave finishes the show try pumpkin he later told me it is e best he would ever performed afterwards tineids a minute to clear is head he slips out for a walk while i stand with gave in front of the theater games in the middle of showing me the close cigarettes he does not smoke any more but bought for nostalgia's sake to smoke with him when him as peers arms open imposes gave into a hub he ma e h h we drive to the studio and get right in to it him said it was strange to sent the audience hearing some one talk about him knowing he could not respond of course it did not stop him from wanting to respond like get the moment when it is revealed that he and cake got other the crowd goes oh ha him goa h ha ha h ha that's why wive you buying either no one good to night sit the o city i cant noaplays always different in this is thesis a ai agree there is a difference the two resinous for a bet and pretty quickly it is apparent that him does not remember the rise or far of their friendship and nearly as much details gave does there was one part though that him remembered clearly him had tried at one point in his own way to make amends a year after their break up he would invited gave to a concert with music by the composer beard green which he chose specifically because there is this one song in that concert the men a lot to both of them when they were friends called the lost spring gave fry introduce the song to him in college when he took him to a green concert and then a few weeks later were up the three m plague that you games listening to classical music on the radio and the the song the last spring came on on the radio and i thou know we just contain stop talking and turned up the music and tether and listen to i but an his is just very special moment as i remember it this was a context him hat in his head when he reached out to gave thinking that maybe they could be friends again as let us go to this concert together it is this piece of music that as is deep residence for both of us i and my feeling was this is a gesture of good will of extending in all branch in gave said now and at that point was a balas in his court gave when you got that message from him did you see it as the all of french that him meant it to be i do not think i saw it as go this is him putting it everything on the table my perspective was o him does not one acknowledge the hurt he is cause he just once to be friends again without having to do anything si felt i think that perhaps my invitation to you to go that concert i think i was maybe overly relying unlike you should feel a sentimental about this piece of music as i do and connect it to our friendship as much as i do and without me explaining it i remember feeling the meeting behind this should be self evident some think titan gave seemed to having common is a kind of magical thinking him ad hope that gave would understand everything he was trying to express complicated feelings love and remorse and a stalag with what was essentially a link to ticket master gave had expected him to from comstyle ut peer unannounced one night at his performance without ever actually inviting him to a show or even telling him it existed it is each one at all the benefit of being heard without the burden of having to say anything at all the main thing gave one at out of all of this was an apology for how him broke the news to him about hate all those years ago he thinks of him ad handled it differently they could have stayed friends i know this is what he is waving for he is told me about but an hour of circling around the topic goes by before finally gave brings it up in a sideway sort of way i guess which refuse do you wish that it happened differently of course of course i wished at half it differently i would tell you a thousand percent i help bad about it i i tell you felt about about it but if i being totally honest i remember that conversation differently what i remember saying is less ism not sorry and more i not asking your permission but i what i did not won was greeted be e a to ma please on to this yet i mean that that is it is illuminating there was always a part of me that wanted you be tell me i think ism in love with her i do not k want to do and i it least maybe would have given me the opportunity to be time i do not want to lose you was a friend you are coming to me and i want you to be happy and it just what always was frustrating was it just you never it never felt i had the chance to be the bigger man that is fair a that is farrow ow ow no that is fair because you are right because because what i said and even what i remember saying you are right is it i si i n i guy to give you the chose yes to tell me now ye or ear to tell me you really do not want me to do this do you feel sorry about that tin yet a to what i do not but what i do not feel sorry for it is is the facts right the underlet and but what i am learning for the first time this that it is not it was not the facts no of course that was not that as ell and that is wait do you feel sorry but the way the facts came out well ye no knowing that that is the probably you why do you should tell gave that i just i did i think did not we you you don't say a words ism sorry no i think o but i thought i said that early earlier in the conversation but i am sorry for the way that i broth that use to you i really precise say that you him is have been waiting a long time to hear that i was surprised by how on emotional an aunt climactic the apology fell her him was say in all the words that gave that wanted badly to hear and yet somehow i did not feel all that much and i think that is because of this other thing that kept surface throughout their conversation it is one of those awkward things and seems borderline cruel to bring attention to but i be remiss not to ask nervously i do they think that i cannot tell is what your friendship as important to we him as it was to gave it was very important to me i i doftko had to answer that i think it was incredibly important to me i do not know that it was as importantbut i do not he was of of very very very portent friend to me do your friends now that occupied the space that gave previously occupied i do you did i do no we wrap up our conversation shortly after this but the question still nags at me i asked him about it again the next day when i was just the two of us talking it is a question very self conscious about it answering why because i i would not say he was a guy i knew let get yet he was a very good friend of mine was your best friend any point it in now oar getting inflict things about basked france and willingly best friend can be a tear not a person that runs a tear it a person he was easy on that tear what i gave was on that her i he is certainly close to it i do not know of how drown always it was darling to see the truth of the matter laid bare him just did not love gave as much as gave level him and really and imbalance in lave is not that ultimately the reason that all relationshipsend i ran this by game hat maybe there is a mismatch in their feelings for one another and how they understood their relationship he rejected that idea outright says he was there he remembers what it fell the idea that we were not best friends coneys heresy but it is just not true but it is not true in your story ye and i thees it could be true in tins yet i just do not b and i think that is self prevision i think a pard of me had been jealous that titan gave got the chance to come to some understanding i thing that my ax's friend made clear was not on the table for as but it had not occurred to me that sitting down together and rehashing things may not lead to some sort of new common ground that tin could just strike a match on game's memories and say no your on it was not that i never felt that way about you e that what happens when you try to talk tout ye nothings i guess that the problem when you write to one man she hoping it a props one to tell you the thing you have always wanted to hear there is no guarantee that we will say the lines you have signed to them if your a comfort is in producer at show give mock show slow a show about friendship the opens in october and runs in york way boson and chico digest a it gave male a not calm coming up an words succeed where spartfuly platformshoes have failed that is in a minute chico to a greater one of program continues to smart in life my glass to day's programmed say it to my face we have two stories to day e show hm is better friendship wither is something the two friends you not see id eye on and that is something is fundamental the talking about it seems just explosive and the friends have to decide do we discuss this at all we have arrived at act two of our program at to pinky swear wat rang you thing about the friends in this next story is that they talk every day they are close best of bestirs and yet there is something of they have never talked about that he is big and basic that one of the wonders are we really as close as i thought desman gars is one of the two friends she is been on our ship before jesting a hearing the united states in new york the grip went a gyrus on the day left home i sat in my kitchen with my best friend gabby a tansy was waiting outside we were leaving argentina i was eighteen listen i said barely able to make the words out without sobbing there is something i want you to have i gave you my sparkly platform shoes it was not she begin a rest only mean something to you yours yo pa life yo are not will cat at we lust a setticleen at at the photomap people become all gabocomal been i gan a beat combat go r what the hell om i supposed to do with these he says he thought to himself before he could say anything mama stuffs and cash savings in a pouch under her shirt and yelled let us go my grandma gramayaa held my face in her bony hand and whisper something in my ear i turned to gave an told him ism going to move back as soon as i can i promise e e that was more than twenty years ago gabby is still my best friend we talk all the time about everything he knows when ism going to go get my paps here i know when he is how a bad day just by the tone of his voice by now some of my facial expressions are actually his they just stuck to me but the way i curl my lower lip when i find some one annoying but as close as we are we have never really talked about how i said i was going to move back and i have not followed through it became a sort of unspoken rule we cannot talk about this one small enormous thing until recently when all the words we would kept in over the years came spilling out ut happened by acid of course nothing truly happens by accident we reached the spoiling point by our own doing by assuming we knew one another well we could read each others minds and to be fair we often could we have always understood one another instinctively from the moment we met we were fifteen back then i mostly spent my summer vacations at the neighborhood park that is where i first saw him he was lying out in the grass next to another friend of mind a cigarette hung from his lip he held a need mess beer in his hand i took one look at him and thought what a bad ass he took one look at me lanky pale blocking his son and curled his lower lip he was irritated i gat that to at me yet get the people c the dining i cold h muscular run yet while you must feel lend that wat the o ho we that look at this one she looked too white she must be unsufferel let the be e be batman and just too prove him wrong i took my first ever swig of beer it was piss warm but i chugged it down this earned me some respect we started joking we were very different i was a scared and secretly angry nerdy jewfish girl he was a brown kid who was scared of being out at his gay but we quickly signalled to each other that we both came from homes where there was a lot of arguing that easily boiled over into physical fights they adults in our lives they often behaved terrifying children y want badly to tell you that from that day on we became trouble makers be gabby was not the bad boy i thought he was when we met we were not it the rode the barrio rebellious teens the won e as gotta of yo i mi but i a am all we were as he puts it senior synod children who behaved panties our big act of rebellion was secretly drinking all of my male's tea we hung out in the park and just gossip smoking cheap national tobacco ripping the filter off to feel tougher that you'll see yo see awe cam up a that of mayor pericope you will tin con bad ice win feta i cant we a yet the park it was our island and on it we shared our fears our obsessions and our escape plants with always involved moving far away things were not good at home my parents who were professors had been in employed for a whole year gabby who dad was a cap driver his mum was a secretary they were barely making ens me i mean not little logroll what meal senamamals e at tell seen ban sometimes he would come home from the park and find there was just tea and bread for dinner at the end of each night we would say good by see i to morrow it'd go back home and sometimes slip into my gran my yaasmet next to her she kept a tiny plaster radio under her fellow which blasted the news all night and over the years the news got increasing we worse ten per cent on employment fifteen per cent on employment seventeen per sent on

month line next to mama's radio was falling asleep to a muffled doomstake o by the end of the year my family decided to go an felt now or never at the time there was an acidness out of our gentian

leave and he was still there he says he felt anchored to a sinking ship me no have bee a we him gemot a me egad get on gal in come all an amebae wet i was angry he says i was frustrated i felt i was

fashion becoming a designer but his mother sat him down and told him university was not in the cars they needed him to get a second job he started waiting tables the tips were meager no one was eating out meanwhile for me it'd felt it'd got and thrown into the deep end of america with no life jackets we lived in ego gallon southern californium i worked a lot of job dawn at a bakery after noons at the super market we gens i sold cowboy boots at a store back then mamma was always yelling at me there was no a for effort there was just keep swimming or you will drown wake up jasmine and rolling community college jasmine go to bed jasmine but before bed i always tried to call gabby on skip or with these international calling cards they sold at liquor stores i tell him about whoever i had a crash he would tell me about the pants he would design and made for himself in the background of these conversations there was always my promise to return whenever it'd have a bad day whenever my creepy boss would give me another on solicited usage it'd call and tell him fuck this place an glad ism coming backs in whenever gabby would have a bad day when he would get into an argument with his family ear his boy would throw tantrum he would sigh and say cannot wait for you to come back but returning at this point was impossible i could not afford to even visit let alone move back we just needed time we figured i needed time two more ears maybe three three a most in the meantime i started making money not a lot but i tout i could help my family for the first time i started getting a taste of an independence i could never have imagined back home still a gentian was always on my rare view mirror beautiful on valiant alive even in its wreckage gabby would tell me about all these new things he was doing poetry readings a protest to roadtreb every one was hurting back home but they managed to hostel and enjoy life meanwhile me i was making money in the guess say but the closest

in time and by the time i got to the hospital the police had arrived she had died the circumstances were murky and it could have involved violence so this was now when official investigation the copse

from the start he smiled at me granted his brown eyes filled with mischief and said get a cats our count a opus want to stay here awhile longer i felt the rush of excitement of someone who has just been spoken to for the first time yet i answered we stood under the ledge together watching the world around us come undone n ratan gars juverson if you gat before a podcast the last cap that wat he

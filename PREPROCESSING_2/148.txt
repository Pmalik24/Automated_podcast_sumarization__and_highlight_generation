look the whole week up have been telling me he needed his family close to him now they are her they are together in raft they have moved from the very north of gaze all the way down at the bottom edge of the gazes trap on the border with egest used was now responsible for his own camp of about sixty people one of whom was teigptmonth's pregnant and all of whom were looking to him to tell them what now what is the plan on a jiffy want coming up things do not go you sit plan that is in a minute the chico to radio wen a program continues dis america life of lira glass did they were telling the story of used mamas he spend mods living his family from one place to another in gaze trying to keep them safe till finally at the end of last year he got the made raft an enormous feet that the cannon idealize you sup here but there are few people who have the special combination of resources and familiar relationships and trust and also skills of planning abilitiesand really law to pull off what yousiph just put off getting sixty people to raft host and together and seemingly for the moment safe but the beginning of this year throat settled in raft waiting but everyday this talk that israel on watch a ground assault in raft next and a seal you sure youngest sister is about to give birth again hurshana i really wanted to talk to using sister a seal once he got the malta raft she was the when used was thinking about the most talked about the most the funny sister the emotional sister also the one most used resourceful determined used told me one o seal settled in raft she quickly started taking things into her own hands first of all the ten used felt they were too crowded and lout a seal bit her own tent with her husband every time yuseph went to visit the camp she would find everyone in a seal's tent hanging out she began to rebuild other parts of her life there too a seals an nurse people in the camp began bringing her their medical questions she wouldidvise follow up try to force medications for them when she could a seals tent became part living room part clinic used had always told me a seal was his youngest and most stubborn sister but when she arrived in raft he added she is also the least based difficult things do not rattle a seal which es why the moment shed called him crying and long to the bath room was alarming to him yes she she was when it does not copy she does not compleat you was what as set is the wok be tween we sister i look i loo just we as the most wise she is young wat she is ex she she she is in lot when there shin about the she she to look i i i i i spoke about about the she and trusty we she of it was really hard to reach a seal i i a seal this is a i fin any hi finally the famous sister the in her net is o key now war oke did i use you it was not one than that ti city bad e one alas toke there was no inner net at the tents and hardly any sell connection i try d catch a seal on the inner net at sip's office or on her phone i hi can you hear me woke we would my oke of i learned things in scraps of conversation that were maybe two or three minutes long some voice mambos tack messages just as a seal had managed her situation at the camp she took control of her plans for child birth too a seal told me she would never been fearful of child birth she seen late births as a nurse she was actually working in labor and delivery in gosh city when the for started she would imagined it she could do it she said when it comes to health care matters ism capable of controlling the situation for myself and those around me when she had to flee her home leave behind the doctor she loved and the hospital she would planed to deliver in a seal just made a newsman she found a new hospital and a new doctor in coenurus when maxwell apart and she fled to rape a sal brought us in her planning process in rape a seal and if worked in tandem they figured out where she could deliver a small maternity hospital they mapped out a rout to the hospital rapes seal packed with traffic and people now it can take hours to get across the city us studied routs and gigolo maps and he practiced driving to the hospital on back streets through farm land and bumpy dirt roads a seal did not want to bring a newborn back to the tent in the cold give asked the annarsey if a so in the baby could stay with him and the other staff living at the annals office just for bit after the birth they said yes at the camp they got the bath room up and running four days after a seal arrived i lead canary if in a seal had a bath room a rout to the hospital and a postcard in plan there was only one thing a seal desperately wanted that she could not make happy in herself she told me an arabia when we were finally able to talk for a longer stretch feta had habit it the to can tea i moth have always preyed that i will not give birth until there a trust i do not want to start experiencsinglaberpain before there is a trust god wording it soul happen every day there were small glimmers of a possible truce negotiations were under way for a sense fire between israel and harass it was the last week of canary a seal was due february forth with er without a truce a seal and us had a plan then five days before her do date they had an unexpected dry run that tested their plan a real had contractions in the middle of the night used racer to the hospital t was a false alarm the contraction subsided but for the first time a seal got to see what it looked inside the hospital o the mad ha almost fisher so ma can end hin jockey be when you ended the hospital there is an in imaging o be number of misplace people it is full of displace people when we were standing at the door there was a woman coming from basin and consumes they were displeased and she came to the hospital e later he water had already broken she was standing at the door waiting in line because there are am five or six beds inside and they are oldest she was waiting for her turn to get examined even though she could not stand the baby came out why she was waiting at the door you saw her give birth area ya in the baby is out hiya ya the baby is old an the baby came out and the lad her down on the floor to deliver the baby right there there were no beds a not even in the maternity door they lad her down on the floor and the midwife or the a doctor came to deliver the baby with her on the ground two in front of you catch an a a we my gan ya i heard that i would be in her pace i imagined my self in her pace waiting for my turn to go in for later but then for it is a happen at the door that night in the hospital everything suddenly felt very real to a seal she was about to give birth in a tiny hospital that used to have around twenty birth a day and now sometimes had one hundred she would be delivering her first baby in a city that had two hundred thousand people just a few months ago and now had one point five million she was about to give birth in a hospital in the middle of a war that had killed six hundred people inside medical facilities and obliterated the vast majority of healthcare services she was about to have a child in a war were more than ten thousand children have been killed far a seal could not get one pregnant she could pray for a sense fire but she could not wait for one a seal had imagined her birth clearly before the war but now she was imagining it and we she never had before what if she delivered at the hospital on the floor what if she delivered in her tent alone what if is really tanks came in to rape while she was in labor what if she was naked pushing a baby out when in is really soldier showed up at the door tor her tent the ki bad e in ahead the hataabig thinking about this spy its see tatstuddered in my heart that i could give birth and see the soldiers the the me sit of the soldiers cars me and what if after she delivered her baby she started bleeding one horrifying thing a seal new was happening in gazarit now is women who hemorrhage after birth are sometimes being given his tireactamies have talk to doctors and a midwife and gaze who told me this is happening s happening for lot of reasons hospitals do not have the routine medications that help stop bleeding after birth they also do not have staff the staff they do have do not have time pregnant women are coming in you nourished sometimes with injuries another complications and there going into leader severely in near if they hemorrhage after birth which happened sometimes things quickly become life threatening they using his directives in gaze because his directives can be the fastest and safest way to save lives of all a very real possibilities a seal was now imagining this was the one she feared the most she deliver her baby start bleeding and they take her uterus that night in the hospital she begged a doctor for his attention is it safe here am a medical professional she said please help me the doctor told her if you can deliver somewhere else you should a seal walked out of the hospital to the car where used was waiting and told him i cannot have my baby here a red tree to the i i don think e ha the cobitro bin in what it related tour the itself that she without we mates there not i find position to moron i think it out julep begin calling people he knew asking about other actions for delivering a baby in raft maybe a private doctor who could deliver outside the hospital but those conversations quickly became other conversations his coworker is friends said but used are you seeing this did fusee what you of balance said the as really defenseminister he is saying raft is next glean you a gnat wo a that when we finish fromtenuoneis we will go in train an that is a his constant i have for exam from what i am stay was lady tan in the li varsity it is listen one till mete i can the that thanks moving plenty and he the clashes clearly yet i think it this ladies decided to continue the ground to prion baba its on to take this three minutes dor i me when yuseph thinks of those three minutes he is not just thinking of himself he is thinking of the sixty people he moved

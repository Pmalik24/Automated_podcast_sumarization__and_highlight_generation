welcome to the superman latponcas of science science spaces to e for i ma indrhubermen and of a professor of neurobiology and althemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing anabas also referred to as marowana anabas includes many different compounds that have profound impact on the brain and body while many of you probably heard of t h c there are also compounds in anabas such as c b d and of course there are different types or strains of anabas including serena strains and indict strains and hybrid strains and believe are not nowadays there is also an entire literature meaning a scientific and medicinal literature about type one type to tintype three strains it'll explain what all of that is and how they work it'll talk about some of the medicinal applications of different strains of anabas and combinations of anabas strains as well as some of the potential health hazards of anabas use i want to emphasize that any discussion about anabas has to be trained within the contact that the legality of anabas varies tremendously depending on where you are in the world depending on which country your in and even which state your in or which aria within a country possessing and using and certainly selling anabas can be either highly illegal or entirely legal or decriminalized or largely overlooked you of course sure obligated to know what those local laws are for you where you live and where you travel with that said to day's discussion really will include a full picture as to where anabas and the various and even very specific compounds within anabas can be extremely useful in the treatment of some ailments and where certain compounds in canvas can be extremely dangerous for certain individuals to use in particular individuals that have are existing genetic propensity for cyclosis that theme is going to come up again and again but we are also going to talk about the role of anabas in anxiety in depression both positive and negative effects will talk about sex differences and terms of women verses men and how they react differently to anabas and i would be entirely remiss if i did not include a conversation about anabas meaning t h c c b d hybrid strains et camera in creativity and different modes of thinking because as many of you probably know or at least have heard about anabas kin impact the way that we think the types of memory systems we can access andwhat is called convergent and divergent thinking which is one way of conceptualizing what is commonly referred to as creativity to day's discussion is going to include a lot of information but i promise to make it clear in accessible to all of you regardless of whether not you have a background and biology or not and today's discussion will also be quite wants you will find me routinely reading directly from specific research paper something that of course we always do on this podcast but to day am really going to dig into some of the finer points of the me t theologian papers and some of the statistics that were used and the specific populations of people that were study because is it turns out there are instances that we will discuss in which the use of canabusts can be immensely beneficial to one group and yet can be entirely detrimental to another group even at equivalent dosages and depending on a number of different factors we will discuss what those factors are just to give you a brief over view of the kind of structurumming a put on to day's episode we will review of course canabusts and its various forms it'll told about some of the biology but we are going to really drill in to how dosage that is the concentration of t h c relative to c b d impacts whether r not cannabis is going to have one effect or another we will also talk about the frequency of use daily use multiple times per day use weekly use are monthly or occasional use we willalso talk about different professions and how some people may have a little it more leeway in terms of whether not they decide to use canabusts or any of its various component chemical constituents that is s b d or t h c et camera and for other professions it might be entirely inappropriate because of the particular kinds of connive tass those professions demand we will also talk about genetic predisposition again sex differences hormone effects and i will also touch on what i think as the most important variable in determining weather r not cannabis is right or wrong for you and that is your age at which you are considering starting or continuing use or ceasing use what i can assure you is that by the end of to day's podcast you will have a quite thorough understanding of cannabis how it works what it does what its potential benefits can be what its potential hazards are and whether not its right for you and the people that before we begin i to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls it stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zerocostic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive end physical performance element contains a science bactoelectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any biophysical training and after physical training as well especially if i have been sweating lot if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element bacon slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element daccom slash superman let us talk about anabas and when we refer to anabas we are indeed referring to marowana or the marowana plants cannabis plants come in different strains or different varieties and those different strains are indeed different genetic strains just as animals and humans have different genetic backgrounds and they can be cross to one another to yield further genetic variation in the offspring plants can be hybridized to one another in various ways through grafting or through the use of different types of c comminations et camera in order to generate different strains there are also naturally occurring differences in the strains of plants and the cannabis plant is no exception for instance in the contacts of the discussion about anabas and its medicinal uses and recreational uses we need to distinguish between the beta variety the intima variety a variety call ruderal that is not often discuss and hybrids of retina indict and ruderal before diving into the different strains of cannabis and how they impact brain and body both similarly and differently i want to emphasize that the cannabis plant contains a number of different psychoact of compounds and the most powerful of those compounds is t h c the technical name for it is delaine tetrohydro canabanl but t h c as ill referred to it is just one of the psychoactive and biologically active compounds within cannabis plants there is also c b d which is technically referred to as canabadial and canabadyal c b d is known to be used for things painmanagement anxiety management and other medicinal purposes we will talk about the efficacy of c b d for those purposes as well as some of believe are not some of the dangers of c b d depending on where it source than the dosage et camera we have got t h c c b d and also c b n or canabanal c b n is less often discussed your going to here a lot less about c b n containing products out there c b n containing medicines but it is relevant to to day's discussions will come up a bit now i will be sure to provide more specificity to what ism about to say but very broadly speaking t h c is largely responsible for the psychoactive effects of anabas that is the changes and mood the changes in bodily state and sensation et camera whereas c b d and to some extent c b n have profound effects on the brain and body but they do not tend to give people the sensation of altered perception altered mood et camera some people might say they are not the component of anabas that quotenqo gets u high although today we will really drill into what the high itself represents and terms of chemical systems in the brain and body and what we will soon learn is that what we think of as being high actually includes a number of different changes in the brain an body some of which can be best explained by c b d not by t h c which runs counter to what most people out there no and belief broadly speaking we have t h c c be and c b n but i want a point out that the anabas plant has over seventy seven zero seventy different psychoactive compounds many of which still have not been studied in isolation and in detail there a big future of research for anabas and for t h c and t h c related psychoactive compounds as well as for seed and c ben to day we are mainly going to focus on t h c and c be as i mention before i should also point out that the anabas plant has over four hundred biologically active compounds these are biologically active compounds that may or may not have psychoactive properties that may or may not be useful for pain relief et camera again there is a vast landscape for exploration of the anabas plant and of hemp for what they include that could be beneficial to us are detrimental to us can lot more work to do to day we are going to really try and stay on target with what we already know and where there are certain exciting mysteries were intriguing mysteries about what we ought to explore more i will certainly highline those let us go back to the different strains of the canvas plant saliva indict and rhuderalis and explore how each of those differentially in pacts the brain and body because therein i think we can start to learn a lot about this incredible plant that is the anabas plant and whether r not you are a user of anabas or whether or not you are entirely opposed to anabas use understanding how anabas works in the brain and body itself is absolutely fascinating and and teach you a lot about how your brain anybody work at a basic level and can tell you a lot about how your brain and body will react to different life events and how your mood is established in stabilized and how your appetite is established in stabilized and on we have the three major strains of anabas saliva indict and ruderal and for sake of to day's conversation we can to much cross off rhuderalis its not often consumed and components of ruderal are not often consumed for medicinal or recreational purposes let us focus on saliva and indict people will consume the saliva variety of anabas either by edible or by smoking anabas or they will consume the indict variety of anabas again by edible or by smoking anabas or sometimes they will take it in a transdermal form or sublingual form their bunch of different ways to get the minibus into the body but there is a clear distinction between saliva and indict that actually shows up first in the structure of the plant at there extremes meaning in a pure strain of saliva it tends to be a taller plant the longer stack believe it or not and actually the length of the leaves is quite a bit longer whereas the indict planted to be re short and stout and for those aficionados out there insure a lot of the other specific features of saliva verses in dick but already what were talking about is the same plant minibus with two very different morphologies or shapes my sill wises interesting or i portent to now how it affects me or affects other people for medicinal recreational purposes will turns out that even though they are the same plant these two different genetic varieties because of the way that they grow and the way they capture sunlight and the way believe or not that the different plants within that strain interact with one another cause believe it or not plants are interacting with one another they actually bring different elements of the psychoactof compounds to different components within the leaves on the called books the take away is that when consumed and when i say consumed i want to be very clear i do not necessarily just mean oral consumption or eating minibus saliva b medical i also mean smoking it and that a be people will just with tobacco the way that they bring the psychoactive components into their blood stream and into their brain and body is to esentuly heat the dried leaves of the minibus plant then the heat liberates some of the psychoactive components that when inhaled into the lungs because the lungs include a lot of musculature lot of physically blood vessels and capillaries that the psychoactive components are actually directly absorbed from the lungs into the blood stream and they can cross into the blood stream end permeate throughout the body and cross the call blood brain barrier in other words burning the plant liberates the smoke that contains the psychoactive compounds and those are inhaled into the lungs and then get into the brain and body and act on the brain and body and the major effect of saliva varieties are to create a high if you will and using these an aliquots for those who their listening but to also act is a stimulant the saliva varieties tend to make people feel kind of invigorated somewhat alert it does attend to be as much of a sedative as some of the other varieties some people report heightened sense of focus or heightened sense of creativity will talk a bit later on as to whether not they actually are achieving heighten levels of focus and creativity or whether not they just perceive themselves to have heighten levels of focus in creativity the saliva varieties tend to make people feel a little bit less susceptible to pain and noxious stimuli which are basically stimuli that you do not the setivaarieties a ten prescribed or are used in the recreational contact for painmanagement and relief bay finally the saliva variety is known to include a sort of head biased effect a here were talking about subjective effects and of course these will vary from one individual to the next some people will smoke anabas satire in jest canada saliva only and will feel an entirely different away of a facts but most people the majority of people experts a sort of head entered high alertness focus and a sense tat their more creative contrast that with the indict varieties of anabas and when people smoke or eat er in jest indict varieties the psychoactive components of indict and again this is pure indict not hybridized with setivadabage is purindica tend to lead to more full bodied effects people report feeling more complete full body relaxation more of a servo felt indict anabas is often described and ore used recreational in order to achieve a state of sleep or to help relieve anxiety less of a stimulant effect and we will talk about why literally the underline neral circuits that lead to the saliva variety causing more of a elevated mood and a head high if you will and the indict varieties being more full body relaxation one of the ways to remember the distinction between the effects of anabas saliva and anabas indict was relate to me by a friend mash was a chronic meaning every day all day a consumer of marinas e basely smoke martian for twenty years before quitting about for five years ago he said that a indict is often referred to as indicouch meaning laid back in the couch am and that can help you remember that the indict varieties of anabas do tend to be more sedative in their effects o case of there saliva and there is indict and then now there are hybrid strains marowana growers and people who specialize in creating novel varieties of the anabas plant gan amusing the words anabasis marawana more less interchangeably here they are very guide creating new strains of plant that might be twenty five per cent saliva and seven five per cent indict vice verse or fifty fifty or ninety ten essentially what is happening nowadays is that through plantbiology plantgunetics i should say growers are getting quite efficient at creating a variety of different strains of the marawana plant they give rise to very quant and distinct effects on brain and body in fact much that there is now a new nomen later a new language emerging around anabas and the development of novel strains of anabas for medicinal and or recreational purposes and while this might sound a little but medical or a little bat clinical to some people leave are not this is the nomen cloture that is now typically used people still refer to the saliva indict and hybrid strains but there is now also a description of call type one type to and type three strains for any given saliva indict or hybrid strip a so just to put this clearly in your mind you have got saliva varieties that is pure saliva varieties you have indict varieties and pure indict and then you have hybrid varieties and beneath teacher those you have type one type to and type three strains of indict saliva or hybrid varieties what are type one type to and type three well type one type to and type three strains or strains that have varying amounts or ratios of t h c to c b d for instance type one strain for instance you could have a pure saliva type one or a type one pure saliva or a type one indict those are going to have the greatest amount of t h c relative to c b d and i really one to emphasize this understanding the ratio of t h c to c b d can help explain a lot or even predict a lot about how given strain of anabas will impact somebody for instance because t h c is largely responsible for the typical psychoactive components of anabas what i mean here is if somebody is in getting saliva and it routinely makes them a feel more energized elevates their mood gives them a heightened stance of creativity f that is what they experience and there taking a type one version of that that means that it is quite rich in t h c and very little c b d however if they were to take a type one version of saliva and it feels far too strong too much energy or they felt either too much in their head nowadays there are strains of saliva that have been genetically engineered and i do not mean by an engineer tinkering away with a unogeni engineering in a kind of crisper mu creating mutes but literally by hybridizing crossing different plants to one another e creating in it in a natural contact the same way plants in the in the outside world would sometimes hybridize to one another creating a variety that is perhaps type two which is going to have less t h c and more c b d or a type three which is going to be very high c b d and very little t h c and the same is also true for the indict varieties onto make sure that every one understands this because it becomes very important for understanding the biology of anabas and predicting positiveness negative effects of anabas saliva has this kind of stimulant a fact intends to be more of a head high if you will indict tends to be more full body than lead to more indicouch as i refer to it before of porn tended deep relaxation reduce in some et camera now within each of those estival indict you have type one type to in type three and that has everything to do with how much t h c which is the dominant psychoactive compound verses c b d which has other effects mainly on the body but not much on the brain and modes of thinking and mood et camera how much t h c her we c b d as present and again type one is t h c dominant type too of equal rations if you will of t h c and c bed and type threatened to be high c b d case already we have got some categorization here that hopefully is not overwhelming to you but this turns out to be extremely important if you want understand how cannabis works and predict the effects of anabas o case somewhat surprisingly we are going to set aside cannabis were goal take what we know about saliva indict type one type to old type three c b d et camera which can set that aside for a moment why would we do that well we have to ask ourselves why would any of these plants why would any of these compounds t h c c b d saliva indict et camera why would any of that have any effect on us at all and this discussion that we are about to have very much resemble the discussion that we had on a previous episode about nicotine because as many of nicotine is a commonly use substance in fact if we were to look at the three most commonly used drugs alcohol would be the top of the list many billions of people regularly use aldol or occasionally use alcohol many billions of people also use nicotine it is the second most consumed drug more than one billion and probably clos or tourbillion people consumed nicotine and then the third most consumed drug is anabas in one form or another many of you are probably shouting what about caffeine what about caffeine will in the contact of drugs and in regular addictive drugs caffeine does not quite rise to the list but if were to look at caffeine and including that miss caffeine would be above all of those o cape but the most commonly use drugs are alcohol second after that is nicotine and then anabas nicotine as some of you may know if you listen to the episode on nicotine but even if you did not nicotine comes from the tobacco plant and there few other plants that include nicotine and typically it is brought into the brain and body by smoking tobacco dipping tobacco snuffing tobacco or raping nicotine nicotine exist in the outside world in these plants the tobacco plants but the reason it has an effect on the body is that there are called nicotine receptors in the body now those nicotine receptors were named after nicotine the compound but the existed in the brain and body not because of the existence of a tobacco plant but because there are other chemicals in the body that naturally occur namely a coal coalmine that bine the nicotine receptor those chemicals such as ha see calling the bind the nicotine receptor in your brain and body create in hent sense a folks et retreat camera but nicotine from tobacco binds that same receptor but with much greater affinity and therefore also creates a state of focus but a much greater one than we can achieve without nicotine case can see the nicotine episode if you want to learn more about that in a very similar way all of our brains and bodies from the time that we are conceived believe it are not very shortly after conception if we want to be accurate very early conception when you were in the womb and still now if you are listening to this you have what are called canabinoid receptors because you also have indigenous canabanois what we mean by that you have receptors which are little parking spots that are present on cells in your brain and body and what we call a ligan which is baying just a chemical that is released parks in that receptor and causes a number of different biological effects minibus contains compounds that also bind to those receptors but here i want or make a really clear distinction we have what are called in erogenous lagers those that just mean chemicals from within us that we make naturally even if we never go near the cannabis plant or any other source of canaibus we have chemicals that are created in us that park in those receptors and cause biological effects on mood on perception on the immune system on hunger et camera again without ever going anywhere near cannabis we have these indigenous canabinois indigenous canabinoids are floating around in us or i should say they are released in us in particular ways bind these receptors and cause changes in mood appetite et camera they've many different effects on the brain and body will talk about this but just with nicotine there are substances in the outside world in this case minibus contains these substances to things t h c and c b d that when ingested by smoking or raping or by ingesting meticals also will park in those same receptors the canabinoid receptors and lead to biological effects now it is a litlabat misleading because we call them canabinoid receptors as if they were there to bind minibus or just we all the nicotine receptors nicotine receptors it makes it seem as if they were there in order to bind nicotine from tobacco but that is not the way our brains and bodies evolved are bringsonbodies evolved for these receptors to make use of chemicals that exist within us called in again indigenous chemicals and those indigenous chemicals lead to certain effects as i mention before the my thing here if you have not understood anything outset up until now please understand this the key thing is that t h c and c b d and the other components of cannabis bind to those receptors those indigenous canabinoid receptors the ones that we naturally make with much greater affinity and exert a vastly greater potency and effect on mood and reception et camera then our indigenous canabinoids another analogy that one could take an order to understand this would be hormones testosterone and estrogen many people i would say all people make testosterone and estrogen to varying degrees scone depend on wether to your male female your age what to gone through purity et center et camera but let just take testosterone for example there is testosterone circulating in your body that is true if your male or female and there are receptors called androgen receptors we could even call them testosterone receptors and the testosterone binds to those receptors and has effects on cells it causes pergroth changes the vows it can effect libido it facts all sorts of things in the brain and body depending on which organ an tissue your talking about but of course therefore people that take synthetic testosterone or derivatives of testosterone and some of those derivatives for instance in the body building community in the sports commie they will take things dianabal these are modified versions of of testosterone that can bind to the testosterone receptor with much greater affinity where i should say the androgen's receptor with much greater affinity and have superphysiological effects effects that would essential never be seen from testosterone that was indogenally endogenously excuse me in endogenously release within the body we could say the something for estrogen there estrogen receptors they bind estrogen oke but if some one were to take synthetic estrogen or to ingest a plant compound that contains various estrogenic compounds in those plants certainly exist out there they can have superphysiological effects on those receptors why am i telling you this well many people believe that because cannabis marowana is a plant and plants grow out of the ground and their naturally occurring and because we have receptors in our body that are there without the need to engineer or them from some external sort right there in our genomic program for it and were born with these things and we keep these con are entire life many people mistakenly think ah these plant compounds are safer for us are better for us or are somehow appropriate for us to ingest but that simply not true and here am not saying that cannabis is always a bad idea for people there are certain populations an certain people for which it can be relatively safe recreational that is the truth and there another populations for which it can be downright dangerous recreational ormadicinally and of course there are medicinal purposes that are being exploring will talk more about that but this is vital to understand because i think that when we here oh its from a plant its natural and then you all sure receptor for these and erogenous canabinoid receptors and therefore the marriage of those too the coming together ere of the chemical t h c or sad or both with these receptors is somehow supposed to happen as if this was a a purpose of having these receptors but it is simply not the case in the same way that the nicotenic receptors are not there because nicotine is good for us they are there because the are compounds that exist within us theater good to bind to those receptors from time to time now here is the key thing about i guys to dam sing their sticky things but here is a other key thing about understanding cannabis in the way that it works which is that t h c and c be when they are brought into the brain and body by smoking or what edible et camera they bind to those receptors those indigenous canabinoid receptors and they tap into the same systems that your indigents canabinoise would happen to the ones that affect mood and energy in creativity and relaxation et camera but they do with thousandfold greater potency and as a consequent of that your indigent canabinoiss are out competed they really get no opportunity to interact with those receptors and understanding that can lead to a very clear understanding of why for instance when people use canabusts to relieve anxiety or they use cannabis to enter a certain brain state for creativity or to enter sleep why a dependents on canabusts starts to emerge because if they do not in jest canabusts and again in jest could mean smoke to bring t h c in or sedan or unjust early or even transdermal or tincture r one of the other varieties if they do not do that then what happens is not only are the receptors not stimulated to the same degree or with the same potent that they normally are but the indigenous canabinois can no longer have their effect people experience heighten levels of anxiety disrupted mood disrupted brain state and on again i want to be very clear that ism not trying to pain to picture of canabusts as all bad or even partially bad what i want to do to day is give you as much information i can as to how cannabis works how its different component parts work how thedifferent types of cannabis work and point to some of the valid medicinal uses and some of the recreational uses and then lay out the landscape for you as to who is really most at risk in terms of psychoactive components amuse components and on and forth that you can make the most inform choice for you i am not here to tell you what to do or what not to do as i to say do as you wish right i mean do not do as you wish of arms other people yourself but do as you wish but now what you are doing that is really my goal here as we begin to dive further into the biology i think you'll stare to get a clearer picture of why cannabis is effective in some contacts but also why can create such massive suffering in other contacts because of the way that outcompetes your own natural in genius canabinoid systems this talk about those indigents canabenoid systems what they are and how they work because that will give us ta lends into what the higher potent for maximum impact of the various canvas plant varieties and strains an t c and body and forth how and why those work it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve m delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets be the probiatics that i need for got health our got is very important its populated by up microbioda that communicate wit the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those probiatics unathletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptegins vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste right if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road an the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitamin d three k two again that athletic green stock cam slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin the k to what are the indigenous canabenoids these chemical substances that everybody makes you make them i make them you have been making them basically from the timethat you are conceived and you are going to make them until the time that you die whether r not they have the impact and the biological functions that ism about to describe we will depend a lot on whether or not you are using your own indigenous canabinoids to parkin those receptors that you also have from birth until death or whether or not you are tickling those receptors or strongly activating those receptors using some external source canvas t h c et camera the two man indigenous canabenoids that we want to consider are anandemide which we refer to as e a e an andesine and another one which is abaca dentil liberal aracodenoil liberal which we will abbreviate to a g let us just take e a e and two a g lump them together and talk about the indigents canabenoids just to make it simple but if you want do the deep dive on anademide verses to a g please be my guest the indigenous canabinoids a released from neurons what are neurons neurons are nerve cells and nerve cells should be conceptualized this you have pries synaptic neurons and postnapticg runs preen attic neurons basely contain little messing ls little bubbles full of negro transmitter which are chemicals and when neurons are stimulated electrically and that could be from a thought it could be from the desire to move it could be because of a drug it could be because you are hungry the relevant neurons will vomit out or will fuse as we say those belittle packets little bubbles of hero transmitter into the gap between the preimposonapnern we can that a synaptic clap or the snaps old gal space and the hero transmitter flows across that snaps and some of it will park in little parking spots that we call receptors on the posonaptic iron side depending on which nor transmitter it is and a bunch of other things not worth going into right now the parking of that chemical in those narrow transmitter receptors will either cause that neuron on the posonaptic side to itself release nor transmitter elsewhere or it will quiet it down led excitation in in ambition that is come negro transmission in a nutshell you do not understand it no ideal it is not going to prevent you from understating to his discussion if you understand even a small fraction of what have just said then it is going to allow you to understand not just to day is discussion but a lot of hero science with a lot more nuts and depth of understanding the key thing to know about the indigenous canabinoids is the unlike most hero transmitters they are released from the possonaptic side what happens is negro transmitter goes from presonaptic neon to posonaptic neuron but under certain conditions the posonaptic neuron itself release is a chemical and that chemical goes backward what we call retch or greatly to the presonaptic neuron binds receptors there and changes the probability that the presonaptic neuron will release nor transmitter put simply indigenous canabinoids tend to decrease the probability that the a neuron will release hero transmitter they are a sort of a break on the system they are a way of shutting down the communication between neurons regulating it not to make it completely quiet but to adjust the levels with a lot of nuns now the other thing that the indigenous canabinoids do he sort of a mine bender because where talking about cannabis and a commonly known feature of cannabis and marooned consumption is disruptions in short turn memory and there is essentially zero debate as to whether not that occurs and well talk what the mechanisms solo bit later and yet indigenous canabinoids the chemicals that you naturally release from these posonaptic neurons that travel rector greatly back to the presonaptic turn actually can lead to strengthening of connections between the presonaptic neuron and the posonaptic neuron through a process called long turn potentiation or el t p they can also cause what is call depression of communication between a presonaptic up on an opposanaptic neuron long termed depression has nothing to do with depression as the psychological state or is a illness long terpotentiation and long terms depression simply refer to the probability that one neuron will be able to stimulate an activate another neuron and as i just told you the endogenous canabinoids can either turn up the dial or turn down the dial they can either increase the probability or decrease the probability that a given connection between neurons will function more or will function less you think about the communication between neurons as cross talk is a conversation well the indigenous canabinoids can dictate whether not that conversation is likely to occur or not to occur thing of them as either am putting someone at the top of your text chain in your phone which wold be long tern potentiation or essentially blocking their number which would essentially be long term depression if you are getting the impression that the endogenous canabinoids are working and a number of different ways and its not very straightforward your right in fact that is the message that likely to take away the indigenous canabinoids are sometimes increasing neuronal communication this can lead to increases in mood or increases in the likelihood that some one will talk a certain way or behave a certain way or feel a certain way they can also lead to decreases in synaptic transmission that is communication between neurons in ways that will make somebody is mood lower or will make them less hungry or more hungry and here is the really we thing there are two kinds of indigenous canabinoid receptors refer to a c b one and c b two and we can say with confidence that c b one is highly enriched in the nervous system and especially within the brain its found not everywhere but almost everywhere in the brain and else where in the nervous systems o spinal cord and other aspects of the nervous system c b two the canabinoid receptor c b too is largely located and the tissues of the body including the mine system the liver even the genitals et camera what this means is that the indigenous canabinoids are having the sorts of effects on neurons that i talked about but they are also having effects on i mine cells on reproductive organs on liver on digestion on hunger et camera through mechanisms that are divorced from the function of the nervous system of neurons now in reality no system of the brain body is divorce from the nervous system because the nervous system is controlling everything here is really the master controller and everything feeding back to the nervous system it is a to a street but the simple way to thing about a c b one receptors are mainly in the nervous system and c b two receptors are mainly in the body and indigenous canabinoids again e a anadamid and two a g each denial liberal a impacting c b one and c b two receptors to day were mainly going to talk about c b one receptors cause they are the ones a responsible for most of the familiar facts of anabas but the we take away at this point is to really understand that the major effects of your indigenous canabinoids on these receptors in the particular c b one are very new ones it depends on contacts depends on which neurons it is you know sometimes increasing communication between euros sometimes decreasing it and then a long comes cannabis and that anabas again can arrive by smoking by raping by edible and anabas contains t h c and c b d that potently bind the c b one receptor and now the effects of the c b one receptor being occupied by t h c are being occupied by c b b are not very new ones in fact they are very predictable and especially importance to understand that they are strong and they park in that receptor with such affinity with such force and precision and stubbornness and refusal to leave that receptor that they completely outcompete the indigenous canabinoid system in fact they leave the indigenous canabinoid system essentially dysfunctional which in some cases may be a good thing but in most cases is going to lead to problems of various kinds and well talk about what sorts of problems and again i feel obligate to say this is not me saying do not ingest cannabis or t h c r c b d a it is not what ism saying what ism saying is if you evaluate the potent that is in technical terms it would be the affinity with which these compounds t h c and c b d and c b an bind to these indigenous receptors that would be a how's are gone a cannon going off as compared to indigenous canabinoid whether not it is ya or too a g which is more a cap gun level of activation at least in the analogy now you have what at least i would to think is a fairly complete understanding of the different varieties of anabas at least at a broad sweep and the different biological effectsthat they can have at least in terms of the major receptors and retrogrades signaling et camera et camera now let us take a step back into the real world and valuwaht or think about what happens when somebody smokes cannabis or in just anabas by way of edible or tincture something that sort anabas is very fast to enter the blood stream in fact within thirty seconds it is going to enter the brain and permeate throughout the brain and body that is very very fast and contrasts that with something aucoaul or even niacin depending how the nicotine is delivered that is very fast delivery of the psychoactive and biologically active compound which in this case is t c and c b d and probably some other things as well within thirty seconds it reaches the brain and bodily tissues and within thirty to sixty minutes it is going to reach its p cousin rations and have its peak biological effects those are not always the same thing but in the case of anabas again here o musing canvas as a kind of umbrella term for t h c and c b d the effects are going to pike at about thirty to sixty minutes after bringing those compounds into the body in somewhere another and the effects ten to last anywhere from three to four hours although there is some variation on that depending on individual metabolism whether not somebody is i familiar with the compound belie stare not psychologically familiar but also biologically familiar or whether not a first time use or occasional use and on t h c and c b d and other components of anabas are highly what we call lipophilic that is they have an affinity toward and the connactially pass through fatty tissues now every cell in your body but especially neurons have a double layer of fat on their outside and of course when people say here fat they we thin you fats bad forever most of the world seems to want to lose fat or bodily fat here were talking about the fatty membrane the barrier round each tissue in this case we are talking particularly about neurons and t h c and c b d and the other components of anabas are highly lipophilic they can get into essentially all cells just by flowing into them they will also remain in those cells for a long time i know that a number of people passion whether r not they get tested for work or for sport or otherwise for anabas or c b d and t h c do not take this as a strict number but typically if one in is c b d or t h c smokes anabas and jests by oral et camera does not matter it is going to stay in that fatty tissue and can be detected for at least as long as eighty days after ingestion and there is a whole industry as to how to celebrate the clearance and a i should just tell you that just losing bodily fat is not going to a eliminate it from your system i may be partially in those fat cells but i certainly inn troviseral fat and other fatty tissue that is in around the brain embody is going to harbor that no t h c molecule in the c b d molecule for quite a long while at least eight days so if some one smokes anabas or they in just anabas very rapidly gets into the bloodstream and the components that are psychoact of getting tote bloodstream and are immediately able to access neurons and other cells and start having these effects of parking at those indogenists cannabonoind receptors and impacting the signalling between neurons which leads to the subjective effects of anabas including t h c and c b d let us talk about with those different subjective effects are again this is going to very depending on whether not people are jesting retina varieties of anabasis just remind you that then be elevated mood alertness talkativeness people who takes the eve of varieties tend to talk a lot more than they would otherwise again there are exceptions to this of course there are exceptions ism sure their people out there shouting altho i gossip your the quiet people who do not talk to much your probably not shouting or your not your not doing on retina joke intended but in any event there are exceptions but there are also general rules and the retinas tend to me peoples ore mood elevated energetic and the or head high and indict varieties tend to do the opposite more of a sedative relaxant et camera why and how would they do that look hey without going in to an extensive deep dive into the different narrow transmitter systems of the brain and body what we know for sore is that s b one receptors are present on an enormous number of different neurons in train structures in neural circuits that the retina varieties that act a sort of a stimulant making people feel happy cause in general they do tend to elevate mood at least at certain dosages talkative a tend to make people feel on they have ideas that are interesting that they might want a share om tend to narrow their context stand to increase focus that is something is not often discussed about cannabis but it can specially the saliva varieties can increase people's level of focus to particular things something their watching or something their doing or music allows them to narrow their sense of focus that is going to occur by activation of s b one receptors in the call prefrontal quarter which is just behind the forehead and the prefrontal quarter acts as a strong modulator of call limbic circuitry and other circuitry that is more stress oriented an the way to think about the stress and limbic circuitry such as the amygdala which many people have heard about that they are not really circuits for fear and stress they are circuits that are constantly evaluating one's own internal state heart rate et camera and what is happening externally and sorry to say but the default of those systems is to detect danger the for threat detection systems and then the rental quarter largely acts as a break on those systems we the rains pulling back on a steed of horses that would otherwise just con of take off and the retina varieties tend to increase s b one activation in the prefrontal quarter and another circuitry that then leads to a kind of overall reduction in stress because the way that prefrontal circuitry can reduce activation of the emigdula now that corse does not explain why some people become very stressed and very paranoid when they smoke saliva varieties or other varieties of anabas ore invest other varieties of anabas we will talk about the paranoid effect and why that occurs in who might predict that would occur to them in it in l bit but this on to give you a sense of how this is working because as i mention before t c and or cab my are going to bind that s b one receptor let say in prefrontal quarters and neurons of prefrontal quarter get a bind there and then theyewill be a retreat signalling back to the presnapptic neuron in the case of prefrontal quarter what is happening is its increasing transmission increasing the release of narc transmitter in prefrontal quarter however at the same time the very same t c and c be that was brought into the system is binding the very same type of receptors side one receptors in other brain structures such as the emigdula and causing retrograde signaling back to the present attic irons in the middle but its quieting the activation of those neurons this is interesting right we have the same compounds tiny and orsibd brought into the body and brain binding the same receptors in this case the side one receptors but depending on where those receptors are located and which brain areas were referring to they are either causing heighten levels of alertness and activation of systems that are design to make you talkative and alertness and mood et camera focus or they are causing suppression of those circuitry's we have a kind of a we saw effect here where the same compound is increasing mood and alertness and focus in the prefrontal quartics and is decreasing stress and threat detection in the emigdula and that is one of the reasons why especially the saliva varieties of canvas allow people to enter these states of focus might even say flow although i do not want to go into what flow states really are that is for a different destruction and its very poorly defined as it is and i certainly do not want to give people the impression that anabas increases flow states because that not always the case and certainly most often as nocked to be the case but the idea here is that this molecule comes into our brain and is shifting everything towards a state of focus elevated mood of heightened sense of importance about whatever it is that we happen to be doing and now of course whatever we could happen to be doing could be writing a song writing poetry communicating with somebody but it could also be something as trivial as watching cartoons or watching a move which is in ought not trivial in its own right but in terms of thinking about the creative aspects or the created activity stimulating aspects of canvas not a too productivity oriented narrowed focus elevated mood more relaxed and yet energetic that is the major effects of the saliva varieties except and this is a really big bold faced triple under line except except in some individuals depending on dosage but also depending on preexisting nerd circuitry and propensity for anxiety some people in jest or smoke saliva varieties and regardless of weather nods a type one type to or type three variety can regardless of the ratio between t si and sib people will experience intense anxiety in paranoia hide you predict who will experience intense anxiety in paranoia and who will experience intense relaxation focus and sense of creativity from investing or smoking a type one type to or type three saliva well there is no way to predict that and there is a lot of kind of what i were call street lore or dorsum lore or can of a pure not pure reviewed a but a sort of pure disgust mean among friends and people and acquaintances lore out there that what one needs to do is simply smoke more right or just in guest more you hear that oh a listen if it makes you paranoid you simply been to use more that is absolutely categorically false everything we know about the way that t h c and c be work is that they tend to potentiate that is increase the effects of these different systems at given synapsis in different areas of the brain and body that is if some one experiences paranoid or anxiety from a given strain of the marowana plant or from investing an edible in a particular way or particular kind of medical that person is very likely to experience the same effect every time they invest that strain or variety this is part of what is led to this enormous industry in their number different reasons but this part of what is led to this enormous industry of highly customize minibus where people will spend some time really seeking out the different strains of canvas and hi hybrids of cantus that work best for them and work best for them in particular contacts i wish i could tell you that if you are a person who is between five foot seven and a six feet tall and a your blue eyes a were brown eyes that the saliva varieties are gigot be right for you or that the sutra varieties are going to you panic attests i cannot do the the only way to determine it would be to actually experience investing those are smoking those which is certainly also not what i am suggesting right that is up to you ism not telling you what to do or what not to do but there are no good predictors in fact if you look in the literature it is not at all clear that people who have a heightened level of anxiety when they do not smoke minibus will experience minibus as less paronoisain do sing or more relaxing that is simply not the cases now what we can say for sure is that a general categories of effects such as increase focus and reduced anxiety are largely due to activation of areas the prefrontal quartets now unlike other compounds nicotine or alcohol or near transmitter seems dopamine when we talk about the canabonoid system and i say effects biological effect psychoact of effects i want you to keep in mind always please please please keep in mind that those effects can be varied and often opposite in direction that is just give an example of that i just mention that when people smoke or or eat saliva that it tends to lead to one specific set of or generally leads to one specific set of effects heightenfocus mood et camera whereas when they ingest or smoke indict and its components right again were still talking about t h and c b d and varying ratios but now indict minibus and say what why would it improve the transition time to sleep or at least give people the impression that it improve the transition in to sleep will talk about what indict actually does for sleep in a l bit but indict also tends to suppress activation of the amygdala and threaten detection centers in the brain again binding the same c b one receptors in those retrograde signalling mechanisms have talked about before but it also tends to shut down the hippocampus an area of the brain associated with memory which is why indict varieties lead to pronounced or i should say profound defects in short her memory and sometimes in long her memory as well if its consumed over long periods of time will talk about short medium and long term consumption occasional consumption going forward what i likely to take away from this compose of the discussion is first of all the mechanism of action by which anabas impacts the brain and body but in particular the brain is going to be through c b one receptors and the c b one receptors can lead to either an acceleration or a break on particular biological mechanisms and there are going to be a constellation of different accelerations and breaking of different neral systems in the brain and body depending on whether or not people in gjuscitiva or indict or some hired strain and perhaps most importantly even if you did not understand anything i have said about the biology of these different strains in the receptors please do understand that there is no way to predict what the effect of a given strain will be on an individual there has been extensive exploration as to whether not people who are call mellower or more anxious or any number of different personality dimensions will respond in one way or the other but in fact there is no way to tell lay er on top of that the fact that dosing t h c an c b d can be fairly straight forward in the form of edibles might because there can there can be at least of its a controlled source a defined number of milligrams of t h c a to find number of milligrams of c b d that is true for injestables it is much harder to gas that from the movable forms of anabas especialyif those movable forms of anabas are obtain through sources where there is not a lot of clear information about the total amount of t h c in that product at this is all changing quite a lot nowadays because of the commercialization of t h c and c b d products in anabas in a number differnareas clouding in the united states but still many people are investing anabas t h c c b d through sources where they do not really know how much their bringing into theiresystem and whether or not some one gets incredible anxiety relief in hance sense of mood and focus and well being pain relief et camera or whether not they have fumble an panic attacks et camera is very hard to predict based on dosage information alone now of course we can create broad categories and we are going to talk about studies that create broad categories of lo dose moderate does and hides frequent use and infrequent use but unlike alcohol unlike like en we cannot really point to specificity of amount of alcohol grams of aldol per weak which is say for amount of alcohol which is not safe and i know lot of people out there are wondering now how often and they smoke cannabis are often can they eat cannabis or t h c r c b d in any number of its different forms in products safely well we have to really find what safely means and we have to really acknowledge that there is a pretty loose set of controls over what one is bringing into the brain an body as they in just t c and b d but even under conditions in which its very control it is very hard to predict what those effects will be before moving into specifics of taking cannabis are not taking anabas who should who should what the medicinal purposes are an what some of the newer exciting data point to i just briefly won to make a listen i promise very briefly i know ism not often concise but i do try to be thorough for your sake i want to make a very brief list of the different brain areas that a impacted by t c and c b d and why t c and c b have the various effects they do when somebody smokes or in jest cannabis does not matter what the t h c er c b d ratio is if they experience deposits in memory and that is almost always present that is going to be because of reductions in electrical activity within this brain region we call the hippocampus sepia us means c or at she lees we or and ataman to name things after what things look but hippocampus memory memory is reduced in particular short term memory that is through regardless of whether not one is using saliva intima or some hybrid in general the prefrunts a quarter as going to be activated by the saliva varieties which is going to increase thinking in narrowly constrained focus to some activity and that is more commonly associate with the saliva varieties the intima varieties as e mention before tend to lead to a suppression of activity in prefrontal quarter believe or not and cane turn off thinking and planning this is why intima varieties are often used for relaxation and for promoting sleep regardless of whether not saliva or indict variety and again regardless of the ratio of t c to c b d there is a general suppression of nerd circuits within the called basil ganglia and sarabellum ball gangly and cerebellum are tires of the brain that a involved in action planning and with holding actions thou be the basil ganglia called go no go circuitry and the cerebellum which is involved in balance but also motor planning and motor sequencing this is why people who smoke marijuana regardless of the strain will tend to b less physically mobile other common effects are reddening of the eyes dryness of the mouth that essay caused by the same general mechanism which is a reduction in the secretion of saliva and of s or tears and lubrication the eyes from the lacrimal glands of the eyes because of the presence of largely c b two but also c b one receptors in the mouth and on the eyes and there tends to be especially with certain strains of anabas increase in appetite called munch and that has everything to do with very very hi density of c b one receptors in the hypothalamus and in particular areas of the hypothesis the arcuate nucleus the hypothalamus other air is as well of course that have tons of c b one receptors bin t h c and c b d an activate the neurons that strongly stimulate appetite through two mechanisms one is a cognitive mechanism of creating a preoccupation with food and anticipation of taste as well as the experience of taste of the narrowing of focus to what you want to go eat i really crave pizza it seems to be hug fat hobo hydrate foods but really crave tea and narrowing of focus thatyou are not thinking about anything else but also signaling from the hypothalamus to the gut to neurons within the stomach itself that regulate blood sugar there are strong effects on blood sugar of t h c an c b d that generally lead to increases an appetite two parallel mechanisms one within the brain one within the body increasing appetite were there is an array of different effects and as i mention before c b one receptors a present all over the nervous system in the brain the spinal cord in fact the presence of c b one receptors in the spinal cord largely explains the fact that t h c and c b d to some extent although its not very well studied can provide me pain relief i shall say some because the lot of people perceive or believe that they experience more pain relief from anabas than the actually do its actually has the lot to do with a perceptional shift to basely focusing on other things but there does seem to be some antignosuceptive meaning anti pain effects of anabas t h c in particular and that is exerted largely through a facts on c b one receptors in neurons of the spinal sort a broad array of effects are taking place regardless of what strain take an the then i u eat the anabas are you smoke the anabas and the broad array of effects can be explained by the fact that that wretrorad signalling can lead to activation or suppression of activity in various anurans now i like to take a step back from the biology of anabas and t h c and c b d an all the signalling and receptors et camera and really just focus on canada use and wherever possible i will point to the specific strains that have been studied and the ratios of t h c to c b d but i have to say that unfortunately most studies of marijuana of anabas w while they have been very careful to detail the amount of the s logos medium dos or hypos and actually getting very specific right down to number of milligrams or even how much circulating touch h is present after somebody smokes a joint or in jests i anabas most studies have not distinguished between saliva an indict strains that is unfortunate because in the real world people are distinguishing between estival and intocastrains in their patterns of use and what they prefer in what they do not prefer even what they prefer to smoke during the day or injestering the day verses night believe r not their people who are using certain strings during the day and other strains at night but the science is yet to catch up to that or i should say more accurately the general public and the themes that are emerging and the practises at there emerging around anabas especially in states where its decriminalized or legalized are occurring at such a rapid rate that there is absolutely noway that the science could keep up this is a naturally occurring experiment not to say that is natural people should do it but it is and experiment that is happening in real time in the real world much faster than can controlled studies within universe laboratories and their laboratories can keep up at this point i thing it is appropriate to ask ourselves why do people even use anabas mind what are they trying to achieve is it always about not feeling pain is it always about reducing anxiety well sometimes it is but oftentimes people are using cannabis in order to achieve a particular state and we could use a broad rush an say well they just being high but while that may be true in a lot of circumstances have to believe it actually is true in a lot of circumstances there are a lot of people who use cannabis in a very directed way or they get quote in hi in order to achieve states that to them are particularly attractive and one such state is a state of creativity and this brings us to a broader theme which is does anabas in crease creativity and if is it the t h c the s b d what is the appropriate ratio or the best ratio for acting creativity this is an interesting and important discussion i believe because creativity is one of the more sought after and more elusive states that humans can experience and yet if you look at human evolution you look at our progression a in terms of technology development and a culture and a music and poetry et camera we really can look to creativity as the state that fostered much of that evolution whether not your into technology or into art or music the there not your to somebody who wants to expand their under standing or their experience of life in some way creativity is a fundamentally important state to try an access and to try an access regularly and to try and tap into in order to eventually produce something in order to create something of meaning that exists notice in that creative state but to yourself after that creative state has gone away rites of the painting that you paint in the creative state hopefully as a painting that still inspires and has impact after you ex at that create of state and that will inspire others and this could be true for any number differenthings not just pinking does canibust increase creativity the short answer is it depends first of all we need to define creativity here we are as a thinking a scientists if not already scientists and there are basically two modes of thinking their associate with creativity and they do not completely explain creativity but if you look in the research of psychology research and the conscience research you will hereabout converge thinking and divergent thinking converge thinking is taking loos ideas and an abrading them together finding a common thread synthesizing and organizing those different ideas into some common or specific framework in order to get or create some specific outcome converge thinking is basically o the person in the room whose listening to all the ideas and taking them all and may be it is a a panel of younohow should we om how should we get a certain product out to market or what are the what are the different motifs that we should include in a piece of music or of what shall we do in terms of re a rearchitecting a given a physical space taking in those different opinions those different ideas from different people and then synthesizing them and coming up with one or a small subset of coherent ideas that incorporate some ore all of the once that they heard case that is converge thinking at does not have to involve a panel of people talking to you i use that as an example of what goes on inside your own head when you are engaging converge thinking you are thinking well and said this and i think that and your contracting them through and trying to get some common theme some common vector to emerge from that divergent thinking on the other hand is best described as brain storming its exploring ideas and continuing to move into the variation in the vastness of ideas in hopes of eventually being able to converge on some novel idea of framework these are similar and related but typically the creativity process involves first brain storming and divergent thinking and then in order to arrive at something to actually create something rite the verb create not just thinking about what you might create which cars during divergent think on bit actually creating something a specific painting a specific song of specific body of literature a specific scientific project a experiment and on that usually involves convergent thinking now these can be explored in the laboratory and they can be explored in the laboratories through sets of different types of question airs or even tasks that you can give human subjects and this has been done extensively and across the entire body of data and by that i mean literally hundreds of studies that have explored the relationship between particular normal circuits an or chemicals converge divergent thinking we can arrive at at a principle and the principal involves a molecule that many love heard about before which is dopamine dopamine is an modulator it is involved in motivation and it tends to direct our attention to things outside of us but it is also closely related to converge thinking in divergent thinking and to the creative process and therefore it should come as no surprise that diseases of the nervous nervous system souse me such as by polar disorder of which we done in episode all about by polar disorder or skis aphelia or to disorders that impact the levels of dopamine either making waylay too high or waylay too low strongly impact whether r not people will be creative and i think the short take away that makes the most sense in terms of framing this and we cover this on the episode on on by polar disorder sometimes called by polar depression is that in professions where there is a lot of creativity required in order to succeed again musicians composers artists et camera you tend to find more manic depression and manic depression at least in the manic states the hyperactive states are correlated with elevated levels of dopamine likewise it is been seen over and over throughout history that an that individuals that have mild forms of skis friend or even full blown skis offrenia many famous painters for instance or musicians they are known to have elevated levels of dopamine and they are quite creative now that does not mean everybody whose creative has elevated levels of dopamine although it is likely that their levels of dopamine are at least not diminished and it does not mean that non creative people have low levels of dopamine do not get carried away withe interpretation here but the point is this dopamine levels strongly relate to the probability that you can engage in convergent and divergent thinking and they do in the following way when dopamine levels are high divergent thinking is more likely that is when people have a lot of dopamean circulating in their system they tend to be very expansive with their ideas they tend o brainstorm a lot they tend to be comfortable and even want to or reflectively throw out a lot of ideas that sometimes even seem a little disconnected some people might think of this is kind of attention definite but it is not it is really the idea of yo throwing out disparate ideas it a you hear sometimes you throw things against the wall and see what sticks while these people that is a obviously it an analogy but people are a throwing lots of things against the wall and being what stick and then seen how the things that stick fit together that is divergent thinking and elevations in dopamine tend to increase divergent thinking however they tend to do this in kind of an inverted you shape way for those either watch on you too bum gest drawing kind of a a hump obviously and for those of you listening just imagine a you a the shape a of a letter you and they just flip it upside downs that looks a bump turns out that when dopamine levels are very low there is a low probability of divergent thinking when dopamine levels are high as i mention before there is high level or probably city of divergent thinking but when dopamine levels go very very high then there is again a reduction in divergent thinking in other words there is a kind of a sweet spot of elevated dopamine for divergent thinking and again divergent thinking is critical for the creativity process because creativity by definition is taking a novel set of ideas an arranging them in a particular way or taking existing ideas and arranging them in a novel way that then you eventually converge on some new product new idea new song et camera now convergent thinking follows a very different pattern when dopamine levels are high convergent thinking is not very likely and when dopamine levels are low convergent thinking is very likely here using a arguably a very reductionist view we are looking at all of this thing of recalling creativity through a very narrow science reductionists lends we can say this the creative process involves going into a state where you are willing to consider a lot of options many of which seem distantly ore not even connected to one another and dopamine facilitates that divergent thinking state in which you are perfectly happy and in fact experience a kind of a joy ore elation a comfort and a pleasure in organizing all these different ideas that to any one else might seem not that related but when yourdopamine levels are elevated these all seem cat ideas and that may be there are connections there right you are not accepting all of them as true and valid and interesting in combining them but there is this idea that it is it is worth entertaining the possibility least for moments and then as dopamine levels drop there is the process of converge thinking which is taking options down off the wall saying no no that does not fit with that does not fit with that but ah that fits with that and that can work that feels right or sounds right or looks right that is the creativity process and i think this is not just important for understanding anabas which will get back to in a moment but it is important for understanding creativity and brain states in general brain states are not as we would say a square way function you just drop into a trench of creativity creativity is not an event it is a process and what ism telling you that s a process involves divergent thinking an consideration a lot of different ideas that is correlated with high but not too high dopamine and then one has to transition into a state of convergent thinking which is really homing in on the ideas that seem to have validity or that could have validity and getting rid of everything else and that is associated with low dopamine it is more about logical implementation and consideration as opposed to thinking about and considering everything let us now return to the question of whether not minibus and it is different components increase creativity and when you look at the literature on this you find studies that very clearly point to a yes it increases creativity and it is not surprising therefore that anabas can increase dopamine transmission that is dopa levels in certain brain areas pretty the brain as involved in thinking and planning o case anabas increases opening in these areas elevate dopamine in creases divergent thinking and divergent thing is associate with creativity and the are studies that support the idea that anabas can increase creativity however there ore at least as many studies that say that anabas does not increase creativity that anabas increases consideration of multiple ideas perhaps through elevation of dopamine and related systems but that ultimately the ideas that converged from that are not truly creative ideas at least they do not make the criteria for creative brain storming an extraction of ideas that are truly novel it does not increase creativity which one is it well fortunately there's an entry distinct that of literature that is taken all the other literature into consideration and here is where we arrive there is a really nice study that explored creativity in anabas users and we will provide a into the study a first author is family la france and the title of the paper say somewhat amusing its own right which is at starts with a question inspired by many jane of course many jane being one of the and of old school versions of our ways of talking about anabas or marijuana nowadays people refer to it mainly as pot as other names to a course and the tile to paper is inspired by many jane mechanisms underlying en hance creativity in anabas users and i really this study for a couple of reasons first of all they looked at people who did not use anabas as well as people who use anabas say two different groups but they did not a valuate creativity of the anabas users while they were under the influence of anabas they looked at the level of creativity in these anabas users when they were not under the influence of anabas and asked whether or not their ability to be creative was enhanced by anabas now we are going to compare this to studies in which people come into the laboratory and actually use anabas and than they valuate creativity under that context but the study as some unique take ways that i think a really interesting first of all they did yes see evidence for enhanced creativity and when i say enhance creativity i mean within the context of this divergent thinking thing that i talked about a moment ago and when i say enhance i mean significantly greater than in non users people that do not use anabas right now i can imagine the all the anabas users are are are cheering yes anabas increases creativity makes people more creative than they would be otherwise well his interesting we have to ask ourselves how that was accomplished and turns out that one of the major ways in which was accomplish is that anabas users even if they are not under the influence of anabas or far more open to novel ideas and they have of more exploration and reduced anxiety or wishes a lower anxiety mode of thinking when they explore novel ideas which is essential for divergent thinking they observe both enhanced divergent and converge creative type thinking in anabas users and the source of that they conclude is and here all just quote anabas users higher levels of openness to experience are responsible for their enhance self reported creativity and convergent thinking test performance it is not necessarily that anabas is in creasing the capacity of the brainairies are associate with creativity but rather canvas appears to be increasing and openness and probably doing that in part through lowering anxiety in particular people and that openness is leading to inclusion of more ideas during the de percent thinking process right their willing to consider throwing up more things on the wall to see if they stick to speak in their conclusions they have a really nice statement again all just read of from the paper because they said it better than i ever could quote while mainstream media has propagated the idea that anabas expands the mind and chances creativity our results showed the link between anabas and creativity is largely a serious correlation meaning that it is not the case that anabas increases creativity but an i in i inserted the the but in this quote but driven by differences in personality that are related to anabas use for example openness to experience that are related to both anabas use and augmented creativity this is a real chicken egg argument what o i mean by that what i mean is this paper fines that people who are more open to experience are more likely to use anabas and people who use anabas are going to be more open to new experiences and that commination of features openness to experience and what that openness to new experiences brings enhances the convergent and divergent thinking that is characteristic of the creative process in short anabas increases creativity but through changes in personality that tap into the creative process rather than directly impacting the naval circuits that for instance turn on creativity and i have to say this study is really important because by exploring anabas users not while under the influence of anabas they were able to tap into this very important what i believe to be fact because if you think about a study in which you would have one group using anabas in another group not using anabas and than you give them some tasks that taps into creativity you will see effects and very likely you will see effects were anabas might even increase divergent converge thinking i creativity that those results have actually been publish many times before but given the varied effects of anabas and tease see that we talked about earlier or all that complex signaling stuff you can imagine that there will also be other studies than in fact there are where divergent in conversion thinking and creativity is not assisted by canals and might even be reduced by investing anabas however if one considers that divergent thinking is absolutely crucial to the creativity process and the range of things that one will explore will be enhanced by openness and by reduce levels of anxiety a willingness to explore different option some of which might seem completely crazy and anabas increases the personality types and reduces the anxiety that create that sense of openness well then it makes perfect sense why anabas would increase creativity in certain individuals but not directly and this study the one i just refer to which i should say was publish in the journal consciousness and cognition again will pro providalink to it did a wonderful job of teasing out this impact of anabasis on personality which then impacts creativity if somebody asks you or if your wondering or if you feel anabas increases creativity in some sense the answer is yes but the answer is yes because of the ways that it shapes openness to new ideas and can should a can because not in everybody but can in some individuals reduce anxiety what this means is that if you are somebody who experiences anxiety or increase levels of focus from anabas regardless of the strain hin hereafter to imagine people are exploring different strains of their exploring them at all exploring different modes of deliveries smoking or instable et camera if your somebody who experiences anxiety it is very likely that you will not have the increased openness to experience and divergent ideas that will facilitate creativity however few are somebody who achieves heighten levels of relaxation and reduce levels of anxiety from anabas regardless of which strain we happen to be talking about will then yes it will position you to be in a heightened state of creativity at least as defined by converge in diversion thinking one of them more characteristic or i should a stereotype qualities of people that smoke aloutomarowana or in just anabas through other means is there changed patterns of speech in fact there is a kin of a lore in the clinical realm that you can predict or get some strong indication as to whether or not somebody is a anabasis user pot smoker based on their voice and the particular tone of voice and their lack of inflection there is lost speculation here but fortunately it is been studied i to discuss now whether or not anabas can impact patterns of speech both acutely meaning while under the influence of anabas and over time in chronic canabasusers and when i say chronic cannabis use i want o be very specific what i mean chronic anabas use does not necessarily mean that people are smoking anabas or investing anabas every day although certainly if they are that qualified s chronic use chronic use is regular use over time of anywhere from twice a week or more using anabas once a month would not be considered chronic use even of its for many many years using anabas are in busting anabas in some way or form twice a week would be considered chronic use an of course someboyou gout there are going to ask me to split hairs and they will were of somebody uses it twice a month well listen a the clinical literature and the scientific nature do not get a that specific and of course there an infinite number of ways to arrange ones a canvas use for everything from zero none at all to constantly everyday all day never where in between but think of chronic use as twice a week or more think of occasional use as less than that and realize that within the realm of yuan chronic use souse me that or more can anywhere from twice a week to every day to just in the evenings et camera the effects of chronic use of anabas as i just defined it on speech have been studied because of this characteristic drawing out of certain syllables a slowing of speech and in many cases a total change ere alteration in the way that people speak and use language both when under the influence of anabas and when not under the influence of anabas if they are chronic users and here we really want to distinguish between t h c and c b d and just make it really simple and say that c b d is not responsible for most of the psychoact of effects of anabas were as t h c is and again the ratio of c b d do t h c is going to be relevant there but let us just think about anabas and t h c as one and the same for this portion of the discussion realizing the course they are not exactly the same thing there is an excellent study entitled adults with history of recreational can misuse have altered speech production we will provide a link to that first author madam vocal really this a paper it was published in the journal drug and alcohol dependants we will provide a link to it for you if you would to peruse it in more detail the title itself adults wit the history of recreational anabas use have altered speech production a tells you pretty much everything you need to know except there is some important wants in here because as i mentioned early or people who smoke saliva varieties of anabas oftentimes will become more talkative much more talkative however whether not people tend to rely on saliva anabas use or indict anabas use there is a very consistent finding that people who are chronic users again twice a week or more recreational use or medicinal use undergo pretty profound changes in the way that they speak but in a very specific said of ways no first of all the changes in speech should not surprise us at all because both saliva varieties of anabas and intima varieties of anabas impact those brain centers involved in movement the banal ganglia remember the go logo circuitry the circuitry that makes you want to do things and the circuitry that makes you want to withhold action and it tends to shift the body and brain toward more inaction and anabas impacts see be one receptors in the cerebellum which is involved in motor planning execution and balance regardless of whether not people are using anabas of the saliva or the indict variety there are disruptions in motor circuitry and as you may have heard if you listen to our episode with rockofeller professor doctor a larvas who works on speech and movement speech is movement right the movements of the mouth the movements of the hands those are intimately related in terms of our speech in fact the centers of the brain involved in hand movements a part of the speech areas an vice verse ericashy point out that if you put your hands behind your back provided you normally do have use of your hands it actually will reduce your fluidity of speech an men o put them back in front of me now the point is smoking marowana or consuming marijuana by edible changes one's speech and does in a very specific way and in the study by madam vogalland colleagues they explored a huge different variety of aspects of speech and this can be done using spectral processing which is fancy nerve speak for looking at how much inflection there is are la looking at how long people hold vowels or consonants et camera and again these are people not under the influences of anabas but rather people who tend to be under the influence of anabas when not participating in the study another words chronic recreational anabas users what are the two major shifts that anabas causes on our patterns of speech or the first one is a change in what is called spectral tilt can that is fancy nerves speak for vocal effort in intensity ism not a nonsmoker i confess but if i were to say the sentence vocal effort and intensity are important components of speech that is the way i would say that sentence if i was striving to enunciate very carefully and to accent certain words and syllables a pot smoker or somebody h uses recreational anabas fairly often would have reduce spectral tilt a c vocal effort intensity and might say spectral tilt is vocal effort and intensity and it differ between groups and appear to change in line with the duration of abstinence from anabas use that i think is not a far cry from the change in spectral tilt that they observed here in addition there are changes in verbal timing that is pronunciation of words and accenting particular syllable of words in people that consume anabas or smoke anabas rather then emphasize particular words within a sentence again it'll just use a sentence from the paper that you can gain more knowledge from the paper anabas and it'll say it the way that i would say it since i not a anabas user anabas marina is the most commonly used illicit drug in the world with a privately four per cent of adults age fifteen to sixty four years reporting recent use and the citation is from the united nations office on drugs and crime twenty ninety that would be the way that i would typically read that sentence and having gone into the date on this paper and of course a valuated references therein and listen to some of the spectral analysis that they include as data you can literally go into these papers me line in here recordings of people who are canvas users or non minibus users and it'll try and give you a a clear sense without picking an extreme example of how somebody who is a a fairly consistent or even occasional canvas user might read that very same sentence anabas maruwana is the most commonly used elicit drug in the world with approximately four per cent of adults age fifteen to sixty four years reporting recent use and the citation comes from the united nation office on drugs in crime twenty nineteen now you will notice that was not a dramatic difference and of course i could have taken the liberty to pick an extreme example of the sort that they did occasionally observe in a valuating subjects for this paper i could have said something anabas maruwana is the most commonly used bliss drug but frankly that would have been selecting an outlier example and i do not want to do that i don't wan to skew the data as they say rather if you heard the first time i read the sentence and the second time i read the sentence what is mainly different is the different in the amount of enunciation and accenting of particular words and symbols within a sentence the total content that is delivered is exactly the same and while i was not measuring my pace the overall rate of communication is essentially the same but there is less sort of lilting and falling of the voice in less accenting that is the major consistent effect of anabas use now of course there are examples of people who are using a lot of anabas and it impacts brain centers involved in movement in speech much that they really do have the really drawn out kind of naan oftentimes this will be detected in the laugh of there is the sort of stereotypical sooner laugh as it sometimes called rather than say ha ha or that is a fake laugh obviously a i it is hard to make myself laugh if something is not actually one enough to something of something funny people say ha that is of a bit more of the way i my laugh ha sort of the inspiratory laugh or the ha which is expiatory laugh people who use canvas chronically will often do the right which is sort of the back of the throw it sort of this the a it is neither inspiratory nor oratory laugh and believe are not there's an entire literature on inspiratory inhaling versus expiatory laughs and theirs also literature on anabasis altering the pattern of inspatorian expiatory laughs it almost sounds a sarcastic laugh when in fact they may not be feeling sarcastic at all and i have a very close friend and colleague whose a phenomenal euro surgeon and air scientists by the name of doctor adychanghes the sure of neurosurgery at u cyan f and his lab and him are expert in the study of nauru science controlling language and speech and he often tells me that he can predict with almost certainty whether not somebody is a regular anabas user base not just on the patterns of speech that they use but even just by recording specific neurons in their brain that underlie the laugh reflex and certain patterns of speech this idea that anabas use changes durability to speak an enunciate clearly does appear to be true and the stereotype that anabasis use tends to create more of a drill or cinema if you will a laziness in the laugh and some of the reflective denunciations that people use does also appear to be true and i say all that of course with the caviar that many people out there will know individuals or perhaps you yourselves are individuals that may use anabas but that have incredible articulation probably better than mine and better than other people out there who speak for a living ism not saying that one hundred per cent of people that shush anabasis regularly cannot speak well or clearly that simply not what i am saying and i do not want to communicate that idea at all but it is the case that people who are regular canibisusers are impacting the normal circuits involved in movement movement also control speech and therefor anabas is impacting speech now i to turn our attention to whether not anabasis can increase sexual activity sexual desire and or sexual function workmen o be talking about libido about sexual desire and about effects of anabas on hormones and while this might sound a discussion that purely oriented towards recreational use of anabas that is people using anabas to in heightened or increase their sense of arousal for sexual activity it actually ventures into the clinical realm to meaning there have been excellent previewed studies that ill describe to you in a moment exploring the use of canasta or the s more specifically for something called hyperactive sexual desire disorder which refers to a persistent or recurrent deficiency or absence of sexual fantasies and thoughts and or desire for or receptivity to sexual activity this is a disorder that is fairly common anywhere from six to nine per cent of people both males and females used to be considered higher prevalence in females than in males but now those numbers seem to be evening out basically there are anywhere from six to nine per cent of people out there who have very diminished sexual devil ire and a number of those people are interested in figuringout ways to increase their amount of sexual desire and of course their people in the general population who may not have hyperactive sexual desire disorder who are interested in using cannabis recreational in order to increase their desire for or their experience of sexual activity ow first we have to acknowledge that sexual desire and activity is a complex set of processes meaning its not just one event sex the verb it involves arousal it involves sex the verb and it involves a whole set of mine sets and emotional states that very tremendously between individuals but once again we can distill out a few basic principles and i should emphasize these are by no means the only chemicals and neral circuits involved in the sexual arches will call it desire the act of sex et camera but they are sensual to it they are vital to it they would be considered what i would call necessary but not sufficient case they'll be other chemicals involved to but the main chemicals and neral circuits are those involved in dopamine the called mesolymbic reward pathway in particular a bring structure called nucleus recumbent which will talk about more in a moment is vital to all motivated behaviors and to the seeking out of all particular types of pleasurable experiences and sexes no exception when we hear that the nucleus acumen is activated that almost always means that dopamine has been released in that area and other airs of the brain anybody and we can consider dopamine central to the desire for pursuits of and act of sex in addition to that their molecules oxytocin which revolved in pardoning and their going to be neural circuit specific to the oxytos and circuitry but in terms of sexual arousal and sexual behavior it is really the dopamine pathway in this uncles scumbags which are especially vital that allows us to address the question does cannabis increase decrease or have no effect on sexual desire and or the ability to have sex and therein we will find some very interesting answers because once again it will point to the fact that the effect of minibus on different individuals can be highly divergent meaning in one set of individuals cannabis will make them far less anxious and in another set of individuals the same strain of cannabis at the same dosage will make them extremely anxious the same can be said also of sexual activity and this was beautifully illustrated in the contexts of sexual desire in the journal psychopharmacology in a paper publish in twenty seventeen the title of this paper is individual prolactin reactivity modulates response of nucleus recumbent to erotic stimuli during acute cannabis intoxication an ephemera pilot study give a little bit of a definition to some of the terms in the title that will make it easier for you to understand the paper but then it'll just march to the results because they are very straightforward and easy to understand and very interesting efimori is just functional magnetic residents imaging basically subjects in this experiment came in to the laboratory they were either people who had not used anabas before or who had used anabas before they were place into a brain scanner one of these enamor devices it looks a tube that people are backed up in to on a and then they can view images and there and their brain can be imaged without having to remove any skull or drill into the call no burro surgery the participants in this study were grouped according to whether not they had experienced any aphrodisiac effects during the intoxication with canada that would be the first group group a they literally call it group a for aphrodisiac and then the second group and this the only thing i do not about the studies rather than call it group b they called them group non a which is a just gets a little confusing it'll try and simplify we this they are two groups and one group experiences sexual arousal when under the influence of anabas t h c specifically the other group does not it turns out this is a very commonly observe divergence of of facts of anabas some people experience a lot of sexual arousal from anabas and t in particular and some people do not in fact they experience suppression of sexual desire and it is always been elicit mysterious as to why that is well in this study they showed people in both groups erotic images and they measured sexual arousal through a number of different measures we will not go into all that it was largely subjective there been other studies where they have actually measured things erections and males and visional lubrication and females this are called autonomic responses that people cannot layabout a a to speak and that tap into otheraspects of the called sexual arousal process in this study they also took blood samples to look at the concentration of things can avoids this is a really nice studying that these measured how much t h c was in the blood stream in different individuals who reacted to these erratic stimulate different ways and they measured hormones namely carts all which is a stress harmony which tends to negatively correlate with sexual arousal an prolactin and the interesting take away from the study was that for people and it did not matter if it was males or females cause they looked at both for people that experience elevated prolactin levels under anabas intoxication that is how they referred to it people take anabas they measure protect and some people had elevated protect an some people did not for the people that had elevated levels of prolactin they did not observe activation of brain areas associate with sexual arousal in this case the right lucky recumbency of to n lies recomb gully be called one on each side the brain and the activation of that granary is strongly associated with dopamine and with arousal and sexual rows in particular in the study and if people at elevated prolactin they did not experience activation of needles summons and they did not report feeling sexually arouse to those pictures at least not to the same degree as the other group some peoples prolactin levels go up when they in jest anabas and those people do not achieve elevate levels of sexual arousal when under the influence of anabas even if their looking at erotic stimuli that make sense because protect in is mutually inhibitory as wed say its again a pushball with opening when opening levels are high poland in levels ten to below and when prolactin levels are high dopamine levels ten to below the other group called group a that experience elevated levels of sexual arousal when under the influence of anabas and viewing euraudic stimuli that group did not show elevated levels of prolactin in response to anabas this i believe resolves a long standing controversy in the field which is does anabas increase sexual arousal well it depends if you fall into the category of person who has elevated levels of prolactin in response to anabas then no actually anabas will suppress your sexual response and desire if however you are in the category of person that does not have elevated levels of placet in in response to anabas will then fraud i stimuli can potentially and in fact do increase sexual arousal in the majority of individuals now many of you are probably hearing this and wondering whether or not you fall in to one category of individual or another and the anything here to understand is that levels of protect in heading into the study did not predict did not predict whether not people would respond to anabas with elevated or non elevated or even reduce levels of sexual arousal it was whether not peoples protect in levels when up or did not go up that predicted whether not their levels of arousal would go up or not if you are somebody who yes does experience elevated levels of sexual arousal and function when under the influence of anabas that is very likely that anabas does not increase your prolactin levels at least not to a significant degree while you are taking it and if you are somebody who does not experience increases in sexual arousal or function or even diminish sexual arousal and function when under the influence of anabas it is very likely the anabas is increasing your levels of prolactin unfortunately there is no way to nowhere predict based on some other measure i think the outcome measure that is increased or not increase or even reduce sexual arousal is really the lines test by which one can figure that out while we are on the topic of the effects of anabas on sexual function and hormones prolactin probably worth mentioning the minibus has been studied extensively for its impact on other hormones and we can summarize those literature in the following way and here on referring to studies only on adults will talk about the developing brain an body in a obit but it is very clear that smoking canaibus increases prolactin levels very very clear now you might say did not you just describe a study about a set of individuals whose prolactin did increase and as a consequence there level sexual desire went up yes there are subset of individuals for which that true but people who smoke canvas do experience increases in prolactin and that especially pronounced in people that smoke minibus more than twice a week this is important prolactin as a referred to earlier is reciprocal r mutually in history with dopamine one way to think about this is in the contacts of the normal sexual arousal arc whereby dopamine is increased when people are sexually roused but then after orgasm both in males and females prolactin levels skyrocket this is actually what creates the called refractory period for mails during which they cannot achieve erection again for some period of time that relates directly to how long the prolactin increase lass prolactin is also increased in new parents of all species including humans which at least partially explain some of the reported or typical reductions in sexual desire and activity in new parents now therefore other reasons for that two sleep deprivation but nature is smart and has arranged a set of hormones and circuits in the brain and body such that when tending to a newborn is the most important thing it relegates it reduces the importance of producing more children and sexual activity in those moments and days and weeks sometimes longer when prolactin levels are up douma levels are down smoking marijuana more than twice a week significantly increases prolactin there are fewer studies exploring weather not edible marijuana has the same effect although the preliminary evidence suggest that it does not i get into this in a lot more detail in a future episode all about hormones with doctor calumet who is been on this podcast before but he verified that and my read of the literature is that the edible forms of marowana minibus probably again let us put an astrict next to this but it appears do not have as much of a protect in elevating effect and therefore not as much of a dopamine suppressive effect and therefore not as much of a testosterone suppressing effect and that gets the issue of to stostrone does minibus marijuana suppress o estrone and this is a very controversial literature and hers why some studies s ay yes it suppresses testosterone in males and females and keep in mind that testosterone and females is vital for libido and cognac function cellar repair et camera s noxious important in males of course however other studies say that anabas does not decrease testosterone and it seems to depend on weather not the anabasis is brought into the system by way of smoking or enable and it seems to depend on weather r not the anabas is used chronically by an individual or acutely and here i just want dugout and say that studies on anabas or drugs of any kind in humans are really complicated if you think about it one has to come into the laboratory and lets say you want ta study chronic anabas use we cannot keep them in the laboratory all the time you have to rely on their self report of how often they use anabas and in what form and you cannot really control from one individual to the next of how much anabas and t either bring into their system one person might smoke canvas out of a bong and take big deep unolungsful bong in relations or such other people might smoke joints other people might use edibles it becomes very complicated to know what people have done and that their reporting accurately and no joke here especially if marinas impacting the short turn memory systems they might not actually remember they might not be tracking it that well contrasts that with studies of the acute use of anabas and t we where people who are not regular users come into the laboratory and now suddenly with institutional guide lines and safety protocols are under the influence of t s in anabas will now you are dealing with a person who may not have experience with the elevated heart rate and blood pressure that characteristic of anabas cause it is a stimulant at least when initially brought into the system even if it might eventually to relaxation now you got som one who is anxious or somebody who's not anxious is deeply relaxed your try to study these effects its of it is a moving target of sorts and very complicate to study marijuana and anabas in its various derivative in this way now you can probably appreciate better as to why there little wants data about retina verses indict verses different rations of seedy an to its really difficult to do these studies in the first place that said the general rules are smoking marijuana increases prolactin an men and women which will reduce dopamine and testosterone smoking marijuana chronically meaning more than twice a week does appear to reduce testosterone significantly and elevate called aromatic's enzymes to the ensiles that convert testosterone into estrogen this might partially explain the effect that occurs in about thirty five per cent of males which is ganacamastio which is a development of breast tissue in males in particular young males who have elevated levels of testosterone or who are taking exogenous testosterone for teststero replacement therapy or if they are taking hypos is animal i steroids or in females that increase in breast size which is due to additional l estrogen from testosterone converted to estrogen it does appear that mariwanan minibus increase estrogen reduce testosterone increase prolactin specify in chronic users now i am sure that some lout there will say well their testosterone levels are exceedingly high or they are fine meaning the constellation of symptoms associated low testosterone an elevate estrogen are not present in them that probably means one of two things or both they either had elevate levels of testosterone to begin with their sealing was higher bringing it down did not have that much of effect or that they have very low levels of aromatastes in their system there are some anecdotal evidence that smoking particular parts of the marijuana plant in particular the feds can increase a romatastes and the conversion of testosterone estrogen i think in the old days the lower was the seeds make you sterile and i think that was related to what i just told you this increase in conversion of testosterone estrogen there's a vast literature on the effects of minibus on fertility it does seem yes it does seem to alter sperm motility and sperm health and function when taking chronically more than twice per week in particular hidroses of high potent t c the i something we will cover an farmers detail on a future episode all about fertility and in females there is an increase in estrogen as a consequensof smoking marijuana and increasing prolactin in estrogen in parallel whether not that detrimental is in clear although i point out that elevated estrogen and prolactin can be associated again can be associated not necessarily and certainly not causative but can be associated with elevate levels of or frequency of breast cancer detection minibus and its effects on hormones are not without consequence there are effects of minibus on cortical in some individuals it greatly increases cortical to the anxiety and paranoia it can create and in other individuals it reduces cortical again we have these divergent effects but i want to be very clear the effects on prolactin meaning elevated protect in the effects on testosterone meaning at least most studies point to refuse levels of testosterone and increased estrogen that seems to be true from most all individuals that chronically use canvas whereas the effects on cortisaltan to be divergent cannibal increases cortical an some individuals and decreases cortical and others in general increases in cortical that are on going are not healthy for us and on and then of course there are other effects on hormones anal just briefly summarize those that t h c in particular not s b d but t h in particular is known to be strongly inhibitory for something called ganatatrope an releasing hormone this is a hormone that is released from the brain from the hypothalamus that then feeds on too where i should say signals to the pituitary gland which is also near the proud for your mouth lotistof happening or the refer mouth that turns out biologically and reduce levels of ganadatrope and releasing hormone caused by anabas use reduce levels of anlace utilizing hormone a nephew age which reduce levels of testosterone and sperm production in males and egg health and ovulation and menstrual function and females now i am sure there are number of women out there who will say they have perfectly normal menstrual psyches to spite using anabas ism surely not can dispute that but if you are somebody who thing to maximize fertility or regulate or balance hormones merouana an anabas reduces gear age that is the ganadatrope and release from the hypofhalmas and thereby reduces utilizing hormone and physical stimulating hormone which are released from the pituitary and travel in the blood stream to support normal ovarian function and health and normal testicular function and health in females and males respectively up until now have been discussing the biological and psychological effects of anabas now i to shift our attention to some of the negative health effects of anabas and shine light on some of the individuals or groups out there that need to be especially wary of and probably avoid canals use entirely including ingestion of anabas by a way of animal and i frame things that way because i think there are is an increasingly large number of people out there that appreciate that smoking tobacco or smoking anabas raping tobacco yes raping tobacco or raping anabas each and all have negative health consequences on the lungs and on the called and tethelial cells of the body the cells that take up the calculates are the capillaries and blood vessels if you do not already know that it'll make it very clear andi'll make it very brief whether not you smoke or tape tobacco or anabas you are severely impairing the function of andethelial cells that make up the capillaries and blood vessels of your brain and body and that is known to decrease connive capacity over time increase probability of strokes severely impact lung function and also lead to things puerperal nauropothes it leads to sexual dysfunction because of lack of blood flow to the anabas can lead to other aspects of reproductive damage including to the ovaries invested essentially there is no other way to state it except that smoking and raping have negative health consequences that are independent of the substances that people are trying to get into their blood stream by smoking are raping people smoke in tape tobacco and people smoke in tape anabas and in both cases if we just set aside the direct effects of tobacco and the direct effects of anabas we can confidently say that the process of smoking of inhaling smoke into the lung and yes also raping bringing the chemicals that transport nicotine or in this case cannabis in the lungs by way of raping are both severely detrimental to any etheolial selves i think a few years ago when raping was not as prominent there was this question and this idea that may be raping was going to be far healthier or at least not as bad as smoking but now we can see a huge number of negative health effects of raping some of which are distinct from the effects of smoking if you more information on smoking verses raping please c the episode that i dido nicotine we will also do an entire episode all about raping in the future but there is really no way to sliced and diced or candy cot it the fact of the matter is that smoking has clear and severe negative health consequences regardless of whether not your smoking tobacco or cannabis t h c and raping has negative health consequences whether or not you're using the tape to bring in nicotine or t h c or some commination of t h and c b d simply the way it is with that said now i to focus our attention on the direct effects that cannabis has either by way of t h c action or by way of c b d action in terms of positive or negative health effects on the brain and body and we are going to explore that first as a function of age and the reason we are going to do that is related to a fact that i mention the beginning of the episode which is that the c b one and the c b two receptors the two receptors for cannabis to which t h c n c b d and c b and and all other cychlactof compounds of cannabis bind to to have their actions are present throughout development believe it or not they are present very soon after conception and the c b one and s b two receptors actually play a critical roll in the development of the feds now you might wonder why that is because of course the developing feds does not necessarily expect to c cannabis or to be exposed to cannabis in t h c n c b d but as you recall in erogenous canabinoids are present in the adult brain and body and in erogenous canabinois it turns out are also present in the developing fetus in fact indigenous canabinois are present at much greater levels than the developing fetus than they are after a child is born and levels of indigenous canabinois actually go down across development i find this really interesting what this means is that in erogenous canabinois an activation of the s b one and s b two receptors are in internal part of neral development and this is going to become a specially relevant in considering whether r not pregnant mothers shower should not use cannabis or c b d and it also points to some very interesting biology in terms of how the brain develops and how the body develops now the development of the brain and nervous i stem and body is a fascinating and vast literature certainly far too vast to cover in to day's episode especially at this late hour as it were but we will have a future episode all about brain development in terms of the effects of cannabis it sufficient to say that canabenoind receptors are present and active in the developing feeds they a present and active in the new born they are present active adolescence and across that time from conception until adolescence in dogenists canavenois are mainly responsible for the actions of those conabenoid receptors during that time the canavonoied receptors are having very specific effects that are distinct from their effects later in life and those effects can largely be explain interns of neural development again we do not have time for an entire lecture on this now but during development your body was a collection of a bunch of cells its actually called a blastula which means a ball of cells and then those cells actually have to grow out connections and duplicate themselves and this is a very interesting process by which neurons initially are situated far apart and then they grow out connections and make contacts with one another they remove certain connections depending on will kind a life events are exposed to if you have a wonderful event early in life for a dramatic early life those connections change et camera important point for to day's discussion is that the c b one receptor in particular is expressed on every neuron in the developing brain and has been shown to be important for every aspect of neural development from the proliferation of cells meaning getting enough cells to create a brain to the outgrowth of the called accellens of the wires that connect up neurons with one another to the steering the direction at which those acts on go in development which is essential and even far as to explain the connections that form between neurons the called synapses and then how those snaps is work the basic statement here is that indigents canavenois and c b one receptor activation are critical for every aspect of brain wiring and development with that in mind the statement i am about to make is absolutely terrifying at least to me and frankly it should be terrifying to you as well and the statement is the current statistics on cannabis use in pregnant mothers is absolutely shocking the most recent survey of pregnant mothers in united states show that fifteen per cent one five fifteen per cent of pregnant mothers report using cannabis in some form or another either smoking it or more likely ingestion of inedible because they are aware of the negative effects of smoking on the developing needs ingestion of an edible to increase t h c and or c b d during pregnancy which to me i have to say as a developmental norobiologist is frankly it is a it is carry it is absolutely scarred because that c b one receptor is not just of minor player in neral development it is absolutely central to every critical aspect of brain wiring and development now the long termimplications or even the shortcherm implications of this fifteen per cent of mothers self reporting the use of cannabis at some point during pregnancy are not yet known this is as would say a an experiment that is on going but it'd be remiss if i did not point out these data and just implore you please please please if you are pregnant or considering getting pregnant your cannabis user whether not housing edibles if your c b d us or please do whatever it is necessary to not in jest anabas or smoke cannabis or in is c b d during pregnancy now there may be certain clinical indications by which your physician and your of guan and your the p i patrician that will venture be the pediatrician for your your child will prescribe c b d although it is hard to imagine what those are i contacted a number of different pediatricians and of glans and not a single one said they would ever suggested in fact would strongly discourage their patients from using anabas during pregnancy but i think that the advent of edible forms of cannabis and the commination of t h c and c b d an certain products and the fact that most people w c b d as safer because it does not include as or does not have i should say the pcsycholact of effects that t h c does has led to a situation where mayhap fifteen per cent of pregnant mothers using canvas at some point during pregnancy and may be even frequently throughout pregnancy and the effects on the developing fetus are completely unknown but recall that anabas and t h c and c b d out compete meaning they park in the receptor for indigenous can abandons and prevent endogenous can adenoids from having their normal level and pattern of action this is absolutely critical i cannot encourage you enough or rather i should ay i cannot discourage enough the use of anabas and any related compounds in anabas edible or smoke certainly not smoked but even edible during pregnancy and certainly in best feeding lactating mothers the same is all such you recall that anabas and t h c and c b d are incredibly lip of pili they they are fat soluble and they get into cells her very readily and they cross the blood brain barrier they cross the blood parental barrier when i encounter the statistic i had agon wipe my eyes a few times i could not believe it and yet i cross check that number with a few other studies a few others have come in a obit lower it somewhere let thirteen to fourteen per cent if you have come in elicit higher but the average of fifteen per cent is both striking and shocking i do not in how to make the message more clear i hope that is clear please do not use any anabas t h c or related things including c b d smoked or cabal if your pregnant lactating et camera now we are at the point where we need to consider some of the negative health effects of anabas that have been well documented in put reviewed studies and before i do this i want a return to a point that i made earlier which is that nothing i am about to say relates directly to issues of legality if we consider alcohol for instance alcohol is legal in most areas of the world it certainly legal in the u s and yet there is an age limit for its use typically it is not available to people until there twenty one or older its not to say that certain people do not use it before age twenty one but its not legal it is illegal to by possess alcohol consume catchall before age twenty one and i think with good reason because the brain is still developing likewise we can have a in formed discussion about anabas and its various components that can fully acknowledge the reality which is that one of the eager harms of anabas in the past has been the legal ramifications of anabas being legal i that is a statement that is no longer controversial and this is not discussion about legalization or non legalization if you look to the scientific literature the epidemiological literature there are wonderful data out of carton university and elsewhere in canada showing that many of the negative effects of marina and t h c are due to the criminal justice system itself that is the creation of illicit drug businesses the creation of organize crime the creation of a number of different features related to the illegality of anabas and again this is in the topic of to day's episode but that should be acknowledged and at the same time we need to acknowledge that when a compound a drug or whatever one to call it becomes legal there is a tendency to assume that its safe and safe for everybody and with respect to anabas and t h c and perhaps even c b d but certainly for t h c and anabas that smoked or raped or consumed inedible form that is simply not the case there are clear data pointing to negative health effects of anabas sent h c s which again is not to say that there are not plosive effects on mood anxiety pain relief et camera those are out there and they exist and we will mention some of those of course and we have talked about some of those creativity for instance et camera but if we do not acknowledge the negative health effects that are documented in the literature then we are overlooking some very important data especially as it relates to the development of psychosis in certain individuals with that said there are very strong data and i will provide links to these resources pointing to the fact that for people who are chronic users of anabas that is using it twice a week or more that over time their levels of anxiety actually increase and this is true even for individuals that are using strains of anabas that while under the influence of anabas reduce anxiety over time meaning over the course of twelve or more months there is a well documented effect of the anxiety relief that anabas and t initially brought being less and less potent that is people need to smoke more of it or in guest more t h s in order to achieve the same level of anxiety relief and in some cases a switch from anxiety relief to increase in anxiety and again that is increase in anxiety not just when the drug is not being consumed but also while under the influence of the drug why would that be we have to go back to our understanding of the s b one receptor and the potency with which t c binds to that c b one receptor when to is brought into the system over and over again meaning twice a week or more the binding of to that c b one receptor eventually causes a sort of habituation or attenuation of the entire process of binding the receptor in creating the psychoact of effects initially it creates anxiety relief but over time the affinity for the receptor does not change meaning can still parked that slot with a lot of affinity a lot of strength but there are few fewer receptors available and than the signalling that is down stream of those receptors becomes less and less robot now this is a topic we did not get into in too much detail to day because i did not wane include even more biological detail but the s b one receptor is a called g proline coupled receptor it that is a mouthful but a g proving coupled receptor basically is a bucket brigade while some receptors in the brain and body are such that when something a chemical binds to them that receptor has a direct action it opens and allow stuffed a russia to the cell increases the excitability of the cell called fast effects these g proline coupled receptors and s b one is a g proving coupled receptor they are more a bucket brigade where they kick off a process through one molecule thathan is handed off to another molecule that t then is handed off to another molecule it is a long chain or cascade of events those long chains or cascades of events have a lot of opportunity for regulation for adjustment you receptor systems in the brain and body especially receptor systems the canabonoid system that are used to being can have tickled not punched tickled by ndoginists canabonoids everyone in while some binds has an elect but certainly not bound with incredible p potency and over and over again as they are when t c is coming into the system well those systems of entyover time they adjust themselves that the body and those cells can achieve called homeostasis when people are using t c more than twice a week what ends of happening is those reporting coupled receptors in the downstream signaling mechanisms start to adjust themselves and it requires more and more drug either her dosages ore more frequent use and a lot of the positive effects the called decrease in anxiety increase focus increase creativity some of that starts to wain it starts to dissipate and people wonder why they have to use much anabas just to achieve a fraction of the effect that they use to be able to achieve with even a lower dose anxiety is getting worse over time and that is anxiety during the drug use and outside of the drug use some people work around that or try to work around that by using varying strains of anabas or changing the pattern of delivery from you know smoking to raping or from raping to edible and from edibles tried transdermal anyway they go through a lot of gymnastics in writhing and am seeking but none the less anxiety increases over time also it is very clear that depression increases over time and especially this is surprising to me but especially for individuals that were not depressed at the outset of their use inotherwas they did start using anabas because they were depressed but rather the depression starts to emerge as a consequence of the anabas and t use that serious in fact we now know based on really solid epidemiological evidence that depression is not a strong predictor of seeking out anabas it does not drive terribly many people to seek out anabas use but anabas use itself makes people four times likelier to develop a chronic major depression anxiety is increasing depression is increasing and this turns out to be especially relevant important to young people why do i say that well if you look at the data and again i think some of the strongest data or data to come out of the canada system they have done some really beautiful controlled studies i really hope to invite some of the people who ranged and ran those studies as guess on to the supermen that podcast but if you look at the data out of canada re look at some of the data out of northern rope in the us what you find is that the probability that somebody will use anabas and then go on to use it cram chronically corals very strongly with age for instance some of the highest degree of anabas use is among individuals sixteen to twenty four four years old in fact in individuals for sixteen to twenty four years old and in particular in students and people who are working surprising more than in unemployed populations being young sixteen to to nay for at least to me that is young and being a student or working doubles the likelihood that somebody is going to use anabas on a regular basis twice or more per week the typical age of initiating canabuts uses nowadays is about nineteen years old eighteen point seven and about twenty per cent of people in that age bracket of sixteen to twenty four years old are using cannabis daily either by raping by smoking or by edible that is an enormous number at least by my red it is enormous number and here's why it is of really serious concern during the ages of sixteen to twenty four the canabinoid receptors are still available they are not being as strongly driven by indogonists canabinoids but by ingestion of t h c and or c b d there are downstream effects on the signalling within those cells that all the data point to creating a much much higher likelihood of developing major depression severe anxiety or psychosis at later ages to be very clear anabas use between the ages of sixteen to twenty four in both males and females is increasing anxiety increase depression in the immediate years and within the one year's time or much that people are using anabas on going it in attempt to reduce that anxiety and reduce that depression but in addition to that the cannabis use and because of the signalling mechanisms involved are predisposing those individuals to psychosis later in life if you look at individuals who start using canabusts even younger we fourteen or even as young as twelve the probability of psychosis's later in life in particular sis a frantic or sis a frantic episodes more than doubles this is of really serious concern and this is completely aside from any called plosive effects our beneficial effects of canabusts that people might derive from occasionally use as adults meaning people older than twenty five for the person who older than twenty five who eats unstable every ones in while or who smokes canabusts every once in a while and people love to make the argument you notes not as bad as alcohol at which i frankly as he terrible argument because if yous are episode a call calls pretty bad a but even it is just not a good argument that saying that something is good because it is not as bad is something else is simply just not a good or valid argument last not biologically speaking a the use of anabas in young populations is very strongly predisposing people to psychotic episodes and we know the mechanism by which this occurs this is occurs by a thinning of the call gray matter and it is called gray matter because with neurons nerve cells they have a called sell body that is the part that contains the day and manufactures all the narrow transmitters et camera and those ere shipped out to the other parts of the saran than include the acts on the wires between acts on and thoraces on under the microscope because they have a lot of fatty tissue around them and this is healthy fatty tissue that allows electrical transmission to be fast that fatty tissue though those portions of the cells are called white matter see of gray matter and white matter gray matter of the call cell bodies where the done and all the stuff is manufactured white matter or the sort of the acts on to the wires through with all the key components are shipped out to the snaps et camera wonderful data and i do say wonderful because its part of a large scale consortium and we will provide a link to the paper this is publishing translational psychiatry just this year point to the fact that adolescent canabusts use accelerates the thinning of the prefrontal quarter and the gray matter in particulars what this means is while during normal development the gray matter the prefrontal quarter in all the cells there are indeed intended it is a normal process for it to thicken and then thin a little bit as connections are adjusted and people learn and mature and grow up this is part of the normal healthy maturational process independent cannabis use when kids cause these really are kids use anabas in it does not matter the mode of cannabis delivery whether not its raping or smoking or cabal that gray matter thins at a much much greater rate and the reason i this paper publishing translational psychiatry this year much is that they link the amount of cannabis use heavy moderate light or no cannabis use to the rate of prefrontal quartic thinning and it is absolutely clear from these data that the more often young people meaning individuals between the age of fourteen and twenty five the more often they consume or smoke or tape cannabis the faster and the more extreme that quartic thinking is and the cortical thinning is incurring in exactly they are of the brain that is involved in planning in control over one's emotions in reflects in organizing one's life in a number of different ways anywhere from cleaning one's room literally you know knowing what goes were to making plans that extend out through the day through the week through a year essentially becoming a functional human being involves using your prefrontal quarter in a variety of different contact and different s for of time domains the time domain of an hour the time domain of a day making plans in being able to execute plans is fundamental to being a healthy human being and it is absolutely clear from these data that the more canabusts one uses the more impaired those normal circuits are a simply no other way to to view these data in fact much that even small amounts of cannabis use are associated with rates of cortical thinning in degrees of quartic thinking that are really detrimental and concerning for normal cognitive processes if you were somebody who smoked marina or monsoon canals in any form another during a virescence does that mean that your preferential quarters can never be rescued that it cannot come back the short answer is it probably can be rescued to some degree it will depend on how much anabas you were using and how often and what strains of anabas et camera there is really no travelling back in time as my gradurvazare used to say yo time machines are broken least for now we do not have time machine all you can really do is trying emphasize for some all quitting anabas in any form and focusing on behaviors that emphasize end theallial sell blood flow health to the brain that would be cardiovascular exercise adequate nutrition not smoking nicotine and there are number of other things that one can do we will do an entire episode all about trying to reverse the effects of anabas and other drug used during adolescence we moithave time to do a deep dive on that right now but all the things that standardize and kind of promote health adequate sleep a good social connection regular cardiovascular and wit training exercise healthy nutrition what that represents you healthy metabolic function and wait et camera those are all going to facilitate some recovery of brain function in particular prefrontal cortical function by way of all the plosive effects at those behaviors and choices have but with that said if you are in the age bracket that have been referring to this fourteen to twenty five world age bracket and you are a occasional even or chronic cannabis user you should be very very careful and concern about the long term effects that potentially have that statement is bolstered by another statistic which is that unlike a lot of other drugs the rate of anabas use is strongly related to how dangerous people perceive anabas to be that might seem obvious on the one hand if you think something is very very dangerous you would expect that the probability that somebody would use it would be very very low and if they think something is safe the probability would be high but that is not necessarily the case if you think about it anabas is a unique instance in which nowadays we are hearing yes it is becoming legal in a umber of areas and we talked earlier about why that is probably a good thing in most circumstances but that we are not just hearing that anabas is safe or it is not joust being implied that cannabis is suffer but many more people are talking about the positive effects of anabas without a lot of discussion about the negative effects of anabas and i realize that saying this is going to upset some people out there because i know that there are number of people who fought very hard for the legalization process and our want of knowledge that i also wont to acknowledge the many known positive effects of anabas in adults with very occasional use provided it is delivered safely and in the safe contact and setting and with legality that is entirely distinct from the issue of weather not cannabis is safe for the developing brain and body again ism not demonizing anybody for using cannabis but i want to make the point very simply and very directly it is far and away a different circumstance for the brain for an individual to be twenty five years or older and using cannabis in whatever form occasionally or maybe even frequently then it is for a young person aged fourteen to twenty five to be using cannabis either by smoking or raping or by edible or any other form on the brain and body it is absolutely clear that the brain continues to develop at least until aged twenty five and that a huge number of systems related to mood regulation called executive function the ability to organize one's thoughts plan and execute plans sumecily to be come a functional human being that is one portion of becoming a functional human being but certainly i an essential one all of that relies on the fine tuning of this neral circuitry that we have been talking about up until now and it is abundantly clear the cannabis and t c in particular dramatically disrupt those processes if this is en clear enough just from my statements i to point to of particular paper this is one of the more impactful papers in this area recent years sos ha paper published in lancet psychiatry in twenty twenty two title is association of cannabis potency with mental ill health in addiction a systematic review there number of very important points in this very fine paper lets it psychiatry is one of the permeate medical journals out there and they evaluated a huge number of studies they shy looked at more than four thousand studies they selected the ones that were only the most rigorous and terms of study design and analysis and rigor of conclusions and they looked at how early use of anabas impacted later probability of development of psychosis and other psychiatric conditions and the airways from this study are very clear first of all chronic cannabis use more than twice per week has consistently been associated with mental health disorders an pulling some phrases directly from the paper heavy cannabis use meaning anabas use more frequent than twice per week has been associated with four times the risk of psychosis later in life in particular skitzophrenia and by polar episodes now we have done an episode on by polar disorder socle by polar depression we have not yet done one on skis phrenic but both by polar disorder and schisifhrenia have a very very strongtionetic component there is a thirty three zero thirty times greater likelihood that you have by polar disorder if you have a first relax i as by polar disorder and then it is also the case that using anabas especially during adolescence and the teen years and up until age twenty five create a four times greater risk of psychosis for those that have a predisposition to by polar disorder and or skis aphelia now i do not here very much about this in the media this paper got some attention and then sort of a got swept away i do not think that was an intentional sweeping way there just a lot of events in the world as you a well known but i think it is a particularly important set of findings because obviously it in looking at many studies it distills out the strongest findings that are out there and really pulls the the the consistent messages that deriving from all these different studies and as they point out and again ism paraphrasing here this is the first systematic review of the association of anabas potency and all of the at a point to a very clear conclusion which is the more potent the t c concentration the higher probability of developing psychosis or a major depress of episode or a major anxiety disorder later in life that should be of particular concern because we know we are absoluteclear about the fact that with the advent of all these new strains of anabas and with the engineering and availability of anabas at much higher potency meaning t c potency the risk of psychosis is going up and up and is likely to continue going up unless something is done to reduce the frequency of anabas use to zero ideally or to very low frequency very low potency in adolescence and teens an people age twenty five or younger i know a lot of people do not want to hear this message because first of all it is alarming and second of all as i mentioned earlier the statistics tell us that the greatest number people that are starting to use anabas are in the age bracket of sixteen to twenty four many of them are functional an other airs of life their students they are employed et camera but when you couple that with the fact that the most frequent adaptors of cannabis use are in this age bracket of sixteen to twenty four their twice is likely to use as other individuals or to start using anabas as are other individuals plus the general perception out there because of the way that anabas is discussed in the media and by sports figures and by celebrities and by by politicians et camera that it is not as bad as alcohol and may be not that bad and may be even has health benefits then you are essentially setting up a system where young people are far more likely to adopt and continue anabas use without realizing these serious health consequences that await them later with all of that said i of course again want to acknowledge that they are a been well demonstrated effects of anabas for reducing pain in particular in chemotherapy and in the contact of reducing nausea in people suffering from cans orachemotherapy there is a well known effect that one can generally point to as positive using canabusts for things glaucoma for lowering interocular pressure and offsetting the loss of neurons that would lead to blindness although there are other tools of course the don't evolve cannabis use that can accomplish that as well called interocular pressure lowering drugs and drops there are is a list of probably a dozen or more psychological and bodily ailments that can be aided by cannabis use in particular edible cannabis use of particular strains i of course am going to a dress each in every one of those episodes where ism talking for instance about i disease or about chronic pain i m in no way shaper form trying to rob the incredible efforts of the laboratories and people that have works very hard to study and establish the valid uses of cannabis for treating various ailments and that continue to study cannabis in order to try in ameliorate the symptoms of different ailments but today i really wanted to emphasize the biology of cannabis some of the often discuss effects i guess one could can them posit effects things can wants creativity and really point to the neuaunts and actually the divergence of people who take cantus and some experience heighten levels of creativity and some do not some people experience hight levels of special arousal and some people experience the exact opposite and on and forth rather than focus on all the potential positive and sort of emerging positive data about cannabis indifferent medical contacts and at the same time i strongly feel that it is important to acknowledge the shocking because there is really no other way to describe it the shocking effects of cannabis use on the developing feeds and the fact that many pregnant and lactating mothers are using anabas an that number fifteen per cent still has me in dizzy with kind of disbelief and yet we need to acknowledge this and address this immediately and i think it is vital to understand that cannabis use through any delivery mechanism smoking or raping or edible or otherwise is very very concerning in fact dangerous to the developing brain certainly for the feudal brain in for the baby brain but also for the adolescent brain and for the teen and young adult brain notions because of the effects that can have in the immediate term those slow creeping increases in anxiety and depression proud on by cannabis use but also the time release if you will on the development of psychosis and other types of major psychiatric disorders later in life i acknowledge we have covered a lot of ground to day and yet there still farm more ground that we could have covered and that we will indeed cover in future episodes nevertheless if you

happen to ale payoff ale is seventeen years old he moved to the guess from a small town in the u crane when he was nine he is skinny and where's tied o tea shirts and unmanageable spray of frizzy blond hair and a valiant if not altogether successful starter mustache and where he can probably into duce himself better than i can here is how we rest pose when i asked him to state his name for the record i am is ale jar and a loft have very radical experiences in life and i consider myself to pier second relic artistically for ductile person here a few other things by a he lives with his cute older girl friend an his exceptionally patient parents and a small apartment in the midway section of brooked instead of going to high school he is enrolled in an internet homeschooling program he is at work on a science fiction novel and his let several hundred inside hours as a student piled but most of ale is time is spent as ha guitars singer an songwriter for his band he buffalo when i went to see them play at a two day russia work festival last fall i learned several thing first there are many many exsoviateim of as living in bookman second they all very earnestly on aloft and third ale jarofv whether he is riving on his back on stage or reclining in the dressing room with a beer an a cigarette is kind of a superstar before we get to our story the other see person on the to meet a someone who entered ale's life at a crucial moment years ago when ale first came to the states ale had an awkward adjustment he fought in school on this kind of depressed he was bored then one day ale was walking along the brighten beech board walk and saw a group of olderguyz collecting money for something called the russia punk rockclub of america older guys twenty five and thirty years old ale was twelve one of the musicians he met that day was roman goes off who immediately took to the young ale well he had dish blink in his eyes it is sometimes you see extra inner person and a you kind of knowledge he was not a peertlize is felt year old a detriment at twelve years old he was right in sons that i was writing at at eighteen and a of the list we of living together old attack li call concdusha that is what dies that mean crushes means list little big little enlighten under his new friends tutelage ale began walking around in an old bolshevik style hat and trench coat and his friends gave him books dostaevsky talking guides to logic paganism the beats and also robins ceruse an treasure island ale was particularly fond of those win our story to day our own seafaring talk happens on a boat that roman on the twenty five foot white sailboat which ales like to refer to as the yacht one cool eking last may ale roman and another friend named ale ale slewbachonsky decided to take a nice little boat trip in to make a bay the body of water that wraps around the southern end of brookland he was ale the three of us decided to just get tan gallons of ass and my friend roman he a t a bottle of rum and we got two fans o food and we just decided to have a cool trip on on the yacht and the i started saying oh our go as the open ocean we let us sail to poland i told this roman had a slightly less ambitious agent blend was just to goa to the breech under the reck away bridge then turn around and then come back it should have taken about the floating in it yet thing started to go wrong almost immediately for they even left the marina roman who would been making headway through the bottle of rum feel in to the water and they had to haul hin back in he was clearly an no shape to drive this is ale can he got drunk and he just was babbling something laughing he said do not go there do not go there and he was constantly saying do not hit the shallows he was a yous already to nothing he did not console the situation by that time as a responsible journalist i should say for the record that roman does have one objection to ale's version of events it was not therm by t it was at conga i do not know we everybody put true it was at kayak you sure i was at let reck yes i was at reck gonna i do not know how come its become from it is for ale told was from but it was gonna not a little bit it was a looking was out of on i was out of condition ale and ale had had a few drinks themselves but we were perfectly sober and everything we might have had a few drinks but we were perfectly sober lyric was have drove but no no but we got a head hauled of it was not that hard we we knew how to drive it i then seem pretty hard turn on the mother et turn the boat at turns cool somehow they managed to get out of the marina gun the engine and take off across the water toward the marine part bridge in the distance once there they decided to try to sail the brighten beach and headed toward a landmass but they got confused and turned back to open water they drank some rum or maybe conga one way or another they drank a lot of it at one point they almost crashed into a small island guess was running low but they figured that if worse came to worst they could always put up the sails and still make it home then they got caught in a strong current that turned the boat in circles the perfect time you would think to begin to panic or if you are the kind of person who forgets trouble the momentum out of it or even while you are in et the perfect time to shoot off all the boat's flies into the water just for fun finally the series of mistakes reached the critical mass they had no sulphone roman had died when hey fell on the water no fliers no captain and almost no ass even ale had to admit they were in trouble we did not know where we were and then we realized we were not goon make it anywhere and were er in the morning well figure out what to do we e went to sleep it was a glorious spring morning on to make a bay sun glinting off the water gulls calling overhead as our young pleasure cruisers slumbered the light filtering into the boats cabin woke roman and ale glewbachanzky first and they came up on deck what they saw was not good after drifting through the night the boat had come to rest in the shallows of a small bay alongside an uninhabited landmass stretching out behind them they could see a long furrow where the tide had dragged them deep into thick mud and as they stood there blinking and wondering how this might have happened the wind carried them another ten feet inlet they could see the slant o man hazan on the horizon the runways of jam car poured a little closer and signs of civilization in every direction they could even see boats passing by in the distance but these were too far away to take any notice he was obvious that they were in a word she the hung over sailors sat down to decide what to do roman and glubechonsky were in favor of waiting to be rescued or for the tide to rise and pull hem out again meanwhile ale was formulating his own plan beyond the island they were closest to lay another land mass which ale was sore led somewhere his idea was to swim to it walked to civilization catch buss somewhere and bring back helped for his friends who as ale remembers it thought the plan was frankly idiotic these are islands said roman who in truth had actually been out on the bay before him was in a position to know but ale was sure that roman was roll ale stripped to his underwear he put what he thought he might need and a water proof clastic may an at his jar he brought his metrocard for the busses wot a swim to an expired passport for i de and his favorite brutes medal for luck he wrapped his clothes in a celepane blanket and bid his friends farewell roman watched him dish heard to the sir w worst it trike to stop him i tried thou can reasonable thing but he get little bit to much excited i decide to give him a challenge in leg what what should i just knock him down and say stop it you the wanted to sit i you know ye wanted to swim and if he saw he seem i swam really really violently to get myself wormed up and by the middle i got really tired and it was really calling on him a it is it is much worse than i thought and and there is birds flying breaking on me i other crazy strange faraway bird are an a bit nears or something inner and i and i got really lucky because my legs suddenly hid the hid the bottom in i and i got was happy when i came out there i was cold but i was at oh ye and i was definitely sure that i was civilization because told buildings were right behind the trees they were and the bridge was right over there and ism all finally and and and i was even singing a song walking and the birds were screaming something to me and ism yen i made it have still not sure i understand why you left your friends because i thought we were going to be slug there for a really long time make be for the whole day the only thing i could do is just try to get to civilization and especially these island they were they were pressuring me to go there the were close and ism and i got really board i way come in the morning i do notw'at a stay in one spot on the often and then think about how we going to get saved i really want to do something and ism look cam can i have the this little adventure i going go out and try to make it somewhere and i did except he did not soon he realized that he was indeed on another island with no way off except to swim back through the freezing water to rejoin his friends and was not about to do that he was alone ale set about doing all the things a good castaway should do he wrote a grand help in the sand for the benefit of the plains landing at of say he circus navigated the island looking for supplies he found a stick an a piece of red cloth and made a flag to signal passing ships then he found several big pieces of styrofoam and some wood and spent an hour or two fashioning a raft but it collapsed when he sat down on it undeterred he went back to searching for something that would be his tick it off the island and then he found it e was the hollowed out carcass of a pesky were as he calls it a scooter i knew i hundred percent you that i was on a float although is pretty badly dug in to the sand and as i was digging out the shooter something really bad happened there was a pieces of glass under it and did not see i was just digging and digging and i did not have any any shovel or anything and i cut my finger really bad stator getting huge mounts of blood was coming out and a it'd this white tea herder was eventually all in blood now there was really the way off the island even by swimming because willy know sharks it was a galling situation and it was made even more mad cause the city was right there i was thinking how the hell that i get myself into the situation i i never believe that something this could happen in in new york city an is such a huge city that you could see sky o sky scrapers ten miles away and on the other side you can die looking at them and also i got a little mad at the city of new york i couldn't i could understand if they had just one pay from there or at least i do not know a button to press too know that you are there by probably in six o'clock in the evening it was getting a little dark all my excitement has glad away and am i a i got very cold i was shaking and o shivering and no help at all om was this is going to get really bad were you hungry at the pored also i was very hungry and i was very thirsty and i found limes i try to open them up but they tasted last i could not i got isn't even think about end there was no source of food other than the duck i yes the ducks you want i hear about the duck s i was not going going rescued in the next hour or two i had a plan to kill a bunch of ducks to get some warm blood to warm myself you knows to drink some blood and to cut them open and used them to warm myself i had this strange idea about a use them a slippers i even had after that i even had this a relic idea of a floating on the ducks making a rat a raft out of the ducks imagine a a man with ta with string is attached to the ducks a a floating on the water as this duck river n totally normal for a a for a russia hiker to go and pick up a duck and not just to kill it but to eat it i cannot to but you could just over and pick up a duck it how did you catch the duck oh i er you just go after it with a stick i mean your human being you more brains than a duck you can catch but i was not really thinking about doing it i was not fantasizing about killing ducks or anything that i was just thinking that if it comes to that it'll have to all have to get some blood to drink i know it sounds very violent but i was fighting for my life people might laugh when they her about being trapped on an island that is close to civilization and the sharks and the ducks i knew it was funny situation but i really i got the feeling of what what is at being on desert island i felt a robins crush you know i i knew what it was to be by yourself away from civilization with no help and your facing this huge problem and the only person that is near you is you and the the ghost of your death close by you so i can smell the did smell my e smell my death in the air it turned out that the island were alias was transit is called ruffle bar it lies only went minute boat right away from the coast of broodlan far from being aromatized ore ashamed of his exploits ale wanted nothing more than to go back out there and from the vantage of my overpriced undersized department i wanted to see a place where you could be totally alone in the wilderness smelling your own death in the air while in at least theoretical communing distance to midtown and hat we hired a boat to take us to ruffle bar in truth i was not as completely surprised that sun might be to learn that such a place exists i grew up near the islands of jamaica bay in a neighborhood call canary and when i was little my friends and i would cut through the empty locks near my house to explore the miss of trash and nature on the shore line it was a place totally apart from the rest of my mostly urban childhood a secret place that my friends who lived even ten or fifteen blocks away ore unaware existed but then the smaller islands around new york have always occupied a weird place on the edge of the city me to all sorts of enterprise that the citizenry either does not know about or prefers not to city sanitariums and prisons potter's fields and grand failed schemes ruffler itself hade been the side of several of the ladder since the civil war at house the ferry stop resort hotel and even a short lived on community of some forty build n we stopped in front of a concrete foundation building of on find was a that the this is a cooking this is one of the world who are too ting here i can plan the moan you can go insides a roman mind me something a backdoor something you see the rope you the rope as smiling old an tick a picture there are no buildings left were the island his returned to a deeply wild state here's a wall of dense brush and a few trees around which sinister gulls or around we pass a flock of docks who take onlucket ale on the wiselian a a i really thinking about where hack o ti outfit seemed it should be like as we turn and that should be more shut were a ay may be the ye that is exactly it i wo that this is the scoter i tripody a lime show you make ye may be ill see the tastes it was not he dis not as we search for alias is budthist medallion that he would left in the excitement of the helicon to rescue we walk across a plain of thick dry grass matted down a carbide underneath you can hear shells crunching and mysterious things scurrying around still reminders that we are in fact in a major metropolis are always close at hands for one thing there's the garage miles of plastic and driftwood but also shoes steering wheels prescription bottles deflated balloons a washer dryer several refrigerators and oddly boats three perfectly intact ones complete with oars i hesitate to point these out to ale though to be fair there probably too heavy form to attract to the water and then there is this reminder of civil do he doctor boa was thing have time he was always close enough to the city but simply having a sulphone would have had him tuck safely into bed with an half an hour ale was finally rescued after seven hours thanks to roman and glubichonsky back on the boat they were having a fine old time a police helicopter was performing drills near by and apparently no scotches in the cleciade castaway department themselves they had figured out that they could signal it with the mirror but why rush we really engulfed the time staying there well as just you no sitting in the bullet and the smoking the lust toblacka that they had let and the we make i deal that bee not going to eat each other i really going to get basinal o us heaving fun know just little bi all not hostile no note and a very quite nice leather oh you did not you you were actually holding off signalling the hallcoters wall you had a nice day of course was it mic day still as it began to get dark in the cigarettes ran out he friends thought it was probably time to get a move on a helicopter soon arrived and air lifted them off the boat it was not until they were safely ashore wrapped in blankets in being fed complimentary cookies the either of them happen to mention that they would been a third passenger when the helicopter came back for ale cold exhaustion and dehydration had left him in a trance almost wild state and for him this island will always be a place where maybe they be monsterand i was ally when else car wondering told of be wild place a there any animals or an that er i was may be hoping to see some o an ilk iageloran mi batters li is the he yes one of my favorite ate i takes for the same reason probably i the state of you tot where i never was the something that has some kind of i was sutcotlike the secret or is hiding ort the they tract me in the way that they they might be hitting something e from me and that is what after many hours spent with ale i find myself liking about him to most is insistence on finding mystery an adventure everywhere he looks it is easy to laugh at that to write it all off is adores and stupidity what if it is more than the on if it is also a kind of adolescent ant magic actually ism thinking that this needed to happen i i can't inching if i was not boring person and i would just like stay at home all the time and be a hurt i would never get into the situation icing this happened a strictly because i was with the right people at the right time in the right situation you know think about the every step of the way by almost any measure ale could not have been more wall it takes a special kind of grace to turn that into right time right place and how can you help but envy the who would not rather live in a world where if you believe you should have an adventure you do in which each of your mistakes does a narrow your life but expands it in which the worst thing that could possibly happen is being word and you can go to sleep on stormy seas and trust that when you wake up if you are very lucky you will be in to on am trying to say is this ale does something i never in a million years would have thought possible he makes me think it might be cool to be a denature there is a story that back in the eighteen thirties a ship carrying fifty four thousand dollars in medical gold was hijack quit pirates outside to make a bay and that the treasure was buried somewhere near ruffle bar on our way back from the island i tell ale this and he listens with great interest if you found the treasure he wants to know could he keep it maybe i say if you did not tell anybody to which ale answers precisely as i know he wealth only way he possibly can he says but what if i told everybody brae mine is he out tor a difficult man behind the scenes of a creative revolution coming out looking about cage that soothe outside go o believes about chico but the actually is totally and completely true that is in a minute to got we beblegadio went out programmed continues dismackin from or glass each we can a premed guess you chose a theme bring a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme to day she in the shadow of the city strange about things happening out of sight for most of us but baby close to us we have rived at at two of our programmed act too troubled bridge over water don't you don't three on the edge of a city half way round the world in hanging china a man named chest mister oh an had it out to a bridge away from his wife and daughter he was ever ten hours a day the ridge chose is this concrete communist monthstrocity four miles long cover was slow gas that celebrate the worker four can to traffic thousands of pedestrians on the top de two trained tracts on the lower deck over the axe river into hanging a city of seven million as to mister fuzzy but the best guess is that one person per week commit suicide off this bridge crackheads up by the way that this story unite discussed suicide mister when decided he want to tried to keep them from jumping and he started to single handily at first hen with an occasional volunteer the blog that he keeps about this is the most sober taciturn non boastful account of saving lives imaginable was you an mister camel in set his feelings be ware heavy thoughts he declares tor himself in one entry how i wish that he will soon be free of this shadow he says about an old man tat he saved in another promptly is just the facts he was a translation from the chines i did twenty fifth at ten thirty in the morning i dis covered a woman lying on the bridge railing on o belly weeping i went to her she wiped her eyes she said she was just playing and walked toward the center of the bridge i went with her and she very ordinarily out herself found when i returned at one ten i dis covered that she had already climbed up on the bridge railing i restrained her i forced her on to her moved she is from dancing's giant district he last name is jaw an to day she is forty five years old because her husband surname lee and fifty one years old is violent towards her and is treats her she thought killing herself would be better however she has silent and she thinks of her fifteen year old son march twenty first two thousand ten yesterday a three of five am i saved a young man in the middle of the bridge he a drunk out of alcohol was finding to jump over the bridge daily i at once restrained him and dragged him to safety is we spoke i leaned to situation was actually quite funny hes thing about jumping because last year his wife promised to start returning to him two hundred you on of his monthly fourteen hundred your salary to spend as he pleased but she had not honored her promise yesterday afternoon he treated drinking with his friends an the more he drank be angary got he believe the killing himself would make a realize that not one cent had come to him he then said another funny thing his mother's colleague said that the bridge is haunted and could take one soul is at hah it his haunted by drunk ghosts and i took him home this was the calmest simplest rescue of mad in recent years many of mister chensentries ore about the people that he does not save fever fifteenth five thirty in the morning a middle age man jump to his death is reported at this time and he was holding a photograph of his family august ten two thousand at sturdy afternoon at one forty p m a young woman three hundred meters from the south end to the bridge climbed under the bridge daily i immediately started my to red it because i excelaryted to quickly the moped week oil in night had to run to her but when i was two hundred meters away she jumped into the any i start was visible in the water an a spot fifty meters away and i could still hear her yelling for help into a large wave obscurity er from view at the end of each year mister chendisn inventory of how things are going on the bridge this one this from the end f two thousand sing he wrote that of since he began back in two thousand three he would saved at that point one hundred seventy four people from comittien suicide counselled another five thousand one hundred fifty on the bridge and sixteen thousand on the then fifty one thousand people at text him total days volunteering to that point six hundred forty six my paternity wrote a magazine article about mister can he first heard about him years ago from newsrepords i read a bit of his blowing bugle trains li i fell i he had to meet this man who on his own decided to rescue many people an we to china i thought maybe maybe we'll see him in action maybe ill get to see him save somebody just as back story i mean actually came i had come from mam cambodia i was i was covering these genocide trials is i i was not lead i don't have the most optimistic feelings about humanity i and i thought i was going to find something there you the you are thins on a hopeful figure ye i mean oh perseverance generosity i but as soon as i got on the bridge i realize that all those notions were completely absurd i mean i got instantly depressed first of all there this four mile long bridge and this one man out there for of trying to pick out who was going a jump ism just seemed from a distance insurmountable odds actually maybe pull somebody off the bridge yet you read on the article when when you say for to there's the cars and there is the trains and the bridge is shaking and the there is just a see if people thousands of people in the rain with umbrella s a going back and forth in the bridge and he is just one one guide kind of walking up and down and he has his little mob had and does a little cruise on the bridge every every once in a while but ism even that is somewhat a somewhat comical sight to behold he is on this little broken down moped put putting through the crowd with his bring parbinoculars around his neck i set of thought maybe this is an even real maybe this blog is complete figment of his imagination i or a fiction that he constructs you now one week and i just do not see how this guy can save anybody out here and and you read in your article he wont he will not really talk to you when when your when you there in the bridge ye he is really grumpy and urn willing to acknowledge me and then stand give me a typical exchange between the two of you on the bridge i i think i did ask what why why you standing here i supposed to any other spot on this four mile long bridge and a he turned and lifted his binoculars and focus ism out toward the river and then brought his binoculars down turned the other way put his binoculars up and focus ism in the other direction on the crowd but that is it his not he respond no it wasn't i was i was not even there is i was son got ta i sort of went through some of this and then i said maybe there a better time for us to talk and he said to the translator i canal to you at lunch say good to lunch with them and and when what happens there well we were in a little i but they call family restaurant near the bridge and if there are no families present i mean it is just workers and there pretty hard drinking in this case i grain alcohol and beer and we sit down at the table and mister when has invited ism a man to join us whose name is mister she i and then we are served some food and mister when and mister she start really drinking a lot of grain alcohol and i started to ism set of drink with them because it was the convivial thing to do and then i just realized i i i mean to pass out if i an say with these guides i i literally i was my head was fie at i was the of the hull from was revolving i dis not and he was you would ha very disappointed and and he sort of said you had just were drink in here this will we do at lunch and drinking loosens the tongue and get with the program and if if ye cannot then win not we you do not want you put on a tat then he it lunch he definitely opened up a little bit more me he he was not looking at me i when he answered questions but he was answering them and he was speaking more expansively about life on the bridge did he explain why it is that he does this i he said he had read a newspaper article about the bridge and about people jumping off the bridge and and he himself had grown up in the country outside an engine he really related in particular to these people from the villages who came to the bridge and their lives and whose lives were hard and full of despair and he completely understood that see go back up to the bridge and and and he he puttysoff and his moped and tend and then yen then he jumped on his moped to go on his rounds and em i did not have anything to do but i turned to the translator sudan and i said habit is take a little walk out on the bridge and we started walking out over the bridge and were chatting a little bit and this guy cannot came lurching by and he did not pay any attention to him but this guise about twenty we thirty feet ahead of us and he seems to be climbing up on the railing and at that went i just yelled hey and then i said to sudan he is going to go over and i started running for him and sudan came running and i had that one little flash of mister can saying some of these some of these people will really take you with them if they can either that desperate and i had that little flash the would be stupid way the i be ridiculous if i yen go down wit thingy but it did not come to that because when i got to him i had my foot on the inside of the sort of the concrete buttes and and i try to flip him back toward me and tat he was completely leap he was a back of sawdust he he just flipped right back on to me i ai had not even really and pulled hin that hard it's hard to explain but like when i think of it i just get it'd have to say just i i have just goose bumps all over my body right now because because because he ah he was going to kill himself and because he did not did you feel good i now i am feel good i felt kind of various i felt a there there every week somebody actually does this thing and even if we were to column mister can and there were two hundred of amount there they would prod still one a week some one would would figure it how to do it and then all my got who is coming next and say say is can comes back great yet will it took mister canna while to come back on his mowed but when he came when he showed u the crowd sort of parted and i was holding on to this man whose name was fan pane and he said to me step away which i thought was a really bad idea cause we are standing right next to the railing but he had such command of the situation and all the ne once is of the situation that i just stepped away i just go and stepped away and a and then he said i want to take your picture which seem you do not i did not even understand what that was about hes take the picture the guy ye he pulls out is self on will the camera takes a picture and then he says i and now i think i should punch you in the face wholly then he said you call yourself chines how dare you how dare you call yourself chines come up on this bridge with the intention of killing yourself to day you you are somebody is son how dare you i am going to punch you in the face i want to push you right now the crowd of course is crushing in because i think there's can leggin's get a punch om and ism just sitting here with my mouth open i he cannot i takes another step an close sir and and pan says look ism only doing this because my father was in the red army and he is lost all of his disability insurance and there is no way for him to live any more and ism lousy son cause i cannot provide for him and liver documents burned in a fire and without those documents we we cannot get any help and mister when says that there is nothing worth i this there is no problem that we cannotself and then he moves in a little bit close sir any touches his arm i to sir of holding him by the elbow with his right hand but mister when says i i i think i think i can help you i do not i do not this i do not what you are doing here this is not the way to saw i anything and at that point they have each mother's word that they are gong to meet on money morning at mister when's a office do you get creep out on any big bridge now ye i t well obviously after re having been on the bridge i started looking at bridges for their suicide potenchall and every bridge is that bridge and then sing and every person is potentially fan pang and every other person is potentially mister chain and i just kind of look at it i wonder wonder if that is the bridge people would jump from and ism wonder if maybe some one should be out here my paste at e firs rede about meeting mister change for jerk you magazine is back want you out there about mister changing the bridge got the angel of hanging i they yes in my back yard not a story about a some of the mysterious things happening on the edges of the city in the shadow of the city right under our knows and ism to but this stop in some contacts wouldn't turned out to for hate just you may member where ha he sent some story for a program he says the when you move to a new city you cannot get into the regular conversations that everybody else gets into he found the sat a little wile back when he did the one thing that everyone y ciao agrees is the very worst thing the anybody can do he moved to new york all new yorkers won i talc about is what subway trying to get to take to get from i be and it goes on and on and you cannot say any that you cannot be they discovered o tenth planetary well you you would take the dos yet get get the dele at it it is inescapable and when you that conversation finely peters you it is somehow and it it does not fail turns into a conversation about selfheal reception youth not i get into that you cannot get into the count know where the dead spots are you cannot can do any small talk what happens is the smell talk becomes you just moved in new york where you familiar from chico how do you new york how do you more every one's in how you near cause they want you say yours the greatest place that have ever been to and have have burned all of my connections that anywhere that have ever been before because i love it much here when in fact people would say howdy new york w i it it is big it staff but i i really chico i really whats chico chicagofs is you wonderful dream land where there is a bar on every corner and the bridges smell chocolate and then you would free much i have a a silence and your the ice in your glass would clink a couple of times and then then say the bridge of smelling chocolateand then i describe how wonderful it is that the bridges with smell the smelled chocolate and this is something that people in new york have never ever ever ever ever ever believed but if you get up early in the morning and it is sort of quiet out and you go to the right bridge and it is just that sort of magic a twinkling hour where the sun's coming happened and the you are in a big city but nobody's around every now and again they selling brownout ye but the that's i sou true that is very rat smiling say it is it is true and the reason we is because there is the is a chocolate clap on the west side that saws i that spews the smell of chocolate you have the smell of magic to say some to say a the bridge smells chocolate does not convey what actually happens what actually happens is that when you are walking across a bridge and your dodging cars and it is a bridge over a dead river in the middle of it part of town that is industrial and totally unnatural you you you just sort of walk into this cloud of the sweetest memory you have of cook he is then made as a child your sweetest childhood memory can walk into that and en walk into my surprise in the middle of the day in the middle of the city not know that i that that all this is ending right i know i know it is a thousand little stabs in the heart thanks to the federal government it is like a million little stabs in the heart what happened is this somebody complained about the chocolate smell they complained to the fire met a protection age city an the few government ever responsive to e any single complain from any of it citizens anywhere in the country leapt into action the sent inspectors to the blower chocolate company whichhas been making cocoa baron o the goodies when chicanes west side since nineteen thirty nine inspector's found that too much coco dust was going into the air more than is legal under federal standards the plant installed flattering equipment n fact they said they've been planning to get that equipment in place even before the p drop by in any case fewer coco particles in the air means less delicious chocolate aroma you ctapury to pinko liking a one point factory e yet om we come plan an the we de look of yet of the problem re picker but yet your a been e time where it happen et the powerpoin n nothing happened that is braver bishevsky director environmental health programs for the america long association in chico and as he points out it is been widely reported here the illinois attorney general's office has documented over seventy six hundred violations somewhat to the chocolate company violation at six coal plants in lino in the last six years and n p has never gone after any of those coal plants to i let i the packomintn cocotte factory are not a major sort to e fine particle pollution when you look at powerply very to able for about a quarter of the problem and chocolate is chocolate a quarter of the problem as well no o i now it i it t probably o you par par are one er tat ooh the there is a quart that you gave ism where you a used an animal metaphor that have seen quoted milk in a million a articles that i just relive to you to repeat here for our listeners oh i do

ant when there is a pack of wolves around then claiming you have saved people from harm ho bout at we pay it not it what crushing in at yet do not be scare to this anima writes people not to tin have you sharking that o we share i just this s just my entire relationship to government right now can be summed up by this story icy there is all these things are thing particles in the air and the only one i is the one their getting rid of oh ye and you on ta marry try well fed p has not ben talking to the press about the chocolate factory when i called the illinois state e p the manager of compliance in enforcement for the bureau of air a cheerful public servant named dulia hermitage inform me that there has been a misunderstanding yes she said the coal plants had boutesdout too many particles seventy six hundred times but she this times was very very short at the least a momentary spike at the most six minutes long each one was a blip she said automatic monitoring equipment's going twenty four hours a day taking readings at up all the blips per year and you get two hundred eleven blips per plant per year meaning that well over ninety nine per cent of the time the plants are in compliance with the law yet taken out a contact id it it a pears to be a a very bad situation put into contact it century an onion and as for the fact that now there may be less chocolate smell in chico ism net really to position when i prefer do not a pad the hollo e prove yet and you do not feel an y sort of twinge as an environmental regulator who is here to make our world a better place

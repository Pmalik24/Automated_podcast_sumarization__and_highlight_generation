new york tom's columnist avid brook speculates how o shocking revolution or liberal elevates the bad guides trump goes to washington d can pleads not gilts gunmultible januisix charges ism bent fearless is the venthgura show the bench pro shows sons r express we plan i talk about them every single show why have not you gotten o we planet get expressive plan right now at expressive piano come slash men well the trump phenomenon has been puzzling people ever since donate true hoped onto the political scene and started making waves and drew enormous amounts of support from members of the conservative bates from people who are high school graduates in oho for people who are college graduates in flora where was trumps support base coming from and the left was utterly puzzled by this after all dona trump was not historically socially conservative donate trump was not somebody who historically even early a re publican dona trump was merely a major cultural figure who did not seem to sneer at those people unis ever since people oral left m in trying to figure up why is his brands durable why is it that many people feel connected to donate trumpet is particularly true because donate from continues to pole extremely highly among republicans do spite the fact that his shot at beating trobidon is probably weaker than that of the republicans despite the fact that his facing down a bevy of indictments now all all that happens to be true trumpright now is vulnerable mainly in the early states the primaries are not it over if you look at the early states swat in particular dona trump's leaden i is twenty four points as opposed to thirty seven points nationally that is a a pretty significant different and rondo mantis is in second place with twenty per cent for ss trumps forty four in isatin shot earning nine per centare points from ma shammy at five haply at four pence at three et camera hi there are some vulnerabilities there but the pulling stats on foreample the indictments surrounding dona trump show a disconnect between what conservatives think thereat the country things and what the rest the country actually thanks conservatives think that people are going to immediately react to news of the spurious trump incitement in washington be see with the sort of rage that they feel that that we feel the people ma believe that donate trump is in fact being unfairly targeted by legal enforcement while hunter bison is being let off the hookah that he is that this is really happening because of course he is the front runner for the republican nomination and because democrats hate the guy and also because democrats would to see him elevated to the nomination and we tend to believe of ka up now if donate trump is the nominee many people in the middle will resinate to that argument that he is being treated on fairly therefore he should be elevated to the nations highest office but that is not actually what the poles show when you look at hell voters see the indictments what you see is that on the twenty twenty election diction fifty two per cent to voters a prove of the federal indictment the same number on the class documents indictment which suggest that it is really not about the topic or even about the legal case against donate trump basically fifty two per cent o voters want to see donate trump in the dog that is really what that comes down to which is a sheer majority because the classified documents case is a much stronger case legally than the twenty twenty election indictment case now among independent there actually is a different this is what is kind of interesting among independent fifty nine per cent say that they approve of donate trump being invited on the on the twenty twenty election for stuff only forty nine percent hat they prove on the classified documents stuff which is again fascinating you would think that would be the reverse because again the classified document cases much stronger legally speaking than the election stuff from twenty twenty all it really chosen that independence really do not donate trump talking about the twenty twenty election they really do not what he did in the after aft of e twenty twenty lection they really do not canary sex get but there remains this massive disconnect between the conservative bates and independence and the rest of the country with regard to president trump and this raises questions why is it that many up publicans are really really behind trump in deep and abiding ways and and the answer is that it has less to do with donate trump than it has to do three action to leftest elites that really is the and that is always been the answer have said since the beginning the trumphenomina the dot dona trump has always represented two conservatives and to traditionalists a giant pulsating middle finger a orange middle finger directed at the entire left wing apparatus that is what he is get the single estimation of the trump phenomenon is and get ready heritably button trump because you right that has always been the appeal of dona trump shows the pile dona trump in twenty fifteen twenty sixteen as the peal donate trump and twenty twenty tan is even more the appeal of dona trump in twenty twenty three twenty twenty four you do not get to tell us what to do is sort of the generalized mood with regard to present trump to the question is where does that mood come from where where is it come from and the answer is it is direct reaction to a liberal elites who have decided that their values are more important than your values we've decided that their priorities are more important than your priorities and frankly it comes from a a group of people who could theoretically be called value traders gets up to understand what exactly is going on here yet record have to think of the framework of history brawled boarded a carl mark's famously says the beginning of the comes manifesto along with angles e he says the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle and this is wrong now that phrase has shaped near leap every fury about politics in the modern era everybody ranging from francs fucleama to the marks is theories of the early twenty century is shaped by the idea that everything about class today's politicians left alright burned sanders and on the right people bunker carbon very often tend to conflates issues tat are values laden with issues that are economic laden to the idea is that de begotten man is actually the person is being left behind by the new meritocracy by the economy that that everythigisabout class conflict and if only we could re distribute if only we could subside we could do all of that we could create solidarity again all we oud have to do is change the economic systems by which we live and this would magically fix everything but it is not true the history of existing society for all of human history has not actually been about class conflict in fact virtually know conflicts in the history of humanity have been fought purely over class this what world were one did to the market idea world ware one completely defeated the market idea the marks idea in worldlier one is that there would be rope wide a class revolution to end world were one in fact the the home of mark's revolution was not supposed to be in russia which basically had no classes it had a group of a few elevates and then it had a giant giant proletariat easily farmers serfs people where very poor itewasn's most opening poor countries if you look at carl mark's writings who supposed to happen in great brain if supposed to happen in richer countries where the excesses of capitalism would eventually cause much income into quality and wealth in a quality that lower classes would rebel against upper classes and thus when world were one broke out makes were utterly befuddle because instead of the conflict breaking out between lower classes middle classes an upper classes the conflict insteadbroke out between nationalities an broke out over borders and german who re very poor coded with german were very rich to fight brutish people where very poor and brig people were very rich and it did not cross pollinate a cross class marks was wrong world we one proved him wrong but his idea continues to be the motivating factor in nearly all thinking politically still which is the idea that economic circumstances determined class solidarity which in turn determine politics and is not true the real answer to the driving force behind history is in fact community community community of interest if we are going to rephrase marks what would come up with is the history of all hitherto existing societies the history of community struggles struggles between cereal communities religious communities if people who have a common interest because they live together because they share certain values that is the real struggle that is taking place in america and that is the real reason that dona trump is a represented of a particular class is not a representative of the lower classes dona trump because there are bunch people me make a lot of money who would support dona trump against dobidon and did in twenty twenty there are bunch of people wo are middle class car supporting dona trump against jobidon and therefore bunch people who are lower class ho are supporting dona trump against gobidan despite the redistribution's promises of democrats what is that about that is not about economic circumstance is not about pure redistribution's it is not about class struggle it is about community struggle et to what that means in just one second first what is talk about how you protect your asset base here is the reality as the united states continues to down grade the value of on economy as you have places fitch downgrading america tat america currency could be in danger in the future its just that simple we have already inflated our currency there will be deflation there will be inflation therewith be speculation in the markets one way to protect yourself against the vicissitudes of a government driven market is to invest in the only asset that is nevernmen worth zero gold on august twenty second bricksenations brazil russia india china south africa are expected to announce the launch of a new international super currency fully back by golds or other commodities this part of their long turn plan to supplant the united states and the dollar as cornerstones of the label financial system it can protector very or for one cave for the fall out from this landmark announcement by diversifying with gold from birch gold historically gold has ben a safe haven in times of high on certainty which is right now best gold's of people eye by bagel from do thousands of other concern savors when currencies fail gold remains a safe haven how much more time does the dollar have left while protect your savings of gold birchgold has that plus radio with better businesses are thousands of happy customers text ben to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight they are free in focal in gold if e central bantiguiral currency becomes a reality will bounces to have some gold to depends again ten ben to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight to day has which is a description of how society works which is a description of of what what are the for of cleavage points the points at which america separate from one another and where do you in wordoid's plenty of to explain where america unify we do not unify round class middle class people in californium do not necessarily grith middle class people in florid poor people in missippi do not nearly agree with poor people in new york rich people in nebraska do not necessarily agree with rich people in chico such really not about class it really about communities of interests historically that has often men religious community f your talking about historic wars basically from the down of time until the piece of lesfailua virtually all war was religious to nature then afterward it turned in to nationalistic war and now we are sort of back to religious war as it turns out wars are very rarely fought on the basis of pure economic ideals alone and if it is an economic ideal is not because in economic ideals because it is religion maxim has effectively become a religion thee communism was say religion with a great sainted leader at the top who must be worships it the the real cleavage in america society right now is not in economic cleavage person it is a values cleavage it's a community cleavage ay it is a cleavage between people who have more traditionalist values with regard to the united states and people who do not and that has led to a class conflict as people who are high in come earners have essentially left behind their church and their community of interest and have formed a new community of interest with other people who earn s we are now transmuting what were values conflicts into class conflicts which is wear because again if you equally go over to silicon valley widely perceived at as a left is top at nine hands of people in silicon valley talk them regularly the you should go over to silicon valley in you talk to the heads of social media companies the same people when promoting adversity equity in elusion environmental social remnants those same exact people in their own homes they are practicing conservatives those same people are married admired for twenty years they have kids they do not let their kids play with the with the social media as that they themselves create the values they actually live out in their daily lives are fairly conservative this appoint that charges marry makes in coming apart all the same people for reaction liberal money s directed at the very poorest and society who they see as essentially plan things of the gods the gods being themselves those very san people live values that are much more consistent with conservative middle class america traditionalist america and i it sort of a fascinating phenomena to understand that youeft understand two separate ideas of what they call the forgotten man the forgotten man is a phrase that is used in politics all the time and who is the person at whom politics ought to be directed the forgotten man the person who is left behind who exactly is the forgotten man that phrase was made famous originally by franklindellino roosevelt back in nineteen thirty two and the forgotten man according to franklin telling rosevelt was the my who is poor and the gat who's really poor he is been forgotten by society and it's our job to make it up for him and the way to do that is to essentially redistribute all of america resources with that guy in mind leave meritocracy behind leave the idea of performance behind the person at the bottom of thespectrum is the person we out to folksong an this is define democratic party policy for a very long time you con mind that on economic level with the dead liberal social policgot to prevail and that basically d finds that emcratiparty today according toe democrats the forgotten man is the poor guy who must be given money and then preach to about the virtues of transgender's in social justice and then there is another concept of who the forgotten man is and that is the actual original concept of who the forgotten man is there is a yaluniversity professor named willing graham summer who is a clergyman and a and a classical liberal and he wrote a piece in eighteen seventy six about the forgotten man and here is what he says quit as soon as a observe something which seems to him wrong from which ex is suffering a talks it over with be and an be then proposed get a lawless to remedy the evil and help acts there law always proposes to determine what we shall do for acts or in better case what a icy shall do for acts what i want to do is look up acts is look up we i want to show you what manner of man he is i call him the forgotten man perhaps the appellation is not strictly correct he is the man who is never thought of i call him the forgotten man he works he votes generally he prays but he always pays and to who is the forgotten man according summer that is the person who has the tradition a ones it is the person who goes to church the personung supports his community and the person who is targeted by the people in the flee class on a value's level because they don't care about his values thereon hereabout that and he is always the person who they are taking from both in terms of values for themselves another attempting to destroy the values and institutions upon which he relies and here so taken from economically in certain ways as well but it is really more about the values than it is even about the economic takings because the truth is in the united states the people the very top of the economic pet from pay nearly all income taxi is not the middle class pangincome tax in the united states it is the rich people pain come tax really what is this its not a class conflict it is a values conflict in which you have in you lea group at the top whore promulgating a set of values that is absolutely destructive that they themselves do not live by to people in the middle class and people who are in in the lower economic classis that is not economic conflict that is in fact a community struggle as i say that is not part of the history of class conflict it is community struggle and this is what is under girting avid brooks column today it is a fascinating column in the you trimester's trying to grapple with the true phenomenon he cannot quite escape the sort of marks is tinge to to all history being described by class conflict but he is start it is tartington dawn on him that perhaps a tax on traditional judo christian values are in fact the do finding feature of our politics right now and that when america is dividing it is not dividing along class lines it is dividing between people who believe the traditional judo christian values are good and people believe the traditional judo christian values are really really bad you wonder why culture wars our first and foremost in everybody's mind because the things that we actually hereabout it is not actually predominantly our pocket book we all care about our pocket book that is not predominantly what we care about when it comes time to make our life long decisions about what matters to it is values it is always values at will always be values at alleys been values economics determine what jobs we take they may determined where we live but it is values that determine how we live and that is the thing in the end that she matters the most to us when you haven entire today of he let liberals who presumably do not even live their own values but our cramming down and all turned ut set of values on all f america in the name of the quotincual marginalize when that happens there is going to be backlash not backlash is taking the form of trump not because trump is a great representative of mud to traditional judo christian values but because when you are assaulted enough all you wan to to his throw the bird that is what trump is get to that in just one second first let us talk about your sleep quality we may give you an example of sleep that is a problem last night eleven p m and o my baby son couple months old is got calf is got a cold that as is if you have small babies that is actually came can a dangerous was baby's our obligate knows feathers that means that you have to be up all the time taken the s not out of his not and a i a lot of up and down last night for me some little tired this morning it'd be a lot tired if wet were not for ma heck sleep mattress because the god news was that as soon as my son fell asleep and he is breathing fine i would lie down not mattress and out light he looks sleep has a new collection the helices bleed hell's has harness years of extensive mattress ex best he is to being our customers a truly elevated sleep experience the helices leak collection includes six different mattress models each tailor for s specific sleep positions and from his preferences have had my heels sleep mattress for seven eight years this point it is excellent it is durable i kid's jump up and down on all the him go to he keep dot come flesh particle the to minutesleep quits find the perfect mattress for your body and sleep type i took that he looks quiz and was mash when they firm but breathable matters which is daclueti need to sleep for imminent time he lies is offering up to twenty per sent off all matters orders plus two free pillows for listeners it is their best off yet hurry on over to he like sleep do come flesh ben with he like but ta sleep starts right now ill can all is to lead up to the avid brook's column which is making a rounds today called what if we are the bad guises here and here is what datebooks rights quit then trumps seems to get intidown a weekly basis it he is utterly dominating his republican rivers in the poles and he is tied with joining in the general election surveys trumps pall members are stronger against biding now than at any time in twenty twenty what is going on here why is the sguystill politically viable after all he is done we anti trumpets off an tell store to explain that it was encapsulated in a quote the university of north caroling political scientist mark hetherington gave to my collogue homes evil recently quote republican see a world changing around them in comfortably fast another want a slow down maybe in take a step backward but if yhoureperson of color a woman who values gender quality or an el i b the person would you want to go back to nineteen sixty three i doubt it in this story says avid brooks we anti trumpets are the good guys the forces of progress and enlightenment the trumpets are reactionary bigots and authoritarians many republicans support trump no matter what according to the story because the end of the day he is still the big in chief the embodiment of their resentments and that is what matters to the most i partly agree with this story says avid brooks but it is also a monuments who let self satisfaction let us be clear about this the we lead self satisfaction really took the fourth barokobama here's a fascinating interview over its tablet magazine all about barockabama and his value system and all the things the media ignored about barockabama including the fact that he was a bleeding antisemite back in his college days nevis but he is a member of the liberal elite who hated the values of the called bitter clingers and it became a a sort of cultural case to to rip on people who had traditional judo christian values with regard to to life davidbrook says let me try another story on him i ask you to try on of vantage pointing which we anti trumpets are not the eternal good guys in fact we are the badguides and here is where avid brooks somewhady's about says right and some of it is a conflation of sort of marks theory with the actual history of humanity which is the story of community struggle quote this story begins in the nineteen sixties when high school grads had to go off to fight in venom but the children of the educated class got college deferments e that that is true city he tryingadrovs is a class conflict that high school grads went to fight in venom but the children of the educate class gat college over that that is certainly true however it is also true that the objections to treason wore did not calm from the hight scolleghated class they came from the same college elites who got the college deferments patriotic america were willing to go fight in venom and they did and they died large numbers by the way list proportionately white people my saw all all the myths about how venom was bunch poor black people were dying that the sis not true's eighty eight per cent of all casualties in venom we are white people fifty per cent of all people who were serving in venom were middle class it was not all kin of poor brown people as the as the platoon myth would sort of suggest virtually o a huge percentage like eighty six percents of everybody who served invionom was actually volunteer not drafted but put all that aside what avid brook is missing here is that piano was a values conflict it was a community conflict between a bench of long haired hippy left wing u redo christian values rejecting elites on college campuses who wasn't even serving who objected to the war it was not all the people went to church o objected to the war those all people who dropped out at church and dropdascid who objected to the war that was the actual cultural break down that we now try to relight into a history of class conflict he said i continues in the nineteen seventies when the authorities imposed bussing on working classifies of boson but not on the skill communities wellasly where they themselves live that is one hundred per centrum they that part that he is hot the gan that is a commune eye's conflict right the idea here is that a bunch of liberal left wing leads when lived in super white areas and ten post force bussing on a bunch of poor white people and poor black people that part is true that is on again of class conflict that is a community conflict because if those liberals it should believe the own values they would be imposing it on themselves as well the ideal that were all in this toe other was replaced with the reality that the educated class lives in a world up here and everybody else is forced into a world down there his right about this but on a values levels it'll discuss more in just one second

appueron ore that new dark spot treatment system to day and get your genuses backs an puffiness i also included for seventy per cent off retail prices o case backs the datebooks column he says members of our class are always publicly speaking out for the marginalized but we somehow somehow we always and a building systems that serve ourselves this is again true but the reality is that it is not even the they build systems that serve themselves it is that the systems that they themselves build are not intended for themselves on a value's level avid brooks has the thing against the aristocracy and this is where i do not white the conflation between the marksist history of class struggle and the history of community struggle which is not the same it really is not in's i just to take a a quick example john j rockfeller used to go to church on the regular and we've hung of charity inside he is own church from the time he was very young it he was more in line with poor members of his church than who was in line with many members of his own social class this this is just the reality ripping on meritocracy doesn't solve the problem it is a marks is solution two spiritual values problem ripped because here a thing what is the all turn give to meritocracy when i see people both left in right ripping on the meritocracy meaning the people wore most meritorious get the job and right now in an information age that is going to benefit people who have more facility with in formation than other people but it is also turn construction where people who have more facility with machines are going to do better the people who do not have facility with machines people what facility with plumbing are con do better in that industry than people who do not have facility with plumbing theft what is they will turnips no one has ever provided in all turn give to meritocracy that makes any sent on the economic emblem this is why i i really object to the crossing streams of promoting the meritocracy with promoting liberal left wing social valises are not the same thing the best system is is system in which economically speaking meritocracy does obtain but also that is back by judo christian values of community wherein we all care about each other because we share a set of values that is the best form of the system avid books however again infused by this sort of thorough going marks is ideal and again he is not marks is but this is an ideal that is permeated free much every area of social science the class struggle in all this nonsense he says the meritocracy is the problem he says the most i portent of these systems that the problems the modern meritocracy we built an entire social order that sorts an excludespeople on the basis of the quality we possess most academic achievement how my educated parents cots we lead schools marry each other work at highland professional jobs and for enormous resources in to our children who get into the same lead schools marry each other and pass their exclusive cat class privileges down from generation to generation he is conflating a bonding stuffier credentials is in dead you dofthave to go to college in order to make an amazing living in the united states and and lead a business at our business here at daily wire is led by a triumvirate it is me a harder law school and outlay grab is enemy boring i got who did not graduate from college and is call robins a person who did not even go to college that is our triumpherat the thing that we share is wore pretty god o business or all pate smart but a an't thecredential it is the performance when he says that this is a pathway that is unavailable t any one by the way i challenge hims look at the entire alien community in the united states which wildly out performs based on class data where they should be in terms of their kids by the ay how does he think that people become rich in this country he s assuming a self perpetuating a let but let us be real about this again were the not go up wealthy his dwell celeb did not go up fluffy his kidswell i contrary to public opinion did not group wealthy my kidswell for the record i grope ins i was even years old and a two bedroom eleven hundred squarefoot house in urban californium with six people sharing one bathroom i sure a bedroom with three younger systems until i was eleven years post locket has me nous poor i was solidly meddle class but that's solidly middle class not solidly upper class the point here is that again he is conflating class struggle with the actual struggle here and he is missing the point here is the here is the part that where he is totally right however he says and when he gets beyond all this quote arms wot all kinds of economic cultural and political power we support policies that help ourselves free trade makes the products we buy cheaper an our jobs are unlikely to be moved to china and he is he is missing up the economic share but here is the partner gets to the part that actually matters all fleets we use language and morays as tools to recognize one another and exclude others using words problematic sischender almanacs and introsectional is a sure sin love got cultural capital coming out of your ears meanwhile members of the less educated classes have to walk on eggshells because they never know when we have changed the usage rules s that something that was payable five years going to get to fired we also change the more forms and ways that suit ourselves never mind the cost others for example here used to be norm that discouraged people from having children oushigh marriage but that got washed away during our period of cultural dominants as we are voted norms that seems judge mental or they might inhibit individual freedoms after the social mommas voted if fonnything happened members of our class still overwhelmingly married and had children within wedlock people without our resource is in supported by social arms we less able to do that as drain porridge points out in his magisterial two thousand twenty en book the aristocracy of talent quote sixty percent of births to women with only a high school certificate a for out of wedlock compared with ten percent to women with the university degree that matters he continues because the rate of single parenting is the most significant predictor of social immobility in the country does this mean i think people in my class are vicious and evil know most of most of us are earnest kind and public spirited but wo take for granted and benefit from systems that have become oppressive you lead institutions had become politically progressive in part because the people in them want to feel good about themselves as they take part in systems that exclude and react it is easy to understand why people in less educated classes would conclude they are under economic political cultural and moral assault and why they have rallied around trumpets their best warrior against the educated class again it is not really about the educated class it is about a cultural class that has decided it large that the morality of the forgotten man the person who actively holds together h community who provides the glue who provides the nationalism patriotism and allegiance to traditional judiocrisian values that undergird any sense of social solidarity it is those people they are attacking it is that glue that they are disintegrating and those people by the way are living off the fat of the land because they are benefiting from all of those things they're still living inside solid two parent households taking care of their kids and sending them to private schools that is the the the limiting liberal the llibisin liberal is not in limiting liberal because he takes a literal limousine he is limiting liberal because he lives a set of values that he then reacts it large when you say a your church i want my kid to to get married go to church have children within wedlock and get a job when you say that and then the person who does virtually all of those things in san joey says none an now that is bigotry we need to set up a system were if you do not get married you have kids out of wedlock you do not go t church in you do not gat jo we pay you then of course people in the middle argon a say what in the hell is going on what is wrong with y people if you do not talk about people there there is that there is phraseology an makes in the talk about class traders class traitors presumably are people in the working class who vote with the elites people who vote for the meritocracy or who vote for capitalism even though there members the lower class this was the basis no the famous but by tombs frank in themiddle of the two thousands call what is the matter with canvas in which said why are there all these poor people in canvas who keep voting republican when they could be voting benefits to themselves and the answer of course was that not voting base on the benefits there voting base on the values which matter more to them than the actual government hand outs can but that's how the left tens to thing the the reality is that we shouldn't be talk about class traders we should be talking about values traders peoplewho live a set of values and then promulgate a completely different set of values to other people who are two stupid and two poor to actually live those values the assumption is that everybody who is not living in san lose everybody hots not living in upper crossmanhatton all those people are two stupid to actually live values that most of these people themselves actually live and that is by the way why people who live traditionwhih it to christian values they tend to have stereotypical beliefs about people living in banjos anew york they think that they are all in polygamist gave relation ships because they believe the dusts s hat of values being promoted by san lose and man nation when that actually is not with their actually living out and then people in sanjosan mahanleck wellie why do they think all the stuff about us well maybe it is because you make the mark of virtue flying the pride progress flag from your house maybe it is that even while you are living in a heerosectual monogamist relationship with three children with the white pick offense maybe it is that thing may be the way that social solidarity was actually created and promulgated in the united states used to be rich people poor people in middle class people all went to church together they'll see there gets to the same schools they all actually inter acted with one another and had very similar sets of values again john rock feller when to the same church as the poor janitor down the street but have a question where is did youberally believe that is a jack dorky or sudan lash kick or any of the bank leaders do you think those people are going to church with poor people or you think they are hanging out exclusively with people at their country club who are members of the same solid economic liberal e let the answer is the latter and that means the they have cut themselves off from the same values an the used to actually create social solidarity o and that is now being telescoped all that is being telescoped in trump because again the way that that virtually all politics works is that even in consciously we all just look for symbols and the simple right now of resistance to these liberal elevates we've decided to make virtues signalling the most important thing among themselves the is the thing the matters morn anything there two symbols to day that this happening it is a making to watch it happen one is resistance to trump there the resistance trumps if actions that means everybody on the recross youknow it middle finger trump if that is want that is one reason for truster ability another issuer can we that absolutely clearly is not support for the warning crane the beginning of the warning crane heavy by partisan support for the warning crane heavy i mean look at the polling data republicans democrats an penes everybody supported the idea that you crane should be able to fend off russia invasion and then the minute that the left transmuted that into a values conflict about upholding quod quote liberal democracy with pride progress flags in enormous number of people on the right went oh now we s what your doing it is that all you the mini the minute that a conflict that was not actually a cultural values conflict was transmuted into a cultural values conflicts in which the same liberal elite who hate your church suddenly love you crane a bunch be wont note not interested it is that reactionary an understandable reactionary politics that is driving everything right now the answer to all this would be a engagement in social solidarity by the liberal elite but that would require them to understand that they are quonnquot pursuit of justice for the marginalized is not about pursuit of just from marghlize any more n has not been for her my very long tom what it is really about is a is a transgressive notion that if you destroy the center you've made the world the better place ill get that the s cultural wore was not started by the right it was not even re motel started by the right you knowhow because the battlefield if the culture been started by the

room i he he a pure in federal court there is no mug shot you every still assuming the ill at some point pea mong shot of trump in sort that probably will probables can t happen when ye gets o rested in this gorge i case surrounding canary six the cases have ben describing is really really spurious politico describes what it was inside the courtroom i said if you blink you miss it for fleeting moment thursday dona trumpet special council blacksmith appeared to make i contact as the former present on are parents fin of chargers that he sought subvert america democracy itself that shut grants crystallized that his stoic weight of thurstdays arraignment the third an recent months for the form president who fighting federal and local prosecutors even as he appears to be costing to the twenty twenty four g o p presidential nomination smith said nothing audible during his hour in the room but re heatedly shot plants to trump we rationally shot them back until their eyes briefly met even before dona trump entered a federal fourteen to clear himself not guilty the wight of history was evident in washington deceased federal court house minutes before trump entered the silent room several federal judge as files ins the public cavalry turning himself in to spectators in a building they typically rule after a day of anticipation the atmosphere darken the moment smith strode into the wood panels shandaleer court room from a near by antechamber smith was flanked by assistant special councillor ray huller and several f b i case agents as he made his way to the back of the courtrooms well moments later there was trump seated at a table at has not recent months been occupied by some of the very people who storm the capital and are now paying a legal price all that drama ow the magical drawn at up dona trump came out and am was wont combination of i would say stoic a blaze and ism a little bit i would say puckish dona trump i actually post of this construe social considering the fact i had to flight to a filthy dirty falling a part an very unsafe washington to see today and that i was then arrested by my political opponent who is losing badly to me in the poles crooked jobidon it was a very good day i the honestly i why people love him in little finger pall sitting ti metal finger all the time it a finger all the time again dona trump twenty twenty four because fall you i here is a trigonal trump's actual verbal response the over mig dial very san ta to a a a at e very san in o is tinted in ti e a to the cay at love e oi i tine oleate e at tie at the pa ti la tee er an tin e s o li o eye haiti tiki dereism of the e oi ti eaeopo hatpin in o air ti we i teperetaleatin bi re and o e one e pop i very an satin bi by a lot of an hate i we i o or a i of a the is hatpin in a that of er to i mean tit to be fair he is not in the poles leading jobidon by lot the last poles have them easily dead even ism but the point is taken it is obviously true that he is in fact being hit with a variety of chargers that no one in the democratic party would ever be hit with without a doubt i he at then added later on another show they be very dangerous if he were jailed which of course is also true we have not seen in the united states a former presidents of the united states throne in jail is it is something that concerns you oof of the people making sure that they do not go out of they are right mind if something that happens because i know what ism think he have could happen if that for example they do say jackass says o cay ism going to put down trumpet jail thing is a very dangerous thing to even tuck about eat because we do have out tremendously e passionate group of tenters and i mean maybe maybe a hundred a hundred and fifty have never seen thing i can much more passion than they had in twenty twenty much more passion than they had in twenty sixteen may of course t left is taking this as the threat of violence trump himself is doing revenge if he takes office in twenty twenty four he posted on truth social to that a facts ad look done my fault my political opponent in the democratic party crooked jrobidon has told is attorney general to charge the leading re publican hominy and from a president of the united states me with as many crimes as can be concocted said he his force to spend large amounts of time and money to defend himself the demo do not want a run against me or they would not be doing this on president an weaponization of quoniqual justice but soon in twenty twenty four it will be our turn ago ism now that is what this battle is going to come down and of course a this is the language that is being spoken by a lot of the republican primary electric because that has always been the language spoken by the republican primary elector the problem of course t at independence do not actually hear this call and is is the thing that ism warning a lot of republicans lot conservatives lot of voters in these primaries just because you feel and believe the thing does not mean that political in dependence and swing voters are going to feel the thing it does not you get we if to get out of our own heads little bit i understand the thing i feel the thing myself i also understand that ism not the only voter in the twenty twenty four election the donate trump cashmere is is going to come down to in the end basically one issue with regard to this legal case the issue is going to be whether down from actually believed that you lost the election if they can prove the dona's from believed that he lost the election it will be fairly easy for them to convince a deny jury that donate trump was lying that was fraugell and all his now i do not think that the elements this crime are tit our tailor made for this i think it is very difficult to see how this fits into a civil rights violation or how that fits into a fraud case ore ye to fits into an obstruction case but at the very feaster can have to prove that he knowingly did all these things knowingly gets into donate mom's hat that is really what this is all about and this is what donna drum's lawyer was saying yesterday hone of donates frog's lawyers her name was lend baba she said just because he was told thou lost the election does not mean that he believed you lost the election here so was yesterday the number a there is testimony of there's a number of age toad have said that the president was made aware that he lost the election and yet continued to the argue that that there was stolen from them how i you reconcile goes to things i think that everybody isn't made aware that he lost the election ta tat does not men that that was the only advice to is give is that anybody understands what happens in the oral office there are numerous an not of advisers than politicians tan lawyers not just one our too that our giving you advice an telling you what they bell e it is true he may not agree with milk tenth he may not agree with one of his lawyers that that does not mean that there ware an other people advising him exactly the opposite case again this there danger out of contacts an the suggesting that yea e he was told he was told we knew he was told that s a mean believed a thing that is very common phernonaltrump he is told lot of things that he does not believe that meanwhile taco who is a former trampler he says that well if the actually pursue to conspiracy knowingly then that is violation of law that is not free speech again they told him to come down to knowingly here's here's taco he is been out insisting that their criminalizing speech a we are the simple counter that is a you you actually hin solicited further crime thou speech and be prosecuted for it just the son example a in the some of the reporting to day where is aunty are piano tells one of his has o wacky witness well that speech but that is a crime farewell that is true but you actuallywould have to have him do that which is not exactly what happened in this particular case what is can it happening to see hell i mean it is at easy jury a price can be very bad for it for present in trump the real question is what that means for the twenty twenty four election and again i mind everybody two things can be try once to mean unjust indictment they can be going after trump unfairly and also trump may not be the best person to run for the republican party while facing indictments every other day from now until the election well independence look at him and squad already we have reached the end of to days showed back to our money with much more on bench bureau this is the benchbiro show

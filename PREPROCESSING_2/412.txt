welcome to the superman japonica s cut science science tace to uses for i and your superman and of a professor of neurobiology and homology at stamford school of medicine today we are discussing focus and concentration and tools for improving your focus and concentration this is a topic that have covered previously on the superman ladpodcast but in different contacts for instance we had a very popular episode on eighty eight attention defies at hyperactivity disorder which of course relates to the topic of focus and how to improve focus it so talked a lot about dopamine motivation and drive in fact that the title of your previous also quite popular episode to this podcast but never before have we had a single episode silly devoted to the tools to improve focus and concentration the ration now for recording this episode is to provide people one location where they can go and quickly access the specific tools for increasing focus and concentration that are known to be the most powerful tools and the most up to date tools in fact to day's episode is going to include description of several purer viewed studies and the tools that emerge from those scientific previewed studies that point to new and fortunately even briefer protocols than have described before at a basically describing here is tools that in a very short amount of time will allow you to significantly increase your focus and concentration abilities those tools will include behavior tools nutrition base tools supplement base tools brain machine in erase base tools and for those of you that are working with physician prescription drug tools to day's episode ought to benefit anybody young or old or anything in between whether not you have eighty eighty or not today's episode is going to give you tools hat you can apply in your daily life most all of them are completely zero cost and those tools will allow you to tap in to the zoochemistry and the nor circus within your brain and body that pure reviewed science has reliably shown can significantly input your focus and concentration abilities just ought you'll teaser of the kinds of tools that i am going to provide you on to day's episode a previous guested on the superman ladpodcasts was doctor windy sezuki doctor zezuki is a professor of psychology and serow science at new york university or and why you as its commonly referred to this also the dean of arts and sciences at and why you for laboratory made a very important discovery which was that a very brief just twelve actually thirteen if you really count the the into but thirteen minute daily meditation performed for a period of about eight weeks significantly increased peoples focus and concentration abilities and the great news is you did not need all eight weeks it was just that is how long the ran in the study during to day's episode i will describe that protocol in detail it'll also provide you and even briefer alternative to that protocol that you can use if for instance you find yourself with only three minutes are fore minutes are five minutes a day to meditate the great news is there is quality purereviewed science to support that form of meditation for improving focus and concentration and that falls under the ben of these zero cost tools that you can really use to taken to the narrow chemistry and nail circuits that really allow you to take control of your cognivabilities and i prove them over time ill also provide you important details about that protocol another protocols for instants contrary to popular belief it is not i repeat it is not a good idea to do a focused based meditation within the four hours before bedtime many people including some of the subjects in that study performed by the kabuki lab found that when they did a focusing meditation protocol even if it was very calming it led to difficulties in falling and staying asleep that runs counter to a lot of what wee heard about meditation being great for sleep it turns out meditation might be great for sleep at certainly as great for improving focus capacity but i hall recommend that if you are going to apply a focus meditation tool in order to improve your focus and concentration that you make sure that that is performed not within four hours prior to bedtime that is just a brief example of the sorts of tools and protocols and details about the tools and protocols that it'll provide on to day's episode i should mention that we have provided links in the show note captions that you can quickly go to the studies that we describe as well as some of the behavioral tools and other tools that will cover things the use of byword beat supplements et camera our goal here again is to provide you the maximum number of tools for focus and concentration that you can pick from and choose from an apply in your life and trying a eliminate as much of the leg work required to seek out and apply those tools before we begin id t emphasized that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zeros to consumer information about science and signs related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science backtelectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that is one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element firstling in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any con physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doctor slash supermen oke let us talk about focus and concentration and how you can improve your focus and concentration using science based protocols now because to a is episode is mainly focused on tools and not much the underlying mechanisms i mainly going to focus on what to do in when and how to do it but i just want to take about three minutes and briefly describe a model that is a visual image that you can put in your mine that will help you incorporate the tools that all provide and that generally will help you understand at a mechanistic level how focus in concentration work what i want you to imagine is an arrow and an arrow of course has an arrow head and has the shaft of that are and in the context of the neuron science of focus and concentration the negro chemical system that really represents the shaft of that arrow right the straight line is epinephrin also called a adrenaline and to day it'll refer to a adrenaline and pin veteran interchangeably turns out that epinefran slash o adrenaline are released within your brain from a locational cluster of neurons called locus sedulous but you do not need to remember that name end from your body from the a renal glance and the release of epinefron from those two locations overall increases energy it increases alertness it does not alone increase focus a the reason have assigned epinefron adrenaline as the shaft of the arrow is that if focus is the arrow there is no focus without epinefron things whether not their behavioral or psychological or supplements or drugs that increase epinefron allow focus to occur they are necessary for focus but they are not sufficient for focus that is they are required but they are not enough to create focus we are going to need epinefron in the equation without epinefron there is no focus or concentration now the aero head on this metaphorical arrow head that represents focus in concentration is going to be represented or related to the mechanisms of a septal coming a different petrochemical that also exists in the brain anybody in acting the body its responsible for the contraction and movement of your muscles but today were talking about a septal calling not in that context but rather in the context of its released within the brain a retooling is released from a couple of different locations in the brain and the best way to think about it is its a spotlight it highlight specific neuron's nerve cells that should be active or more active i should say than the other neurons in the environment the reason have assigned the ahead to a seatocoling and a seetocolling to the arrowhead is that if you have an arrow with a very big arrow head that is really broad really blood imagine a mile wide arrowhead that is not very focused on any one locations not really pointing to any one location is it but with a narrow really tightly focused arrow head well that is focus on one location we have alertness epinefron and then we have the actual direction in which are concentration and focus is placed and that is in least in this mental model create g a stop coming and then in order to have on going focus we need another narrow chemical and it turns out that that third chemical is dopamine a molecule often associated with pleasure and reward but it is really the molecule of motivation here i want you to imagine in your mind and arrow with an arrow head think of set coming in the arrow head a shaft or a line behind that arrowhead which is epinephrin also call the adrenaline and then behind it a sort of an engine that keeps that focus moving forward right because we do not just one o be focus for a moment we want to be able to focus for ten minutes or for an hour may even for two hours turns to there is an optimal duration to focus it'll teach you that n just a little bit but these three narrow chemicals together a retooling epinephrin and dopamine really allow you to get focus to focus very precisely and in fact increasingly precisely over time to really narrow and narrow and narrower focus progressively within a single bout of focus and to continue to do that n to be able to do that repeatedly whenever you want to here ism purely talking in metaphor and in models and mental models of arrows but in a moment or two it'll start transitioning discussing tools which ill talk about increasing dopamine and a stop coming or increasing epinefron and dooming in various comminations with various approaches and what i you to conceptionaleyes is how those are contributing to creating a very narrowly pointed arrow that has the capacity continue moving forward over and over that you can focus as sharply and as long as you and of course for those of you that want to get really down in the weeds of how dopamine works we have an entire episode about dopamine motivation and drive that really gets into narrow transmitter release and dooming base lines and thresholds and all of that sort of thing we also have episodes on focus much longer episodes i should say on focus that incorporate a lot of the biology of a stop coming turns out a setocollings also n solved in hero plasticity et camera and epineferan of course relates to stress in our capacity to deal with in buffer stress and on and on those episodes are all available to you in their long form at huborman labor come can find the very easily they are all timestamps you can navigate to the particular topics most of interest to you i mention this all not as a diversion from what we want to cover today but i know that some of your hungry for a lotmore mechanism but to day's episode is really mainly focus on the tools i will of course touch mechanism but if you really want to do the deep dibs mechanism go to huborman labor come and you will have more than you ever could want about those mechanisms let us jump into the tools for concentration and focus if you want to think about tools of any kind to modify your biology or physiology in any way whether not for cognac functioned you want get a better exercising or you want o bell muscle or you want improve your hormones you need to think and understand tools in the context of modulation and mediation what do i mean by that well it is quite simple really mediation is how specific types of chemicals and cell ls and circuits and organs control very specific things in your brain and body whereas modulation is the ability of chemicals and cells and circuits to a just how different things change how different things work in your brain and body but to do it more broadly what o i mean by this lame give an example for instance ism going to tell you now that one of the most important things to build and maintain your focus in concentration is to optimize your sleeping behavior that is to get and enough quality sleep i would say eighty per cent of the nights of your life not every one can get optimal sleep a hundred percent of the nights of their life nobody truly nobody achieves that however sleep has been shown to relate to cognac performance physical performance hormone output and many other things including a mine system function what we can reliably say is that sleep modulates just about every process in your brain and body you have to get great sleep there's simply no tool that is going to alow you to overcome chronic sleep deprivation and allow you to remain focus no pill no device no supplement no protocol whatsoever there are tools to overcome one night or may be two nights of sleep deprivation will talk about those but at a fundamental level we need to do the things that modulate are focus an attention in powerful ways and sleep really is that thing we have done two episodes one called master your sleep and the other episode is perfect your sleep the perfect your sleep as a obit more this episode more focus on protocols master sleep includes protocols and mechanism again you can find thosetat superman labor come feels have a sleep tool kit it distilled list of things to do in order to optimize your sleep a highly recommend that you download that you go to superman labor come go to the curl network newsletter it is listed there if you want you can sign up for the news letter but you do not after you can simply download the peatyaph of that tool kit for zero cost why do i say sleep modulates focus an attention well it'll give an analogy if right now on pulled a firearm in this building or if we had a fire in this building my attention would drift it would not be on recording this potgassitwould be on something else but would i say that the firearm mediates attention i mean firearms are not really involved in attention no rather they modulate my attention the noise in the to modulates my attention that is quite a bit different than a tool that it'll provide later andi'll just give you i hint of now n factual give it t you now which is that forty hurts by naval beats have been shown in a number of previewed studies to increase focus and concentration and if you to access forty hurts by nail beats in order to improve your focus and concentration you can do that you can actually get at zero cost you can go into the store princes the apalapstore this is also available for enjoy phone there is an apt called brain wave and you can go there you can did in forty hurts and they will play these synodal beats it is been shown in multiple quality previewed studies that playing a pattern of sound waves to one ear to and the other ear which is slightly offset in frequency meaning not quite the same presence some whore that that combination of frequencies place to the different ears actually get integrated within deep braided centers and can increase focus in concentration in part by increasing levels of the narrow chemical opening and a head of calling which we talked about a l bit earlier in this arrow model of focus will provide a link to that a i do not have any relationship to that a i should mention but it is an excellent one it is one that have use for many years therefore also additional functions within the pages for sleep and for other things but the forty hurts for zero h c is the way redoubt forty hit stimulation has been shown to improve focus and concentration here is my recommendation in thewy that i use it i would not use forty eats by norlbeats every time i doing about of work what i tend to do is use it for about five minutes prior to that work and then turn it off and then do the work and all talk about other tools to use during that work whether its reading or math or even just emailing or something where i require a bunch of focus for a while however there are times in which ism in an area or ism in a state of mind where ism feeling very intractable and then it'll keep the forty hurts by nor beats on the entire time ism doing that bout of connive work i also sometimes use the forty hurts by forbears prior to work out and pretzel to wait work outswhere i really one to be able to focus on in contracts specific muscles this a very useful tool again supported by quality pe reviewed science zero cost available out there not just in the brainwave put in multiple as i think many of you will benefit from it some of you might not experience it immediately as a total dropping in to a tunnel of focus in the same way that you might with say o the sorts of narrow chemicals tat will talk about later alpha g p c and some of these other things that change nor chemicals directly but none the less forty hurts by norlbeats are a very powerful tool again zero cost nonfharmicallogic tool the tap in to your own innocents meaning within you or exists within you physiology in order to increase a head of collie and some other nor chemicals and they have been shown to work quite well o case assuming that you are sleeping well eighty per cent of the nights of your life for at least working on the various protocols tools to sleep well and sufficiently long eighty per cent of the nights of your life and you are interested in additional tools that are sound based in order to improve durability o concentrate in focus there are quality previewed studies supporting the idea that white noise or pink noise and believer not there is something call pink noise it has to do with the specific frequencies of sound that are in the noise well white noise an pink noise have been shown to not improve concentration person but to improve peoples ability to transition into concentrated states i do noted to use white noise in pink noise while i work b y no number people that do i know people that also use what is called brown noise a the focus i know from the engineering and computer inside get really into these details of white noise pink noise brown noise you can fine white noise pink noise or brown noise and listen to it through headphones or in the room there is indeed some data to support the fact that white noise and tho some extent pink noise and brown noise can support the release of particular norchemicals but more data showing that they can amplify the activity of neurons and the can prefrontal quarter this front areas or the bumper behind your forehead a that is directly related to your ability to direct your own focus and remain focus on certain things you have the option of either using byword beats be for but not during your work that is forty hurts by not beats or forty hurts bynorbets throughout your attempt to focus you also have the option of not using by normal beats but using white noise pink noise or brown noise again there a lot of zero coste as you can find also white noise pink noise and brown noises on you too and these are tools that really have been shown over and over inhuman to a low people to focus with more depth and to decrease the transition time into focus this is a really key point a lot of people are challenged with getting into a mode of focus none of us however should be expected to just sit down and drop directly into a state of focus i think that is completely and unfair request of ourselves me for instance you would not expect yourself to go out on the track or go out for run and not warm of you might jog for a few minutes or even walk before you would jog in the jog before you would run right i would hope you would do that and if you are doing resistance training i doubt that you go over and load up the bar f the machine with the maximum mount o wait that you can move and then just drop right and that you always do a warm up and i think it is very important to understand mental work focus and concentration as requiring that warm up what is that warm up well what that warm u is that warm up is the camping up or the increase of epinephrin adrenalin a setocoline and dopamine the way that nor chemicals work as you do not just get to flip switches in our brain because we decide to that is a fantasy that sort of f the the limitless move or o movies an ideas that suddenly in aflippus witch on your arm and also yourgoingto be inflate or focus that is just not the way that your nervous system works there is a gradual dropping into any state whether not that state of sleep right you go from shall ow sleep to deep sleep in the out eventually focus too you go from shallow focus to increasingly deep focus that is in our metaphor of the arrow it is very broad its pointed a lot of things and overtime as we drop in to focus that arrow is narrowing and narrowing and narrowing in fact probably better o think about it narrowing and then sometimes oscillating and getting wider again we might hear something down the hallway or more typically our phone bus or will think oh i wonder what and is doing our had not contact them about something your focus is dynamic it is not what we call a step functions like you go from focus to focus than you drop in your maxim focus by in understanding this dynamic by understanding that you are going to be continually going in and out of progressively but varying levels of focus you will greatly release the pressure on yourself to feal focused all the time when you want to be this is very keep peoplewho are very good at focusing understand this and understand that they cannot expect themselves to just immediately focus and then snap into or out of focus i be patient with yourself and also understand that focus is an ability that you can improve your ability to focus by engaging the neral circuits responsible for focus repeatedly over time through call negro plasticity the ability of your nervous system to change in response to experience and that has a couple of different components but put very simply what we repeat get etched in our nervous system to becomes easier over time and the more emotionally important or vital something feels to us the more likely it is to trigger neural plastic were in talk a little bit more about have ncreasinal circuits for focus later but right now what you have in hand is the key importance of sleep and i again will direct you to hubermalabdot common the goal network newsletter to really work on optimizing your sleep we have also got to auditory sound based tools for improving focus there is forty hurts by naralbeats used before or during bouts of focus and concentration and if you do not those or even if you do you might alternate them with or occasionally use white noise pincnoise or brownnoise also readily available at zero cost the question i often get is how long should i try to focus well the research literature point to the key important of called all radian cycles tuvalu probably heard of circadian cycles ore circadian biology circa the day circa can is about twenty four hours cycle well our brain anybody operate within that day or within each and everyday i should say with ninety minute altradian cycles my suggestion would be any him you are going to sit down and trying focus or going to try and do a focus bout of physical exercise or skill learning or musical learning or may be you reventjust having a conversation may be your a therapy or your attending therapy or a class how long should it be and the ideal duration is about ninety minutes not exactly ninety minutes but we can reliably say ninety minutes or less it does not have to be the full ninety minutes but trying to push yourself to be able to drop into two hours of focus are three hours of focus will possible is not really in line with what we know about the underline biology everything from our sleep states or the different stages of see and our waking states is divided into these ninety minute cycles are called otradean cycles what i to do a set a timer for ninety minutes i acknowledge and accept the fact that under most conditions unless ism really pressed for a dead line and am optimally culminated at camera the first five to ten minutes of that ninety minutes are a transition time s the warm up for focus but i do include it in that ninety minutes and then i really try and drop into doing focused mental work or learning of some sort again this could be physical as well motor skin learning were the a running or lifting waits et camera and really trying drop into that across the full ninety minutes again accepting the fact toque it is not just an idea the fact that occasionally are focus will flicker it will jump out of focus and then a big part of being able to focus is to go back to focusing the way i you to conceptualize this perhaps is that arrow head suddenly getting very very broad that your focusing on many things or that arrow shifts to indifferent location in the room the key is to be able to shift it back and to narrow it once again and that is an active process much that it requires a lot of metabolic energy your brain is the chief consumer of metabolic energy a the calories that you consume is call banal metabolicgrate most of that is not related to movement or heart beat or breathing its related to brain function your brain is a glutton with respect to colonic need understand that at the end of ninety minutes ore may be en after forty five minutes you might feel rather tired or even exhausted and it is very important that after about o focus that you take at least ten minutes and ideally as long as thirty minutes and go through what i call deliberate refocus you really want to focus on somewhat menial tasks or things that really do not require a ton of your concentration this is starting to become a little bit of a movement out there in the can apoppsychology and optimization world this idea of not looking at your phone as you walk down the hall to the bathroom certainly not looking your phone in the bathroom and i should mention by the way that this is a a particular annoyance of mine have you notice that weight times for rest rooms and public places has increase substantially in the last ten years the reason for that is not digestive coquet it is not the up microfilm it might be the gut mi crime but chances are it is because people are on their phones in the bathroom you doing yourself and everybody else a favor by staying off your phone in the rest rum staying off your pone while walking down the hall try and give yourself some time to deliberately decompress to let your mental states idle to not be focused on any one thing that period of idling is essential for your ability to focus much in the same way that rest between sets of resistance training or rest between exercise is vital to being able to focus and perform during the actual sets or during the actual bouts of running or cycling or whatever on your particular form of exercise might be deliberate decompression is key and i know this is hard because we are all being drawn in by the incredible a rich array of sensory information available on our phones and other devices but i cannot emphasize this enough are ability to focus is not just related to what happens during the entry and movement through those focus bouts but after those focus bouts we really need to deliberately decompress and of course the ultimate decompress the time in which we are not directing our thinking in our action is during sleep and it is no wonder or i should say holds together logically that that deep long lasting duration of not controlling where our mind is at is in fact the ultimate form of restoration even if we have very intense dreams take that period after each nine you minute or less focus bout right remember those focus bouts don't out to be full ninety minutes that see you forty five minutes of work it is done with it set it down and go do something for may be five ten may been thirty minutes that is functional for your day i just not just walking round in circles or staring up the style if you can do that do that he most of us have other things to do but do things that are rather automatic or reflective for you and trying not to do any focus reading try not to bring your vision into a tightlocation such as your phone and trying deliberately decompress because that will allow you to drop in to intent scouts of focus again repeatedly repeatedly throughout the day ism often asked how many up trading in cycles one can perform throughout the my that depends on how well you slept how well you are nourish which well talk about in a moment and how well trained up your focus capacity is and here is the paradox if you are very trained at focusing if you are very good at dropping into focus you are actually going to need more deliberate decompression and de focus and i recommend only doing about two maybe three deep work sessions per day not one ninety minute session than expecting yourself to do another one another one another on but rather one deep work ninety minute session a may be another in the afternoon a lot of people get surprised by this and say wait how many people can afforgijust work three hours a day ism not seeing just work three hours a day ism really talking about the hard mental work and again somewhat paradoxically the more you can concentrate the more deeply you can concentrate the few are deep work concentration bouts you can actually perform each day is make sense however if you think about in the contact of say resistance training if you are stronger and stronger in the him or you are an endurance athlete and you can on ultra marathons a hundred miles or you are essentially cutting a deeper cut into your recovery capacity then somebody who is not very skilled at those things or cannot perform as much intense work the intensity of the work scales directly with how long you need to rest after that work i at the stage of my life and pretty good it dropping in to and maintaining focus bouts of concentration provided the landscape of my life is right maund i do not have some burning stressful thing that is a sensual or an emergency that ism tending to and that i put my phoneaway or turn it off i can do three ninety minute focus bouts per day but that is about it and then in between those focus bouts ism doing other things that require less focus some of you may be able to perform four what i highly recommend is that you try doing at least one that is one ninety minute or less bout of focused concentrated work per day and yes that means the weak ends to and on the weakens i to read a book with my phone nowhere in sight not on an to device that is what i do or it'll listen to an audiobook sometimes while taking a walk but really concentrating on what ism trying to learn what ism hearing and what ism seeing again a daily ninety minute bout is one to start with in tho wits after about four weeks of that if you are able to stay concentrate at work through the agitation then i would consider increasing the number of focus bouts again this is not to say that you should go to your teacher or your om oh t advisor or your parent or your friends and they listen i i cannot really concentrate or think about anything for more than ninety minutes per day that is not what i am saying these are deep focuses bouts these are bouts of work or i should say mental work of physical work where you are really forcing yourself to focus and refocus to sharpen the head of that arrowhead to redirect end to what your trying to concentrated on and it is indeed hard work i would even think about it for less a workout of any kind it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a item in mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs have ben taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once ore usually twice a day is that it gets to be the robotics that i need for got health our got is very important is populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those robotics athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptegins vitamins and minerals that make sure that all f my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste crime if you would to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitamin d three k too again that is athletic green stock calm slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the years supply a item and three k to i mention the topic of nutrition a little bit ago and of course nutrition is a complicated topic in fact one of the quickest ways to feel into a battle on line as to say something definitive about nutrition is one a clearly state my stands about nutrition i fully support and applaud those of you that are vegans for whatever reason those of you that are pure carnivore for whatever reason and those of you that are omnivore for whatever reason i happen to be an omnivore my goal is always to eat high quality minimal or non process foods and to eat things in moderation i do a meat from sustainable sources or from organic sources i eat starches and i vegetables and i fruits i try not to eat sugarcane i do not really highly process foods at this point in my life that is me that is what i do but ism certainly not dictating what people should eat i know certain people are qeitogenic and i can say that for people who achieve mitosis and can get into mitosis yes indeed there is a mental state associate with mitosis that will allow your brain to function and to think really clearly that many people find very attractive and keep them going back over and over again to a biogenic diet ism somebody who for instance has nomen in mitosis many times in my life at least not deliberately but i actually will ingest liquid stones from time to time because of the further connive an handymen on physical enchantment that i experience on top of nutrition that does includes some carbohydrates there a lot different ways to approach all this whether not your avian omnivore vegetarian carnivore et camera the point is this you're ability to focus and in fact your ability of neurons to income specific information in your environment that is to represent what is out there in the world is actually related to your blood luck level now here setting aside the discussion of mitosis an and quitogenic diets for the moment but there is a beautiful study the was cushion neuron not long ago that show that the tuning that is the precision with which neurons in the brain or represent things in our environment is actually much greater when there is sufficient glucose in the brain translated into english this means that when we are fasted or when our blood glucose is very low we are not able to perceive and think about things as clearly now there is a twist to this however many people who practise intermit in fasting and i should say i practise a sort of pseudo intermix fasting generally eat my meals between the hours of eleven a m and eight p m although sometimes their some wiggle around that occasionally have an early breakfast ism not supervised about it but i know there are number of people we are doing longer fast for the eating in a six hour window we did an entire episode about fasting yo can again find that hubermanlavdot come will likely have such in panda whose an expert intermix fasting on the podcast intermittent fasting has a lot of different potential benefits for some people it is a convenient way to restrict their calories for other people to convenient way to avoid eating that is its easier to not eat than treat a small portion of they of for intermittent fasting and on and forth but one of the things that you here very often is that some people being fasted because they the clarity of mind that it provides here is the situation neurons unlessyou are in aquitogenic diet really thrive on glucose they love glucose and as i mention before your ability to think and perceive things is actually enhanced by having sufficient glucose in your blood street why would it be that some people experience a heightened state of mental clarity when they are fasted have certainly experience that before well i should say that provided your well hydrated enough and you've enough electrolytes in your system what tends to happen is that when you ingest food there's a shift in your nervous system towards called parts sympathetic mode that is the more relaxed you party herd t as rest an digest although it does other things a more relaxed mode they can indeed make us very sleepy if we have too many crabber hydrates hat achy can make us quite sleepy however if we have any food if we have enough of it that is if our got is full it diverts blood to our got and we become sleepy and we cannot focus as well a lot of people really fasting in the state of being fasted for focus and concentration because they do not have as much of that parts sympathetic activation there just not as sleepy and in fact under those conditions half as much coffin will give you just as much lift as twice as much coffin will give you on a full belly of piston that is just the way that cabin interacts with blood glucose what i you to imagine is if you had a measure of focus from zero to ten these are arbitrary units ten being maximal focus an zero being not focus at all imagine a you shaped function right where if your very fasted you are going to have high degree of focus and concentration but then if you in jest some food in your belly is full your focus in concentration is reduced but having enough blood glucose and maybe even elevated blood glucose will increase cognac function there two ends of the spectrum on one end of the spectrum blue locos is relatively low and your fasted and you can thinker behave in a very concentrated way and on the other end of the spectrum you have a lot of blood locos rights a sufficient blood locos you never want your blood locos to be too high and that allows your neurons to in code and perceive and basically allow you to think really clearly you sort of have to pick your condition what you want for your bouts of focus and concentration i actually do both what i do as as i mention before i eat my meal sometime around eleven a m my first meal typically unless ism very hungry when i wake up and i will do my work out and one bout of focused work i was think of this is my hard work early in the day and i do that fasted it'll be consuming water with electrolights maybe element or other electrolights may be some caffeine is well in the form of your borate or coffee that is my first focus about of ninety minutes or less that is essentially done fasted and then it'll eat and then i do notice after i eat silly have a diminished capacity to focus but then again in the afternoon i will do another ninety minute bout of focus and ill talk about some the tools i use to make sure that that bout of focus is optimal for getting the most amount of focus t cordon wither not it is mental work or physical work although i tend to do my physical work early in the day in my mental work both early and late in the day to make this very simple or as simple as i can for you being fasted is great for focus an concentration provided your not thinking about food the entire time and being fed is terrific for focus and concentration act fly can improve coronal function provided that you did not eat too much food one way to manage this is if you are going to have a lunch to make sure that you do not stuff yourself at lunch they are not overeating and to not get quite full that you put your nervous system into this parasympathetic mode and make it hard to focus in the afternoon i know a lot of people experience a dip or even a crashing energy in the afternoon that make it really hard to focus for that reason it'll list remind people of a tool have talked about many times before which is based on the biology of a decisive and affine et camera which is to delay your first coffin and take to ninety two a hundred twenty minutes after waking up i know that can be painful for certain people i violate that rule when ism working out very early in the morning it'll drink my caffeine before my work out which often occurs within ya thirty sixty minutes of waken but in general unless ism working out very early i will invest my affine ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes after i wake up again i want to emphasize that if you hear somebody out there say being fasted is optimal for focus and concentration well that is true in one context and perhaps i deal for a certain part of the day and other people will say no neurons run on glucose you need glucose in your bloodstream in order to get those neurons to be tuned that is to respond with electrical activity in the optimal way when your reading something or when your trine to perform exercise all that is also true and of course you can incorporate both i in fact as i just described incorporate both fasted states and fed states in order to optimize my concentration and focus and as a brief note about mitosis for those of you that actually manage to transition into mitosis and our maintaining a qeitogenic state that as i mentioned earlier can enhandsbraine function concentration and focus because of the way in which ketones can be used as a called optimal fuel for neurons the erogenic diet was originally designed if you will for epilepsy has a whole relationship to epileptic controlling epileptic seizures and it can in fact allow people to achieve focus concentrated brain states in the future it'll do an episode about mitosis and be sure to circle back on how to optimize mitosis for focus and concentration although i have to believe that most of the people listening to this are probably not in mitosis are falling a quitogenic diet that is why mainly focus on fasted states and fed states and just to make sure that ism thorough a fasted state to me would be a state in which you haven't ingested any calories but may have ingested caffeine or even a small amount of artificial sweetener or something that but really have not ingested any significant number of calories in the previous for to ate or may been twelve hours and again there is tremendous variation here depending on how long people fasted whether not time y the state right after people wake up et camera again if your interesting internment in fasting both for sake of mental and physical health and performance check out our episode on fasting at human lapdog calm i also want to touch back on this idea of which foods can increase focus knowing the episode on d h it that i did a touched on this quite a bit as it relates to elimination diets nor there is a whole industry and a ton of interests for obvious reasons into what sorts of things kids and adults should and should not eat in order to reduce symptoms of eighty eighty i think that the sum total of those data point to the fact that reducing simple sugar in take and certainly highly process food ice cream candy chips et camera those sorts of things really does seem to improve symptoms of eighty eighty in both children and adults but once you move pass hating start to say well which foods can improve concentration focus well foods that for instance include a lot of tyrosine which is a precursor to dooming and now why dopamine is important in this context are certainly going to increase concentration and focus things parmrge on cheese certain meat certain not you can look up which foods a contain high amounts of tracing thermals some fruits vegetables that include hihamounts of tracing but to be quite direct it does not matter whether or not you are in testing foods that are rich in the precursor monoacid to dopamine a see calling et camera if you are consuming large amounts of those foods that is one can look and see for instance that a stake includes a lot of the precursors to a set of coaling it as a monoacid precursors to dopamine as well in their other foods that will do that as well but if i were to injestsay too ribs stakes that is a lot of meat and it will direct a lot of blood to my gut and it will cause me to be sleepy and that will create challenges in me being able to achieve states of focus and concentration the simple way to put this is if you eat too much or you eat a very large volume of food you are going to diminish your focus and concentration a the key is to eat enough that your nourished for the certain activities mental and physical that you need to perform but if your eating large meals you are going to diminish your concentration and focus period i know many people are curious as to whether not affine can improve focus and concentration and indeed it can there is an immense amount of data supporting the idea that affine provided it is consumed in the appropriate dosages can improve mental performance and physical performance in it largely does that through improvements in focus and concentration the dosage of affine of course is going to depend on how affine adapted you are how much fine tolerance you have and that is going to vary tremendously depending on whether not you invest that affine with or without food as i mentioned earlier but there is a kind of general range in which we can talk about affine as being useful for focus and concentration and the range is basically from a hundred milligrams to four hundred milligrams i want a caution everybody out there if your somebody who suffers from anxiety or panic attacks and you are not used to invest in affine and you run out and unjust four hundred milligrams of affine in the form of a espresso or your hamate or an energy drank or in piliform that is going to be very uncomfortable for you your going to be sweating profusely your portrait is going to increase your going to be quite panic in fact or at least anxious be cautious with your use and adopting of affine if you are not already affine adapted but most people do quite well to invest a hundred to two hundred milligrams of affine prior to doing and focused work and again i recommend delaying your affine and take to ninety to a hundred twenty minutes after waking unless you are using that affine to really jolt your system a before a work out affine can of course be invested in various forms even piliform but most people invest in the form of coffee or my particular favorite way to invest affine is your hamate it is important and i should note that you should actively avoid the smoked versions of your hamate as they contain a lot of carsonagenic cancer promoting compounds there some great carbamate brands out there the most cause effective way to consume it would be to use the loosened tea in to to pour water over that there is one particular bran that i i do not have any affiliation to them whatsoever but have using it for years as ana markets and organic brand that is sold i by mine on amazon we can find it elsewhere on the internet as well again i do not have any affiliation to them is just very costiffec t ta very clean it does not have the smoked flavor at least the one that i buy is not the smoked varieties and none of the carsonagenic compounds are in there at least that 'mawhere of and i the way it taste and it provides a very even lift and and stimulant of that i think certainly works for me and that a number of people i know thathave suggested to also en joy yurbomate or affine also have other additional benefits in particular the affine in yourbomate and coffee another sources of affine are known to increase the density and efficacy that is the number and the function of dopamine receptors and this has been shown inhuman several times by investing affine pretty regularly ouractually increasing the ability of dopamine to have this effect of increasing motivation and drive i ten to invest affine only early in the day attend to cut off my affine and take somewhere around one or two p m to in sure that i can get into a good night sleep but i realize that the re people out there that in jest affine as late as two or three in the afternoon and can still sleep time it will caution those of you that think that you can drink affine in the evening or night time as still fall asleep all of the research points to the fact that the architecture of your sleep in the depth a your sleep is deserrupted even if you are able to fall and stately the sleeper getting as simply not as good as the sleepy would get if you were to shut off your affine and take at least eight hours before bedtime and ideally more ten or even twelve hours before bedtime but of course their practical constraints as well o faso affine is increasing dopamines function by changing the number and efficacy of dopamine receptors but of course it also increases or wakefulness are alertness and that is largely through the narrow chemical systems relate to a decisive which is a molecule tat builds up in our brain and body the longer we are awake its part of the sleepiness system if you will makes us feel fatigued or tired and affine also operates on the epineffer in the adrenalin system in fact if we invest too much affine will sometimes get the sisters those gutters are really the sympathetic as it is called nervous systems by is toward movement and our pupils will dilate they if should get broader now somewhat paradoxically when our pupils get bigger the pupils of our eyes that is our visual world actually narrows at becomes more tunnel not r people do not realize us when our pupils are really small that means we are relax if ye reverse some really tines or yopinsizes pupils they're very relaxed if their pupils are very big the very dilated well then they are very laptop the they are very very alert affine increases alertness by increasing epinefron a adrenalin release both in the brain and within the body and that is another way that it facilitates focus and concentration now there are other ways to increase epineferan in the rain and body besides affine or other stimulants and in fact that has been studied there is an excellent study that was carried out not that long ago on how stress itself can increase our ability to f focus and concentrate that is right how stress itself can increase focus in concentration most people think of stress is impairing our ability of focus but that is actually not true when we are stressed it involves the deployment the release of a adrenalin epinefran and that a adrenalin both changes our visual field inotherwars it narrows our vision to a more tunnel focus that is it makes the grow in our metaphor of the arrow more sharp and it improves our concentration this make sense given what we know about stress when re stress we can to be stressed about a specific thing we start anticipating or wondering or thinking about what is can happen next what led up to this houses can impact me how do i feel right now it really narrows the contact of our thinking and our behavior it is one of my favorite studies that really illustrates how stress can improve concentration and performance is one that was published not that long ago and i will provide a link to this in the show notes it is a paper published in the journal experimental psychology in twenty twenty the title of the paper is not surprisingly acute stress improves concentration performance first author regret d e g r oo t e and this study involve taking a number of subjects and stressing them out or not prior to a cognitive or concentration task and there are a lot of data in this paper but ism just going home in on one specific set of data i should mention as i go there that they measured things cortical a stress hormone they measured anxiety in as a quite thorough study and what they found was that concentration performance improved manyfold shows a from here is a greater than doubling of concentration and performance in the stress group and stress in this contacts was provided using a standard way of inducing stress what they baby do as they bring subjects into the laboratory and they have to either do something fairly mundane in the control group or they have to do a simulated job interview in arithmetic task and there being a valuated as t doing this this is an intense psycho social stress you of there not watching anything disturbing there not being aromatized in any kind of way this is fairly low levels of stress that rat there levels of epineferan and we know this from this study and other levels of cortical another stress hormone modestly within their brain and blood but that even modest increase in these stress hormones and their reported psychological levels of tress really enhance their focus in concentration this may come as surprising was you many people think stress really diminishes connive performance but that is absorb wrong stress improves connive performance now of course their other ways to increase stress levels and to do that in healthy ways to improve concentration in performance and one of the best ways to do that because it sure fire and its generally safe provided you do it safely is deliberate cold exposure this is something have talked about on the podcast before but deliberate cold exposure can be achieved by getting into a cold shower for one to five minutes i we're not used to it you probably one a start with one minute a were you can get into an ice bath and nowadays there a number of different commercial sources of circulating cold water or if you have access to a body of cold water a lake or a pool or asocial we know that getting into cold water or under cold water greatly increases epinefran levels and dopamine levels in the brain and blood there is a beautiful study that was published in the european journal of physiology that showed that the increases in dopamine are massive it near doubling or more of dopamine levels that are very long lasting for hours and epineferon and indeed cortical levels are also increased and in ways that support not just immune system function because they do that but and mood because it does that but that can really improve concentration and focus i touch on this elicit in an episode about memory that there is an age old practise really dating back to medieval times of putting people into cold water right after they learn something in order to spike to increase their epineferan as a way to consolidate those memories for sake of to day's discussion if you are interested in ways to improve focus in concentration you need to in increase your epinefron you are dealing levels cold water exposure is one of the most efficient ways to do that is is not a big hack i do not the word hack i know it is commonly use but a hack is something where your using one thing for a different purpose than it was originally intended for and here not referring to the shower the cold fathom referring to epineferan epinefront is aero hemic a that will place your vision into more of a tonal mode which was allow to focus on cognac of work or physical work in a more specific way you are not gong to be is intractable and it is very easy to achieve by getting into a cold shower or cold body of water for a brief period of time people always ask how long to get under or into cold hate and how cold to make it here is a thing it should be uncomfortably cold but safe to stay in for one to five minutes o case uncomfortably cold that you really want to get out but safe to stay an not cold that's can give you hard attack and not warm that it is comfortable that it does not create that a adrenalin release cold water exposure i shout a deliberate cold water or non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases epineferan levels it is incredibly useful as a tool for this and it is in fact zero cost or even negative zero cost how to be negative zero cost well you can certainly save on your heating bill by taking a cold shower that is one way and for those of you that of access to devices or locations we can get into cold water can submerge while the that can work for those of you that do not may be take a cold bath you get in up to your back that is going to be most efficient for those o yo that cannot do that you it under a cold shower again it should be uncomfortably cold to the point we want to get out but that you can safely stay in for one to five minutes how long should you do it before workout well if you get into really cold water it is in comfortably cold and get o ut after about three minutes your probably good to go dry off and get to work some of you might think this is little bit silly as a tool for focus in concentration but if you look at the data on epinefren and how powerfully can increase focus i think you be very impressed i mean it certainly can increase one's ability to a tend to specific visual stimuli for reading or math work et camera it is going to be very useful of course you do not want to make it cold that your shivering and chattering the whole time and of course you could if you combine this with forty hurts by normal beats there is no reason why you could not combine the two protocols but the point here is that a lot of people would love to and i think ought to leverage the health promoting and powerful a facts of increasing epineferen on focus in concentration and running out and getting stressed by a life event or getting into an argument or something that simply as a way to increase focus in concentration does not seem that adaptive to me deliberate cold exposure is a straightforward way to do that it does involve any one else as pas you could do it with somebody else but does not require any one else and again there are zero low and even negative castaways to approach that if you to know how long the positive effects of epinefron last toward improving focus in concentration wit ally u look to that study from degree at all the acute stress i proves convey performance study they measured concentration be four and thirty minutes after the stress was induced and there does appears to be a quite long lasting really up to an hour or more effect of increasing epinefron how might you apply these sorts of protocols early in the day or later in the day well one suggestion or one potential protocol would be if your going sit down and do some work and if you are already feeling a let in focus no need to reach to this tool but if your feeling your focus an alertness is not quite where you it to be you could take a three minute very cold shower or submerge yourself in cold water for three minutes you might have a cup of coffee as well and then sit down and do that work may be even throw in the forty hurts by normal beats all of that would be layering in the different systems that infer sorry chemicals such as a see coming epineferon and dopa mean that begin to lend themselves to a really terrific ninety minute or less work about now i to discuss some of the purely behavioral tools that quality were reviewed science say can improve focus and concentration significantly at the beginning of to day's episode a talked about the study from doctor wendys's duke's lab where they explored a thirteen minute meditation done every day for a period of eight weeks that meditation led to significant improvements in focus in concentration ability as well as other aspects of connive performance it also improved mood and reduced stress you might be wondering what exactly is this meditation the meditation is very simple n it is one that any one can perform what you would want to do is set a timer for about thirteen minutes i do not think it has to be exactly thirteen minutes but since that is what they included in the study you would set a timer for thirteen minutes you would sit or lie down close your eyes and you would s imply focus on your breathing most people are going to mediant from only doing that breathing through their nose but if you have some sort of obstruction or inability o breathe just through your nose you could probably also do it by breathing through your nose end mouth or just your mouth but ideal would do just nasal breathing for a period of thirteen minutes concentrating on that breathing and concentrating meaning bringing your awareness you are called interceptive awareness if you wanted to get really to technical about it your interceptive awareness to appoint just about an inch inside of your forehead now of course that might sound kind of gory to some of you never actually been inside your forehead but just about an inch behind your forehead is where you would want a place your concentration while also concentrating on your breathing here is the thing about meditation that all studies of meditation show which is that unless you are a very experience meditator your concentration your focus will drift away from your breathing and away from that location about an inch inside your head inside your brain about just behind your forehead that will happen maybe every ten seconds every twenty seconds maybe even every five seconds but an important part of such a meditation practise to improve concentration and focus is that you are continually re focusing back to that specific location and refocusing back on your breath this is something that again is not often discuss people think that if you do a meditation and your just to concentrated on your breath that if your mind drifts that somehow you failed in that meditation but actually that is not the case a huge component of improving your ability to focus and concentrate by way of curl plasticity rewiring of the circus for focus and concentration is the repeated return to a state of focus from a state of non focus or diminished focus as think about it thing to drive down the freeway and staying between the lay landlines souse me and every one in a while because there is a bit of drift on the vehicle maybe the wheels are in a line correctly other something else wrong with the classy or the steering device it starts to drift right a little bit than you hit the rumble stripped and then you pull back to the center that is really what a focused meditation practise is about as opposed to expecting yourself to stay between the mental lane lines to speak you are somebody who is going to do a practise of the sort that i described in thirteen minute meditation practise every day you would want to sit or lie down close your eyes strut a concentrate on your breath focus your attention on a location about it inch behind your forehead and then fully expect that at some point you will be thinking about something else and that is a cue to focus back to that location just about an inch behind your forehead and back to your breath by doing that repeatedly over and over what your really training up is the net work within your brain that indeed includes that prefrontal quarter that your focusing on is well as some other structures the inform a temporal cortex indeed the hippocampus a structure social with memory another components of the curl circus that are involved in directing our mental focus and concentration again i cannot emphasize the importance of this practise being one of focusing and refocusing in fact i would prefer to call such a practise a refocus focus meditation or a constantly refocusing or may be all can come up with a better name for it ism certainly not that good at naming things but this sort of meditation practise has been shown in the study but the kabuki lab and other studies to really improve peoples ability to focus and remain focus much that in the beautiful book altered states they describe a number of different meditation practises some a little bit longer than the one that i described one that seventeen minutes another one that is thirty minutes some people meditate as long as sixty minutes a day although that is quite a long time in my opinion the point here is not how long you focus or somehow trying to achieve total focus for the entire thirteen minute or seventeen minute or sixteen minute bout of meditation while that would be wonderful and i ting many people as poor to do that that is a lot of hard mental work i think for most people out there including myself a relatively short meditation practise of about thirteen minutes in which you fully expect your focus in concentration to drift but that you are continually refocusing is going to be the most effective yes indeed the most effective at teaching yourself to focus and stay concentrate in fact i invite you to interpret every time that you focus off that location about one inch behind your forehead as an opportunity to refocus in thing about the refocusing as the trigger for teaching your curl circus how to focus for extended periods of time and as a bonus to that sort of meditation practise the study from when e suzuki's lab also showed that people experience improvements in sleep and improvements in memory not just improvements in mood and reduction and stress and improvements in focus and concentration but all these other plosive benefits from just doing that thirteen minute a day meditation practise it is one that have started to adopt and have felt tremendous benefit from and that i encourage many of you to try as well the one cautionary note is the one that i mention at the beginning of the episode which is because the refocus as it'll call it meditation does involve a significant amount of effort and engagement of these prefrontal cortical circus it is the eruptive to sleep if perform too close see to sleep if you are going to do that practise i recommend that you not do it within the four hours prior to your bedtime earlier i mention that i would talk about ways to improve focus if you are sleep deprived this is something that ism all too familiar with i put a lot of effort in to optimizing my sleep that something that with each passing year i put more and more effort in to again because sleep is vital for mental health physical health and performance of all kinds but certainly in my role as a student in my role as a professor and in my olein life have had numerous times in which i simply did not get enough sleep or my sleep was terrible for whatever reason and yet i still had work demands an social demands et camera one practice that is very effective it allowing you to focus better than you would otherwise under conditions of sleep deprivation is called non sleep deep breast or instar this is also referred to sometimes as yoganedra yogenedraction means you sleep yogenedra is a practice of lying down for about ten to thirty sometimes even as long as sixty minutes you listen to a script it is an audioscript that takes you through a progressive deep relaxation involves a body scan some long anal breathing it is very restorative in the sense that one tends to emerge from yogenedraor nesting feeling greatly refreshed compared to how you felt prior to it there is also terrific nor imaging data from laboratories in denmark showing that there is a restoration of dopamine levels in the local base ganglia after nesting a k yogenedra whether not you call it yogenedra or nesting which is what i refer to it as non sleepy breast you can find these scripts at zeros multiple places you can find there certain as that a en stir yogenedra as there is a n star protocol that was put out thereby made for which is on tube that you can act us for free there is a n star or i should say a number of enestiar protocols through the partisan a there again number of different places that one can a us antiar protocols i do nesting for ten to thirty minutes per a every single day not just on days where ism sleep deprive if i happen be sleep deprived i would extend that nesting to thirty or sixty minutes and when you do that nesting will depend on when you have time for that bestir when i have not slept well what it'll trying do is lying a quiet place where i can do nest for thirty our ideally sixty minutes sometimes i will fall back o sleep during that enestiar that is fine if you do that but most people will stay watering the ancestor and then it'll emerge from that and go about my day if in the afternoon ism very fatigued because of lack of sleep i might do another antiar of ten to thirty or sixty minutes and then another workout again star something i do every day i talk a lot about this in the episodes related to sleep because it can help you get better at falling and staying asleep at night in addition to feeling restorative in that immediate time frame of the day in which you do in t nectar it is immensely beneficial at various times and for various purposes but here within the contacts of trying to concentrate in focus when your sleep deprived n star a k yogenedra is an immensely beneficial practice there's growing amounts of quality science pointing to the her chemical replenishing effects as i mention before dopamine but also the potential for n star to replace sleep that you have lost i we never want any one to trying usenestiars a total replacement for sleep but under conditions and which you cannot control your sleep nesting is going to be the best way that i am aware of to restore your ability to focus and concentrate for whatever purpose and if you emerge from your avatar and then drink some kafinioal notice an even greater capacity for focus and concentration for all the reasons directly relate to fine again an star is a general tool for enhancing your ability to sleep and it is a tool that you can use in order to compensate for at least to some dear compensate for lostsley when you need to focus and concentrate one thing that really contrasts an es dear and yoganedra with the sort of focus meditation that have talked about a few minutes ago the thirteen minute meditation is that during the thirteen minute meditation you are actively trying to refocus and focus whereas during antiar in yoganedraa your act trying to de focus you can think of the thirteen minute meditation for refocusing and focusing as directly tapping into and mediating improvements in the circuitry for focus and concentration whereas you can think of bestir and yoganedra as modulating your brain embody state to a low you to focus and concentrate better now another tool that you can use to directly tapping to the circus for focus and concentration and to greatly accelerate euro plasticity the improvements are i should say the changes in those circuits that will allow you to focus and concentrate better is hypnosis a lot of people here hypnosis and they think stageshypnosis you know people squawking chickens and doing things against their will but a she hypnosis is a a typical but highly accessible brain state that is been studied with a lot of river at stamford university school medicine by my collogue doctor avid special he is been guest on this podcast previously hypnosis is unique brain state because it is one in which you are deeply focus and yet deeply relaxed to a sort of set up the array of practises heres you can think about them logically the focus refocus meditation is based on and focused on focus no unintended and antiar in yoganedra r aimed at deep relaxation hypnosis is this a typical very powerful brain state in which you combine high levels of focus and deep relaxation now it is a little bit of a tough one to just take oneself into but fortunately there is a tool based on a lot of quality previewed research from the speagalab another labs and that is the reversal r e we e i the reversal is available for no cost at least for a period of time and the i think they place certain elements of it behind a payroll but you can try at zero cost it is available for apple soon i think also to be available for android and they have specific hypnosis protocols that you listen to and these are very brief protocols follow the instructions you are listening to a particular audioscript of avid speak himself and some progressive breathing and achisome i movements that are directly long to the curl circuits that allow for these highly focus deeply relax states and there are components within the reversal specifically geared towards improving focus and concentration again there is meditation for focus there is deliberate decompression amnesty are yogonedra which take you into deep relaxation and then hypnosis is this very special very directed state of highly focus and highly relax tricks a deeply relax that allow access to the neural circus for focus in concentration and allow you to tune those up in to improve those very significantly in a very brief amount of time and again some of those hypnosiscripts are assort as eight minutes summer as long as thirteen minutes what were really talking about here or zero cost tools that directly tap into the neural circus the components within your brain that allow for deep relaxation allow for deep focus and improve your ability to focus and concentrate over time simply by repeating these how often you need to repeat the reverie hypnosis for focus and concentration before you see benefits will that will vary from person o person i tend to use it once every third or fourth day and of experienced tremendous benefits from it i do not think ism unique in that sense they've a lot of data to support this revery a in the protocols within it how long do you have to do anestyare before you experienced those benefits there i would say the first time an every time because it is deeply relaxing that you emerge from at feeling quite restored relative to how you went into it and as i mention earlier the study on meditation it took about eight weeks to see the effects that they observed an note that study but they did not observe shorter time points i highly encourage people to explore meditation geared towards focus an refocus also anestyare non sleep deep breast a ka yoganedra and the revert a specifically the hypnosis within the reversal that is geared towards improving focus and concentration all of these have terrific science to support them this is not wo science or hack or tost something that people came up with this is all grounded in e work from some of the best universities in the world from excellent groups whole looked to underlying neural mechanisms and measured things with a lot of rigor et camera et camera these tools are available to you i highly recommend that you use them and if your interested in the optimal time of day to do these we already mention that the focus refocus meditation should not be done too close to sleep the revert hypnosis a can be done at any time really in fact there's a component of falling back asleep in there in motherworts a hypnosis specifically heard toward helping people teach themselves to fall back asleep when they wake up in the mill the night amnesty are i always say can be done first thing in the morning in the afternoon or any time of day in fact it'll sometimes do that the middle the night if i happen to wake up and need to get back to sleep really these tools can be applied most any time of day except for that one coat about the focus refocus meditation not being done too close to sleep now there is another set of behavioral tools that can really help enhance one's ability to focus and those are visual base tools fact the tools am about to describe are actually being employed in number of schools in china and elsewhere in order t teach children to focus better and for longer periods of time the keep principle here is that much of our cognitive focus ore ability to think about something in a very specific way and stay focused on it to read or to follow a line of conversation in or math or music et camera is going to be directed by our visual system or visual system as two forms of attention and focus one is overt focus which is very straightforward if ism looking at the tip of my pen for those wore listening right now and looking the tip of my pen that is o very focus ism focusing on it with my eyes and of course the rest of my brain then will follow and start to analyze the details of what ism seeing the contours of the pen et camera seem sort of obvious when you first hear it but our cognac focus tends to follow our very visual focus that is also why they put blinders on horses that is also why sometimes wearing a hood or a hat or limiting your visual field in some way can help you enhance your cognac focus it can help limit distraction your just not seeing as much it is also why when we in just caffeine or any kind of stimulant or we are stressed and our pupil's dilate and our vision becomes more tunnel less panoramic but more tunnel they say a sotustraw of you with the world ere looking through a tunnel your focus your visual focus is actually driving your cognac focus your cognac focus is narrower then it would be if you are seeing the whole scene that you are in when you hear this it sounds obvious but for many people including many scientist is just not obvious of this would be the case however that is the case your visual focus drives your cognac focus what is a practise that has been studied and various laboratories on that is being employed in serious schools is to have children or adults visually focus on one location for a given period of time how long anywhere from thirty seconds to three minutes and believe not three meets as a long time to maintain visual focus at one location you if you were to try that renew you would probably find it to be a bit of a strain but if you want to try it you can keep in mind you yes are allowed to blink but also keep in mind that meditation refocusing practise that we talked about earlier that the refocusing is the key component of teaching yourself or your brain you are your brain your brain is you but to teach yourself how to focus better if you are going to incorporate this practise what you would want to do is pick location it could be on a wall could be on your computer in front of you although i would encourage it to not be the contents of your computer screen you might just want to blank your screen might not to put a piece of paper with a cross hatch they are any sort of visual target or yo can imagine of visual target and then focus your visual attention on that target and try to breathe normally try and stay relaxed and certainly allow yourself to blinks t your eyes do not try out this is not a test of how long o you can go without blinking by focusing on that particular location and by forcing yourself to refocus on that location any time your gaze your vision drifts from that location you are encouraging the circus for focus to get better at focusing for longer and longer and at refocussing when your focus drifts off of that location this is incorporating marry circus including the prefrontal quarter things the frontal field for those of you curious about the underlying biology this practice is recruiting certain elements of your local prefrontal quarter also the from till i fields which are locations not far from the prefrontal quarter that r involved in deliberately directing your gaze to particular locations in space not outer space although youcould do the by focusing on stars i suppose but in visual space now i mention before that this is overt visual focus and attention you you are overtly losing at that location but one also very powerful practise for improving focus an concentration is to use covert focus covert focus is where my gaze my eyes are focus on one location such as my pen but my focus is actually directed elsewhere in the room or location that ism in my mind end to some extend my peripheral vision is focus in this case on the door just to my left in the room that am in that takes a little bit more effort this is something that all old world primates of which we are old world primates are able to do and it probably evolved as part of the mechanism by which animals could evaluate the their scene evaluate predators a valuate other primates while not necessarily staring t them directly they can obtain information we can obtain information without having direct our gaze specifically to one location may be e can obtain information for multiple locations indeed we can without getting too far down the habit whole of how vision and cognition relate because we have done episodes on that previously and simply focusing on the tools that can be incorporated to improve focus and concentration here is what i recommend set yourself a low bar at first and set a timer and try to focus on one location for thirty seconds and that is it for that day the next day you might have five seconds and then the next day five seconds after that if you dissipate no bedel simply do the practise for the same amount of time that you did the last time that you did the practice and then gradually try and increase the amount of time that you can focus on one visual location overtly by looking directly at that location if you and if you feel you have the ability you can try and do this through covert attention and focus by looking straightforward for instance an attending to something in the corner of the room and trying to do that for thirty seconds you will find that that is quite a bit harder and then extending that by five seconds every time you do the practice this is something that i do not think you necessarily have to build up to being able to do for a full hour in order to extract the benefits in fact the best way to think about this practice is as a means to get into a focus state if remember back about an hour go i was talking about how focus states are not a drop all the way in and then exit type phenomenon we do not just drop into a focustate the same way we do not drop into the pique performance of a workout we warm up what i recommend is having a thirty second to three minute period at the beginning of about to focus were you going to do work or physical work and anchoring your vision to one location somewhere in the room or if you want to do it covertly can do that setting a time or trying to do that for anywhere from thirty seconds to three minutes what you are doing when you exercise that practise is you are camping up nerd activity within the nerd circuits that create focus and concentration than i would stop losing it that location or that covert location and then i would move to the work that your trying to do either mental work or physical work and if about halfway through your ninety minute bound or at some pointing or ninety minute bout of work or exercise you feel that your concentration is drifting rather than look at your phone and scroll through the thousands of contacts that exists within social senior your phone try just picking a location again on the wall focussing back on the location using that as a ramp up to then direct your focus back towards if your rat training sets and reps that you might be performing if you are running you might do this or cycling you might do this by focussing on a particular location and really homing in on that location physically and this is a practice the lot of athletes use in fact and if your say doing musical practise or math well then you would want a focus on something other than the task that your thing to perform but again using visual focus as a way to ramp up and increase your overall ability to focus and concentrate and then applying the to whatever it is that you are trying to learn or perform next i to talk about compounds that can improve concentration and focus and these are most often consumed as supplements although some of them i should mention can also be derived from food again i just want to remind you that there are things in this case compounds that can modulate a biological mechanism that is can modulate focus and concentration and there are compounds that can mediate can directly contribute to concentration and focus one of the key compounds that supports concentration in focus because it generally supports mood concentration and focus and brain function in general are the omega three essential fhatiacids have talked about the o man three essential phatiacids in variety of contacts in particular depression but also eighty eighty the are interesting data on that and it is really clear that getting somewhere between one and three grams of e p a that is one to three grams of e p a essential fatiacid per day and improve out comes that is can improve mood and can improve cognate of function and while there is some debate about whether not can prove cardiac function it is very clear at least to me that insulting one to three grams of e p mental phatiacids pray is beneficial but again in the contacts of focus and concentration it is in modulating the nerd circuits and brain function that are going to support focus and concentration it is not as if taking one or three grams of eye essential fatiacids per day is going to tap directly in to only the circuits for focus and concentration that said and as discussed on the episode of h superman podcast with doctoring iatric and on the episode on eighty get that i did and on the episode on depression that i did i make it a point to invest one to three grams of e pes per day you can get those e pes from other sources beside supplements of course but supplements are going to be the easiest way to do that you could do that through liquid form fish oil cad live royal some people who are vegan popped for other sources of spies you can find those out there certainly some people eve in use prescription spies to get the dosage really high doterono trick talked about this in the episode with me that is shall something that she does i do not take the prescription form i get them through piliform through are supplement of filiate which is momentous but there are number of different quality sources of spies out there and some of those quality sources also include things fat fish ally and things of that sort ill leave it to you as to whether not you supplement with o magothree fatiacids in order to get that one to three grams per day or whether night you do it through food but i would encourage you to try and reach that threshold because there are number of known polite facts for mood and brain function generally the other thing that can positively modulate brain function and that actually works as a fuel for neurons to function and can improve connive performance in particular within the brain circuits such as the prefrontal correct that are involved in concentration in focus is creatine i know many people are familiar with creating monohydrate for its effects on muscle growth and strength and performance but it is quite clear that the bull of scientific studies have examined the role of creatine in the clinical contacts and as its role in improving cognac performance my read of the literature has led to a practice in which i invest five grams per day of creating monohydrates the for of standard form that available in this is generally available a powder that certainly how i take it i take the creating powder all makes it with water or myatheletic greens or some sort of electrolyte drink at whatever liquid happens to be convenient to jest that in the time of day does not really seem to be important some people are strong believers in consuming creatine post work out while that might be beneficialized simply take it in the morning or post work out its or of depends on when i remember to take it but that five grams of creatine per day in my case really is in heard towards muscle growth or strength or performance as much as geared told tapping into the creatine phosphate system within the brain and specifically the benefits of creatine for prefrontal cortical networks again modulating not directly media but modulating and generally supporting the brain that works that are going to allow me to generate focus and concentration much sleep much a magothre fatiacids creating monohydrate diagrams to day seems to generally support brain function which will generally support concentration and focus now in terms of compounds that more specifically mediate concentration of focus we have to go back to that arrow metaphor model that we talked about at the beginning o the episode that included epinapran a adrenaline a see coaling which acts as this attentional spotlight in fact a cesta coaling and elevated levels of seal coming have been shown over and over again through beautiful work from my moronic slab at you c a say and the kailyard lab down in stop and a number of other labs including nor murder's lab it you see survive again gan to improve or even directly gate curl plasticity by increasing focus directly it is a lot of word but but basically what happens is if a steal coaling transmission is increased even transiently within the brain there is a greater opportunity for nerd plates to take place and the reason there is a greater opportunity for curl plates a a learning to take place is by way of the increased focus that spiking a steal coming can provide si mention earlier there umber different foods which can tain coaling you can look those up on line coaling acting as an monoacid crease cursor to a set coming but of course there are compounds the are supplements that can further and more acutely increase a set coming and indeed i use these myself the most effective one have found is alpha p c alpha p c consumed at dosages of three hundred milligrams to six hundred milligrams prior to a work bout or prior to a work out greatly increase one's ability to focus and concentrate at least that is been my experience and there are some good data in humans how would i use alpha p c i would use alpha p c i taking it about ten to twenty minutes prior to any time i want to focus are concentrate very deeply have taken as much as six hundred milligrams at one time although i find that three hundred milligrams as enough for me and i tent to be quite sensitive to supplements and fine in general all sometimes take it a alongside your borate or with your hamate an or with coffee prior to work out or prior to it bout of work in which ism focussing on mental work is could be reading writing could be math could be data and apsis could be anything where i need a lot of focus in concentration now a number of people contacted me about a recent study suggesting that alpha p c when taking ironically over many years could increase one's vulnerability to stroke have looked at those data and my read of the data is that there not very conclusive although any time you see something that it study that is pointing to the fact that a given compound might increase the property for stroke visit want to be concerned we have to ask ourselves how by what mechanism that is could alpha p c be increasing the susceptibility to stroke and it seems to be related to increases in t m a o which is a marker related to the party of vascular system and one known way to offset increases in t man that are associated either with alpha p c or in creases due to other things ingestion of particular food compounds ash can increase t ma o is to offset that by taking six hundred milligrams of garlic now have been taking alpha p c pretty consistently for a number of years i do not take it every day i would take take it about four days per week again prior to work outs or bouts of connive work i have not seen my t ammo spike and have valuate that by way of blood ten but none the less i take six hundred milligrams of garlic in capsule form any time i eat any way and i do that for general cardiovascular function and there some interesting at on a man system function et camera for garlic have been consuming six hundred milligram capsule of garlic for some period of time some days it'll in just just one six hundred milligram capsule other times it'll take to but based on this resent study and the concerns about t me i make it a point to always in justice six under milligram capsule of garlic any time i take alpha p c which again for me is about four days per week in our model of attention in focus you can now clearly see why taking alpha p c which increases a veto culling transmission would be beneficial for concentration of focus and why taking it with a doublespresso or why taking it with yer romance would further increase concentration and focus because as i mention earlier canine is going to increase apineferan is also going to increase the density of soft be men receptors in the alpha p c is going to increase o t of calling the spotlighting for cognition this ability to really amplify the activity of specific neral networks which is largely what is happening when your trying to focus and pay attention to something specifically if one wants to increase the amount of dopamine transmission in the brain and body for sake of increasing concentration in focus one of the most efficient ways to do that is by injection of the monoacid el tyrosine gan altyrasine can be derived from food sources in vote you to look up those serious food sources on the web simply go to webbrows rand put in foods that contain a lot of el train in you will get a rich array of choices to select from but in my case i use el tracing in capsule form i will take five hundred milligrams of eltirasine three hundred milligrams of alpha p c and a cup of coffee ism careful to do this early in the day certainly not after two or three p m because i do not want to diminish my ability to fall and stay asleep that night do this early in the day before work out or before a bout of concentrated mental work again a tend to do this about four days per week certainly not every time i sit down to do work and i should also mention that i still tend to do the behavioral tools it'll tend to use five minutes of bi neral beats or bi nerd is throughout the work session sometimes do nice bath or cold shower before i do not want to give the impression that i combine every tool that have talked about to eh for a given work about and that would be pretty while to take a cold shower papa and altyracine take an alpha p c drink to express a listenable nor rest that to me seems a very inefficient way to go about life in fact i make it a point to try and use tools to increase my ability to concentrate in focus but not to combine more than two or three of them at any one time and when i say to or three what i mean as i will you supplements alpha p c eltiracine and canine together before certain work bouts i might use the visual practise a focusing on a given location for a minute before i begin that work bout am i combine those then another time i might take a colchower prior to doing some work other days i confess have slept very well or my enthusiasm about what i am about to work on is such that i do not require any of these tools again there is no requirement there is no pressure to use any of these tools behavioral supplement based or otherwise it is simply a matter of using the tools that are going to allow you to achieve the states you want to achieve in to a improve your ability to go into those states without any help at all and this is what i find particularly attractive about supplements it is not much that they put you into the ideal state for that work and then you accomplish that work and then you always rely on the supplements i prefer to look at supplements of the sort that i just described as a rout into a deeper trench of focus and concentration that i use as a tool to teach myself to focus and concentrate more deeply such that i do not need those tools every single time a trying focus and concentrate i think this is an important point because i think that many people think of supplements as a crutch or a way of simply getting into a state for which no other tool will suffice or replace but in that context i want to remind you of the larger contacts of pharmacology which is the vast landscape of prescription pharmacology for eighty i for attention definite hyper activity disorder now i covered that landscape in intense detail on the episode on eighty it and focus and just to summarize there is of course after all riddle giants modaphinel armodaphinal a number of different compounds all of which generally increase dooming transmission in the brains to increasing noblemen and all of which generally increase epinephrin a adrenalin transmission in the brain and body and many of those compounds have been of tremendous benefit to children and even some adults who suffer from mighty it properly prescribed at the appropriate dosage those compounds can really help people with clinically diagnose eighty hit the way they help those people is a bit surprising however you might think well they turn on the brain chemicals that allow those people to concentrate in focus that is true but they also have the benefit of teaching those brain circuits how to engage and that is one of the reasons why somewhat paradoxically giving a stimulant riddling or after all to a kid that legitimately needs it obviously do not want to do this without the oversight and careful the valuation of a psychiatric but giving that to a kid who has severe eighty h t you would think would make them remove rambunctious less able to focus and more intractable over all after all riddle modaphinel armodaph and all these things are stimulant you take a kit as attention definite hyper activity disorder and give them these drugs that increase transmission of dopamine and epineperoneed think outs can to make them even more intractable and hyperactive and indeed has the opposite effect it does not necessarily make them feel calm but it makes them feel that they can focus they really can anchor their attention and the ideas that its teaching those neural circuits or those normal circuits rather are teaching themselves to engage into focus and concentrate and the ideal situation is one in which the total dosage of those compounds those drugs can be reduced over time as those circuits learn to come on line through purely behavioral tools now oftentimes there is a maintenance of those drugs over long periods of time although there is a common practise now days of trying to diminish the dosage over all that is in the contacts of eighty hey and prescription medication and i acknowledge that a lot indeed eighty per cent or more of college students say the statistics are using prescription drugs when they are not in fact prescribe those prescription drugs basely what i am saying is there a lot of people using drugs design for eighty h d and narcolepsy because those drugs will effectively increase focus in concentration but i strongly discourage the use of powerful prescription drugs that have not been o prescribe you firsivalitsy legal second of all it is quite dangerous to hit the accelerator of those neural circuits with such vigor because it can increase dependency and they can have a number of otherwise effects outside the contacts of clinically diagnosed and prescribed d h d medication but in the contact of supplementation the increase in dopamine a see calling and epinephrin that one can achieve from say five hundred kilograms of altirasy and three hundred kilograms of alpha p c and a cup of coffee is going to be substantially less then one would see for prescription drugs you are getting a modest effect that can similarly teach those brain circuits for focus an concentration how to engage better but as a general patrol to all of this i always say and it'll say it again and again probably until the day i die which hopefully is long time from now but regardless twill be the same message i always believe that behavioral tools should come first behavioral tooshocom first then focus on nutrition in facts a behavioral and nutrition tools and of course get excellent sleep then focus on supplementation and then and only if those are failing to bring your brain and body to the state you need to be in to perform well in school in work in life et camera do i recommend that people lean on prescription drugs now there is a caviar to that which is in under conditions severe eating disorders obsess have compulsive disorder by pillar disorder depression where people are truly at risk of suicide or severe mental health of facts or behavioral half effects and there really at there lives are at risk and there over all mood and well being is at risk it is often the case that people cannot access the brain states required to shift themselves purely with behavioral tools nutrition et camera again for the typical person who is not suffering from one of the psychiatric disorders i mention before or other psychiatric disorders skis a running et camera i strongly encourage you to look to behavioral tools first nutrition then supplementation then and only if there is a remaining need to prescription drugs this contrasts very much with the typical scenario hereabout these days where college students or other people will say oh i here that there is this drug a riddle in or vive vacant can immediately put me into a state of heighten focus and concentration now listen if you have end it by all means talk to a physician talk to a great psychiatrist and figure out whether not that is right for you but if you do not again behavioral tools nutrition supplementation and in particular those behavioral tools are going to be the ones that are going to allow you to teach your neural circuits had a focus and concentrate better and i cannot overstate the importance of that that the behavioral tools and to some extent the supplementation combined with behavioral tools really allow you to train up your neural circuits that you can focus and concentrate to the depth and the degree and the duration that is going to best serve your mental an physical goals now there is one other compound that have used from time to time and that i continue to use in order to increase focus and concentration and i will use this in commination with the other supplements i talked about before and that is final ethelaming final ethelaming is in the opening synthesis pathway sot increases opening transmission intends to function a little bit differently than altirisine every once and while it'll swap out eltyrisine and put in five hundred milligrams of final atheling or sometimes if i really want to push a little harder on the opening system and ism going to be doing a long bout of intense work i will take the three hundred milligrams of alpha p c the five hundred milligrams of altaricine l generally take that with some canine and i should mention i do not go past about a hundred or two hundred milligrams of canine cause i do not really feeling to misery that is not really my goblets the goal to be alert but not alert that i you do not really camp focus on anything ism not interest in having an anxiety attack after all but it'll sometimes either swap in or i will add that five hundred milligrams of final atheling final atheling is in the p e a pathway of talked about this and previous podcast on opening motivation and drive and it say very short live compounds what it'll tend to do is take it once at the beginning of the work about and sometimes in the middle of the work bottle take another five hundred kilogram capsid but what i just described of combining all of those compounds alpha p c altiracine pinalathelamine and cabin that is a fairly rare currents that ill combine all four and really only under conditions in which i have to do in intensely challenging bout of mental or physical work i a say the frequency at which i combine all four of those things is probably about once every two weeks in typically more once a month again being careful to do that in the really part of the day certainly before the new hour that i am in no way going to disrupt my sleep i realize that many of you are probably wondering about or hoping that all discuss things lions mane or the recitals or some of the other compounds that are known to powerfully modulate the dopamine epinephrin in a seat offline systems to be quite direct there are far too many of these compounds to review in a single episode and they all generally tap into the same set of processes again epinephrin that shaft of the arrowhead that were thinking of his focus a septa coming which is the arrowhead itself and then dopamine which is the sort of propeller behind the arrow that allows it to continually drive forward through about of mental or physical work there is a wonderful side have mentioned it several sounds befoul on this podcast that is examined to cam that wonderful site that is examined to come has recently been updated they have changed their format it was terrific before it provided lynx to relevant studies it talked about specific compounds i talked about the magnitude of e fact to talked about the human effect made tricks are really focus on human studies with lynx to those studies and on and on the new revamped version of examined o calm is even better it is really next next level i really applaud them for doing such a terrific job an organizing the information their lot of interesting pages that you can read there about different compounds we could ut in any compound gincobeloba on phoshodital serine hem alpha p c and you are going to rich array of information about those compounds and if you were to put in a specific goal state that is focus or concentration or sleep or hormones testostrants that are you are going to get a richer of compounds supplements as well as lynx to the studies on those compounds and some details about those particular studies is absolutely phenomenal sight tits one that i rely on that i know thousands if not millions of other people rely on and i ensure you to check it out again the u are is examine dot come today we have talked about a number of different tools and to some expense mechanisms involved in concentration and focus and really the goal has been to provide you and understanding of the nurchemical systems and litmus about the nerd circuits that can allow you to achieve states of attention and focus in contrast to previous episodes to the women lab pot cast were have covered these topics in tremendous depth at it relates to mean ism and also focused on tools to day i largely focused on tools we talked about behavior tools a meditation that is thirteen minutes long done daily specifically to improve your ability of focus and in fact our data to support that it will talked about hypnosis we talked about visual focus overt and copper we talked about very supplements such as alpha p c fenalathlamin eltirisine supplements that i use to directly modulate the neral circus for concentration focus us not about creatine the omega threes talk about the importance of sleep which modulates our ability to function mentally and physically over all optimize that sleep and we talked about a number of other protocols that you can in corporate my hope in giving you all this information in one single location is that you will be able to pick and choose which of these protocols you would to incorporate into your attempts to improve your focus and concentration again i do not recommend doing all of these protocols all at once when i recommend is picking a handful of them may be one or two may re three or four and trying them in different comminations at different times of day and for different purposes for mental work for physical work et camera at find what is best for you once again the goal is to teach your brain that is to increase neroplasticity in the neral circuits that allow you not just a focus but to re focus your attention and it'd be remiss if i did not mention that it is also critical to be able to d focus i highly encourage people to take a period of time each day to day dream to walk down the hall without looking at your phone to not have to incorporate more sensory information to not place increasing demands on yourself to focus and see and realize how having a period of deliberate decompression and d focusing can allow your brain to focus much better when you do decide to return to about of focus concentrated work or physical work si won a thank you for joining me for this discussion about tools for focus and concentration if your learning from and or en

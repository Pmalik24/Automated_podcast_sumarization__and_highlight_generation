welcome to the hubermanlatponcas a science science space to e i ma endurhubermen and on a professor of neurobiology in ofthemology at stamford school of medicine today i have the pleasure of introducing doctor gunman french as my guest on the superman labpodcast doctor french is the vice president of performance at the u f c performance institute and he has over twenty years of experience working with the let professional and olympic athletes prior to joining the u f a french was the director of performance science at the university of motor day and he has many many quality pure reviewed studies to his name exploring for instance how the particular order of exercise whether not one performs insurance exercise prior to resistance training or vice verse how that impacts performance of various movements and endurance training protocols as well as the impact on hormone such as testosterone estrogen and some of the stress hormones such as quartizal he is also done fascinating work exploring how negro transmitters things dopamine and apinefran also called the trenolin can impact hormones and at hormones can impact hero transmitter release what is particularly unique about doctor trench's work is that he is figured out specific training protocols that can maximize for instance testosterone output or reduce stress hormone output in order to maximize the effects of training in the short term and in the long term today you are going to learn a lot of protocols whether not your into resistance training or endurance training you will learn for instance how to regulate the duration of your training and the type of training that you do in order to get the maximum benefit from that training overtime whether or not you are somebody who just exercises recreational for your health whether not your in amateur or professional athlete or whether not you are just trying to maximize your health through the use of endurance and or resistance training today's discussion will have a wealth of take always for you there are only a handful of people working at the intersection of elite performance mechanistic science and that can do in a way that leads to direct immediately applicable protocols that anybody can benefit from doctor french also provides some incredibly important insights about the direction that sport and exercise are taking in the world to day and their applications towards performance and health before we begin it'd to emphasis that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at let i greens is an all in one victim an mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve m delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there reason i started taking athletic greens an the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which or vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called dopmicrobiom and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstone cam slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of data ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient invitees in d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to today's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are soda magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar one talk many times before in this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have soda magnesium in potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparation of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc cam slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do cam slash superman and now my conversation with doctor gunman french gunman french great to see you again eagle shall since don't othenomany stand professes in the forms institutes really exacted of this places amazing and a you have a huge roll in making it what it is the reason ism excide to talk with you is that you you are one of these rare bits that you have been involved in human performance an athletic performance at the collegiate level a you are obviously very involved in mama now in the my performance institute and you also a had the fortunate experience i to think of doing a oh t in a what exactly was the p to is exercise physolitise it the art your familiar also with designing studies control groups all the sorts of thing that in my opinion any way or come lacking from the internet i social mediaversion of i exercise science which is that people throw out all sorts of ideas about how people should be training what they should be doing and eating an not eating and doing an certainly science doesn't have all the answers but i just think it rare to find somebody that is at the convergence of all those different fields and i have a lot of questions for you to day that i ism sure the audience ore canto be really interested in er well listen i men nigh i appreciate that is very humbling and an you have worked after get to where i am an but have always tried to be authentic and i think authenticity comes along side an academic rigor and an objectivity and ins and an a knowledge base right at the end of the day its about an having confidence having experts and been able to deliver that experts to to in my world to athletes an and i think a that is what have always tried to do have tried to of many strings to my bow an that i can talk with many different hats on a one down talking to a coach next am talking to an athlete the new i am talking to a see o the next time talking to a an academic professor the you not i think you o been able to where those different harts is certainly skill sat the have tried to an to build throughout my career and you i as have been bless to work with ha thing of thirty six different professional or limbic sports last time of to iccounsid an gets been been a while rides thin grant mut which of those sports was the most unusual an have wort with crown green bawling an wins a do not knows an america gid on o a a o to basically imagine a an a a twenty foot by twenty foot set square of tub an with a a small raise in the middle i eat the crown it is it did slopes to the edges am and then use you you throw out white jack a smaller ball and an ye you sort a to raw out larger bulls to to trying get closest to the jacket si it is a very a youropean thing that is theft yes bots performance to crown green bawl in ego am wow and then to i mix martial arts island everything in between i almost lines a can you give us sooner o your background your word you start out were from originally ya from the north east of inland an some from a time called harried which is in in yorker which is a northern kind of ever of nice funny aether all your on ye if you can imagine yet with the two weeks of summer that we get in am but ya men i did my year my only graduate studies there in sport seen si in i did teacher training to be a physical education teacher after the most people a then your work of h high school physical education teacher your are experience working with kids you a developing an athletic qualities but something in the back of my mind always yon i wanted more i wanted to be a in to be at the h air and of elect sporting i was a file wallet mike many people like i represent to my country an indifferent sports and things but i never made it professionally and that that little seed was stand in as much as i then stay to reach out to and yo to different areas to do a party whether was in the aka or also you chance my arm took u pony if we get over to the states in all my bodies were going on gap years after the finish university or whatever and and going to baby and hanging out o whatever travelling through land and i fig it well o have always loved the states and chanagone kill to birds y one stone and do something academic continue my studies and but also doing a different environment get some life life experience in them many many rejections as as an show you can of a we from different professors whether was raging or an over or in a willing car you vote to these fell i just cold cold golden and and sent out information anything yes o i have have you got any opportunities am push back from for but yon dogged and kept kept for is asking an m yea doctor willing came who was at baldpate university in indaba at the time and a a muscle your end of chronologist and and researcher in muscle physiology in resistance training and you basically saidliss and i can guarantee fond in for the first yeryou studies but not the next three something at typical acid em a i can take care of you but not that well necessarily i spoke to my parents since that i can we can we take upon and that they were great in supporting me and and eat long story short came out to a to big him a pity at costate after a year doctor came a transferred to upon you connetica since tore in the northeaster and a ma transferred to him an with him and am yet four great years with mat with mapechty and and get ma pity with the with a really prolific and research croup that looked a in on your end o chronology homing work and but using resistance train in primarily as an exercise stress ad as the mags mechanism and then looking all the different physiologist off the back of resistance training yer you as were enormously productive i found a dozens of papers on how went training impacts months and your names on all of em am and it is remarkable i i have a question about this o just inject or question about wait training in hormones you hear to us all the time that doing these big heavy compound movements or resistance training increases exigence things tastasteronthtda and forth does any one know how that actually happens what about move what about in what is it about engaging motor in or ants under heavy loads sends a signal to the indican system e release tastastron have never actually been able to find that in a taboo yer well mean and how can i do more offs much as i know i known again am digging in to the anal of donkey trenches can of brain now but a ye haw anything it is distress response rights mechanical stress and its metabolic straits and these he you anas downstream regulation of testosterone release at the gonads an comes from many different areas and you know that there my work primarily looked and yo caticolameans and and an sympathetic arousal then ow open afrit a draorects yean afrit adrenalin and you noradrenalin and how they were signaling that signal cascade using an the h praxis releasing and courtesan and than looking at how that also influence the admen on media to release and yo androgen and then signal in that the gonads there is an interesting question in u presumably wait training in women people who don't have tastes also it increases to thestrons end is that purely through the adrenals when women left waits there are arena glance release testas absolutely mean that is the only area of testosterone release for females and yes it is the same downstream cascade obviously the extent to which it happens is is significantly less an females but that is how thatches goods good date out there that shows youknow females can increase their anabolic environment there internalanablic milieu and using resistance training is stress and then they get the consequent muscle tissue growth and whether is tend an ligament adaptations that that the beneficial consequences of resistance training which is driven by anabolic stimuli ye have two questions about that the first one as something that you mention which is that the at the androgen that tastasteron comes from the adrenals under resistance lots in women is the same true in men i men we hear that the tastes produce tastasteron when we weight train e for for men that have tastes but am the do we know whether r not at the adrenals or the tastes and men that are increasing testosterone car more both obit from each the field is divided presently and inasmuch as understanding the ace aldrin tithe ace and acrogen adronegic response in terms of you no anabolic and response to exercise in an acute pase in the exposure to and stimulus that distress driven which might be partly from the adrenal glands partly from the gonads verses a longetunal exposure and to anabolic environments which is primarily driven by obviously the gonads in e release the mendicant environment from from tastostron release at the gonads this that the field is splinters of how exercise is promoting hypertrophy o muscle tissue growth and whether that is very much can adrenals and stimuli or if that significant enough in these acute responses verses the longetunal exposure just elevated based levels of a anabolic tattastostron habitual level sones i can musket with musings as pride both by the quatrain at an e gonads ye and then you mention that a tastastron can have a incensing of facts or growth of facts on tender an ligament also that you do not often hereabout that people always think you tastasteron muscle but testoceron has a lot of effects on other tissues that are important for performance it sounds an ye y we not absolutely in i thinking of the the the testosterone homo is e a may listen as androgen receptors on a nor tissue on norlaxon pretty much everywhere exactly it the the binding canasta testosterone and influence in different tissues within the body a tuchedon in a muscle tissue but the the the ligaments tetendens am even bone to to some extend in a testosterone is is potential to influence that a intends of removing onto pen canicharacteristics e camera and let's it is a it is a a magic magic homo let us a and with many a many and and in pants intends validation i differ when to get back to your trajectory but as long as we are on a the inner actions between androgen testosterone and its derivatives and different tissues you from the work that you did as a put student and on and throughout your career could you say that there is a there some general principles of training that favor testosterone production in terms of that the that somebody who is not in a lad the could use somebody who is already adapted to weight training somewhat they know bathe difference re kinin to due bell in a barbell an they know they know the various movements than i can a damage themselves but once the doing that i mean have heard shorter sessions are better than longer sessions but in rep loads wit not there is a lot of perimeter space but if you were going to throughout some of the om the parameters that you think are most important to pay attention to for the typical person who is trying to use weight training to build or maintain muscle ye lose body fats or body decomposition and or stay strong and healthy for sport o a different kind yes o the work that we a mean i was a exposed to bacimapias the and it was a double episode in as much as testosterone is really stimulated by an intensity fact and also volume fact now growth homo is limit different that is log driven by an intensity factor alone oh really i rest the growthromon was driven my volume but just goes to show you move no no no no i think your program which just got to showing that most of what is out there on the inner and is completely i not only not only is it wrong its usually backward no trust i iiliint no trust or nothnat because because i think people just make this stuff up right because it is very hard to measure grow thrown intostostrone and and ism cannot imagine most of the the stuffed i see out there they taking trips an and you know measuring free verses bound in all this conirstop but that's what you do and in laboratory know you look a total composition that of look how much to that is free to in the systemomuchis bound and that for biologically active bound to receptor train relaxation ad but at coming back to testosterone in ins of the training strategic it is log driven by most an intensity ana volume fact if you look to many of the exercise into mentions hat we use to try an investigate an interrogate testosterone and it was it was usually a six by ten protocol you touching a tout by ten meaning yet six sets of ten repetitions which is that is quite large and sit repetitions is quite large volume for a single exercise and that was usually picked about eighty per see in teaseler one repetition maxintensity o get eighty per cent of the one get ma six six sets of ten raps separated by rest of by two minute two meets which is actually pretty fast y at least to me it any don you titi the throw the three minutes when your achy watching the clerk it as too many respires go by pretty fast by the third fourth sat ye you din for to e and i thinkyou know we you k we formulated that kind of exercise photo call to really targe yo that the release of testosterone and trying drive up these anabolic environments to study the of the endearing and you consequences but a think that is that is that is the type of protocol is mut most advantageous for driving anabolic environment that was it for the work out yes we we would do that in a backscotso in a mufti join and you challenging exercise multimuscle mufti join eighty per cent loads of eye one repetition main than six by ten we did play round with you classic german volumntype ten by ten and can of protocols and but they were just unsustainable at that eighty percent the the key to what we also did was we always adjusted and the loads to make sure that it was ten repetitions that we sustained if the load was too too high and an the or participant auto a drop the weight on on the six repetition we would unload the bar make shore they completed the ten vicious bring me back to the point of its an intensity ana volume derivative that that is on o be most advantageous for testostronerally there's really interesting and one thing that you mention there is especially interesting to me which as you said when you go from six resets of ten repetitions to ten sets of ten repetitions you it is not as beneficial an mighty even be counter productive but to me the difference between six and ten sets as only four sets it does not even sound that much that of hints at the possibility that the thresholds for going from a work out that increases tustastrone to work out that diminishes tustastrone is a shy a pretty narrow origin ye and i think it comes back to that intense fact then what what we saw wit that ten by ten protocol really sees pretty significant drop offs in the load an and again we trying to stimulate with intensity with mechanical strain through intensity as well as metabolic strain through volume and i think that is that is the paradise that you got a look is that the mechanical load has to come from that the to the fatal weight on the bar and the volume and is is the metabolic stimulus how much e we driving law ta how much we driving you a glycagenolosist in i in terms of that type of energy sister for and yo executing a ten by ten protocol what we often a was just a significant reduction in the intensity capabilities of even the y to sustain that we shorten the volume and to trying maintain the intend it interesting and you could amain just taking very long rest keeping the session being a big lazy bearer in die training i sometimes do this i tolmyself hymen to work out for forty five minutes and then two hours later ism done but not because i was huffing in puffing the whole time but because i was training really slowly a there any evidence that training slowly can offset some of the negative effects of doing a lot of volume well it is the old add if to two responses to question i mean the first one i would say you now there is a difference between ten sets of six and six sets of ten and and i think that comes back to the volume conversation you know six sets of to is driving up metabolic stimulus and if if you do in ten sets of six you can probably take it to hirer intense to be not gan to get the same metallic load you knot get to get the same internal metabolic environment the drives the lactate release that they will lend signal you know further anabolic testoster an release because of the lactate in your body and that that that is a key consideration the rest is often the consideration that is overlooked and out there in general population in many sporting environments that the rest is is as important a program invariable as the load an the intend the intend to the loads hat the volume et camera and and yes if you remove if if you extend the volume if you extend the the duration of your rest periods what you are ultimately doing is influencing that metabolic stimulus again you are allowing the flushing of the body the removal of waste products lactates to be removed i from from the body and then the the metabolic environment is reduce do want if i vinershin correctly you want ta create a metabolic also the way that have been training slow and lazy is not necessarily the best way to go i could i could in theory do a forty five or sixty minutes session were i packing more more work per unite time ism not can be able to couldn't qua perform as well i will not be able lift us much after one wait the bar between says or have you've during season i have some one who could do that but it sounds that is the way to go is should be this you old adage of high intensity short duration is probably the way to go correct enlaymen's terms if the same objective the same training gold is just muscle tissue growth and were not talking about maximal string or any of those type of prints is who just talking about growing muscle if there is an apply a in the do six six sets of ten with two minutes rest an the ally be that does six sets of ten with three minutes at rest fully a will likely see the highest muscle gan muscled high perhaps gains because of the metabolic stimulus that the driving with the shot to restless interesting for all the years that have spent exploring exercise science and trying to get this information from the nonet in various places that this the first time it is ever been am told to me clearly easily i need to put my ego aside and i need to not fora much on getting as many raps with a given weight and keep the rest restricted two mine about two minutes yet get the work in and then it'll derive the retrofits i mean you have absolute filed it to bandstand again if you think about human nights you and how we approach were in recently lazy i as as as as humans we want to you know we want to say that rest one to take the the time out to recover feel refreshed bots we try to cry a training stimulus i trying cry a very specific stimulus internal to the body an not is often driven by the metabolic environment at that moment in time now if we allow the meticobolic environment to change by standing the rest periods we not going to see is as beneficial gas at the end of it very interested it it is at it is very much e mot to visional and ego thing and rather san of ism going to push my loads as high as a conoid really challenge maximal string to do few repetitions take long appeared to times ti completely different approach to training its a different and gull interesting you mention lactate it seems o still bit controversy sal as to what truly triggers hyperchephy you her about lack build up or people that the common languages the muscle gets torn and then repairs but i do not notice the muscle actually tear ism in mi cry gan microphone and inscription o e an o the mi within the muscle tick interesting and and we are talking now about non druggassisted people's whose it less to say i let us defend our terms here are that whose testosterone levels are within the the the range of somewhere between three hundred and fifteen hundred or whatever twelve hundred because it does seem that athletes who take his levels of exogonis androgen can do more work and just get preaching synthesis from just doing work have seen these guys in the him it the tut that he'll tell signs are not that hard to spot where they are just doing a a too volume not tosearly moving that much weight there just spring blood into the into the tissue and then there loading up on their eating a ton approaching presume because they are baby an puberty part fifteen right either on their fifteenth round of puberty where during puberty you are approaching synthesis machine am that is to me that that is a you pretty clear about puberty interesting and then am you in terms of a because i know the audience likes to try protocol t you describe to protocol very nicely what about data day recovery em and can the work out you described as intense but short how many days a week can the typical person do that and sustain progress my in a thing that comes about to training age in yo train history obviously there is a rasilians and a robustness with with an incremental training age an ow that is not apart to call at advise any one to go out and to to morrow the ben having them off the guraclor but at the same time insoles relative writes a mighty perpend in o we if y maximum at young trying an ages sdeligty person vas is and have been trying in ten years it is delight yo resend but yes the mechanical load is going to be significant you is just more tunnage rive and but yet i think a prodigal that would look at two two times you a week something that is tat pretty in tensive that because again it comes bats o the point you make is you really need to be for one a better term suffering a little it through that type of pro to call both in terms of are the challenge of the load but also been able to tolerate than ma the metabolic starts that your exposed to it did sir it is in our bit of a sick o feeling i because the lactate the u tripping up you a i won't promote as an athlete doing that type of modality you know multiple mufti times unless you were from the realms of body building and then you really that that is the sole purpose of of what y trying to achieve most athletes and in most sports have diverse requirements in turns outcomes at the trying to achieve they are not just targeting muscle growth and muscle growth is a a conquer to increase strain increase power ad increase speed obviously yes trying to get big a croissants and later of a muscle means that we can produce more force into the ground or or wherever it may be for a locomotive they but usually sports men and women are not just purely seeking muscle growth and they they they look for different facets of muscle and durance or must maximize muscle power and muscle strain us o then you got a be very creative in how you build the work out if it is a body builder absolutely the chase in muscle growth and they on a duce with these types of pro to cause which sees intensities in the high volumes of work load and on a pretty regular basis if it is just somebody an you a weaken warrior that wants to keep in shape and look and loo good i would say two times a week for a really challenge in work out that and then flecks the other types of work outs within the week to have more of a a volume emphasis where you reduce the intensity in you might just look er larger reck ranges from twelve to fiftieth twenty another work out way you looking a you a reduce in the volume but increase the intensity n really than a drive you k a different stimuli to give you more an points of a of success great other that really informative am along the lines of androgen end am intensity when i think intensity i think apenaferin a dragoon and a since you have a background in a catecolomians in tastasteron last time i was i hear at to course performance institute we had a brief conversation and i i want to may shrike at the details right that in the short term in a big increase in strasrormon can lead to an increase in testosterone a a parachute jump cram but that stars can promote the release of tustastrom yet that was news to me ram we always hear about stress suppressing tastasteron star suppressing the idiots as to all these terrible things but in the short term you are saying it can actually increase the release of tustasteron a i have that right crouse end then the second question is does my cognitive interpretation of the stressed make a difference in other words if i voluntarily jump out of a plane with a parachute does it have a different effect on my tustastron than if you shofar me out of the plane against my will what presume by with a parachute right to i mean this was what all my pitch t work was was looking at was the and that the a or and the the exposure to a stressed and the prearousal of how your body essentially prepares for that stressed and then how it manages it throughout the exposure to the stress and it was actually motivated from parachute jumpers to there was an older study and looking at parachute jump for into into into combat and and that they were study in the carters all a stress response and the epinefan response of these parachute jumpers we we got us thinking about hold on you the certain work out that you do that just the daunting it sit wait squat squats waterway or whatever may be it my gash this is going to be a is going to destroy me the are a to talk to this person i do not want talk to nowwhat right i mean tonlthing your piste dissertation exam or sing an you have been public speaking o whatever be now we we used an exercise we used the resistance training protocol that would that these athletes knew would was going to be very very challenging it is going to be that is going to have some anxiety to doing it the knew the we going to be some physical distress from doing it and and therefore you know them then mind set of how they were going to approchstat was already set all we saw prietfifteen minutes prietothe start of an ex exposure to to the workout that the epinefer in the nordranling the drawling was already saying to prepare the body him pathetically and to going to what it knew was going to be a very very challenging workout that brings you back to exercised preparation competition for certain preparation and preparation for certain competition excuse me and your are work out routines the use of music and all as different things that we know can now you anecdotally in the him we put into place but you the day to i presented to showed that it was the first of its kind to show that this link between and epinephrin and and nor up anear release an arousal and then consequent performance force output throughout the a throughout the work out was intimately what is it what's to take away there should is it a beneficial for people to get a little stress about the upcoming in pending event whether or not it is i lifting the him or whether not is talking to somebody that you might be intimidated to talk to or a a an exam what is it is the stress good for performance or is at harmful yen i think that is a great question and i think i can only talk to physical exertion which is what we were we were were exploring an in our do not want to trad on the to of the psychologists with flosstate in these types of things because clearly i think you are in the the position of scientific tone this one i think you have the average to i mean to en all our friends in that community is it'll just say as as a buffer to to your the answer your about to give that there is there is very little science around am flow an there's very little nor science relate to most psychological states anyway i think we have got a lot of degrees of freedom here breath aria it'll take o it'll be anything you credit gunman anything you dislike sensed them in commence to me i ye thing for from for my dates to certainly the the greater the arousal the high o the performance was from a from a physical exertion perspective and i thing that was the intriguing part of some of my findings with that definitely a boy an individual biocanetics to some of the and homo of kind of release is in as much as those guides that had the highest and you vagina responsintems of epinefran release nor apinefan release also sustained false outputs and through for a long of peed of the workout than those that did not that the the individuals at at a love and stimulus of of the sympathetic arouse let a and certainly did not perform as well throughout the work now the intriguing thing then becomes is oka and i think this this me really psyguising to what what we doing here that with with combaathlis with mixmachalatists that there is a philosophy there is a paradise now from a sold items of the exposure repeats exposing the the more you do that challenging workout do you get the same psychological stimulus dis ta get the same stress response and an and the sumption is unlikely you accommodate you become a custom to the strata you body will love or adapt and that is the classicovelo principal right and you then ne to take the stress down a different rout buts and i think when you look a that the the ashes that we we with here and it is it is a with fight at the end of the day that's is nothing more stressful than tot but a think just the exposure to the rig is of training to understand the bad positions the bad situations to know that they can get out of certain situations out of certain submission hands or whatever it may be i think that really ties in with some of my sex d working time of what these guides do to approach what is you really challenging sports refer in mixmachalats gets deploy the extreme of what is possible in terms of asking does stress favor or hinder performance am because at in you sat the end of the day it is some one trying to hurt you as much as they possibly can within the bounds of the rules and you are trying to do the same that is you i find tat your thesis work fastening were were you never to be it the a you have see performance institute luckily they made the right choice and brought you here am but were you never to come here i is still fascinating by this because over and over we here that stresses bad stresses bad stresses bad but everything i read from the scientific literature is that stress an epinephrin in particular it is coupled to the testosterone response to performance and to adapt ton provided it does not go on too long ism unless ism saying something that violates a i mean than that is your works at a really it's important and beautiful work and i i refer to it often ism just glad tat i ism the could bolt that down because i think the people mean to know this that that discomfort is beneficial now there is a there is another side to this ism that i want to ask about which is ism the use of cold ism i particular things ideas called showers or i any other type of a cold temperature exposure in theory that stress also it is apineffering and ism how should one think about the use of cold for recovery if it stress how is if stress if colds cause stress then how is cold used for recovery that is what i do not understand in maybe just one of chariot thoughts on that yet no and i think this it is a great question and i think the the curio still out there certainly and knowing some of the conversations that we we have been have but i think you know when woe to out stress it is you classic fit flight or frees a preach and and you've throwing your body into a a cold to a ice bath or whatever it may be and certainly is going to have a physiological stress response now people use in that for different and an guys and again i think that is where the narrative has to be explained an if you are use in the stress specifically to manage the mind sets and to use it as a specific stress stimulus that is the same as me down sixty ten eighty percent you you just trying to find something to disrupt the system to do something that is very and if one a better to painful discomfort whatever and you just finding a stressed and then been able to manage the mind set but if you using cold and specifically from a physiological perspective to promote and redistribution o vascularity of blood's food yo t to different vascularareas of a muscle that that you feel have gone through work out that at damage tor whatever t may be i think there is we have got to understand what that stress mechanism is and and the the date of the literature is certainly still out there with respect to criotheropean cold baths and some of these and your high the discord exposures items of what they do at at the level of the muscle tissue if that is if that is the eager if you tried to promote a flushing mechanism or you trying to promote redistribution of of the blood flow what you have got understand is that cold is going to clamp down every par of the vascular system and and we have really got to understand how the muscle would be redistributed and two areas of interest you i think the stress response is is is is a real thing with respect to yo cold exposure an but i think the narrative round what are you using the cold for has to precede the conversation because yes it is it it is put your hand over a a hot coals you o that that distress the same way as jumping in the coal bath is and i think must people do not realize that you gin to get the upon afrit release from holding your hand up to clostolu lam you can get up from getting in the ice bat you body does not know the difference a you body does not know the difference it is a prone a a a primordial kind of physiological response that it is crated over millions of millions of years and i think that that is a that physiology is is not changing and it is it is fixed in a particular way right now and that that it does not understand the difference between whether it is six by ten down a challenge in work out of year whether it is put my hands on the hot coal whether a lance stood in front to me o whatever that epitaph in response from the the level of the brain down to the the whole signalling cascade is is the same in cold have heard can actually prevent some of the beneficial effects of training that it can actually get an getting the way of muscle growth et camera ye this us was some pretty robusdates about there now showing that it id definitely has an influence on performance variables strath and power in particular and but absolutely intends of muscle hypertrophy and there is a big kind of theme in in the world of athletic performance right now insteps of pluralization of cold exposure as as a recovery madallitintial what when use cold should yo be using cold for recovery in periods of high training load when your actually pursuing in it mig be general propratric preparatory work we nasty trying to pursue muscle growth well that is usually way you get the most for it is usually were you feel the most fatigue but it is probably not the most beneficial approach to use an ice bath in that in that scenario because you dampening you dulling the end of the actor pathway and and the the hyper hypertrophic and signaling pathway whereas in a competition pase where actually quality of exercise and quality of execution of skill and technical work has to be maintained you want to throw the kitchen sink of recovery a capabilities in recover into mentions in that scenario because you now yo that the muscle building activity should be in the bank that should have been done in that in the general report poparatry work an and now you pocosin on technical execution you are absolutely right tut interesting fight f in shim correctly a if if i want to maximize muscle growth or power it were improvements an adaptations then the inflammation response tho the lade on set muscle for in us all the stuff that is uncomfortable and that we hear is terrible as actually the stimulus for adaptation and using cold in that situation might short circuit my progress but if ism i do not know it all ever do that s but if i were to to an iron man or something or run a marathon under those conditions ism easily coming to the to the a s to speak with all the power and straight i am going to have and they are a reducing inflammation is good because it is can allow me to perform more work assentionally absolutely yet you have to be strategic about when you've some of these interventions and the the time when you preparing for a competition is not the appropriate time a excuse me it is the appropriate time when you want to drive recovery and make sure that your body is optimized and when you are far away from a a a competition you date or outs of season and whatever it may be and you are really tranagist tear up the body a little bit to allow it to it is natural and you know healing and adaptation process is to take place we you do not want to negate that you know that you want the body to ought to minds its internal recovery and that is how muscle growth is gan a happens interesting that there is a time can of consideration that you in to make with these interventions for for at the your see performance anger of the or the rider is periodizing the recalled exposure where they just you doing sort called at at at will well it is not just you eve see and again i talk about my personal experiences with different sports i think just education around we science and or under standing of a concepts the use of cold exposure for recovery ice bath t everyone wants to jumping an ice bathtub think as we have as we have step back and scientists of start to say a a stay to figure out and look at some of the dater were now more intuitive about well actually that might not be the best or the most optimal approach and i think that is that any given sport yes certainly hear the you have see were trying to educate our athletes around appropriate timing and it is the same with nutrition is the same with an ice bath intervention is the same with lifting weight is the same with going for a run or working out on the back the that there is the tactics to when when you do things h when you do not do things and i think stress and and cold exposure and we have to have a consideration round that as well but it is not just you know ma may files that is any any italy and i think it is that the best the best professionals the most successful professionals do that really well they under they listen one they the educate themselves and then they build structure and i think you know the the most o let level we always talk about it here the you have see but the most only level you not necessary training harder than anybody else everybody in the you a see trains hart every one is training superhero but the best athletes that the true a let levels are the ones that can do it again and again and again on a daily basis and sustain a technical out put for skill development therefore their skills can improve or physical development that physical attributes can improve that ability to reproduce on a day to day basis falls in to a recovery conversation now when is the right time to use some to make nice bathing when is an is part of the the high performance conconversation for sour s really the scientists the rebuilding structure a they figuring out variables ye but it sounds the ability to do more quality work over time is is one of the keeper ism in its fundamental i mean goblin garbage out quality in quality out but in our sport in a i talk about in a mine bachelors it is truly a decathlon of combat there is many different attributes whether a grappling whether a resting whether it is the transition were whether is to stand up striking the the different facets of a training program in this sport ah significantly large compared to something and a wide receive in football that is no disrespect for why receivers but they run routs they they the going to run o rat o a a passentry and that is all the need to do these guides have to be on the ground the god be ground the groundage got to be great standing up the got to be great with the fit the back against the fence the there many different canofacets to our sport managing the distribution of all the training components is one of the biggest challenges a mine bachelors and the best guises get that rights they they allow their body to to optimism the training and remember why why are we doing train and we doing training for tat technical and tactical improvement now if you if you body is fatigued or you just come expose yourself to for tactical development or technical development then essentially doing self a his service you on to be behind the curve with with respect to those guys that can reproduce that day and day out on the topic of a skill development regardless of sport a we hear all the time and it certainly is o fugitive to me that the person who can focus the best well progress the fastest butts come of interesting something as i talk to at least in am they seem a a little bit laid back about their training sometime it is and yet they obviously know how to flip the switch an they can really routine in the intensity do you think that there are option proper calls for skill learning in terms of physical skill learning but could it ever be parametrize the six sets of ten raps an this gets to the heart of narrow plasticity which is still it is not a black box but it is kind of a a black box with portions of it illuminated i to to say but know what your thoughts on skill development is there for somebody that wants to get better at sport a do you recommend a particularly long or short training session it does intensity matter was it just raps ye think it now it is it is not a volume driven exercise it is a quality driven exercise and list and ma my expatigeis not in mot to learning and mot to skills question and i attend to default to gabion to aerial wolf her you a vifefit and for that she is one of the leading proponents in this area buts if if you look out and of true skill development it is about rehearsal of accurate movement accurate movement mechanics and and the soon as soon as that becomes imp acted by fatigue or inaccurate movement you now losing the the the motor learning you losing the accuracy of the skill that yo people can call it muscle memory o whatever the want right but essentially growing neural axons to to crazy movement patent and the situational throughout sport right whether it is a croifturnin soccer or a jump shotten basket ball or a forehand down the line you can carve out that reticular posture in position and skill and you can isolates it and you can drill it again and again again is soon as fatigue is is influencing that repetition it is time the time to stop and the best coach is understand that they understand that it is quality of a quantity when it comes to skin acquisition to answer yo question in around about way it's say yes it it is it is it is short sessions that a very high quality and i think the best athletes in my experience to the one's it consciously and cognitively ire aware of it every moment of the training session they should they should leave the training session not necessarily just physically fatigue but mentally fatigue because their completely engaged in the learning process the the problem then becomes o ka if we just do lots of you know thirty minute sessions we got to do a lot of thirty minute sessions to get the volume exposure of the repetition and the rehearsal of the skill again and again and again the bit of a paradox it is a bit et of a double eye sort but at a three hour session versus a ninety minute session ow wilt we will take the ninety minute session any day when it comes to skill acquisition because that is on to be driven by quality of a quantity training and skill learning is incredibly mentally fatiguing have often wondered why when one works out hard when that is with your on or with the weights why it is hard to think later in the day yet if really there really does seem to be something to it and have wondered is it depletion of a adrenalin dope mean i sometimes think it is might be dope me and here ism totally speculating i have any dados support this but if you hid a really hard work out or run early in the day oftentimes the brain just does not want to do hard mental work which gives me great admiration for these athletes that are drilling their mind in body all all day every day with breaks but what r your thoughts what what it what leads to the mental fatigue after physical performance well again i do not wont a talk out in om talking that to the man hern o this wet were we are just two side i speculating on on this point up until now we have been a you have been giving us concrete am a pure of feud study base feed back on the my questions but but if were to speculator i think this is a common occurrence people thing if i get that really good work out in in the morning i feel better all day perhaps true unless that work out is is really intense or really long and then you just the mind just somehow will not watch on to mental work quite quite as well i main just philosophically and i think this h this is a coming back to this connostress consideration you i a a public speaking to taking a exam me mean if you are if if if you have an amazing coach you as setting o training in a particular why it is challenging it there is the strain relates it to it ism not toking physical strip ism toking figuring things out on o figuring you the skill and i think that can be stressful the learning process can be stressful a you now were much om stress i also think if they if they if if the hit the right technique that reward center in the brain that dope mean shot is is going a fly up there and there is only many times that we can get that before that becomes damp and and i think there is an energetic piece to it you know there is the fueling of of the brain there is the the is the the the carbohydrate fueling exercise the actually the strategy round how you fuel full learning and fuel for physical training it is actually pretty similar let yet it is it is plucks it sugar at the end of the day right and ye a you are you fueling accordingly around you training sessions be that very physical cause everyone thinks ki you knife going to jump on the treatment ism going a bang out fifteen sprints the maxed and ism going a be be dropping off and lying on the floor at the end of it any to refuel wet what about the refueling of the brain in a very demanding a exercise or drilling session why you looking a technique that i than o figure out this very challenging for your mind to figure out it the complexity of it ut still needs to be fueled or refueled afterwards and i think that is fifty might be in grey the athletes do themselves a diesis i not appropriate fueling from what might be consider to be a lower in tensity session but the that they the cognitive challenge has been significantly high they are doing skill work or dream work and it is taxing the brain ever everything in oh i was not pushing hard left for ore doing sprints and i can just go off the rest my day but then they're they're their mind is drifting ye come i speculate yethats a things very reasonable i mean i know that ism here end presume wit the other athletes you have worked with a nutrition is a huge am aspect of that and i think the general public can learn a lot from athletic nutrition because it at the end of the day the general public is trying to attend to their kids attend to their work whether their lawyers or whatever am they need to focus a nutrition is a barbed wire topic oh ye who i if i since we are free to i do what we would do if were just sitting in each others offices which is to just a speculate a bit it for the typical person i do you think these am low carbohydrate diets a typical person who exercises run swims you miss waits maybe not all those things but some collection of those is pushes themselves to do those things and to do them well but is not westerly highly competed they do you think that a nutrition that does not inch udo lot of glucose does not include a lot of carbohydrates an is a problem or is it o k and what yo what ye recommend for athletes what he recommend for topical people yea cain disclaim ism not a dietician and but i i dot get the dieticians do not know what to remain not either and i say that from having spend a lot of time with the literature now it is a complete dramas it is i thought we did not understandanything about the brain the neutrician science stop is all over the place right i think we have again i go larger easy freezer or i mean i thinking o i think it is it comes down to metabolic efficiency and we would never we would never avocet a h i never say never a but we rarely advocate a high performance the in a in a intense the intirmatan port mama and being told a qeytogenic or e do not recommend no because it then o the day some of those high intensity fits and usually require o carbohydrate fueling and for the am and the energy and the energies produced tat those high intensities we try to navigate run not now the listen the our fights in the you have see and and elsewhere mat brown is a great example and who o promotes the erogenic approach and it works for him but we we look at the science and the not to the characteristics of spartan we do not nelly promote that can i interrupt you rook with what about ketones for people that are ingest in carbohydrates this is an interesting are because people always here ketones and they think will have to be qeytogenic to benefit from taking ketones there a number of athletes and am recreational athletes now as well taking liquid or powder based ketones on even though they do in eat rice an o meal and bread and other things as are there any unknown benefits of ketones even if one is not in a state of mitosis the the the and the the only the the use of ketones am primary where of is is and in our sport is after the event near in tens of the brainhealth with with the said taking a potentially taking aroma to the brain et camera and looking to maintain t at that the fueling and the energy supply to the brain but yes it is probably about my remit i i do not want talk on that because ism not not fully familiar with that what for the ketones am after head injury can provide a buffering commits not in a reverse brain damage but it might be able to offset some of the microwave right that that is what that is how we use it just to sustain and near the energy supply to the brain that might be compromise through brain aroma and that is why we use qqeitones and to come bout the original question if it is in a general population then yes i think that there is a place to argue the actually been on a qeitogenic diet times and may be that to cycle etsocises may be not i do not mean cycling o becoming cycling and mitosis and is beneficial because i think it is going a lead to betomatobolic man angered and an and metabolic efficiency at those lower intensities where we should be fueling our our metabolism with lipids and fats and clearly the the western get and and on o the money diets is heavily driven by process food and carbohydrates the people become predisposed to utilization of that fuel sauce and above lipid use fat use and intensities theatre very low some oboe ditto with the fits shows a as well and but to think the challenge focuses that were working with a clean tell the require intensity bouts of effort and you know fueling appropriately and it is very important for that now we use we use tactics here where we essentially have athletes on what you would say canada is it a labia keytogenic diets but then we will fuel carbohydrates a round training sessions we will do very timed exposure to carbohydrates it is n host training post training immediately are during and then immediately post and then the rest of their diets on of breakfast luncheon dinner a what would look keetogenic type approaches we trying to be very tactical in exposures to maximize the intensity for the training and and then return to a metabolically efficient diets which is heavily reduced in carbohydrate because we fueled the the the sessions it needed ism smiling because a once again the this place that your we perform in center is doing thing scientifically which to me the idea and an u please to hear that because to me that idea that the keetogenicdiet is the best and only diet or carbohydrates and a low protingdites or the best it its just it is ludicrous then you mention metabolic efficiency think am some people might be familiar with that term some perhaps am not but the way understand metabolic a efficiency is that you you teach the body to use fats by maybe doing long long bouts of cord may be lowering carbohydrates a bit teaching the body to tap into its fat stores for certain periods of training and then you also teach the body to utilized carbohydrates by supplying carbohydrates immediately after training him before training you teach the body to use ketones and then you use them at the appropriate time as appose to just deciding that one of these fuel sources is good and all the others or bad or dispensable do i have that correct you've nil o simmer from a a bobs a is b formerly of say triathlon and is is the a that cantacame up with the the concept of metabolic efficiency but yes your absolutely rites o mean a low intensities of exercise or just day to day living we should not be tapping in to our and cabahydrte fuel sauce is extensively that that is that is for her intensity work or the whites of fly needs of stress and if you no athletes or any individual has a hi cab hydrate diet the gangsta to become predisposed to utilizing that fuel sauce preferentially now a low intensity that can be problematic certainly for anatomy because if they preferentially use cabahydra a lower intensities when they when they exercise the man goes to a higher intensity they have already exhausted the fuel stars an o the cant draw upon fat because the oxidation of that that fates just too slow they're essentially now become fatigued and because of devote utilize the carbohydrate stars what we try to do yes through diet manipulation and a little bit of exercise manipulation is as ye say teach the body o train the body to preferentially use a specific fuel was fat of tiny a lower intensities in cbahydra a high intensities and look at specifically the cross of a point between the too tells a lo intend of howanathly is is ultimately an how the metabolism is working be again i smiling because i love this because it is grounded in something real and scientific which is that we have these different fuel sources the body can adapt us any number of them are one of them and thing most people are looking for that one pattern of eating that one pattern of exercising that can o be best for them or sustain them and they often look back to the time when they felt much better switching from one thing to the next but the adaptation process itself is also key right teaching the body and i i soil we were to ism just riff on this tirtelobit further if if somebody it'll use myself as examples and a a can only am speculate what other peoples a current nutrition proton calls a but if somebody is eating in a particular way and they want to try this kind of periodization of nutrition i could one say o we o for a few weeks immune to do more high intensity interval training and wait training an ism an needle bit more carbohydrate cause ism to pleading more glucagon then if i switch to i face of my training where i doing some longeron maybe ism not maybe ism training less maybe ism just working at my desk lo bit more then i might switch to a low lower carbohydrate do do not have that right and then if ism going enter a competition of some sort certainly not you have see er m i a of any kind to be clear a not because it is not a wonderful sport be because it is that would not be good for my other profession but i if i were going to do that then i would think about stacking carbohydrates ketones and in facts as that don't have that ism anything thing ye you just said it eloquently at the end of the day you consciously understanding what the and the exposure to to physical exertion is and yeuflectsing you diet accordingly i this it is the need based eating exactly and i one of editors an e call it whatever fancy terminology there is out there but yes it is it is needs baste eating and but your very conscious and cognesan of what is my current exercise status tam and if ism taking some time off then on do not gone on the cabahydrahts we probably need to be cut it is on to be lower intensity work or even just habit pal dit to day walking round u negroseries that that does not require massive amounts of glycogen storage an an an ancabahydrate refueling and you can pretense to go for keetogenicin nite and you now oxidized lipids for that fuel and if you are in a high period of of his intensity training then you've to consciously fleets you diet to support that that is not normal eve you have made a a change of elevated the demands the fueling requirements for the regent not only fueling the exercise wit the regenitary o requirements of you body after that type of work is gun to be really i port as well yes tycoon mocabahydrates i think it is consciously interpreting the nigthof e die against what thewy you are any moment in time that you ow that think ism the listeners of my past generally are experimenters y are scientists of themselves geum which makes me happy obviously and and and i to think that the pain attention to the changes their making and how they are effecting themselves and they seem more open to ism trying things port they can do it safely in u and and seen what works for them and ism certainly in a try some of the change shop i also really a creature of habit and i think the a talking you to day i realize on probably doing a number of things truly wrong in my training but also that i do not tend to very a my nutrition with my training quite as much as i should ism just locked into a protocol we are we cover a number of things related to your phthisis work and then but i cut you offer on related to your a trajectory after you finish your thesis you i know you were a notrdame for while was that your first spot after after yourpchithisno no i yam basically finish majesty and i drops into the brutish alembic system for about fourteen ones i as i was with them in have done three full o lymph cycles and with different sports in lag strength and conditioning coach and as a practitioner i was always working in in universities and academia alongside you knowintems of continuing to publish in right and and do section teach as well that next pains the or us volume of public i do not think people realize of the work that goes into getting equality pure reviewed publication it is not of what what they call now on interim anicadata where people do something what rehavetis experience and then they put in the world that the anecdota are i only know that we gets recall it data but also fourteen years in the working with the britishall impacting yes with them whether it was go box in primary with with the the risk at accuse me the the banging cycle but also light what road and gymnastics and for the onion olympic games that cycle i was with i was the the leads from the condition in a physical performs coach for brutish basket ball robe basket ball and i had about three years and in the english primelegu and with with nutcase nitid an avocation and and for the red will pixy colors with great been tychondon o gan at another combat sport and after it'd finished there i can have moved to universe in notradame and where i went into more of a more of a managerial position working across all the different technical services medical nutrition strand the conditioning in a put psychology and whatever sport science whatever it may be and as the n the an director of perform sciences at for notrada athletics and then after about sixteen months the the you have see came knocking an and they recruited me have notradam a it is been a been a great right and lots of funavego lot lots of athletes have taught me a lot along the whalers to coaches every day as the school day i i still trying keep that at mentality in in this world we call it white ben white belt mentality it a not a'mapigety have got twenty five years of experience in in high performance sport but an i still i still learn every single day from these people out on the mats and in the ring and its impressive to see what they do yet certainly as i it'd got introduced the ma mars a few years ago i think that for summer came out here was one of the forties i ad heard of mama came is gave in my laboratory and you knows down a and it is a really interesting sport because in corporate many different types of movement as yours yours not stand a barking its ad just kicking as ever you ground game everything and ism still learning about it am but it as you mention going in with that beginners mind the what white cement a white beltomentality am what w what as been the most surprising thing for you in terms of being exposed to make in particular as pop to other sports i what what is unique about ma ma figures besides that they have this huge variety of a a tactical skills that they have to learning perfect yet that is a great question i would say two thing can answer two questions one actually iterates what you have already said the degrees of freedom in mix marshall as or exponential no other sport ye were got eleven different white classes we have man's classes have woman's classes we have and kick boxes wrestlers suits of fights jokes carats fighters the stylistic backgrounds a infinite and we have were write classification sport there is a whole is you relation to making were and then rebounding to to fight about twenty fourth thirty out just the versatility in this sport the the the considerations that you have to make or unprecedented compared to any of the sport lav wort wit and and a lot of them go against and the are the antithesis of what you would expect for high performance in terms of we we do not always have a very clearly defined competition schedule you now once these guys fight that they do not necessarily know and then next fights cone to be what is the closes spacing of of a fight i mean miss an think tattle record is around tan it is just over a on i believe youngest an that that is a quick turn round but most of these guides a fighting three or four times a year three times a year is is pretty normal and that the the bigger fights may be two times a year but invariably the guides do not know when that next date is going to be r in this gray area of ora what what what do we do i to we we taking some time off for we just can o do some general pet work or we going to trying keep this the you the life sharpen in case i get i didn't realize us in that way it is a lot special operations absolutely you do not know when the cop and right they have to be ready at all times there is not this let us get ready for it see r yet when when i was with the bitch olympic association i knew is the the brutish open the punish open the french open the utopian championships the really open the america open the canada open the olympic games i ya work it in your rain rimy on you dis plans where all the targets a on to be ye it is a moving target because you might be just tingling you doing some general pet work and then you might get a short notice fight they give you quick corn since six weeks or five weeks and o car have got a ramp everything up really quickly that is a real challenge in terns of just managing all these this these different components oft mix martial arts and alone the whether to combat you question the other thing which is truly fascinating about these individuals is there just the mental raziliants and again it we we have touched on it in the talk but the ability to do what they do on a daily basis to and look at all the different skinless that they have to try and engaging and and and bring in to their training to do that and and and embrace the grind and brace the process of just learning and the physical side of our sport is unprecedented and but the mental sides you we have funny any we er say it to ninety percent medical at ninety present mental apart from the sixty percent as physical it is just it is just more and more and more and these these guides ability to and to just do that on a daily basis is is is is very impressive the brazilin the they are internal drive in their razilians is is is really impressive to see all the firers a me here been really terrific its u interesting am every time i meet a fighter how often i a i should not be surprising whether often berry soft spoken or is extremely p e en fighting is such a it comes from a very primitive portion of the brain rights a but a large portion of the brain you know not a thing that is another skill is that is which and again that is the recoverability piece right like you cannot be ti pay or you cannot be supercharged twenty four hours a day because you going o just fryer system in i think that is something else where wed really try o manage this whole process be it through altricial interventions bet through education round sleep best through and training pro program management and bet through psychological interventions you could look at fights and say these dudes are go the reviler and they the run through a brick war but actually again and there ability to turn it on an off means that they can do what they do they can bring it down and an be very normal very plight very in a accommodates and maybe even better then most people because one o the reasons ism obsess with with human performance and high performance and at people fighters an ex let military or or even body builders for that matters that they they experiment they find the outer limits of what is possible but one of the things that they have discovered is hour describing as disability to toggle between high alert states and calm states most typical people cannot do this they see something that sets them on the inner net or something on the news or some external event pressures down on them and their stress for many many days and weeks and sometimes it goes pathological right an and this i do not say this as a criticism it is just that most most human beings within our species most members of our species never learn to to either flip the switch onto just voluntarily toggle between states i think athletes learn how to do that extremely well and don it some em me may fighters do that even better than perhaps many other athletes and yet ti is the out one of to that struggle with but a think in time of that chronic exposed we we see and that codein from challenges around no cyclical white closing and metabolic description an metabolic injury not necessary from the psychological drive and they they do they do understand that this is a job for them an and the time on the man most of them can can turn off a little bet and and down great things when they are off the mouth bandits it is impressive to see because again as as lame just looking and the fight gam you think in night's gun to be crazy calcic a hundred miles an hour every hour of every day but an that is not let us clearly to the case they they they can manage their energy in their effects pretty well is a love bit science although maybe scientistic take a lesson force evident i practice practice a tat i a a couple more questions i i cannot help myself i know we talk about temperature early or and we discuss cold but i i cannot hep myself i have to ask you about heat because earlier we were having a a conversation about heat adaptation about how long does it take for a the human body ore athlete or typical person that may be exploring san our things that sort to learn to be a better sweater sounds something no none of us would want to do we all want to a cool common collected but one of the reasons to deliberate expose oneself to heat is for things growth homo release et camera we talk about this but am couple questions one is heat exposure stress in the same way that the ice bath or cold exposure stress second one is is there any difference there that is important and the other one is how does one get better at heat adaptation or at least what are you doing with the fighters to get them better at dealing with heat how long as that takes the first question just a cause i throw three questions a you is a was is heat stress cold distress ye think it is and i think he shot proteins for example a driven by that stressful exposure to a changing environment and think it is it we do grated responsion of heat acclamation strategies and but yes we were touch on earlier in the conversation for me heat is still a stressed and and if it is managed in correctly you can have detrimental responses rather beneficial responses warring hyprethermean at coming these heat up the brain too much people will yes measures and i but on you loosen our aunts but ow what is the right way to acclaimed heat taking in to account that people sous to check with their doctor et camera we do all these just claimers but you but let us ay i let should say i want to get better at dealing with heat or i want extract more benefit from heat is i mean how many minutes to day or people typically exposing themselves to heat how often in over what periods of time yes we we we know n the start wit about fifteen minutes of exposure now if some one's really lacking acclamation to heat you can do that in three five minute efforts get men and catchy is a his hots nor ye hot son take time to step o hundred degrees or something corners ye y ye two hundred fir and it yes and we we we try to work up to thirty to forty minutes to forty five minutes in the corner continuous now we we have to understand what what is the advantage of he acclamation for our athletes ultimately their ability to sweat and to lose you body fluids is going to be advantageous to their wait cut process to their ability to make wit it is a technique that these gat some of these guide adopt if you do not have high sweat rates it means you would on have to sit in the corner for longer and longer and longer to get the same deter in sweat rules and the more acclimated you are the more you body its the magma gently adapted the more sweatbands you have and the more pause you can sweat more and therefore you will lose that fluid quicker and he spend less time in the corner that is why we do it and to trying promo the the limp to limit the exposure and he comes bat t you first question is it stressed it is it absolutely to stressed if you have got a spend two hours in over you over fore our period two hours of it sat in adorner ye is yo were the honk dozen work you can now i sous now you out to worse than from the recon and that is a stressed in itself right join yes o think there is the say you know what we do is we anything we build up in temperature with but we build up in en volume of exposure we start with fifteen minutes and then we justritto ad on a had on a cross e time and now now for us we can a found about fourteen and corner exposures starts to really then drive that stations that were looking for it is not quick fix a he acclamation strategy has to happen long before right week along before the fights this is a is a process to has to begin in a eight or ten weeks before the fight that we cannot sty get the adaptation an the tolerance to the strata to the exposure of heat is interesting i until to day when we tare about this earlier and again now i did not realize that i but it makes perfect sense now that i hear it that heat adaptation is possible that your baby can train the body to become better at cooling itself which you you t what sweating is i a i should have known that before but you do not see that in the textbooks and a i in listen it is it is it is the same as the keatogentic conversation and ye you train in your body to be me bytametabolic efficient you train in your body to tolerate heat to you training you but the body is e in a as an organism is an organic system it is it is hugely adaptable it is hugely plastic but a think the skill is understanding the wens the wise in the ware of in terms of changing the overrode changing the stimulus to drive specific adaptation and philosophically that is that is how we go about our work here we talk about adaptation led programming now adaptation led programming fits into every single category not just lifting whites or running track it fits into nutrition it fits into sitting in the sooner it fits into been in a combat or not it fits into many different things because were driven by scientific insights and and that is how we really want to go out to our business a lever a lathis concept of adaptation led programming and doing that notches in the contacts of you not throwing another plate on the bar or something that but in every aspect of of one's training and in performance and i think there is a lot here that is applicable to the recreational ash let too ye would you say that you what comes to mind is twelve weeks it feels twelve weeks as a nice block of time for some one to try something in terms of to try something new see how they adapt adapt and then may be switch to something new i realize that it is very hard to throw a kind of pin i time train around something but in terms of if some one wanted to experiment with heat adaptation or experiment with call adaptation or change up their training regiment or or diet and a look at metabolic efficiency do you think ism twelve weeks as a good period of time to really give something o thorough go and get and unmet gain an understanding of how well or how poorly something works for oneself or would you say it is enough for three i in it's that is the how long is a piece of train and of o nonsuit man yes if if we would just token albite recreational explain baby three months exposure twelve week training a strategy try at twelve we intervention is is more than adequate to say it for ninety nine percent of things that change within the body that physiologically adapt to a training stimulus or nolo stimulus you on a stop to see the regression all progression and in a beneficial or detrimental effects within three months absolutely i unsihself now listen to i say that in as much is we do training blocks here that three weeks at ray no what is it that is because of this constraint that sometimes people suddenly have to they get the call to fight correct yes its supercondensed and in that in that sonar were always conscious of is a body is their body or and this individual do they have the ability to tolerate that superoverlowd that supercondensed exposure now we might be doing that purposefully we might be trying to do an overreaching strategy where we really tannin damage or fleet something and i do not mean negatively damage but lie we than a damage tissue to really get in adaptive response verses more drawn out twelve weeks strategy which is more there and more planned out more structured in nature but and yet for all you listeners i would say if twelve weeks to engage in in a process of of trying to change and adaptobody or expose yourself to something is more than sufficient to see if its can o be and the right approach for you and i think that that the the he the individual interpretation is always has to be considered and i think that is where it comes bat to to be a thinking man's they or be a thinking man's trainer like some under going to exercise dot you have to counts consciously understand when your bodies at any moment in time you got to be real with yourself you can to car a journal prologue of be training prologue of y feelings is subjective feed back of and how you fell you mood is early to that yet we wee we try to promote that because again that is that part of this this process and may be twelve weeks for you but i might get the same responses an eight eight weeks and i think that is that is sir that is i another critical theme here is the we could put fifteen guise on the mat and give them the same work out and there is going to be fifteen different responses to that same work out because the human organism is complex and in nature the it is can adapt differently some people will tolerate it some people can to be challenged by it some people have got a metabolic make up that is can a promotes it some people a met metabolically challenged by it you know that there is there is just many different things that we have to consider and that is what we try to do here it is the cross we bear is that we try to understand on an individual level how to onto miss athletic performance i thing it is terrific and either yo the athlytorr fortunate to have this and most people out there am give you n i certainly been training courage people to learn some science and some mechanism and become scientist of their own pursuits whether not skill learning or athletic pursuit a et camera am as a sort of our final question what are a some things about the you have see for something about the you see that perhaps people do not know in terms of it is overall mission or what you get or trying to do here i mean i think i have become of far of e me may and i am more and more as time and moves on am some people might be in the me mas some people not into watching him i ma but what are some things that you see is interest end it in and doing i get most people might not know about it certainly i might knot know about ye i mean aha think ewe am we try to be cutting edge we try to be superprogressive we were think we have got an amazing platform here particularly performance institute to do some really cool things that can inform many different people and a out that does not just mean the the six hundred u o athletes are on our global route and what we are trying to do is is influence global community a found optimizing human performance o any moment in time we are engaging in different technologies with different venders different partners you now explore and opportunities to learn more shad dato understand what is the best mechanisms for you know interpreting your body interpreting how you body's responding to training interpreting you know u nutrition ow whatever it may be we get wereinary really privileged position to do that and but we have also i ow hence you been here to day now were are also trying to ventureinto some really cool areas of science and research that is got applicability and that you can take from my performance athletes an a ply you know to yourself to can jo blow walking down the street out there and that that is really interesting and that is everything from and you now whether it s be and psychedelics through to different technologies for you thermal monaterin and blue toot her rate monitoring or whatever it may be through to at to management et camera and n anything between we have we have got some great partners on the nutrition side on the psychology side on the datolite and and i think ewe always to to just push the envelope a little bit more i think we we keep our commission with our athletes but a think a lot of what we do hence your podcastand and i an amazing platform do such a great job of it the we can all learn and take from you know the let and interpret how it might help us and interest in the general population i think that is that is o o mortar is to provide our athletes the best integrated service of care and but we also one of influence you just the global community and put neither you have see at the forefront of the its great we goes ascertaintly doing it and we am cannot i let the cat you the bag just yet but a the things that were gearing up to do with my laboratory an y e were me to gather am i homely will be able to talk about that insure that and in the your to come but that is were very excite about that an am do not can look i have this i this a filter that i use when i talk to people academics or otherwise which as your some people they open their mouth and it and it does not make much difference but when you speak i learn much i i gan take the protocols that have give heard about to day ism going to think about how ism training and his a trying differently and better our eating i could you different differently and better forsake of performed and just in in general i thank you much for your time you scientific expertise the stuff you are doing in the practical realm its its immense flee i we can do it again yes thank you this been of last appreciate ye keep deny den casino the lot of people of the platform thanks for the invite as been also thank you thanks much thank you for joining me for my conversation with doctor gunman french i hope you found it as in rightful and informative as i did if you are enjoying this podcast and ore learning from it please subscribe to our tube channel please also leave us a comment or a suggestion of a future topic or future guests that you us to have on the superman podcast in addition please subscribe to our podcast on apple and notify and on apple you can leave us up to a five start review please also chick out the sponsors that we mention at the beginning if this episode that is a terrific way to support this podcast and as mentioned the beginning of today's episode we are now partnered with momentous supplements because they make single ingredient formulations that are f the absolute highest quality end ship international if you go to live momentous stock calm slash superman you will find many of the supplements that have been discussed on various episodes of the suberin labpodcast and you will find various protocols related to those supplements and also to mention that if you are not already following us on instergram at superman lab you might want to do there i do brief science tutorials and offer science pace protocols for all sorts of things that are often separate from the protocols and information covered on the superman labpodcast we are also on twitter as superman lab and last and certainly not least thank you for your interests

has no connection to any establishment political machinery of the past which is all corrupt that kind of purity test is something at you see a lot among republicans right now in the house of representatives in washingtan many political fights or be exipeen between republicans who do not want to compromise at all and everybody else you see this another republican state parties and swingstanes arizona card georgia but no state party is taking the flying leap off the cliff that the michigan republicans have more than any other state party they have the least politically connected fur this from the establishment most ideological party leader and her followers running things among other things have to say it is enormously idealistic out and by true believers who feel deeply that the only way out of the mess that ran as a country is a total break with what has come before and me coral on they work camp i so every things onions the rehears i pray former now now a starts to ana program when the political party takes ta leap this one throws itself out in an active faith this one in a major swing state what does that gambol look what happens next today we going to look at how this year in folded for these true believers producer we chase when man many times to michigan throughout this year and as the special up close an personal look at how all this played out from w b easy chico is this america life o for coss stay with us come a o on a ta n oo a an o that on the lonely island i can u now before e jump any deeper in this maybe should take a see and explain just what a state party actually does especially an organizations set up to handle all kinds of boring practical work that you need to do if you want a win elections they were f candidates they organize meetings they are these massive get ut t e vote operations for state elections of national candidates to and above all else there is money to pay for campaigns by ads to do everything else and the person o raises that money usually is the party chair its to have somebody with no political connections in that job christian cram that is very unusual boy tells the try from here now christian coral as elected in february tin the party did not pull together behind their new chair here is the tine of in fighting tell over the first few months in the first major test of her leadership fertility to get things done keep this fall the bacchanal island conference it is a big symbolic fable the van an michigan politics politicians cobias presidential candidates all make their way up to northern michigan and get on a marry to this island for no cars are allowed worst drawn carriages instead the whole place does smell for shit which makes it a perfect setting for a group of politicos they hobnob the gossip they make teal as they raise money and the test for christinawise with all the old school republicans she and her followers have ejected from the party could she raise enough money to even hold the conference would it even happen raising money is probably the most m portent thing the state party char does and christian has no fun raising background over the last ten years the list of reported job she is done are the scraping by kinds sales clerk trivia host substitute teacher ad junk community college instructor she made a christian podcast a plan to fun the party was to get donations from small republican businesses who have supposedly been sitting on the sidelines because they did not think the party was conservative enough but that never seems to get off the ground and for months before mananas there were rumors lake how would show ever come up with the cash for this big showboat affair to get a read on those rumors i checked in now and then with john smith as the perfect person to go to because he totally epitomizes what the michigan go play we come i he is an unabashed conspiracy theorist he started in state politics surround twenty twenty he chartered two buses to get to canary sixth booted not go inside the capital he says mingling he another stopped the steamers took over their local county parties johns on the state committee now e r the was i doubt christian raise enough money to pull off canal i ti your in e people ago a i o o the do not have a way to o about a him i think you do not at tat tackama you wit that a tat id that hae a moon fry t think that what what you're doing here ta i a ut it in ma your ye that a that a i ta yer hon literally in the fire festival documentary people show up in the bahamas and instead of blinkuenty two and the instograndmodels they were promise there is no music no food no water and saggy fematents we we all find ta ma√±ana as a quite that desperate when i got up to the grand hotel here was deftly a republican conference akin place the trumpets red white and blue sparkly pains as promise an grand piano playing a song about how anything is possible if only u believe but apparently this her was really different from past years at night i was wandering with a cublatendians including one of the younger vice chairs the a me and soon in a low founding fathers i poly tail we are headed upstairs in an elevator looking for the macadam parties which had heard for legendary engine o ones no is yer r a ma yes is is seriously n as one o them all and is lake once torn an this sosmedintis in what beats how is tat ones as last time we walk on the portions eight hundred people another a tin a in vary even an last time they were around two thousand attending this year the best guess i saw was eight hundred at the very most last time ted crews was a keynote speaker the bigamy national republican this time cut went on proponent him cuvette who made the sleeper summer hit move about child sex traffic sound of freedom he also played jess passion of the wrist out on the colossal porch at one point i talked to another state committee member who upset about how things seemed to be going well it is not ins tact wen what we were hoping or tichipatin mark forgot is one of those who wanted a complete break with how he used to be and how i used to be was that the head of the party was a super rich michigan guy weal estate mogalran wiser in the last few years the party yearly budget has been something twenty million dollars the trunk of which came directly from wiser and mostly one other rich family and michigan the devises we knew that if the fresh which to overs the party if the big shooters would go that all but we knew the the most family would go an a an a mister wiser would go they're their all globalist you know there all part of the same great big mass of machigan him and o bringing in the chines of battery factories i may we know their globalist and then mark spins out the first of the many times i will hear the theory that christian is the globalist plants that the reason things are going badly is that the establishment planned this way from the beginning of her rise to power they knew the grass rot said headenough and there going to take over this party they knew it then now the question is or these globes types a they gin to see by o take it ore they gin e her planning for when the guess would take over what we do next thereafter michigan is no doubt whit she is the most untie globalist of them all shes the anti glublistist i know am not accusing her am saying but who is pulling the strings who i just on know what to think them ism tell me of things yo ask me with on my mind you ask me then concerned about and none of them are facts but my got you look at all the appoint on in o cannot come up with the decent answer and i just do not know y thus ism trying to find out anal towboat is not the only conspiracy theory i here about christian in all way i run into some one whose conspiracy theory is on parallel track but going the other way radio jackobisi and of a frantic little do the is a major christian supporter a chair and one of her committees radar says socristina who's the globalist plant instead there's secret operatives within the party who are final her out they are doing it by starting all these rumors heist friend can buy er another gromwell loyalist wo told me that a few to day they came up with i a what e ones as the most see tens i saw that on the why is the that rube they lie because thing one people to show up and pact the house that is weather just as i rid it the me we can fitness for a while in all they dos li li l li li li lie and the make up the most absurd rumors because they know if they do that it will make it will la try to discredit this event credit discredit the administration and try to discredit basically all of the unitive why would they want to it people want power is it is a is an old saying i i do not know where it comes from but some people would rather rule over ashes than allow somebody to bead them o yet and some thin train that is absolutely tall for they go ha the ins from game i thrown n the actual business at macadam the meeting of party leaders with a showdown between christian supporters in christian skeptics about party finances this was a closed meeting but i got a tape cristinas tin claim they would raise six hundredand fifty thousand dollars the skeptics demanded they open of the books improve it for the end of the meeting christian on to the potinghim to defend her a y w w y man no you we we w wool o w y we people e o we a we are a at the end of the day christens tin does not agree to quote an quit open the books show them the party finances and every one bridges down to the boats frustrated with each other dodging the piles of fresh horseshit i at too another purities just a few days after the conference ended there was something else there really has nothing to do with money they came up about christina's grope about who welcome inside this party it was an meal anonymously penned by a guy who called himself pal revere and the just was an a slam takeover of america as happening hamisidel islamic terrors are becoming intrenched and infecting our whole country it concluded to paraphrase sir wanton churchly is lam in a man is as dangerous as rabies in a dog this meal was sent out to district chairs and vice chairs of the state party three of the vice chairs are mole and two of them replied all because they felt attacked by the anonymous meal one of them was hi sign semi the guy was in the elevator with that ma√±ana here is which he wrote good evening christian this meal was sent out to the republican leadership every

our destructs arias i was just rude the way this sos and i noble we had the commerce had the conversationwith the gladly and then actually after convention i met up with their we had another conversation for an hour ism more than willing to entertain that conversation the ow our face sorcery similar not s ism not an enemy we are not enemies the way the media perceives it but it'll it'll have that conversation all they but we tell this story though causlake i felid i miss the beginning of the story what happened we were at convention on do in our rounds is the day of the sections

great den to stop these muslin from becoming leaders of the party still it did not pass and these guides ended up his pace chairs they were excited lake he would t my budget line what like the credentials to start main people as official state party representatives thuds drive around set ut meetings to whatever it is this new experiment o group of people wants to do to reach out to people cut there were no leadership than meetings the say no one called them to tell them heres what we want you to do and how to do it and that they were the ones hazan and all who set up the first leadership meeting for back chairs all across the sweet christian did not show up to it then there was the whole vacant situation the guides wanted to help planning and the by was say that the adman bice chair that is ale he supposed to play a big role in planning it but they say no one would communicate with them about it finally they entered bat a meeting in leaning with christian and some of her team where they came away with the message we do not want people you leading things with this party in his an alias telling this is how the meeting went hazan was lake why aren't you advertising what a diverse leadership we are your black you've three arab muslin bice chairs he have an india america district chair he should be talking about that ye all was back to it a judo christian movement and somehow my face an does not play a run in that his was send to useplicitly among those lines you want exact by yes along those lines is is the duty christian values and in we are not a part of this plan how didn't make you feel ism use to on ism stolen to do what i think is right and e as ai i just bothers you was is not the federal safe his n ant a federalese papers were some of the best things have ever read it in my life and this the conversations that took place and then you deal with this type of verderer any la if if were truly tong about the fond fathers the foin fathers this all of this sol this freedom of religious you could ow we had stepped out and walks back into the room at this point what did you say i a let me non were to about the diversity why we are not playing and playing the tray i had party she set on shes christian all the country wasn't fond end awful muslin believes it was found that a false jugal christian believes and that is o fact you can look that of for yourself mama li de we understand that but lets me more inclusive and word a differently a several one including look use we got the mole sea the muscles and the america of in deathlike were there it all i not talk about what was said in the conversation exactly what was said yet to la its me botrethan his san say to get annoyed staring down the table at ally but yet she was o nachos genuine my were trying keep our republican party together in not this makes the on is truth the truth men was the scan the statement no against the truth is just this case much more problems when it comes out the wording that was used it please the render tan hey we were just told that you as are not a part of the plain wo shouldn't say that basically they felt at the meeting in land saying that they were being subjected to a different purity test not one about who was grass roots enough but about whether anybody but christian had a place in christian promos party e talked to christian about this and she categorically denied this person of events she says of course there is a place for museums in her leadership and she says she did try to include his sin and flee but they were on responsive i sin shared screen shots with me that showed him reaching out to her about mascara specifically and getting brushed off in any case by the time they got to mascara which they had played no part in putting together his san and all were feeling salty we got there in we dame an they hey may make us name tags and that is a statement i your knows to some that as offense and they got mad when we ask were a nametags the we gas when ha namings in takin an the they give us and whatever at the point i a i as candy baby they gave us general admission on mi i were blackcaps none can i get a leap you on what he is doing and but yet we were not in wolves i t all i did there to help was a during the meeting on sundae the the lights guy asked me if he could had out so i told me i me e that we still talking when his sins phone rings it is john smith the guy always talked to about was happening in the party the fire festiogat es got news e e o ma come no have been doing ta six hour long innerve a i i she she o no have been to a ben the inter vote not a mat the charge the got ma cat the o o with e grow the got him to he one r him ministry relatable is these new mishican were publicans y the habit of overthrowing first they her through their own establishment now the having beers remorse over the bed they made on christian wondering if they should try to remove her too i e hers no e chine t re mom you now a leadership i but i e p a i mi i i e to crincpoitru it a saying them for o far i can't i might go wit john there if if everything is really as corrupt as there saying in we get more solid evidence and everything spread the lion an looks what it is then young ninon i do not see these efforts as being misguided thinking bout christian hem or you time the same a ort sori e peace of sells i is drunken pretending an doors o on be hones o hackers e no a gartherena but as far as john smith personally goes he buried the lead on this call hi son checks his meal wile were on the phone john smith rest resignation john smith is this ever john would ye thinking men count understand why you decided to resign i think i can i coconut on again mark would even e party would even it do for work is he soar a hundred i can to for ianiasgestor no i i chain also soy woman for i man mom right to with you man is i in aged sang sonde i may i put ninth thousand miles on my trunk was force to by my least o the an by aah hem i promised you a in the same boys i but on the to pin we hen the word jo that is an interesting question to me these leadershiprolls are volunteer not peed did the party only work before because there were rich people who could afford to do them how long can the not rich people afford to be in political leadership per of all the people to leave now ism surprised its john he was one of the first people in michigan to make a show of pushing out the establishment part of this wave of new leaders who ousted their county chairs to create this grassroots state party run by the new beast disconnected from the on guard he walked christian could run is for hissing and ale then found the party in especially welcoming place either before or after cristinas take over but they're gin to keep trying seeing how hard their having to fight to be included it makes me think about how relatively unimportant winning seems to be and postjanuary six purity politics if the party wanted to win you could imagine a world were they be reaching out to guise this instead of side lining them but instead it seems that this new version of the party is winnowing it down to a relatively small and tainted by compromise o principled people not a winning strategy for a political party and michigan in particular o is he chase coming hot how to too a republican later t i somebody said a half century ago follow the money it is about to get red that is admitted chico to bogradio went our program continues to smart can li from my a glass as they sher ends noticing the kind of fights happening among republicans in u s house of representatives and on the country we have this political story though we thought capture something about the state of republican politics this yer from michigan kind the episode it would not be make believe if you would believe in me he chaste picks up mocha left off the last week of september the plot to oust christian heated up when some one i the michigan go p sent out a garage of screen shots to a few reporters they were of bank statements of the michigan go pee it was a little confusing this collection of random screen shots but it did seem the party was almost completely out of money john smith got the texts hen see any evidence of this thing christian people said at maccaboy about the money they traced he was depressed and you bi yo older e it the can to abs which is a lie the my in the lying t lying you every one i yet t you think they are lying because they are corrupt or do you think there lying eras her her the ye her that o thing we would be we with it e thin you then the not we u awful i we need tea the hundred ha to be got above can we would all go out if y you united that o tit e mirin make ever the suing to be e ha o you think that if from the very begin in they that hay we are not going to any of the old done we are doing a whole new than o we need you hat the quadrate all the time e people would have been what have gone wit that o to o but the cut yo ten on a the in the get go you do not your that wit weaving people and of in the middle of that that i a cannot to yo goth word people were getting scared that the party was in no way can be able to run next year's elections there would be no fundraising no get out the vote no coronation of strategy the were going to lose control of twenty twenty four at that brings us to act three the insurrectionists resurrect again the guide who lead the bank accounts green shots warring carpenter was a major christian supporter at first won't helped to get christian elected he raised money for her secretary of state campaign he would votes for her cherish an went to talk to him he runs a landscaping business and the suburbs of detract he walked me to the back of his offish this is uncomfortable is it e ya use it o you you fore well its radio that is why warren comes off antagonistic rate from the beginning and a little man what he is just done leaking documents to the press about christian it is a big deal though why ye oat is the get in read the news or something he says that morning the morning we spoke september twenty ninth the trout news reporter crag larger an eminently fair and lightning fast journalist published a right up of all the documents warren had sent him the article begins the michigan republican party had about thirty five thousand dollars in its bank account an august according to internal records that flash new warning signs about the dire state of the gropes finances this as followed shortly by a quote from a former state get p official these numbers demonstrate that the party is not just broke but broken warring is also extensively quoted in the article which is a big betrayal of christian talking to a journalist who in her view is just in league with the establishment trying to take her out warren says he dabbled in republican politics before this movement took off worked down a state wide campaign over ten years ago but not much since then until trump he loves trump called him big daddy and had that schoolyard come to jess many republicans did round the cove protocols masking in schools kind of thing he went to canary sixth after he thought he saw the election get stolen says he d inside the capital but he had such an intense experience there that not long after he had a mental breakdown as he puts it that is when he got involved in his local party he is one of the new bees who got elected to district chair part of the weave that took over the party this year he d in part of christens in her circle but now the would resigned from his position is district chair and was talking smack in the press what happened well a few weeks before the mac in our conference warren get on the fond with christina's chief of staff jewel shut baker and the rest of routine the were telling him they needed help to pull off the conference he looked at their financial situation and he responded with what a now under stand to be his typical intensity how sh my ye how sh my n how sh my you who is been paid i what is the problem what you need why m y the fucking call with you but job stutobaker did not know what the numbers i try did not know any of the numbers for anything they were literally flying by the fuckanseet to their pants shooting from the head it was in is the most ludicrous thing weever heard of my entire life time there was no budgetary dramatic thy a share with me and during that initial fridge call the only thing they had to share what they almost had the program ready to go to the prince a program with speakers on it they did not have the each to pay for it seemed warren called campaign finance experts who looked at what he had and told him to get as far away as possible from this organization have looked at warren's documents and what i saw looked a broke party spending money way faster than it was taking anything in i also went over the parties a you see filings though they have not filed since jury and all that i looked at i did see some very unusual accounting but nothing illegal warren alleges such only two ways at this carat this wont you things this scars would be in my mind i it is either e pros negligent in copitance right i would describe i would escribe intend and say that it is malicious therefore if it is malicious then the have to go to the next conclusion which is then h destruction of the party now can you escribe intent for destruction of the party warren goes on to float his own version of this abbatage theory i heard from other people that christian herself is controlled by some kind of national operation launched at the michigan republican party and order to destroy it he r an operative or is offed but its either from the democratic side or its from or is from ears from e an agency he is pretty surest is not and that not just in michigan how would explain why goes in georgia arizona an too or struggling some one sabbatacing them but even if it is not in tot i some one who helped put christian in office in the first place warren now feels responsible for where she is brought the party and warren's a doer he is also on mega mends i i find that out myself when he calls me apologizes for yelling at me at one point maybe that comes from his years i h warren has a plan to make things right i was to christian coranto he is a whole eighteen point plan to do it that defrost new's article wash the first step now he's ripping votes against her just like win votes for her at the beginning of the year trying to make sure as the numbers i you you file for the meeting only get the signatures were in to have all the signatures needed to overthrow that a shows him over i want psychologically them to be beat before they can go into this thesover o car way i as ye save to quick a a we once on son call a the next time i her warren's voice it is from his tune meeting some one sent me of steeve committee members from around michigan warren called the meting he is a spread sheet of the hundred or people in the state committee color voted who is with this who is against him he is literally counting votes trying to get to that majority to outs christian o get let oo is quick a everybody in read is in ready o the public from o who she so is i som i ais any badyistri satabord this ani o you i a

and shes frank she admits they would have to make a lot more money the conference there is still in debt for a hundred and ten thousand dollars speakers my for him cobeazl for example your minds every one that the reason they elected her is they wanted to run the party differently not raise twenty million dollars and run right through it the previous chairs where i all this twenty dos go what was is window no abut it the suit is to do nothing that is what it was bit a e where did a the latest people rag about how much lay they raise the deal the off the french that e will beg on of for dates

these people ten ten people fail in the a we the was of a there car her at all on people w tar may now what the era ran the a win doll is law laugh out of the who we can overdo i she called out the people that she sees is covert deemster operatives within the current party then she describes them they sound alike warring an this a body of these people they we can to be than is ut they can get welt up they we tend to be one abs the we will trusted moving on next to my in his sign not my name may i had too life here faulty you be a be a big fool but a she insist for administration hasn't ever lie or committed any crine the fighting itself she says is a tactic to keep her from succeeding the fighting however immediately continues back downstairs in warren's room a guide from christina's team swaggers in to confront warring his names can beer he said he would received a text from warring seeing him coming after you horn says it just said ism coming and there is this big wild west fast off between them that very a your ask questions a why don great you at all get over was agon at you room for dressbssin just as you re about that me remove at are you rob e if you wan for e us i i never a you an o e y at mi now a little crowd gathers watching them gotta across the said hour to a o is to a i e on for run ravings years ago we a asap naggetiv in the account there is the fifty thousand o ora an this is the problem with the true warrens trying to pull off it is the problem that was baked into chromous version of the party from the start this croup of people all agree on some besucitions collection fraud less emigration no gun control portion is murder do not tell me what to wear mast do not tell my children what to read and the rent is to damn but whit is brought them altogether running this party is there lack of trust in any kind of political leadership they are very suspicious conspiracy minded group and that is how they look at everything including each other course they cannot agree on for the real enemy is of the cause they all actually believe in i you fir r a lie wright before this story went to air this week christian chromo finally agreed to an interview i reached her while she was taking a morning walk i asked her about her year in power it told her it seems for all her good intentions the party is ended up in disarray broke and ineffective without the money it needs to win elections next year i will say i reject your premise that mi tango should be defied by flood the that is the problem your premiss off i your premises that i should be defied by body is the only people that benefit from the premissour potation is the political class the only people hat benefit are do you least at i will i elected to reject that permit this is what it is to talk to her about this she would not say which she do to get the party out of this mess so would even acknowledge that they are in mess but not bankrupt that is not true drill the think aborted we a separate at a poet of cashflow or yet it haw i hit the fight ant ballet o would not at the level i would but we are at our way will that is why i guess ism asking just for any example is they are a fund razor in which you tapped into businesses that had been sitting on the side lines you talked about n your carrying for something that is all any any specific you can get me yet wet a well i for what yes but i do not know what e if if your looking for wit my question is why you dogmatic won the notion u people who want a plishteeld be the native that is my question the astern it notable time ut no question to use a why are you thelograthiv o mat nation ism not going to go through the not not o every partan will give at a dollar o ten thou the the o the twenty thou totrimetistration i an the were opeready you a pop of cash club as e last month they're bringing in more than they're spending not because of any fund rasing they got ta pay out from a national committee but there still deep in damn and they could not get any specifics from christian and how the party would bring in the millions they have always used to run elections for twenty twenty four she pointed out again and again that was the wrong question they have cut costs they do of a plan to run a round game and once that happens they can judge how that goes over the last few months give watched er circle of supporters get smaller district chairs have resigned members of the budget committed resigned upset about the finances and that the leadership would not listen to them for all intend one purposes the party splitting to what is it feel to have all these people we lies were on the same team to begin with calling for your ouster or coming after you making all these claimslike what is tit feel to was they experiencelike for you that's be trail o it but we you realizes again the fact that our country's corrupt is way it is wit coulter people of the politics are dishonest it

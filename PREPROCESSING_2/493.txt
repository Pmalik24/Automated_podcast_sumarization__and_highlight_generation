welcome to the superman japonicas ts of science science space to i mandrel supermen and am a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate for my teaching research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zerocostic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on treason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient incitement d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock om slash supermen to claim the special offer of the free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element t do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they're all delicious again if you wan a try element you can go to element else a went calm slash superman let us continue our discussion about narrow plasticity this incredible feature of our nervous system that allows it to change itself in response to experience and even in ways that we consciously and deliberately decide to change it that is an incredible feature no other organ in our body has that capability are nervous sister which governs everything about who we are how we feel in what we do does have that capability the issue is most people do not know how to access neral plasticity children readily access nerd plasticity and they do not e realize that there doing it adults want negro plasticity and that is what this entire month of the superman ladpodcastis been about we have exploredinero plasticity from a variety of different perspectives i talked about representational elasticity we talked about the importance of focus and reward we talked about this amazing and somewhat surprising aspect of the vestibular system how altering our relationship to gravity and in addition to that making errors as we try and learn can open up windows to plasticity but we have not really talked much about directing the plasticity toward particular out comes and thus far we really have not talk yet about how to undo things that we do not want have talked about learning and i say learn a language learn freethroes learn a particular motor skill et camera but what about what we you call unlearning or about removing some aspect of our experience that we do not want and to day we are going to explore that aspect of hero plasticity and we are going to do that in the context of a very important and somewhat sensitive topic which is pain regeneration and in some cases injury to the nervous system now for those of you that are fortune enough to not have or had a concussion we are not have or know some one whose experiencing chronic or acute pain i encourage you to stay in here with us because a lot of the information that we are going to cover has direct relevant to negro plasticity for other purposes we as always here on this podcast are going to discuss some of the science we get into mechanism but we also really get at principles principles are far more important than any one experiment toward one description of mechanism and certainly far more important than any one protocol because principles allow you to think about your nervous system and work with it in ways that bast serve viol they are very flexible batches of information we are going to talk about the principles of negro plasticity for removing pain and wound healing and injury were going to talk about acupuncture of all things we are going to talk about modern medicines attempt to try and restore youth to the aging or injured or demented brain and we are going to definitely talk about tools got a lot of tools i consulted a number of fantastic colleagues at stamford at hazard medical school and in the greater community of tissue rehabilitation injury and pain management in preparation for this podcast i do want to be very clear and just remind you that ism not a medical doctor ism a professor i do not proscribe anything i profess things i have my beliefs but the podcast is for information purposes i do hope that the tools that we discuss will be of benefit to you but as always you should talk to your doctor or health care provider about any tools that you plan to add or looking to explore as well as anything that you might look to remove from your daily predicates in other words do not change anything without consulting an expert first your responsible for your health not me and i say this not just to protect me but also to protect you please keep that in mind as we move forward and ism very excited to share with you this information because i do feel that it can be of great benefit to a number of people let start our discussion about pain and sensation and regeneration and wound healing with a discussion about a very important system in the nervous system which is the sematicensory system the somematicensory system is as the name implies involved in understanding touch physical feeling on our body and the simplest way to think about the sematicensory system is that we have little censors and those censors come in the form of neurons nerve cells that reside in our skin and in the deeper layers below the skin and indeed we do we have some that correspond to and we should say respond to mechanical touch in pressure on the top of my hand or a pin point or other censors for insane respond to heat to cold some respond to vibration it a huge number of different receptors in our skin and they take that information and send it down these wires that we call axons in the form of electrical signals to our spinal cord and than up to the brain and we thin the spinal cord in brain we have centers that interpret that information that actually make sense of those electrical signals and this is amazing because none of those censers has a different unique form of information that it uses it just tends electrical potentials into the nervous system the nervous system you somehow decode what a given stimulus on your skin is have it is the wind blowing om gently and deflecting some of the hairs on your on your arm or maybe it is a a sharp pin prick or a hot stove or the warmth of a glowing fire that all arrives in your nervous system in the form of these electrical things we can l action potentials which is just amazing and then the brain computes them and make sense of them we have peripheral censors and we have got stations up in our brain and within our spinal cord that makes sense of all the stuff coming in pain and the sensation of pain is believe it are not a controversial word in the now science field people prefer to use the word no subreption no susceptors are the censers in the skin that detect particular types of stimuli it actually comes from the satin word no era which means to harm and why would nursing does not want to talk about pain well it is very subjective it has a a mental component and of physical component we cannot say that pain is simply an attempt to avoid physical harm to the body and here is why they actually can be dissociated from one another a good example would be if god forbid you were exposed to high levels of radiation such as working with some sort of material that was radio active or ah you where near a former radio active plant or some some radiation excessive ex rays et camera you would not feel any pain during the ex rays in fact you do not if you have ever had exams as i have you do not feel anything they put you under that led blanket they run behind a wall than they in milk is t take these pictures of your teethes really scary if because you what something really terrible must be happening here but you do not feel anything but there can be a lot of tissue damage that can be mutations introduced to cells et camera have had ex was girl not saying people shouldn't have ex rays but excessive ex rays certainly are not good for human beings likewise with excessive exposure to any radiation there can be tissue damage without the physical perception or mental perception of pain at all as well there can be the belief of pain or the feeling of pain without their being tissue damage and there is a famous case that was published in the brutish journal of medicine were a construction worker i think he fell is how the story went and a fourteen inch nail went through his boot and up through the boot and he was in excruciating pain just beyond anything he would experience he he reported the e could even move in any dimension even a tiny bit without feeling excruciating pain they brought him into the clinic into the hospital they were able to cut away the boot and they realize that the nail had gone between two toes and had actually not impaled the skin at all his visual image of the nail going through his boot gave him the feeling the legitimate feeling that he was experiencing the pain of a nail going through his foot which is incredible because it speaks to the power of the mind in this pain scenario and it also speaks to the power of the specificity it is not he thought that his foot was on fire are he thought because he saw a nail going through his foot when it was going through his boot that he thought is going through his foot that it was sharp pain of the sort that agnail would produce and there are thousands of these finds of case reports out there that is not to say that all pain that we experiences in our head but it really speaks to the incredible capacity that these top down these the entire level cognate functions have in interpreting what we are experiencing out in the periphery even just on the basis of what we see and the example radiation speaks to the fact that pain and tissue damage are dissociable from one another why we talking about pain during a month on enrol plasticity what turns out that the pain system offers us a number of different principles that we can leverage to a insure that if we are ever injured we are able to understand the difference between injury and pain because there is a difference that if we never in pain that we can understand the difference between injury and pain that we will be able to interpret our pain and during the course of to day's podcast ism going to cover protocols that help eliminate pain from both ends of the spectrum from the periphery at the level of the injury and through these top down mental mechanisms a lot of times on this podcast in fact mostly i tend o center on the physiology on the really objective things that you can describe and talk about diaphragmatic movement or sunlight of a particular number of photons et camera but to days are really exciting opportunity for us to discuss some of the more subjective things believe it ore not we are going to talk about love a college of mine at stamford who runs a major pain clinic on is working on and as published quality pure reviewed data on the role of love in modulating the pain response only there is a twist to it and i not in reveal it just yet but it turns out that the specific type of connection one has to a romantic partner actually dictates whether or not their love for them will alleviate physical pain and the effects are really robot it is an amazing literature and what we are toot to day is plasticity of perception which has direct bearing on emotional pain and has direct bearing on drama and other things that we discussed in previous episodes a little bit but that we are going to explore even more an entire month about those topics let us get started in thinking about what happens with pain and i wish describe some examples of some kind of extreme cases for instance i will tell you just now that there is a mutation a genetic mutation in a particular sodium channel of sodium channel is a one of these little holes in neurons that allows them to fire action potentials its important to the function the neuron its also important for the development of certain neurons and there is a particular mu action there are kids that are born without this sodium channel one point seven you want to look it up those kids experience no pain no pain whatsoever and it is a terrible situation they burn themselves they tend to rest on their limbs too long they do not make the micro adjustments you might see me swivelling round my chair moving round a lot those microadjustments are actually normal healthy microadjustments that prevent us from going into pain they do not make those adjustments they do not get the feed back that they are in a particular position and they never make those adjustments and their joints get destroyed essentially ah they do not tend to live very long doe to accidents it is a really terrible and unfortunate circumstance some people have a mutation in the same channel where they make too much of this channel they feel too much pain in fact it is reasonable to speculate that one of the reasons not all but one of the reasons why people might differ in their sensitivity to pain is by way of genetic variation and how many of these sorts of receptors that they express people who make too much of this receptor experience extreme pain from even subtle stimuli now the good news is there are good drug treatments that can block specifically this sodium channel one point seven and those people get a lot of relief from taking such drugs pain and how much pain we are sensitive to or insensitive to probably has somgonetic basis and then of course there are things that we can do to make sure that we experience less pain although pain has this adaptive roll let us talk about some of the features of how we are built physically and how that relates to pain and how we can recover from injury first of all we have maps of our body surface in our brain it is called a homunculus in a rack believe it are not ism not making this up its called ha ranunculus in costello my dog is snoring behind me it is a dogunculous i can get into the coming later and why it is call this but it is baby a representation of the body surface that representation is scaled in a way that match is sensitivity the areas of your body that are most sensitive have a lot more brain real estate devoted to them your back is an enormous piece of tissue compare to your finger tip but your back has fewer receptors devoted to it and the representation of your back in your brain is actually pretty small whereas the representation of your finger is enormous the how big a brain areas devoted to a given body part is directly related to the density of receptors in that body part not the size of the body part and that is why if we were to draw your homunculus or costellos dogunculous what we would find is that certain areas the lips the finger tips the genitalia the eyes in the area round the the face would have a huge representation whereas the back the torso and areas of the body that or less sensitive are going to have smaller representation to be a very distorted mat you can actually know how sensitive a given body part is and how much brain area is devoted to it through what is called two point discrimination you can do this experiment if you ant i think have described this once or twice before but basically if you have someone put in maybe take two pens and put them maybe six inches apart on your back and and touch while your facing away and you they will ask you how many points their touching you and you say o two but if they move those closer together say three inches you are likely to experience it as one point of contact where as on your finger you could do the play that game all day and as long as there is a millimeter or spacing you will know that it is two points as supposed to one and that is because there is more pixels more density of receptors this has direct bearing to pain because it says that areas of the body that if dense or receptors can be more sensitive to pain than to others and where we have more receptors we tend to have more blood vessels and plea which are the support cells and other cells that lend to the inflammation response and that is really important just as a rule of thumb areas of your body that are injured that are large areas that have low sensitivity before injury likely are going to experience less pain and the literature shows will heal more slowly because they do not have as many cells around to produce inflammation and you might say weight i thought inflammation is bad one of the things i really want to get across to day is that inflammation is not bad inflammation out of control is bad but inflammation is wonderful inflammation is the tissue repair response and we are going to talk about subjective and objective ways tomoduly inflammation after tissue injury even after just exercise that is been too intense toque you have this map of your body surface its sensitive in different ways now why you have got your neurobiology of some at sensation one o one under your belt now we did not cover everything but we will touch on some of the other details as we go forward i thought it might be a nice time to just think about the relationship between the periphery in the central maps in a way that many of you probably heard about before which will frame the discussion a little b better which is phantom limb pain some any you're proudly familiar with this but for people that have an arm or a leg or a finger or some other portion of their body amputated it is not uncommon for those people to feel as if they still have that limb or appendage or piece of their body intact an typically unfortunately the sensation of that limb is not one of the limb being nice and relaxed in and and just there the sensation is that the limb is experiencing pain or its contorted in the specific orientation that it was around the time of the injury of some one has at a blunt force to the hand and they end up having their hand amputated typically they will continue to feel pain in their phantom hand which is pretty wild and that is because the representation of that hand is still intact in the quarter in the brain and it is trying to balance its levels of activity normally it is getting what is called proprioceptive feed back proprioception is just our knowledge o where our limbs are in space its an extremely important aspect of our sematicensary system and there is no s proprioceptive feed back and a lot of the circuits start to ramp up their levels of activity and they become very conscious of the phantom limb now a before my labs at stamford i was at you see sanding in when my colleagues was a guy everyone is calls in by his last name romachondren who is famous for understanding this phantom limb phenomenon and developing a very simple but very powerful solution to it that speaks to the incredible capacity of top down modulation and top down modulation the ability to use one's brain cognition and senses to control pain in the body is something that everyone not just people missing limbs are in chronic pain to learn to benefit from because it is away to tap into the our ability to use our mind to control perceptions of what is happening in our body and this is not a mystical statement this is not about mind i i guess as much as is brain to control our perceptions of our body what i romachondren do romachondren had people who were missing a limb put their intact limb into a box that had mirrors in it such that when they looked in the box and they moved their intact limb the opposite limb which was a reflection of the intact limb cause are missing the opposite limb they would see it as if it was intact and as they would move their intact limb they would visualize with their eyes the the limb that is in the place of the absent limb that is all by mirrors moving around and they would feel immediate relief from the phantom pain and he would tell them and they would direct their hand toward a orientation that felt comfortable to them then they would exit the mirror box hold take their their their hand out and they would feel as if the hand was now in its relaxed normal position you could get real time in moments remapping of the representation of the hand of that is amazing this is the kind of thing that all of us would to be able to do if we are in pain if you stub your to if you break your ankle if you take a hard fall on your bike or if you are in chronic pain when's it be amazing to be able to use a mind trick but it is not a trick right because it is real visual imagery to remap your representation of your body surface and where your body is that is something that we could all benefit from because if you do anything for long enough including live you are going to experience pain of some sort and this again i just one remind you is not just about physical injuries an pain this has direct relevant to emotional pain as well which we of course will talk about the romachondran studies were really profound because they set a couple things one plasticity can be very fast that it can be driven by the experience of something just the visual experience he had people do this mirror box thing but not look into the mirror box and they did not get the remapping it require visual imagery coming in we also know for instance that in cases where people are concongenerally deaf the cochlear implant which is simply a way of putting a it it is not simple but it is a way of putting in a device that replaces the cocoa the the device that were normally born with in the ear that has these little what are called hairballs that deflect according a sound waves and allow us to hear by replacing the the normal hearing apparatus that is deficient in death people with this cochlear implant the brain can make sense of this artificial ear basically snot the outside years not the pinna but the the inner ear and they can start to hear sounds now some people really the artificial cocoa they really benefit from it it restores their ability to hear and they it other people do not some deaf people would prefer not to hear anything can be very disruptive to them some of that might have to do with the need for further better engineering of these artificial coulis but all this really speaks to the fact that the brain is an adaptive device it will respond to what you give it it is not a device that is fixed in fact the essence of the brain especially the human brain is to take sensory puts and to make sense of those meaning cognitive sense and then to interpret those signals and this may come as a shock to some of you and by no means in my trying to be insensitive but pain is a perceptual thing as much as it is a physical thing it is a belief system about what your experiencing in your body and that has important relevant for healing different types of injury and the pain associated with that injury in people's pursuit for nor plasticity a question that comes up every once in a while is people say you know i just a brush my teeth with the opposite hand for couple nights in a row will i get normal plasticity and the answer is probably yes i means a deliberate action in your focussing on it there is an enroll your very likely to make errors yonjovment of anherorlips angles at first and then getting better at in is you heard in last episode making errors is really important cause those errors of the signal that plasticity needs to happen and then when you get the actions correct then those correct actions are program me in ism not sure that brushing one's teeth with the opposite hand is the most on effective use of this incredible thing that we have which is plasticity it is not can open up plasticity for many other things if that were really important to you on for whatever reason maybe en crowded bathroom and its easier to on one side or the other than fine but it is gun a hard to imagine why this would be a highly adaptive behavior unless of course you have an injured limb or your missing a limb and that gets me to some really exciting and important studies that were were performed mostly in the nineties as well as in the two thousands and that for now there is really a solid base of data this really a center of mass are round a particular set of experiments that point to particular protocols for how to overcome motor injury and this may resinate with some of you who ever been injured to the point where you could not walk well temporarily i hope or even longer think about a sprainedankle scenario or broken arm scenario we are all familiar with the stories of people having a cast on and then getting the cast off and that the particular limb that was not being used that was wasted is much smaller in atrophied most of that atrophy you might be surprised to learn is not because the muscles are not being used it is because the nerves sending signals to those muscles are not active and therefore the muscles are not contracting work done by innate timothy smaller and his graduates dudes in stocks terms ones and others in the nineties and two thousands did showed something really wonderful that i think we can all benefit from should we have an injury and even if we simply want to balance out imbalances in our motor activity and i think all of us tend to be stronger on one side or the other side usually a right handed person will be stronger in their left arm not always for compensatory reasons o some other time we talk about handwriting the lefties likely will be stronger in their right arm although it find oft depends on whether not people are hook cities that is when you can hook around and right from the top or hook lefties thermal sorts of theories about this that we can a talk about right brain left brain math proficiency et camera any event what shallertin college showed was that if we have damage to our brain in the sensory motor pathways any number of different sense my motor pathways or we have damage to a limb could be a leg could be an arm could be hand there is great benefit to restricting the use of the opposite better performing uninjured limb or hand or other part of the body they had about a dozen papers showing that if there was damage centrally in the brain or there was damage to a limbs a unilateral damage as we say one side the thing to do o is not to cast up the damage side although you need to do that to protect the limb of course from further damage it he broken arming to cast the arm re to brace the arm but that the anything was to restrict movement of the intact uninjured opposite limb and when they did that it forced some movement in the injured limb and remarkably through connections from the two through sides of the brain through the corpus colossus this huge fire pathway that links the two sides of the brain they saw plasticity on both sides of the brain this makes sense when you hear it you let say i injure my left ankle and ism limping along or amusing crutches you would think will the last thing you want to do a start is injure your opposite limb or or not use the your opposite limb my right ankle is perfectly fine but if i lean too hard on my right limb and i take all the work out of the left limb at left able that is chilly setting up a a situation where there is going to be run away a symmetry in the central pathways and the nerve to muscle pathways on my left side and what they suggested and what they showed in a variety of experiments was that by encouraging activity of the injured limb provided it could be done without pain and importantly not just exercising that that limb or part of the body but restricting the opposite healthy part of the body that the speed of recovery was significantly faster now i want a repeat you do not want to go injuring something further that is body the worst thing you could do but in some cases where people have damage in their brain the limbs are perfectly fine but the motor signals are not getting down to the limbs and in that case the limb is fine you actually are free to use the either limb as much as you want and in that case you do not want a relief on the uninjured pathway too much in fact you want a restrict the uninjured pathway i find these studies remarkable and they've been followed up on at the molecular level at the cellar level many times and i think the physiotherapist out there and some that the rest of you who involved in sports medicine and some of the physicians will they will of course that makes perfect sense but oftentimes this is not what happens oftentimes what happens is it is all about resting and limiting inflammation and et camera of the injured limb or the limbs corresponding to the injured part of the brain and these experiments and the collection of them point to the fact that the balance between the right and left side of our body is always dynamic it is always being updated that the level of neral circuitry the romachondran studies with the mirror box support that too and that even slight in balances in the two sides of the body can get amplified and when you are in a situation where one side is injured or the brain is injured representing one side of the body the anything to do is to really over work the side that needs the work and to restrict the activity of the side that does not need the work because it is healthy and this has great semblance to ocular dominance plastic which i talked about it couple episodes ago i will not going to it in detail but where the noble prize winning norbiologist town's of vessel davit you will show that if one eye is closed early in development that the representation of the opposite eyeing the brain is completely overtaken by the intact eye this has important means that all of our senses and our movements are competing for space in our brain and the way to thing about the principal is any time you're injured and your hobbling along you do not want injure yourself further but you want to try in compensate in the ways that respect this competition for normal real estate and what that usually means is not relying on where you are still strong because that is just going to create runaway plastic that is going to make it very hard for you to recover the motor function and in some case is the sensory function of the damaged limb some of you may be wondering how long and how often one should restrict the activity of the intact or healthy limb or limbs in some cases and the answer is you do not have to do that all day every day these experiment centered on doing one or two hours of dedicated work o sensory motor work or on for instance if you had the sprained ankle on the left you might spend part of the day where your left leg provided it is not too painful can be exercised get in away that is not damaging to the injury and the right limb cannot contribute to that exercise this might be peddling unalatterly on a on a stationary bike a if you can do that for a different type of liminjury an arm injury this might be o reaching provided the shoulder is mobile doing reaching might be even writing with the the damage side a and then intentionally not writing with the preferred or undamaged side this has been shown to accelerate the central plasticity and the recovery of function which i think is what most people want when people are injured they want to get back to doing what they were doing previously and they want o be able to do that without pain now this brings up another topic which is definitely related to neral plasticity an injury but is a more general one that i hereabout a lot which is dramatic brain injury many injuries are not just about the limb and the the lack of use of the limb but concussion and head injury and i want it emphasize ism not a neurologist have many colleagues that are at some point we will do a whole month on t b eye because it such a serious issue and it is such a huge discussion but i want to talk a little bit about what is known about recovery from concussion and this has very important because it has implications for just normal aging is well and offs it setting some of the connive towline and physical decline that occurs with normal aging we should think of t b i is just for the football players are just for the kids that had an injury or just for the personthat was in the car accent we want a learn about t b and understand t b i for those folks but we are also going ta talk about t b as it relates to general degradation of brain function because there is a certain a semblance there of t b i to general brain aging typically after t b i there number different things that happen and their huge range of things that can create t b they are all just and the emergency room physicians are going to on to know was the skull you was it was the skull itself injured did the brain rattle around in the skull om was there actually a breach through the skull om is their physical object in there was how many concussions as the person had an every one situation with t b is incredibly different but there is a constellation of symptoms that many people if not all people wit t b i report which is headache phodopho b a that lights become kind of aversive sleep destruction route concentrating sometimes mood issues there is a huge range and of course the severity will not very et camera in a previous episode i mention the heard principle the heard principle named after the famous neurologist named bi and after the famous zoologist market heard said that if you are gong to get a brain injury better to get it early in life than later in life and that is because the brain has a much greater or height an capacity for repairing itself early in life then later but of course none of us want t b i and you cannot pick when you get your t b i you can avoid certain activities that would give you t b i but really when it comes to t b i their couple things that are agree to upon across the board the first one is as much as possible you want to avoid a second dramatic brain injury or concussion now that is can be a tough one for some of the athletes and even recreational athletes to swallow because they want to continue in their sport and ism not here to tell you that you should or you should not but ah that is simply the way that it that it is om for folks that are in military or that are in a certain professions o construction is a place where we see a lot of t b it is not always just football lot of construction workers are doing with heavy objects swinging around in space om they were those hard hat helmets which unfortunately do not protect much against a lot of those a blunt forces and certainly not against falls and things that sort many people in order survive and feed their families have to go back to work it is very clear that regardless of whether not there was a skull break and regardless of when the t b i happened and how many times it is happen that the system that repairs the brain the adult brain is mainly centered around this lymphatic system that we call for the brain the lymphatic system now the brain was not thought to have a lymphatic system it was not thought to have circulating a man cells but about ten years ago it was sort of rediscovered because you look in the litriatury realize the stuff was around longer that there is a lymphatic system it for a sewer system that clears out the debris that surrounds neurons especially injured neurons and the lymphatic system is very active during sleep it is been imaged in function on a magnetic resonance imaging and the lymphatic system is something that you want very active because it is going to clear away the debris that sits between the neurons and the cells that surround the connections between the neurons called the plea those cells are actively involved in repairing the connections between neurons when damaged the lymphatic system it is important that many people if not all people who get t be my are told get adequate rest you need to sleep and that is kind of twofold advice on the one hand it is telling you to get sleep because all these good things happen in sleep it is also about getting those people to not continue to engage in their activity full time are really trying hammer through it you might say well if you have trouble sleeping how you suppose to get deep sleep most of the activity of the lymphatic system this wash out of the debris is occurring during slow wave sleep slow wave sleep as i mention a previous episode is something that happens typically in the early part of the evening even for those of you that are falling or early part of the night rather f your falling a sleep in the waking up three four hours later it is important that you continue to get sleep but know that the slow wave sleep is mainly packed toward the early part of the night that hopefully will a alleviate some of the anxiety about of the three and four am wake up although you really should follow some of the protocols that have suggested in your physicians protocols in order to try and get regular longer sleep of seven eight hours later wore can talk about the eight hour mark is a prerequisite for repair the lymphatic system has been shown to be activated further in two ways one is that sleeping on ones side not on back or stomach seems to increase the amount of wash out or wash through i should say of the lymphatic system there are not a told of date on this but the data that exists are are pretty solid again sleeping on one side or with feet slightly elevated as well has been shown to increase the rate of clearance of some of the debris and that is because the way that the lymphatic system works is it has a physical pressure fluid dynamic to it that allow it to work more more efficiently when one is sleeping on their side or with feet slightly elevated this means not falling asleep in a chair while watching tiki this means if possible not falling asleep on one's back or on ones stomach sleeping on one side and if you cannot do that i do not really to sleep on my side i sleep with my feet so lightly elevate i put at the count of fin pillow under my ankles i do not have t b my but i have had a few concussions before but right now i feel fine but i find that putting the pillow under my ankles helps me sleep much more deeply and i wake up feeling much more refreshed the other thing that has been shown to improve the function of the lymphatic system and this is again is for sake of t b i as well as for every one even without brain injury is a certain form of exercise and i want to be very very clear i will never and i am not suggesting that people exercise in any way that aggravates their injury or that goes against their physicians advice take your physicians advice as to wether not you should be exercising at all and how much and into what intensity however there some interesting data and we can provide a link to the review on this it shows that exercise of what i guess people would nowadays call it zone too cardie which is can low level cardie that one could do while talking to somebody else you could maintain a conversation although you do not have to talk to somebody else is just gives you a sense of the intensity the exercise that zone too cardie for thirty to forty five minutes three times a week seems to improve the rates of clearances of some of the debris after injury and in general injury or know to accelerate and improve that rates a flow for the lymphatic system i find this really interesting because i think nowadays tare such an obsession with high intends to the interval training and people train to pack in as much as they can into us a short work out which is great if it brings people to the table have not been exercising before but i think it is really important that we know that the data on exercise in its relationship to brain health speak to doing thirty to forty five minutes of this kind of what we i do not call low level cardie it could be fast walking it could be jogging if you can do that with your injury safely could be cycling this is not the kind of work out that is design to get your heart rate up to the point where your improving your fitness levels at some sort of a massive rate or taking huge jumps in your via too man or anything that this is exercise i do this o and i know a number of other people especially people in communities where there is a lot of t be ire are now starting to adopt this that the thirty to forty five minutes three times a week or could be more of this zone two type cardie can be very beneficial for wash out of debris from the brain and this is really interesting outside of this because what we know from aging is that aging is a non linear process it is not with every year of life your brain gets a little older it is a has sometimes it follows what is more a step function in get these big jumps in in eight in markers of aging ice s that we could thing of them as jumps down because it is a negative thing for most everybody would to live longer and be healthier in brain and body and the types of exercise ism referring to now are really more about brain longevity and about keeping the brain healthy than they are about physical fitness there is no reason why you could not do this and also provided again it safe for you given your brain state and injury state et camera there is no reason why you could not also combine it with weight training in other forms of cardie i think this is really interesting and i some of you would to know the mechanism or at least the hypothesized mechanism there is a a a molecule called aquapouring for it almost sounds a a the forth in a sequel of movies or something that but am aquaporin for is a molecule that is related to the gleam system clear the means glue and latino these or these cells in the brain the most numerous cells in the brain in fact that in sheathe snaps is but their very dynamic cells they are little ambulant cells they'll what the microgleo will run in and will gather up debris and soak it up and then run out after an injury a aquoporan for mainly express by the glee sell called the atrocity astray looks a star incredibly interesting cells and the the thing to remember is that the atrocities bridge the connection between the neurons the snaps the connections between them and the musculature the blood system and the lymphatic system they cannot sit at the inner face an the imagine somebody on an emergency cite carcrashsite whose directing everybody around as to what to do get that person on a stretcher bandage them up call their mother et camera et camera get this out of the road put down some flares the atrocities can work in that capacity as well as doing somethings more directly this lymphatic system and the gleam atrocity system is the system that we want chronically active throughout the day as much as possible low level walking own to cardie and then at night during slow wave sleep is within really when this lymphatic system kicks in that should hopefully be an action will take away provided that you can do that kind of cardie safely that i believe everybody should be doing who cares about brainlongevity not just people who are trying to get over tebieye now it'd to return a little bit to some of the subjective aspects of pain modulation because i think it interesting and actionable that everyone should know about this and in this case we can also say that regardless of whether not your experiencing pain acute or chronic what ism about to tell you is as close as anything is to proof you knowinsins we rarely talk about proof we talk about evidence in favor or against the hypothesis but as close as possible to proof that our interpretation are subjective interpretation of a century event is immensely powerful for dictating our experience of the e went here a couple examples first of all anyone who is ever done combat sports are martial arts knows that it is incredible how little a punch hurts during a fight and it is incredible how much it hurts after a fight the molecular drennoline when it is liberated into our body truly blunts our experience of pain we all know the stories of people i now walking yo miles on stumped legs of peoples doing all sorts of things that were incredible feats that allow them to move through what would otherwise be pain and afterward they do experience extreme pain but during the event oftentimes they are not experiencing pain and that is because of the pain blunting effects of a drennolin it'll tell you exactly how this works in a few minutes when we talk about acupuncture but nor apineferon binding to particular receptors a adrenaline binding a particular receptors actually shuts down pain pathways people who anticipate an injection of more phone immediately report the feeling of loss of pain their pain starts to diminish because they know they are going to get pain relief and it is a powerful effect now all the erpolicsand placebo effect placebo effects are very real placebo effects and belief effects ass are called have a profound effect on our experience of noxious stimuli pain and they can also have a profound effect on positive stimulant things that we are looking forward to one study that i think is particularly interesting here from mycholligue it stamford than mack they did a borrow imaging study they subjected people to pain in this case it was a a heat pain people have very specific thresholds to heat at which they cannot tolerate any more heat but they explored the extent to which looking at an image of somebody in this case a romantic partner that the person loved would allow them to adjust their pain response and it turns out it does if people are looking at an image or thinking about a person that they love or even a thing that they love a pet that they love studies previous to the one that machine colleagues did showed that their experience of pain was reduce their threshold for pain was higher they could tolerate more pain and they reported as not as painful but there is a twist there which is it turns out that the extent to which love will modulate pain has everything to do with how infatuated an obsessed somebody is with the object of their love people that report thinking about somebody or a pet for many hours of the day kind of having an obsessive nature almost that kind of what pop might call quote quote codependency for those who the listening am just providing air quotes cause coherency is a kind of a clinical thing now though it is thrown around a lot all the time it sort of gas lighting people to about gas lighting all the time now gasping is a real thing but the people talk about gas lighting for many things outside the clinical description if people are are very obsessed with somebody they have a kind of obsessive love of somebodies face even if the other person does not know them which is little weird that response that feeling of love internally can blunt the pain experience to a significant degree these are not small effects it is not just that love can protects us from pain it is that infatuation and obsession can protect us from pain and not surprisingly how early a relationship is how new a relationship is directly correlates with people's ability they showed to use this love this internal representation of love to blunt the pain response for those of you they have been with your partners for many years and you love them very much an eurobsessed with them terrific you have an reinstalled wishes is not reinstalled ya to do the work cause relationships are work but you have got a installed mechanism for blunting pain and again these are not minor effects these are major effects and it is all going to be through that top down modulation they we talked about not unlike the marabou experiments with phantom limb that relieve phantom pain or some other lowdown modulation and the ops examples the nail through the boot which is a visual image that made the person think it was painful when in fact it was painful even though there was no tissue damage it was all perceptual the pain system is really subject to these perceptual influences which is remarkable because really when we think about the somaticensory system it has this connive components got this puerperal component but there's another component which is the way in which our sensation our some adisensory system is woven in with our autonomic nervous system and were gain get to that next but i want to just raise the idea that the reason that this kind of infatuation and obsessive love can blunt the pain response and increase one's threshold for for pain may have to do i would say almost certainly has to do but it has not been measured yet with dopamine release because dopamine is absolutely the molecule that is liberated in our brain and body when there is a new kind of obsession or infatuation it is very distinct from the kind of love chemicals if you will a i do not even calling them love chemicals that just feels weird if this were text i would to let that line but if from the chemicals associated with warmth and connection such as serotonin and oxytocin which tend to be for more stable long lasting relationships dopamine is what dilates the pupils which gets people re excited they cannot stop thinking about some body the text messages are even exciting they right to them and they cannot wait for the texamessers to come back the gotta on the screen the techmeasures excruciating they do not respond for two minutes and people are getting flipped out ism not here to support that kind of whatever what am saying is that that obsessive type of love which without question is going to be associate with the dopamine pathway does seem to have a utility in the contact of reducing the unpleasantness of physical pain and probably has to a lot to do with reducing the unpleasantness of a lot of life sitting in traffic et camera because when we talk about pain emotional pain in physical pain start to become one and the same they are closely intertwine that the lines between them neurally become very blurry what do i mean by that well if love and infatuation can reduce pain presumably through the release of dopamine well then does dopamine release itself blunt plaint pain should we be chasing dopamine release as a way to treat chronic and acute pain and that is exactly what were gone talk about now independent of love we are gong to talk about something quite different which is putting needles and electricity in different parts of the body called acupuncture something that for many people were it is been viewed as a kind of alternative medicine but now there excellent laboratories exploring what is called electroacupuncture and acupuncture these are big university centers in fact my source for everything ism about to tell you next is professor chufa at hazard medical school and his papers i stand behind the information that ism got to provide today but there it is extracted largely from the mama's a papers which are use very rigorous veritable isolating experiments to address just how does something acupuncture work and i think what you will be interested in and surprise to learn is that it does work but sometimes it can exacerbate pain and sometimes it can relieve pain and it all does that through very discreet pathways for which we can really say this noon connects to that nor on connects to the adrenals and we can tie the all back to dopamine because in the end it is the chemicals and nerd circuits that are giving rise to these perception these experiences rather of things that we call pain love et camera in a previous podcast episode i mention my experience of visiting an acupuncturist and getting acupuncture the acupuncture itself did not really do that much for me but i was not there for any specific reason i was gifted to me by somebody and i one to try it ism not passing judgment on acupuncture i in fact i know a number of people that really derive tremendous benefit from acupuncture for pain and for o gastrointestinal issues their actually a lot of really good purereviewed studies supporting the use of acupuncture for in particular g i tract issues in recent years there is been in emphasis on try to understand the mechanism of things acupuncture and acupuncture itself not to support acupuncture or to try to get everybody do acupuncture but as a way to try and understand how these sorts of practices might actually benefit people who are experiencing pain or for changing the nervous system or brainbody relationship in general and shall the national institutes of health in the united states now has a entire subdivision o an an institute within the national institutes of health which is complimentary health and that institute is interested in things acupuncture and a variety of other practices that i think ten fifteen years ago people probably thought were really alternative and may be in counter culture least in the states and it is exciting i think people are starting to really take a look at what is going on under the hood for certain types of treatmentsthat are very useful nothing it is very likely to lead to an expanded number of treatments for a number or different conditions what i want to talk about in terms of acupuncture is the incredible way in which acupuncture illuminates the cross talk between the we data sensory system are ability to feel stuff externally extrareception internally interception and how that we data sensory system is wired in with in communicating with our autonomic nervous system that regulates our levels of alertness or calmness after that ism going to talk about how the acupuncture that is being done right now also points to relief for what is called referred pain this takes us all back to the homunculus let us start there we have hits representation of our body surface in our brain that representation is what we call seat topic and what seat top is is it just means that areas of your body that are near one another your thumb and your forefinger for instance are represented by neurons that are near by each other in the brain now you might say will do but actually did not have to be that way the neurons that represent the tip of my forefinger and the nurses tat represent my thumb on the same hand could have been distantly located and therefore the map of my body surface the oculus would be really disorder but it is not that way its very ordered its very smooth as let us ay you were to image my brain if you are to stimulate my finger my forefinger and then march that stimulation across my finger across the palm and to the near by thumb you would see that neurons in the brain would also make a sort of jay shape in their pattern of activation that means there called sematatopy but the connections from those brain neurons are sent into the body and they are synchronized with meaning they crossfire with an and form synapses with some of the input from the viscera from are got from our diaphragm from or r stomach from our spleen from or heart are internal organs are sending information up to this map in our brain of the body surface but it is about internal information what we call interception our ability look inside or imagine inside and feel what were feeling inside the way to think about this accurately is that our representation of ourself is a representation of our internal workings our viscera a got everything inside our skin and the surface of our skin and the external world what we are seeing those three things are always being combined in a very interesting complex but very seamless way acupuncture involves taking needles and sometimes electricity and or heat as well and stimulating particular locations on the body and through these maps of stimulation that have been developed over thousands of years mostly in aria but now this is a practice its being done many places throughout the world they have these maps that speak to oh well if you stimulate this part of the body you get this response and if somebody has a gasterontestonal issue like their there guts are moving too quick they have diarrhea you stimulate this area no slow there got motility down or if their got motility is too slow there constipate you stimulate some place else in accelerates it and ye hearing by this of it sounds kind of to a westerner who not thinking about the underlying curl circuitry it could sound kind a wacky it really sounds alternative or even kind of really out there kind of stuff but when you look at the curl circuitry the anatomy it really starts to make sense in chufuma's lab at hazard medical school s excellent laboratory has been exploring how stimulation of different types intense or weak with heat or without heat on different parts of the body can modulate pain and inflammation and what they have shown in a particularly exciting study is that stimulation of the abdomen anywhere on the the midsection weakly does nothing wit is not very interesting you might say intense stimulation of the abdomen however with this electracupuncture has a very strong effect of increasing inflammation in the body and this is important t understand because it is not just that stimulating that the gut does this because your activating the gut area it activates a particular nerve pathway for the ofpycionatas it is the splenic spinal sympathetic axis if you really want to note and it is pro inflammatory undermost conditions however their other conditions where if for instance the person is dealing with a particular bacterial infection that can be beneficial and this goes back to a much earlier discussion that we had on a previous podcast that will revisit again and again which is that the stresserous b its was designed to combat infection it turns out that there are certain patterns of stimulation on the abdomen that can actually liberate a mine cells from our mine organs our spleen encounter infection through the release of things a renal chef's lab also showed that stimulation of the feet and hands can reduce inflammation and again this was done mechanistically this was done by blocking certain pathways with the appropriate control experiments this was done not in any kind of of subjective way this was also done by measuring particular molecules isle six and cidokinds and things that are related to the inflammation response and what they showed is that the stimulation of the is in particular the hind limbs at lo intensity led to increases in the activity this vagal pathway the vaguest nerve being the tenth cranial nerves that serves the kind of rest an digest and parts empathetic in motherworts calming response what this means is that we are now at the front edge of this research field that is doit is early days still but it is discovering that depenningawethere not the the stimulation is intense or mild and depending on where the stimulation is done on the body you can get very different effects this points the idea that you cannot say act puncture good or acupuncture bad there has to be a systematic understanding of what exactly the effect is that you are trying to achieve and the the underlying basis for this is really relevant to the thing about a adrenalin than i said before that in a fight it is rare that you ever feel pain when you get hit of experience that but later it hurts a lot it turns out that when you stimulate these pathways that activate in particular the adrenals the arena gland liberates norapineferan an epineferan and the brain does as well it binds to what are called the bad noradernergic receptors as is really getting until down into the weeds but the bad noragernergic receptors activate the spleen which liberate cells that combat infection and its anti inflammatory that is the short term quick response the more intense stimulation of the abdomen and other areas can be pro inflammatory because of the ways that they trigger certain loops that go back to the brain and trigger the sort of anxiety pathways and that place people into a state of anxiety that exacerbates pain one pathway stimulates norupaneferan in blunts plain the other one does not what does all this mean how we sup pas to put all this together when there is a paper that was publish in nature medicine and twenty fourteen the excellent journal that describes how dopamine can activate the vagus periferaly in the not nope in the brain periferaly and nor norpineferan can activate the vagus peril really am reduce inflammation and ism not trying to throw a tonifacts at sat omit was to do with all this information what this mean means is that there are real maps of our body surface that when stimulated communicate with our autonomic nervous system the system that controls alertness are calmness and thereby releases either molecules nor up an efferent in dopamine which make us more alert as we would be in a fight and blunt are response to pain and they reduce inflammation but there are yet other pathways that when stimulated our proinflammatory and that brings us to the question is what is all this in inflammation stuff the people are talking about one of the things that bothers me much these days and ism not easily irritated but what really bothers me as one people a talking bout inflammation inflammation is bad inflammation is terrific inflammation is the reason why cells are called to the sight of injury to clear it out inflammation is what is going to allow you to heal from any injury chronic inflammation is bad but a cute inflammation is absolutely essential remember those kids that we talked about earlier that have mutations in these receptors that for sensing pain they never get inflammation and that is why there joints literally disintegrate it is really horrible because they do not actually have the inflammation response because it was never triggered by the pain response inflammation can be very beneficial there is a lot of interest nowadays in taking things in doing things to limit inflammation one of the ones that comes up a lot as numeric ism surer the moment any one starts tucking about inflammation the question is what about numeric i have talked before about numeric elsewhere i am very skeptical of numeric and i i might lose a few friends although i be weird if my friend it would say something about my friendships if i lost friends over a discussion about numeric but in any case numeric does have antiimflammatory properties there is no question about that but as we have just described inflammation con be a very good thing at least in the short term the other thing about numeric is there was a study publish out of stamford in collection with some work from other universities showing that a lot of numeric is heavily contaminated with lead the lead is used to get that really rich dense orange coloring to it am that everyone wants to see you have to check your sources of numeric the other thing is for men in particular numeric can be very antagonistic to dihydrtestostrone de hydrotestostrona is theme more dominant form of androgen in human males and it is involved in things aggression and libido and things of that sort many people that have talked to who have taken numeric get a severe blunting of affect and libido for some people that might be a serious negative i certainly avoid numeric i do not numeric am for that reason i also think that the inflammation response is a healthy response you have to keep it in check and weeping to talk about specific practices for wound healing and injury in a moment but this idea that just inflammation is bad in you want to reduce inflammation across the board nothing can be further from the truth we have pathways that exist in our body specifically to increase inflammation it is the inflammation that goes unchecked just stress which is problematic for prepare from rain injury and that can exacerbate certain forms of diminish et camera but it'd to create a little bit more wants or a lot more haunts if possible in the conversation around inflammation because people have just taken intis discussion round inflammation to be this idea that just inflammation is bad and nothing can be further from the truth before i continue i just thought it'd answer a question that i get a lot a which is what about wimhoff breathing i get asked about this a lot wimhoff a also call tea the ice men a has is breathing that similar to a tumor breathing as i was originally called finals easily hyper ventilating and then doing some exhales on some breath holds o couple things about that it should never be done near water a people who have done it near water unfortunately have drowned it is not certainly not for everybody a and me not here to either promote it nor discourage people from doing it but i think we should ask ourselves what is the net effect of that because a number people have asked me about it in a in relation to pain management the effect of doing that kind of breathing it is not a mysterious effect it liberates a adrenaline from the adrenals there is a paper publish in the problems in the national academy of sciences which are very fine journal showing that that breathing pattern can counter infection from endotoxin and that is because when you have a adrenaline in your system and when the spleen is very active that response is used to counter infection and stress counters infection talk about what this more going forward but the idea that stress lends itself to infection is false stress counters infection by liberating killer cells in the body you do not want the stress response to stay on indefinitely however things wimhoff breathing ice was anything that releases in adrenaline will counter the infection but you want a regulate the duration of that of adrenalin response this should make perfect sense we as a species had to evolve under conditions of famine and cold actuaytecus right now is an extreme case of cold and power outer have seen the pictures and their lot of people out their really suffering their systems are releasing a ton of a adrenaline their cold some of them are likely to be hungry they probably stressed their releasing a lot of a adrenaline which is keeping them safe from infection after they get their heat back on and they relax and they can finally warm up again which we would for them very soon hole by tome this ponces comes out that will have already happened that is typically when people gets sick because the immune response is blunted as the stress response starts o subside stress inflammation countering infection that comes from endotoxin that comes s from any number things can be from cold at can be from hyper mental action it can be from a physical threat it can be from the stress of an exine or an upcoming surgery it is ta grenadine thing and the inflammation associated with it is adaptive highly adaptive it is a short term plasticity that is designed to make us better for what we are experiencing and challenged with not worse and hopefully that will add an additional lay to this whole idea that ounostresses bad inflammation as bad et camera again ism not suggesting people do or do not do something whimhoff tomb breathing i just one appoint to the utility it is very similar to the utility from cold showers ice bad and other forms of anything that increase a adrenalin every episode i want to make sure that every listener comes away with as much knowledge as possible but also actionable tools and today we talked about a variety of tools but i want a enter in on a particular sequence of tools that hopefully you will not need but presumably if your human being in your active you will need at some point it is about managing injury and recovering and healing fast or at least as fast as possible it includes removing the pain it includes getting mobility back and getting back to a normal life whatever that means for you i one emphasis that what ism about to talk about next was developed in close consultation with kelly starred who many of you probably have heard of before kelly can be found at the ready state he is a formally train degrees and educated exercise physiologist he is a world expert in movement intis rehabilitation et camera the are not sponsors of the podcast kelly is a friend and a colleague he somebody that i personally trust and his views on tissue rehabilitation and injury i think i really grounded extremely well in both medicine physiology and the real cutting edge of what is new and what you might not get in terms of advice from the typical person all that said you always always always should consult with your physician before adopting any protocols or removing any protocols i asked kelly i made it really simple i said o we let say i were to sprain my ankle or break my arm or injure my near facial tear or something that or shoulder injury what are the absolute necessary things to do regardless of situation and i and what science is this grounded and and then i made it a point to go fine the studies that either supported or refuted what he was telling me because that is what am here the first one is a very basic one that now you have a lot of information to act on which is in terms of what we know about tissue rehabilitation both brain and body we know that sleep is essential and we both agreed at that eight hours minimomen bed per night is critical not wall was interesting however is that it does not have to be eight hours of sleep we acknowledge that some of that time might be challenging to get the sleep especially if one is in pain or mobility is limited we forget how often we roll over in bed or how the the the conditions of our of our sleeping can impact those injuries too tell acknowledged and i agree that eight hours of sleep would be ideal but if not at least eight hours in mobile and that speaks to the power of these non sleep deep breast protocols too if you cannot sleep doing non sleep deepest protocols we provide line to them before were going continue to bride links to the previous ones and new ones are coming soon that is extremely beneficial that is a non negotiable in terms of getting the foundation for allowing for lymphatic clearance and tissue clearance et camera the other is if possible unless it is absolutely excruciating when you just cannot do it a ten minute walk per day of course you soft want exacerbate the injury at least a ten minute walk per day and probably longer this is where it gets interesting i was taught i learn that when you injure yourself your spot the ice something you s was but ice on it but didn't realize this but when speaking to exercise physiologists and some physicians they said that the ice is really more of a placebo it numbs the the environment of the injury which is not surprising and will eliminate the pain for a short while but it has some negative effects that perhaps offset its use one its sludge it create slugging within the blood and other lymphatic tissues tactual can creates some clouding and slugging of the of the tissue and fluids the fascia the fashion interface with muscle and a number of the stuff this must be flowing through there can slow up and increase inflammation in the wrong way conceptually restrict movement out of the the a injury sight which is bad because you want the macrophages and the other sellotapes fatfagosetosin eating up the debris an and injury and moving it out of there that it can repair that was surprising to me which it made me stable than what about heat while turns out heat is actually quite beneficial lot of people toke about heat shock prolines and all these genetic pathways and praying pathways that can be activated by heat very little data to support the idea that heat shock prolines are part of the wound healing process at least in terms of the sorts of conventional heat that one could use a hot water bottle or a hot bath or a hot compress the major effect seem to be explained by heat improving the viscosity of the tissues and the clearance and the profusion of of fluid blood limp and other fluids out of the injuryarea s that is really interesting i did not know this i thought well uses to ice something as it whenever i would see it could get injured in soccer never me of course now of course i got injure and sokarantin't in thy give you an ice pack and the ice pack remove some of the pain i think on the consensus now which was surprising to me is that the he ice pack is actually more of the top down modulation you think your doing something for the pain there some interesting studies that is sound show the placebo effect of the ice back ice backs are placebo perhaps that is interesting it'll underline perhaps because who knows may be there some people out there they essay a this is told crazy and the ice is actually very beneficial what seems heat mobility sleep keeping movement and it turns out that the movement itself can act as a bit of an analgesic it can actually reduce the pain whereas the ice reduces the pain but sledges the tissue and keeps the sells that need to be removed from leaving the area now what is also interesting is in negro science we know that if we want a kill neurons or silence neurons we cool them is is a well known tool in the laboratory some of the early and most important studies and hero science that form the basis for the text books where lowering a cooling probe into a particular area the brain or a puerperal nerve in order to shut down that nerve the cooling will shut down the nerve but an other very well known fact in neuroscience textbooks is that when the activity of the nerve pathway or neurons comes back there is what is called homeostatic plasticity that it rebounds with greater pain with a higher level of intense which in the pain system would acquire to greater pain regardless of where these neurons are in the body if you stimulate a neuron it is active if you cool it it becomes inactive and when the neuron heats back up after being cooled it becomes viper active and this makes really good sense as to why heat provided it is not damaging levels of heat would be more beneficial for wound healing and for reducing pain in the short and long run then would be cold or ice which i find very interesting now interns of chronic pain the manuscripts on this my discussion with helium with others point to the fact that chronic pain is basically plasticity gone wrong it is sort of peatiest for the emotional system in the stress system and chronic pain is going to involve a number of different protocols to rewire both the brain centers and the peripheral centers associate with chronic pain certain things fibromialga for instance which is whole body pain relate to too little inanition in the brain you have excitation and inhibition they come from different sources anurans the inhibition is mainly from gala and glycine and things that in fibromyalga there is too little central within the brain modulation of the pain response to that people experience whole body pain in that case the emerging therapies are really interesting eye of a friend who works for the natural institutes of health who unfortunately suffers from fiber mile jo asked me about the ballot and his question and what he is now actually exploring is red light therapy something that have talked about on serious instegrandpost red light therapy typically is talked about in terms of mite c anuria and the date on that are not terrific least not really published in blue ribbon journals in most cases except for one study that ism aware of from glad jeffrey's lab at universe college onion showing that red light stimulation to the eyes in people forty or older can offset some of the effects of macula degeneration by improving the health of the photo receptors people with fiber miasma which is this whole body pain are now starting to use red light therapies and i asked kelly and others and some experts in pain what what are your thoughts on this red light therapy for things fire myalgia pain especially red light local therapy their idea and i do not think this is a a of feel that is progress far enough now to really place any confirm conclusions on but the ideas that red light therapy locally may have some effect but the systemic red light therapy this is wearing y on protection to the eyes in some cases not from the treatment of macula degeneration but wearing protection the eyes and getting very bright light a reed light therapy in many ways may be in to usekelly's words approximating the effects of nature these are surrogate technologies for getting outside in the sunshine you known you are in the sun it might not look red but there r lot of red wave lings coming toward you the red light therapies may have some utility but getting into sunlight may actually have as much or more effect of course if these wounds are on a part of the body that you cannot expose then you can imagine why the red light therapy might be good depending the neighborhood you live in the maybe may not be a weird thing to go outside and expose your body to sunlight pry number of factors that dictate with an aunty heard or not but that is up to you not me and it seems that movement heat not ice light sleep and in some cases the use and ill talk about this in a moment that some cases the use of of restricting above and below the injury to then release and then increase profusion through the sight may actually accelerate the wound healing all of this might sound just common sense knowledge but t to me at least as of forty five year old i always just thought its ice its nonstelroyd anti inflammatory drugs it is things that brock block postal landmass to things aspirin i beprophin a see to manikin those things generally work by blocking things the the they are called a cop the cocks of prostaglandan blockers and things that sort things in that pathway those sorts of treatments which reduce inflammation may not be great at the beginning when you want inflammation they may be important for limiting pains people can be functional at all but the things that i talked about to day really are anchored in three principles one is that the inflammation response is a good one this is what we are learning from chufas labs work on acupuncture the immediate acute inflammation response is good it call to the to the sight of injury things that are going to clean up the injury in bats cells then there are going to be things that are improve profusion the lymphatic system getting deep sleep we elevated sleeping on one side low levels own to cardie three times a week red light perhaps is going to be useful though sunlight might be just as good depending on who you talk to we talk about that probably more at length in a future episode a number of people will ask me insure about stem cells and i do not want a a take more of your time by you on going into an hour long discussion about stemsell stemcells exist in all of us during development we were created from stemcells which are sells that can become essentially anything later cells get what is called restricted in their lineage a skin cell unless you do some fancy molecular gymnastics to it you cannot actually turn that cell into a neuron a yamanoca on the hobo prize for finding these yamanoca factors which you could give a skin cell the turn into a neuron but that is not in approved therapy at this time but many people ask me about platelet rich plasma called p r pa they take blood they enrich for platelets and they reinfect it back into people here is the deal this deserves an entire episode it has never been shown whether or not the injection it self is what is actually creating the effect this is something that the acupuncture literature suffered from for a long time that the sham control as it is called a sham we do not mean it is a sham but in since you say a sham control men you do everything that exactly the same way you would for acupuncture you would bring the needle right up to the skin but you wouljectually poke it into the skin for instance that be a sham control with a drug treatment you would a inject a drug into a person and then the control the sham control would be that you would bring the injection over you might do the injection or not do the injection cause imagine that the injection it self could have an effect it is never really been shown whether not p r p has effects that are separate from injecting a volume of fluid into a tissue the claims that p r p actually contain stem cells are very very feeble and when you look at the literature and you talk to any one expert in the stemcell field they will tell you that it is the number of stemcells in pimp is infinitesimally small in fact much that a these places that inject p r p for injuries are not allowed to advertise through the use of the words stemcells is action be legal at this point least as far as i know it was through the end of last year and ism messing it still is now stemsells are an exciting are of technology however there is a clinic down in florid though it shut down a couple o years ago for injecting stemcells harvested from patience into the eye from alula degeneration these were people that were suffering from o poor vision and very shortly after injecting o these stemsells into the eyes they went completely blind ism somebody who is very a skeptical of the stemcell treatment work that is out there it is actually very hard to get in the united states for this reason it is not approved the pop treatments are very complicated the marketing around them is om shaky a at best ism sure a number of people say that they had part an benefited from it tremendously and i do not doubt that whether not it was placebo to day we talked a lot about top down control that is just a dim variant on the word placebo belief effects whether not it was placebo or not i do not know i was not there that is for you to decide and ism not here to tell you that you should or should not do something but i do think that anything involving stemcells one should be very cautious of you shall be very cautious of any one that tells you that pimp is injecting a lot of stemcells this is an involving area that really needs a lot more work and attention the major issue with stemsells that i think its concerning is that stemcells a cells that want to become lots of different things not just the tissue that your interested inside you damage your knee and you you inject stemsells into your knee you need to molecturaly restrict those stemsells that they do not become tumor sells i a tumor is a collection of stemsells is when you get you something horrible glee blastema in the brain which is e terrible thing to have it is glee cells that returned to stones excessive stems they are produce too many of themselves and glue blastema is often deadly not always injecting stemsells hat sounds great and it sounds something that one would want to do but one needs to approach this with extreme caution even if it is your own blood or stemcells that your reinfecting i think those technologies are coming there on the way om if any of you are om devote of part tell me your experiences with them ism curious i want to see the papers i want to know the evidence and of course there always folks out there that say i do not care what the scientists and the o physicians in the it e say i just want to do this and if that is your same that is your stance ism not here to govern that am but i do think that people should be informed and in thinking about tissue recovery an injury u that is what i was able to glean again check out what kelly and a his to workers are doing at the ready state it is phenomenal and they have worked with all the top people in just about every domain of life it seems very high integrity folks some of you are probably saying will ism not injured ism not an athlete i soft want stemsell injections i do not have a again i sang you should not get stemsell injections for now o please hold off until the field learns more about how to do that safely but i want ta talk about an end with a really interesting and somewhat weird technology which is baby blood i have a colleague at stemford his name is tony wise's query and in twenty fourteen his laboratory published o study showing that the blood of young rodents mice in rats when transfused into old demented rodents misonrats made those old demented rodents recover much of their memory and seem much more vital and energetic better recall of different spacial learning tasks tissue and wound healing they have since shown can be improved in these older animals it is pretty incredible they went on to show several years later that blood from umbilical cords not making this up blood from umbilical cords can do the same and this is the basis of about at company i should one of my former post ones a now employ there they have isolated the molecules from young blood that seems to vitalize or revitalize the old brain and body and one of those molecules has goes by the name timeout i m p to where is all this going well i do not know how long it is going to be before their treatments based on these blood transfusions i doubt that blood transfusions themselves from young people into old people is going to be used for the treatment of dimension although it might as weird as it seems we know that transfusions of all sorts of stuff for instance people transplants are being used to treat obesity the up microfilm of fin people is being grand not transfused but is being transplanted into the clans and guts of beast people and leading to weight loss which sounds really wild and is not a topic i particularly enjoy talking about but none the less it points to the importance of the gupmicrobiom in regulating things blood sugar and health as it relates to obesity and diabetes and all sorts of things it does appear that there are things factors in the blood of young members of a given species that are lost over time in the older members of the of that species i am not going to give you a tool on the basis of these findings to day i am not gin to tell you to consume any a fluid from any other member of a your species on our species a for any reason but i do think that its important to mention that the science is asking questions such as what are the factors within the brain that allow the young brain to recover much better then the older brain from injury from all sorts of things events et camera and what are the factors in the older brain that are limiting and thinking about identifying which factors are going to allow people to restore count function physical function wound healing and f worth it is really exciting area i mention it i not to be sensationless but because it is happening and because there is a lot of excitement about it and because i think it is clearer that the young brain and body and blood are very different from the old brain body and blood and the goal of sciences to identify an isolate those factors that make that such that people who would otherwise get to bench or perhaps even have to bench will be allowed to recover again not actionable i tam at this point but one to think about perhaps not too long but one to think about some one at close there have talked about a lot of tools to day have talked a lot about some at a sensation about plasticity about pain about acupuncture some of the new ants of acupuncture inflammation stress even talked a little it about high intensity breathing talked about restricting limb movement to get compensatory regrowth of pathways or i should say reactivation of pathways that have been injured or damaged as always we take kind of a whirlwind tour through a given topic lay down some tools as we go hopefully the principles that relate to pain and injury but also curl plasticity in general today in the contacts of the symaticensury system will be of use to all of you i do not wish injury on any of you but i do hope that you will take this information to mind and that you will think about it if ever you find yourself in a situation where you have to ask what is the difference between my perception and the actual tissue damages injury and pain is at the same well know it do i have some control over my experience of pain absolutely does all of that involve taking drugs are doing certain therapeutics know not necessarily there is incredible subjective component there are also i is a need sometimes to treat the injury at the level of the pain receptors a at the sit of the wound please take the information do with it what you will and in the meantime thank you much for your time and

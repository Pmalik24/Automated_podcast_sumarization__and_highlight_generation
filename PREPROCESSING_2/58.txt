h benchpirshreesponser baexxpressvepian protect or online privacy today expression piantacan flashes the is a famous comic from twenty fourteen during the last major war between israel and comas it was done by cartoonist a f branch and it depicts then secretary of state john carry sitting between is rally prime minister benjamin at tinamou and a member of comas the comas derris has a baby strap to him with dynamite and he is holding a paper reading demands death to all news carry is asking mitinahu could you least meet him half way the more things changed the more they stay the same this weekend represent of promilitiapol chair of the congressional progressive caucus appeared oncianen when show asked about why there has not been more international outrage over comes systematic rape of his rally women the accounts of compass rapes have ben legion over the week end thirty nine yearly join salon told the case sundae times that he saw at the nova festival a beautiful woman quote and eight or ten of fighters beating and raping her she was screaming stop it already it's going to die any way from what you are doing just kill when they finish said senor they were laughing last one shooter in the head here is giapal's response rapid terrific sexual salts horrific i think that it hopping in war situations terrorist organizations compass obviously are using these as tools however i think we half to be baseless about bringing in the outrages against palistinians fifteen thousand palistinians have been killed and is rally air strikes three quarters of woman its far women and chant horrible but r on teisraily salter raping whotdanna i think why we are not we are not i do not want this to me the hierarchy of oppression that is hysterical for the first time promise gipon now opposes a hierarchy of oppression balance you see is the key balance in all things never mind the new reports emerging from hostages about just what they experienced in gosh at the hands of comas according to the daily mail quote for weeks they were starved beaten drugged branded made to watch footage of comas terrorist invading their home land with weapons pointed to their heads until the moment was rite for the teragroup one hostage was operated on by a veterinarian many of the hostages were kept with supposed civilians in the gosipstrip giving the lie to the hard and fast distinction between goes class members and the civilian population but still why cant the s rallies meet their new hating terrorist enemies half way increasingly this seems to be the lock of the bison white house although to be clear they are not actually asking israel to me the palsinians half way thartually asking them to meet them about eighty per cent of the way as israel offensive against compass renews in southern gossip the white house has now racketed up it is absurd and continuous demands for israel to do a quote better job protecting civilians as though israel is in the business of murdering civilians the same way comas is for as though israel is not already taking in sane precautions to avoid the killing of civilians israel is actually taking more precautions to avoid civilian ruths than any army in modern history is ronzermer is really minister of strategic affairs pointed out over the week and we saw that nice director their on tomsufi burgers pe than we heard pethiceloido say that fact continues this could be not only humanicary dis auto re startantic calamity for israel your trespass listen we are doing everything we can to keep civilians at has where want the america people to understand is dishes not going on thousands of makes away it is going on literally hundreds of the yards away in its going out an a time when rockets are flying into our country we have people running to ban shelters i think wit these rally army has done in inprosetuting this swore the undress dene in the history of boys there when you have not enemy right on your border i a you doing everything to get the civilians of that enemy out of ones way i do not think any other country including the united states hat an if you ever face the situation this would take such great care yet defend secretary laid often spent the week and warning theseraelies that the government risks quote strategic defeat in gaze even if they wen a quote tactical victory because palisinians he said might be driven into the arms of the enemy this naturally create to catch twenty too israel cannot get rid of comas without civilians dying specifically because camps once its own civilians to die if israel does get rid of commas and civilians die by caustic's logic israel then suffer strategic defeat and if israel does not get rid of comas israel will suffer in actual defeat this is call they no wind scenario and yet the white house seems eager to provide israel with no wind scenarios lately thus the bide administration is reportedly encouraging israel to restore humanitarian aid into gaze at the same levels as they did during the recent seas fire that is political idiocy first off it removes all in centime for compass to come back to the table if the aid is something compass wont since they steal it giving them the aid welcomes continues to hold hostages is ridiculous second israel is currently at war the fuel you us once shipped intogaza goes largely to comas then of course the media lie about all this leading to awkward exchanges this one between a sky news reporter and a spokes person for the idea you will telling people when is can be taken to next people do not have power to power to at metal finvamgal i fa well i don'know i me i think you and all f your viewers saw our hostages being paraded through the streets as they e released the israel over those seven nights and hundred of gods sends holding their phones o viewing them clearly there is enough power to power their phones when we are their parading our hostages throughout gaze now that saint power to their phones will be to get them mouth dow them mouth look at the fliers and don't forget were not like the no an unsavory we are out of to the recorder humiliated ism sorry we we were done here yes it turns out there is electricity which is how all of the terra and their friends are powering their selfness then there is the no one scenario being press ford by the white house for after come falls

arab world thinks much wood boss is a joke because he is and dor the people he rules over by the way if elections were actually held in the west bank today camps would likely win all of this is silly nonsense and the white house not it is silly nonsense in fact because the radical muslin world perceives the white house's weakness they are pushing and they're pushing hard according to the

all these attacks are happening that is the rout by which ten per cent of all local trade passes attacking the of navy's erectly is absolutely insane unless you think the united states is we why worth the terrorists do that well maybe because they think the united states is we and maybe they think that because the democratic parties was is showing sympathy for terrorism there is no other way to put this the latest galloppole shows fifty per cent of america approve of israel military action in gaze with forty five per cent disapproving heavy partisan break down in this pole seventy one per cent

histories according to jewfish inside are one of the leaders wen hogan smiley was forced to step down as the local head of the council on america ironic relations for legend domestic abuse in sexual mist conduct he calls israel quote pianists iris several of the leaders of this rally support october seventh this is the kind of action that terrorist are looking four they believe that if they greet enough trouble well get america thinking twice about supporting israel in the first place this is the tactic and it is nothing new of course goes all the way back to the era oil en bag of nineteen seventy three it was also osombon laden strategy in the nineteen nineties he believe that america was ay quote paper tiger and after a few blows ran in to feet according to an interview he did in nineteen ninety eight quote been laden believes that whale we consider to be terrors is just the amount of violence required to get the attention of the america people his aim is to get america to consider whether continued support of israel is worth the bloodshed he promises the laden told the interview quote we tell the america is people and till the mothers of soldiers and america mothers in general that if they value their lives and the lives of their children to find a nationalistic government that will look after their interest and not the interests of the news this tactic seems to be working at least with members of the political left in the democratic party that is why members of the progress of qualms have to down play the mass rape of women because they would to cave in precisely the way commons and the shoot the tavern wish them to cave in but they do not really on to lose all moral credibility instead they manage sort of condemn ray but they have to make sure to

that is caving to it and a agreeing with it well you out say far their being successful over the weaken are not knifemen in parts killed a german tourist and wounded a written he said yeas mode of it'd by the warn gossip according to the you ki telegraph these suspect is twenty six his a kin evicted terrorist with a history of psychiatric problems which am makes you wonder why is he out on the streets of parts why is it that rope is damned stupid hoe re portably shouted wait fir way for it a'llhoakpar i know it was that's a hard one before being arrested near the fitful tower on sturdy they dead later emerged of police officers approaching the suspect he is a french born national to cranial parents with stun guns at drawn he shouted he was wearing explosives and was also ready to die he claim that france was an accomplice to muscles being killed in goa he is said what we do not forget your crimes against muscles especially women children we will fight you and kill you until last day of judgment apparently this meant that he was going to a attack a german couple with a knife that that is it that i g you ask yourself why wouldthey do that right it me sure they hate news but why they attacking random german tourist in the answer is to scare the hell out of you that is the whole point of terrorism the whole point of terrors m is to scare you into doing what they want that is the whole idea here and that sort of tactics now being applied pretty much everywhere in philadelphia last night con uncial protestors socidedythey are in a threaten a pailful shop in philadelphia what a this philomel shop to is the pivotal shop involved in making his daily form policy apparently corn's protestors it is why because it is daily owned s they literally gathered outside this willful shop to threaten the owner of a philafal shop in philadelphia i mean let me think i there another population in history that threaten jewfish business owners for the crime of being jewfish hart oh ya my i did not see that one coming and indicates very go these these are the protestors threaten a pailful shop in philadelphia for world piece of course they are shouting gold gold ta you can hie we charged with genocide golddhes is the name of the pailful shop by the way the amount of projection here is just astonishing he is are people who would love to see every new wiped off the face of the earth which is why they are attacking a jewfish pailful shop in philadelphia and they certainly they want eversion the madeleace killed they they want the people gone and and yet they are the one's charging everybody else with genocide it is at the the amount of projection is always insane from the antisemite meanwhile over in columbous circle you had protesters who decided the it was a great time to go hoping la they decided to break into shops or a run rough she through columbous circle then now reach ta columbous circle and they are going to a run into columbous circle an basically a run roughshod through the shops i gain what is the got of this the got is to intimidate the goal is to suggest that the only way to stop there bad action is to give in to their demands in the using away pas security security doing a making shop also wildly understand right there m excellent stuff happening all over the country in this has it is predictable effects which is the intimidation very often succeeds for example over in williamsburg virgin every year they have a in official minor lighting again it is that time a year this week conical starts conical is a is in the hush calender to more minor holiday but in america to obviously become a big holiday because instructs to position to christmenisin being part of the season and all of this sort of thing wit that said it is very common across the country for people to hold conical manor lighting ceremonies the event organize a cancelled it why because apparently the manor lighting which was schedule for the second sundaes art and music festival on remember tenth in williamsburg said that it did not want to appears to choose sides in the israel comose conflict now you want said yours of weight why what is lighting up minor have to do it the israel mass conflict in the answer is nothing but again the idea is that if you even light a minor you are choosing sides which by the way actually as kind of honest because let us be real that is what one side wants every one who would high to mora they want dead or expelled that is the goal the put the event organizer claim ta conical celebration with send a message the festival was quote supporting the killing bombing of thousands of men women and children anadem they even went further they offer to reinstate the event if the event called for a sense fire you our the political priors of the people who are antipyretic then they will allow you to do what a that they will allow you to let you minor which by the way it is a rather counter to the to is basically the the conical story all over again the conical story is about the green spastically saying to the news they cannot to minor and the house then leading a mass of resold to stop them from impinging on their religious freedom but this kind of cowardice it is becoming common all over the united states it it is certainly happening sonar compass will get to that in just one second

on college compasses is continuing a pace the columbine school of social work is holding a teach this week thacposter for this thing is insane again this the colombia school of social work apparently the poster shows a chain that is being broken by a love flower being fired from abaca forty seven ism not getting and a bird of peace quote significance of the october seventh palistinian counter offensive teaching and discussion now you might think what what code that counterofensi be oh y out the was the mast slaughter and reap of hundreds of people a thousand two hundred people killed two forty taken hostage that is the count a offensive and here holding a teaching at colombia school of social work s that is exciting stuff meanwhile colonel students according to mediate protesting against israel and the universities involvement with companies that due business with israel occupy ta campus building on fridge holding signs condemning the war in gaze chancing from the revers to the sea palestine will be free which of coursing genisidleslogan and holding a much trial of the university president won marthopolic for quote complicity in genocide student with the cornel collision from mutual liberation against to the interjectional coalition organized the protest which join many other student demonstrations against israel with other groups on campus students for justice in palestine which of course is a radical front group the groups first helodyan on thirsting campus they advertised the event as a quit occupation and then leading up to a much trial and then finally handed up occupying school buildings they disrupted studying they prompted complaints to the dean they liberty a list of demands that included that the university take a strong sense against stand against quotdoxing of students doing they mean if if you take part in a protesting you show your face that s from of doing nobly sending their home addresses is ow doing to point out that a person participated nine protest the group demanded the university divest from israel and declared the school is implicated in breaches of international law and then they held a trial of the president of the university in counter guilty of genocide and a partied why because cornel hostile to engineering aerospace and other ten companies they be very difficult by the way to divest from the palistinians because there are no businesses that that actually succeed from those particular areas mainly because eyre run by corrupt corrupt grass of that all went particularly well the administration maned of meeting with them probably the administration wall and opcavingsto them because this is what these administrations do that is exactly would happen over a brown university on money night last the brown university presiding christian pain spoke i individual honoring a palisinian student had been wounded in shouting in sermon and then mum the the president was t interrupted by protestors calling for the university to devest from israel of course now it is amazing is that the university published the speech as written on website that is not have speech was delivered according to the version on website choose to pose to say quote at a faculty meeting last month i said that every student faculty in staff member should be able to proudly were a start avid or dona came on the brown campus or to cover their head with the heeshoboryamica but after the procomau students began heckling her that line change to quote every student faculty and staffmember should be able to proudly dona came on the brown campus or to cover their head with the he shop i there goes the starve avid and the keep up and the mixup yup having to a all the worst people again that that is what the left us they cave to all the worst people and and youknow knows that is america enemies they know this to cross the board this by the way is why again all overly is it that i feels the world's on fire because when the world america enemies since weakness in the white house they take advantage of this this would also be presumably why even isualaw is now threatening to invade one of its neighbors according to yahoo news even sullen electoral authorities on sundae claims that ninety five per cent of voters in a non binding rough random a proved of the nations territorial claim on a huge chunk of neighboring oil rich guyana that by the way that sounds an amazingly free in fairest in a socialist tyranny when ninety five per cent of people prove well that is ut that that is when my favorite things by the way about these tyrants is that they will hold the elections in an attempt to show that there in factor turned and then they will stack the result much that is ninety five to fives the guys in hide the gallic hide the ball little bit says sixty five thirty five or something but know it is ninety five to five that they should go in crushguiana and steal all of its oil maduro who is the corrupt tyrant of veniswuala hailed what he called quote an overwhelming victory for the yes throat vennizuala quote we have taken the first steps to anew his stoic stage in the struggle for what belongs to us to recover what the liberators left us the rough run am naturally raised fears in guyana and around the region about veniswalis ultimate intentions over the contested territory maduro hopes the outcome of the referenimals strengthen his nations century old claim to the oil rich was a keep territory governed by guyana the defenceminister of laden pairings a quote to day is ta day of ratification of national sovereignty the people have done it with flying at colors about ten point five million votes were cast according to the president of the national pectoral council of his amoroso but the tally start confusion because in opposition politician suggested that each vote or cast total of five votes one reach question on the referendum related to venisuala's claim apparently was two two million people who turned out the mature government said it was not seeking justification to invade or annex the huge territory but of course the whole point is a threat the whole point is the great any when they are saying basically is sure we might invadehim he we have an absolutely good claim to the territory of our neighbor we should just it maybe we will grab or maybe you will sign us a bribe is the same sort of stick that am think in routinely does in north cornea he drops some sort of nuclear last weapon and then he asks for the west to pay him he will not do a bad thing teniszualea has claimed the huge territory of a sokeepo for decades even though it sone hundred and sixty thousand square kilometers represent more than two thirds of guyana and its population of ne hundred twenty five thousand is one fifth of the entire population of giant ism good times good times and again that is only happening would that be happening underway a present en trump i have serious doubts meanwhile the situation the situation in crane continues to be very bad for the ucranians they tried and all out frontal assault on dug in positions it did not work now according to politico dato secretary general sons sultenburg worn the hessian military line should be ready for bad news from the cranial front as reeve continues to defend against to rushes all out invasion stolenburg says work develop in cases we should also be prepared for bad news his comments come as western allies to bate over am and financial aid for you ran and mascot is busing is strop levels russia present of ladies potent signed a decree on fridge to increase the number of soldiers by a hundred seventy thousand a total of one point the million the lines really have not moved very much stolenburg is calling on dato members to ramp up the production of ammunition now the reason that that putter is doing that is because he assumes that the less is going to essentially leave you crane defenseless the wesiould not do that the who provide you crane with what is necessary in order to defend it is own territory while looking for an offal this thewy has been prudence about two months into the war because it is perfectly clear from the outset of the word at the military got a using russia completely out of crime or the donnas was not going to succeed russia spent ten years intrenching itself in these areas and absent providing crane f twenty twos nothing was going to change in these particular areas at wit that said russia is sending weakness and they are pushing and they're pushing very very hard meanwhile the left is concerned with the things that we are almost concerned about right amenlihe we might be concerned about the world being on fireboat the left is concerned about is fossil fuels now maybe you think that that is crazy because it is crazy but for the left left understand that the the chief moral priority on earthlight now is d industrialization and redistribution's hit is the thing they care about the most they believe that the world is on fire not because america enemies sends weakness and then prey on that weakness they believe the world is on fire because we are not setting quin more of an example and the way that we need to set and example is by d industrializing it is by taking green initiatives in order to curb our own economic growth now ironically the result of that is going to be the impoverishment of many of the countries that require actual economic health is can make those countries more aggressive not less richer country's tend to fight each other less i guys the idea hers in perish every one an n the world will become more peaceful it is really really stupid the u a e climate chief sultan altabare he he said yesterday that the fossil fuel fades out this thing that is being push by the entire international commutes this is really cumin is not going to work he happens to be correct we don't not to tenywish send up assist agony i euros the signs a these mom siskins oh the o mosonnouou o the us the the was to to furs feed is whats wont let if will not wont apes one point f is my not ta and i was don and the face an the fuss you an my

false accusations give been fat you about my position this is long and you at thing for e this to to first fun please hat me show me wont mot for was a the fuss of got go and now that we an now forsusyu for the thing that is suss going development and this you want to think the word back in to caves showmen we he is absolutely right about all that that would be of course i vow a e and and he is totally right about all that but the west has this bazar religious vision that if they magically say that fossil fuels should be faced out than an they will just disappear and everyone will retain they are level of economic development or out cloche they will not and which is what the sultan is sang there hes well i know if you do this than the economy is going to tank which of course is true none the less biding climate convoy john carry the wen directly from failing form policy to failing on climarchange i he is now calling for the death of all coal plans which is o good luck do be

worlds ability to push developing countries away from coal and other fossil fuels south africa and indonesia among the world's most coal hungry economies are back tracking on commitments they made to burn less of the fuel under agreements known as the just energy transition partnerships which offered them twenty eight on five billion dollars from the united states another wealthy nations so just ignoring it and then they are taking the money and then they are till building their coal fire power plans were paying people to continue to do what they were doing in the first place when by the way

policy there is no realism because the assumption is that if the west simply goes hands off the world will be a better place which of course daytime and then when it comes to things environmental postylicl the world has to be superman's on we can get involved imperialistically with stopping developing nations from developing there own economies ore no lecture them a lot a lots we are not on a focus on the things that actually make a person moral instead we are going to quurn'tquot heal the earth by telling poor people the they are not allowed used carbon base fossil fuels the most efficient fuels known to mankind a perfect example this sort of moral disconnect unfortunately is pope francs pope francs have been very critical of pope francs of course aren't have a particular dog in the catholic fight except that i believe the catholic church is strongest and best for western civilization when it holds to some semblance of traditional values two stories from the vatic over the course of the week and one pope francs did take action against one of his biggest critics according to the blaze his the second time this month pope france is punished in america relit pope france is punished cardinal rayon burn seventy five r old cannon ware from wisconsin he revoked berks salary and his subsidized that vatic apartment he was living other cardinals in come and his apartment for free receives a monthly stipend of about five thousand box he said that he was taking action gainsberg because he was a force of disunity according to anonym anonymous participants in a particular conversation on nonmember twentieth another in named source wait france is punishburg because he was using his privileges against the church reports from earlier this week claim that the pope see of berk during the meting quit cardinal berk is my enemy i take away his apartment and his salary francs dance at making those comments at never use theory enemy or the prone on my i simply announce the fact the meeting of the disaster had without giving specific explanations berk has been very critical of francs by saying you are focusing on the environment and you do not seem to care at all about the crucial social issues that a dividing the church to day and in many cases you are being offed on them that happens to be right by the way the pope has been unbelievably soft what he does he issues the sort of vague exclamations about say legit t k issues inside the church say about female priests yeshhe does not actually cave on them you's makes really vague statements that seem to open the door than we ask for clarification es as why why how dare you ask for claim cation i was perfectly car know you wasn't or nobody wo be asking the questions that is happening on the one hand and then on the other hand you have got the pope calling for the elimination of fossil fuels which by the way for a church that is seeking new adherents in the poorest parts of the world it turns out that you know what they actually need fossil fuels ism sorry to break it is the pope and everybody else in the environmentalists corner the singlemost efficient source of fuel on the planet remains of fossil fuels that is particularly true if you are looking at places africa if you are looking at places aria south america the theetonenconenconpres oredebadentebegree asallomin gevestame and for point

morality focused on quonquot saving the earth it is ridiculous i can meanwhile closer to home over the course the last few days the congress expelled gorge mantas e currently faces twenty three federal charges including fraud and identity fact his pled not guilty before fridges expulsion which passed three eleven to one fourteen only five people in history had been booted by the house three removed in eighteen sixty one because actually served in the act of confederacy the other too in nineteen eighty and two thousand to according tote waster journal ore convicted of serious crimes congress move to boutsantus because he is pretty obvious the guilty of all the stuff however setting a precedent of booting members before they have actually been convicted of a crime it's can open the door to a lot of things you once you start booting members based on the fact they've been accused of a crime welcome to congress were half a congress is accused of a crime it's the walstrturnal editorial word points out said it is no good to argue that santusis fabulous who fibbed his way into office how is that a distinction with other members the congress what is the rule now shortly after cantus is the ouster pennsylvania enter john fedderman rented is called to eject enter bobanends vrguno exspelsantas how can you allow something agendas german it is adman ends i thin is hat is a center for egypt because that is the accusation is that he was paid off by foreign countries yah s o may now be that in congress in accusation is tantamount two a conviction and really that started withe antitrust movement because again the accusations against trump as and you crane bast on rush on all the rest of the sort of stuff we are considered sufficient to push an impeachment inquiry into him and to now the accusation is on to be tantamount to the actual conviction regardless what you think of cantus and i think he is a ridiculous figure almost as ridiculous is one third of the resticongressbut if the new standard is accused equals guilty then welcome to congress where they are five people left and meanwhile the demaltrump verses jobidon that race continues to move forward house democrats are realizing that bionomics a giant fail according to axis house democrats have rejected the white houses months long campaign to sell bionomics they stop pushing the term at months ago the democratic con gressional campaign committee a committee and house majority pack two key fundraising arms our avoiding using the term bionomics on social media and personalleses because they say the tailing is ineffective in the meaning this assume house democrats stuff with people over politics rather than bionomics apparently according democratic sources their saying at bionomics presents a bunch of visions hey sales tone duff because their bunch people do not the economic one democratic strategist said the biggest problemlsn't using bison but the term as two philosophical and required to much explanation they are gin a continue to push bionomics policies they just will not use the cachrase bionomics because the giant fail and there is some hilarity to that because the reason bionomics became a thing is because obomonomics was a thing in anomalies personally popular linking berocoboma personally popular president with his failing policies made the policies somewhat more popular attaching bison's name to his bad economic policies makes his bad economic policies worse for the america people democrats are running headlong from jobidon in the twenty twenty four election which is not a good tine for join which means the real hope for democrats is notchobidon the real hope for democrats is that somehow some way people soup to vote against dona trump that is a very dick proposition they're basically making two separate arguments one is the dona trump will be dictatorial get to that moment play they are making the argument the dona trump is a criminal the problem there for trump is that he does not have to be a criminal to be convicted as a criminal in places washington d c girl get to all the updates from quart in just one second first if you are a

ziprocrer is indeed the smart way to hire gay meanwhile as jobiton continues to fade in the poles and again the poles are not good for hoiden right now ism looking at the latest poles the real cerpolitic selection poles between at donate trump and hoiden the latest messenger haerisacx pole has trump up fifty two to forty eight on jordan in the pulling average trump is up almost two points forty seven to fifty out o forty five point three biding his lad and only two of the last may be ten poles he is our very bad numbers for jobitan again is not that his numbers have gone down they haven't they've been pretty stagnant in far they're little bit up from where they wore back in tune the problem is that the numbers for trump have risen pretty dramatically why are those numbers rising because trump is not in the news well democrats have two ways of putting trump back in the news that is their actual strategy one is clam the dona trump is going to be a tyrant and the other is criminal conviction those are the two big plans on the trump is a tyrant side robot pagan a post opinions contributing editor has a piece over the washington post called a trump dictatorship is increasingly inevitable we should stop pretending human let comply no one things trump is going to be come dictator of america you now he become dictator of america by taking control the military do you thing the military is simply can go along with donate trump's plans to completely subvert the constitution of the united states yo the that is of thin tht'scgan to happen ti n happen on canary sex the income remotely close happening on canary sixth trump dictatorship and what is funny is that the elements of dictatorship that they suggest are all things the democrats are currently doing again the projection here is superstrumt oh my god he might take over the bureaucracy oh you mean democrats have taken over the bureaucracy for a hundred years o my god he might put federal judges on the cart that are conservative oh you mean democrats have ben trying to stack the costs for you now the last several generations inwwhat exactly is that the trump is going do that insanely dictatorial we according to robot pagan the next pase is about people falling in line he is talking not you trump is going to pick up the nomination and all likelihood and the he says trump all not only dominate his party he will become the central folks of every one's attention even today the news media can scarcely resist following trumps every word and action once he secures the nomination he will room over the country a colossus is everyway in gestured chronicled endlessly the first fall that was true of mama as well but then the idea is going to be that once he takes power something terrible is going to happen if trump does when the election he will immediately become the most powerful person ever to hold that office not only will he real the also powers of the america executive but he will do the fewest constraints of any president fewer even than in his own first term what limits those powers the most obvious under is the institutions of justice oh o which trump by his very election what devil to fight and revealed as impotent a court system that could not control trump is a private individual is not on control in better when he is president of the united states and appointing is own attorney general and all the other top officials at the justice department ire you ketingma in motherworts because trump is going to nominate his own agate this makes indicator have to introduce you to marigarland we are going all way back to canton jane rent what what with the gallery talkingabout here will i future congristop mast sober ligan president can accomplish a lobbies days without congressional approval as even barokobama showed you mean would mean even brokalamma he mainly showed it it was barokobama who started this process the final constraint on presidents has been there own desire for a glittering legacy but is that the way trump thinks he thinks his legacy will be napoleon will his president turn intoadictatorships as robercagin the odds are again pretty good what what exactly what that hell what is even talking about he says that his administration will be filled with people with enemy's lists a de trurmin cobra vetitificials will see it is their sole residentially authorize mission to rude out those in the government who cannot be trusted many will be fired others will be subject to career destroying investigations faintly this is tiresome nit isznocconahunt this dog's nockanhat which means that in the end what democrats are really relying upon is not scaring the hell out of you about trump it is on o be criminal conviction the bad news for trump is that criminal conviction is a high likelihood given the latest developments in washington be sees an my earthy over at national review points out that over the weak end trump was felt two defeats in washington to see federal courts judge gonna chucking who presiding over the criminal case with regard to genus six twenty twenty rule that he is not immune true criminal prosecution now it is unlikely who's ever going to get a ruling in his favor but it could determine the viability of trumps twenty twenty four presidential bit according to earthy according to my earthy trhutkins forty eight page opinion rejected the former president's claims that the first a amendment barred his prosecution by the bye injustice department special council blacksmith lithe says have periodically spotlighted the immunity is seeds not that i thought trump had much of a chance of prevailing he says the immunity issue is critical for trump because it is a healable are trial and thus potentially a vehicle four delay and delay his trumps main strata to be thatchiscot shot down there is no delay he says trials are not one by legal claims which our argued outside the jury's presence jury trials are one by factual evidence a good deal of the evidence against trump is unsavory but but it does not really matter because it is a dc jury he says that trump recognizes he could be very well convicted in the federal election interference cate he knows the recent pulling which showed him leading by non o number of battle ground states indicated a material slices of his support would fall away if convicted in one or more criminal cases he says that the the lay tactic was trumps best option and now the delay tactic is probably going away he says he thinks that the a peal by trump is problegoan' be rejected by the supreme court he says for now what matters most is this at is doubtful the former president n currentupe pe o front runner will get the e lay he seeks in his election interference case he is very likely to defacing a criminal trial in washington running from march to may twenty twenty four and if evidence are acquired to be an attendance throughout the entire federal criminal trial and let us say that he is convicted he says that he thinks cut can would exercise for broad authority to allow him to remain at liberty pending sentencing which is about three months after rob of that means just that he would be sentence if convicted may tune jury august o in august is my earthly says if trump were convicted in sentence to a term of imprisonment the default position of federal law would call for the revocation of bale and in order that he be remanded that presumption could be overcome only if chutkcan made a finding that trumps opal raise his substantial issue likely to result in reversal of the conviction which is probably unlikely we may enter the final days of the twenty twenty four election would trump actively imprison that is a thing that may actually happen ow that cut can has basically rejected all arguments to the contrary that is the plan and s when trump says this election interference he is certainly not wrong at least when it comes to that d c case which is ate which is a aboral a ready coming up we will get to the new religion of the left with goddess beyond say if you are not a member become member usecoachpera chest for two

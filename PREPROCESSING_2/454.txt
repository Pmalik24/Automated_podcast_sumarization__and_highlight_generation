welcome to the hubermanlan science science tace tore i mandrel supermen and o a professor of neurobiology an opthemology at stamford school of medicine my guest to day is doctor avid buss doctor buss is a professor of psychology at the university of texts busting and he is one of the founding members and luminaries in the field of evolutionary psychology doctor buss is laboratory is responsible for understanding the strategies that humans use to select mates in the short and long term and he is an expert in sex differences in mating strategy his laboratory is explored for instant why women cheat on their spouses or their long term partners as well as why men tend to cheat on their spouses and long term partners he is also explored a number of things related to the courtship dance that we call dating and securing a mate including the use of deception related to proclamations of love or promises of finances or sexual activity doctor bus is laboratory has also evaluated how status is assessed meaning how we evaluate our own worth and our potential as a mate and who is let us just say within range of a potential mate both in the short and long term for instance today we talk about how people do not just make direct assessments of their own and other people's value as a potential mate but also using the assessments of others to indirectly determine whether not they stand a chance or not in securing somebody as a short or long term mate his laboratory has also focused on some of the complicated and varied emotions related to mating love in relationships such as lust and jealousy and his extensively explored something called mate poaching or the various strategies that men and women use to make sure that the person that they want to be with or the person they are with is not with anyone else or seeking anyone else and indeed that other people do not seek their mate doctor buss s work also relates to how bi logical influences such as ovulation or time within the menstrual psyche influences mate selection or tendency to have sex or not with a potential short or long term mate and more recent wore from doctor buss's laboratory focuses on the darker aspects of mating and sexual behavior in humans including stalking and sexual violence to day we discuss all those topics we also discuss some of the strategies that humans can use to make healthy mate selection choices and for those that are already in committed relationships to insure healthy progression of those committed relationships in addition to publishing dozens of landmark scientific studies doctor buss is authored many important books a few of those include the evolution of desire and we women have secs and his most recent book is the one that i am reading now which is called when men behave badly the hidden roots of sexual deception harassment and assault and it is an absolutely fascinating reed it has indorsements from doctor robot supulski professor stamford who is been on this podcast as a guest before as well as stepped pinker and jonathan hate who wrote the coddling of the america mind it is a really important book i believe and one that does not just get into the darker aspects of human mating behavior and violence but also strategies that people can take to inshore healthy mating behavior and relationships there is much rumor speculation and outright fabrication of ideas about we human select particular mates in the short and long term what men and women do differently and on what i love about doctrobusis work is that it is grounded in laboratory studies that are highly quantitative using rigorous statistics and throughout to day's discussion you will notice that ism rapped with attention trying to extract as much information as i can from doctors about the real science of human mate selection and mating strategy ism certain that every one will take away extremely valuable knowledge that they can use in existing or future relationships from this discussion with doctrobus before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens acetic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic

avid bus avid delighted to be here have followed your work for a number of years and a excite o ask you a number of questions about is super interesting topics about how people select mates how they lie cheat and a but also behave well in the this dance that we call make choice yes ye fortunately there are there are a well behaving humans in the in the mixer good to know a just to start off am perhaps you could just orientals a little bit a about mate choice some of the primary criteria that study show men and women use in order to select mates both a shall we call them a transient mates as well as a lifetime mates right well that is the critical distinction because what people look for in a long term committed mate ship a marriage partner or long her romantic relatship is different from what people look for it a in a hook up or casual sects or one light stand or even a brief affair a am that is actually critical oneself we can may be back up a second and just talk a little bit about the theoretical framework for understanding mate choice or i it basically stems from drawings they of sexual selection and most people won they think about evolution they think about a clashes survival of the fittest or nature redingote an claw and drawing notice that there were phenomena that could not be explained by this called survival selection things the brilliant plumage of peacocks a sex differences like can stags for example have these massif antlers and the females of the species do not and ye come up with theory of sexual selection which deals not with the evolution of characteristics due to their survival advantage but rather due to their mating advantage and he identify two causal processes by which mating advantage could occur one is intersexual competition with the stereotype being two stags locking warrant in combat with the victor gaining sexual access to the female lot or ambling off with a broken antler and dejected in low self esteem and needing psychotherapy perhaps or were mate mate mate a value improvement therapy a an the logic was whatever qualities led to success in the same sex battles those qualities get passed on in greater numbers as ye see evolution which is change over time in increase in frequency of the characteristics associated with winning these what more one call contest competition and we know that logic of that is more general now an involve tings in our species competing for position an status hierarchies anyway o intersexual competition is one but the second most relevant to your question about mate choice is preferential mate choice that was the second causal pathway and the logic there is that if members of one sex agree with one another if their some consensus about the qualities that are desired than those of the opposite sex who possess the desired qualities or embody those desired qualities they have a mating advantage they get chosen they get preferred those lacking desired qualities get banished sound ignorer were in the modern of our become cells and the logic the is very simple but also very powerful and that is that a whatever qualities are desired con sensually desired if their someheritable basis to those than those increase in frequency over time and and in in the human case these two a causal processes of sexual selection are related to each other in that the preferences of the mate preferences of one sex basically set the ground rules for competition in the opposite sect if for example hypothetically women a preferred to mate with men who were able and willing to devote resources to them than that would create competition on among men to quad their way yo ow and beat out other men in resource acquisition and than displaying that their willingness to commit that to a particular women and same with women that his one of the interesting things about humans is that we have mutual mate choice which is not true in all species and that is that it is not just a matter of you selecting some one to be your mate they have to reciprocally select you and with mutual mate mate choice a we have both preferences mate preferences that women have and mate preferences that men have in consequently competition among men for access to the most desirable women in competition among women to r access to the most desirable men that sort of a little bit of theoretical backdrop a you askedable what are the qualities that men and women desire and maybe will start with a long treating and then shift to short treating and long treating is is interesting in an of itself in that its very rare in the mammalian world there more than five thousand species of primates of which of sorry more than five thousand species of mammals of which we are one be on the percentage of members that have anything resembling a paranoid of long treating strategy s about three to five per cent its extremely rare an even are closest primate relatives the chimpanzees a a they do not have a long treating strategy that do not have anything resembling hairband and mating him in the chimps the females coming to extras almost all the sexual activity occurs during that extra phase after that males and females basically ignore each other a for the most with some some exceptions a but with humans you have the evolution of long term pairbonding attachment a heavy a male and vestment in offspring a a relatively concealed ovulation a and and these are kind of unique aspects of the human mating system so to get to your question a well what are the qualities the tithe best t the most large scales study this been done this is study that i did awhile back of thirty seven different cultures and has not been replicated by other researchers but basically what we found as three clusters of things we found qualities that both the men and women wanted in a long termite we found some qualities that were sex differentiated were women prefer than more than men were men preferred the more than women and the we found some attributes that were highly veritable a cross cultures in weather people found ties as desirable indispensable or irrelevant intimate and i could give examples of each of these if the yet you great i i love to know a what some of the common themes were across these cultures and terms of what what is beyond sech the matin sexually selected for ye o o some of the things that were tuck by universal desire to things that men and women share a there things intelligence a kindness a mutual attraction and love a which is really kind of heart worming as some people think that a love is a recent western invention by some european a poets but it turns out is not try you go to the clunston and bosouana a and they describe pretty much the same experience as a falling in love as as we do and even describe the distinction be tween this kind of infatuation stage of love and the attachment pase were u you cannot maintain this frenzy of infatuation an obsession for very long six weeks may be six months at most on aotherwas you can get nothing else done in your life and of those of those doyenne in circuits firing and i frequency ye a yet o mutual attraction love on a good health a a dependability emotional stability all there is a bit of a sex difference there with women preferring it a bit more than men an and basically and the an these may seem obvious no one wants a stupid mean ugly disease ridden made and perhaps obvious but a but no one do this in advance of the thirty seven culture study these were some universal preferences you go to the lulu tribe in south africa or a a reodeganera and brazil or a portal or slow a or anywhere in the world and these are qualities that people universally desire in long term mates sex differences sex difference is basically fell into two clusters women more than men prioritized good earning capacity a slightly older age and the qualities associated with resource acquisition the these are things a man's social status a does he have drive is the ambitious a it does he have a good long try resource trajectory's one way that i to phrase it because women often they do not look it necessarily a the resources that a good possesses at this moment but what is his trajectory an was a just urchin true but may ask a is there anything known o about the commonalities of how that is a best it is it a he is rolling out o bed early and a running eight miles a he is showing proficiency in school a he handles himself well socially a parties is drinking too much but knows what in obyousey their integrating multiple cases the brain as a complex place but it at is there any information about what those variables or across cultures ya well i think that a i there is been less attention to that shots a great question a one of the things that we do know across cultures is that women attend to the attention structure a the attention structures a key determine of status as people who are high en status are those to whom the most people pay the most attention also the attention of others to them not how well a given potential mate pa onfokess in pay attention yes airily yes exactly and but but but women look i mean a it is the guy even in the modern environment as the guy spending eight hours a day playing video games a a eating cheats in drinking beer or is he a devoting effort to his professional development a hard work a ambition does he have clear goals or is he in an existential crisis not knowing what is going to do with his life a those are some the qualities that that that people look for and also women use a what is called in literature mate choice copying and this is related in parts to the attention structure that is guys who have o a pass the philters of multiple women a those a a a a preapprove preapprovemend we have done studies were you just take a guy photographed him along a versus take the same guy put an attractive women next or put two women next to em and women judge exactly the same guy to be much more attractive if there's if the a es paired with women than i then then if his not and and some guys exploit this in the modern world by hiring wing women to go with em on dates and of fore this is my my sister former real friend or whatever a a a but a but but be correct in in in the women use multiple use to assess these things a and they change ever time and a a in in the modern environment even things the attention structure to this guy have a million twist critter followers or three twitter followers a a that is an index of the attention structure and hence the status of the go within the brother community so an and from an evolutionary perspective is reasonable that women would priorities these qualities because of the tremendous a symmetry in our reproductive biology namely that fertilization occurs internally within women not within men women bear the the burdens of the nine month pregnancy which is metabolically expensive as well as creating opportunity costs in terms of mobility and involving other tasks that people need dissolve in the course of their lives and a one way to phrase that is that the costs of making a bad mate choice are much heavier for women when it comes to sexual behavior certainly a because on it a and the the benefits correspondingly of making a wise mate voice a higher for women in the sexual context a but as i said we have mute mutual mate choice in our species and what do men value more than women a physical attractiveness a they wake that mut as a a more important criteria than do women about men yes yet exact consistently across call consistently it is not that women ore are are a indifferent to it women do pay attention to a guise physical appearance is his fitness and forth in guise are actually off base in the a thinking that women prefer more muscular men than they actually do in muscle magazines these men with bulging biceps and forth women do not find that especially but they do privatized fit men a good shoulder to hyporatio and other qualities of physical appearance as well as things a use to health a in physics physical appearance provides a wealth of information about a person's health stay us but also provides for men a wealth of information about woman's fertility a her reproductive value non not that men think about that consciously and you men do not walk down the street and see of women and they a find her attractive because i think she must be very fertile a maybe a few heard people do that but most men just is a they just find those cues attractive and the yes are us associate with youth and health because we know that youth is a very powerful cue to fertility and reproductive value men paradise physical appearance in and in the field of psychology it used to i ways taught when i was an undergraduate that you cannot judge a book by its cover that physical attractiveness was infinitely arbitrary infinitely culturally variable and and it simply not true we know now based on the last twenty years of scientific a studies that the use that men running attractive women are not at all arbitrary a there is some variation across cultures in relative plumpness fermis thinness a but things clear skin clear eyes symmetrical features a i a low waste hyporatio a a full lips a lustrous hair all these are qualities that are a associated with youth in health and hence have have evolve to be part of our standards of attractiveness and and it is not just that men a these a superficial creatures who you value at women on the basis of appearance the there is an underlying logic to why they do a and as i said relative youth this this age thing is one of the largest sex differences you fine in look from mate selection with women preferring somewhat older men and men preferring somewhat younger women is there consistent age gap a through a to relate to that statement yes there is a the age gap though depends on the age of the man a we can document this in my studies what we found is that men preferred women who are about three to four years younger than they were on average i it'll qualify that in second women preferred guises who are about three and a half the four and a half years older then then they were there is a sex different going in the opposite direction a but as men get older they prefer women who are increasingly younger than they are one way to gages there there actual marriage statistics a and then there are express preferences and both sexes kind of converge if you look at a you know first marriage second marriage third marriages if people get divorced tan remarried average age gap is a in america anyways three years at first marriage with the guides being older a five years second marriage and eight years a third marriage a a that is as men are getting older and getting divorce remarrying that they are marrying woman who are increasingly younger than they are a in terms of preferences it is also expressed in preferences it does not go down a say at twenty five year old man would say prefer a women who's twenty or in e early twenties thirty five year old man might prefer women who is in er late twenties or early thirties a fifty year old man might prefer women who say thirty five to thirty eight that the preferences do go up but the gap gets increase in the larger and the reason that you do not see things a why are not men preferring women pique fertility in humans is around age twenty four twenty five a and say why are not the sixty year old men prioritizing twenty five or old women well as i mention we have it is a reciprocal mutual mate choice phenomenon shocenstrains the occasion is well she she constrains it but also marriage and long treating are a things other than reproductive unions in the modern environment that is there a w we yousposed to do things as a coupled and if you get too large in age gap then essentially your indifferent cultures in a you you grow up with different songs and and and and if the cultural gap gets two large you youngerstand each other said the constraints on that but if you look at contacts where there are no constraints of that sort historically kings emperors does buts a teeter and it'll give one more modern example a they basically prefer young fertile attract it females and if they have harass they stock the harems with those s an then circulate them out when their thirty and forth and if you look at at marry systems that are unconstrained a then the preferences are more likely to be revealed or within cultures that is if you look at men who were in a position to get what they want as mac dagger no ted you cannot always get what you want but orris sometimes a you which you need i hear that at most the time he got what he needed right right you got what he wanted right and may be what he needed but he he was in a position i do not if he still anythings in his seventies now but he was in a position as was a let us a rod start take another example or leanorder the maria if you were a male whose in a position where there are thousands of women potentially available to you and you can have your pick then you see that clear expression for younger females a there is a chart that was floating around the nine and at of the the girl friends of leone leonarter de capo as he got older was he is getting older and old or and the graph of the age the his girl friends it basically stayed the same was in the early early twenties or he values consistency he his consistency a but on say to any tithe day to converge on that these are universal sex differences in a long turn mate selection now when we shift to and i should mention cultural variability because that is a critical think cause there is in my thirty seven culture study what i found was the preference for virginity that is no prior sexual experience that was them severable a desire of cross cultures you had cultures on at the time of the study china a it was basically indispensable that a partner be a virgin and then at the other end you have sweden where sweden swedes typically place close to zero value on some you find it undesirable your weird if your a virgin and you have this whole spectrum this is a virginity in the female or is this also was not n when china was it preference at the male and the female b a your mutual makes a selection yet it was a preference for both sexes o but tit is a good question because where there was a sex difference it was always in the direction of males preferring virginity more than females and we have gone back to china i still to research in china among other places and we gone back and retested modern urban populations in the importance of virginity has gone down in china specially in the urban areas and the sex difference that did t exist before has now emerged where males value to more than females and i think part of it was in previous times you u it sealing of fact where both sexes say yet it is absolutely important to to be version there's cultural variation and cultural change over time in some of these qualities i abut the sex differences that i described have remained invariant over the years since my thirty seven culture study these been replicated in in at least a couple of dozen different cultures and a and we have gone back to some of the culture i mention have gone back to china a a brazil and india a to look at cultural changes over time and and there have been you ness in some cases dramatic cultural changes over time but the sex differences that i described are invariant they have not changed a bit i be remiss i did not ask about a truth telling and deception because some of the measures that you are describing age for instance of one can potentially lie about right i an guessing that there are people who do that on online profile us what not from what i understand people also lie about height and other features on unlink profiles a but some of them are much harder to live right eventually a the truth comes out about i some if not all of these things it if you would a could you tell us about how men and women a leverage deception verst is truth telling and communicating some of the things around mate choice selection yet well basically the both men and women do deceive on o we have a the modern cultural mention of online dating which was little use ten years ago and virtually absent twenty years ago and people do lie but they lie in predictable ways they lie in ways that attempt to embody the make preferences of the person they are trying to attract and men do lie they deceive about their income their status to they exaggerate their income by about twenty per cent a they they are they add they tack on about two inches to their height of their five tend they round up to six feet a they do not if their five ten they do not say that their gigantic but they think con of rounded up in the more desirable direction a women tend to deceive about weight they tend to shave about fifteen pounds off of their reported weight and both sexes postphotos that are not truly representative what they actually look they might postphotos of a themselves when they were younger ore the even advice a a tips on how to create the best self of the best angle that will maximally and hance what you look or to order just doctrine of f odds to guessing r a i are but a shy in absolutely and and in one of the things a about it now you say will do people find out of course people people do find out i mean i give you one story about a colleague of mind who as doing is e male who doing in an et dating and we picked only women who self described as sevens on the one to seven on attractive o the most attractive as self reported and and to win out with one women and she was missing her front teeth and he he said will call me picky but missing front teeth and she thinks she is he tolebadraggors he was a little a disappointed about that and women of course are disappointed they they meet a guy who they think is this physically fit athletic guy in he comes up is in a three hundred pounds and overweight a people people do find out and and and there are some in net dating sights have a kind of a vetting of the accuracy of a something somethings you can look up though public records and to risk i have a criminal record for example i we is on a in a a sexual a offenders a the website a there somethings you can verify but what i tell people is you really have to meet the person in inner act yow because it bebeimpart because of the discretion but also because what happens within erne dating is that the phis the photograph tend to overwhelm all the other use and all the other curse are written statements and we ware not relieve evolved to process written statements a but we were revolve to respond to physical use but a and men tend to attend to the visual cause much more than women women in their mate selection they have old factory use to what is the guy sound is vocal qualities a a a that is a auditory us a but all factory use what is the smell and women have not more acute sense of smell than men do and o and if the guy doesn't smell right even if he embodies all the other qualities women want that to deal breaker and and i cure people just stop with the hundred payback an forth or messaging and meet a person for could coffee and inter act and then you will you will get a more accurate beat on the person and then of course some qualities you cannot disses even with a with a half hour inter action you can tell a lot but things emotional stability are things that have to be asses over time and one of things that i advise people to do and not the advicegiping business but people asking a what do i find out what i study they a i go this problem can you give me advise but one of the things to assess things emotional stability which is absorb critical and long term mating is to do something go on a trip together take take a vacation and were your even in a unfamiliar environment were your you have to hope with things that you are not familiar with in a as opposed to a in environment were it is very predictable and and u u get a greater exposure because one of the one of the hall marks of emotional instability is how they respond distress emotionally unstable people tend to have a long latency to return de base line after a stressful even and this is the sort of information you cannot get on a coffee date and i you can only get by accessing it over time ut somebody whose laboratory study stress and tools to combat stress i a that is great it is yet more incentive for people to develop a self regulatory mechanism a for themselves a ism guessing many of the a features of deception in this contact a were present long before internal dating a and is it it is somewhat dark to think about what is a is deception built in to this dance that we call mate selection and has it been built in for a long time or this a where's a something that you think is emerged more as people i are approaching each other through these electronic a the base medium ye i mean some forms of deception have been there a for a long time over human have we shoring history one form of deception which we have not mentioned is deception about whether your interested in a long term commit a relationship or a short from hook up and there is deception about that especially on the part of men men who are interest on tender it has been reported of the tender denies this is been reported that something thirty percent of the men on tender or either married or in long term committed relationships an their long for something on the side but a the a in terms of successfully attracting a mate the overdisplay that hey ism interested in just a short term hook i thunderstone sex i most have sex right now i lest just go back to my apartment these are very ineffective tactics and effective tactics for men a often displaying use to long term interest and and of course that is effective for a woman who seeking along term interest and and that is of deception we find in our studies of deception that men tend to exaggerate the depths of their feelings for a woman i exaggerate how similar they are and how a long they are in their values and religious orientations and political values an forth and and i think there is deception around that and i think that is probably in evolutionarily a recurrent form of deception that women have defenses against by the way but i think that modern internetdating opens the door for certain types of deception that it were at minimum were difficult to accomplish ancestrally things photo shopping you was not available back then a plus we evolved in the context of small group living were you not only had your own personal observations of some one's qualities you had also your your relatives your friends allies the social reputation that some one had this is these are all critical sources of information that are less available in modern environments because in a people migrate they move from place to place on i they can close down one inter not profile and put up another or they could have six going simultaneously there the modern ferment opens up the door for forms of deception that were not available or ware not available to the same degree ancestrally i see a very interesting a would you i touch on some of the the features that a are selected for inters of a see sexual partner choice a tactual obit about a make choice but a in terms of sexual partner choice are the is are there any good studies exploring what people are selecting for or is it a that they are both just in a state of of a pure hypothalamic drnerside test after all and a and therefore it is hard to recreate in the laboratory o no no we we do know something about that and we know something about how the preference of for a sex partner differ from preference for long termite there is overlap of course but one thing is on physical appearance physical appearance for women is important and long treating not as important is former but it becomes more important in short treating and is the go good looking so this physical attributes are more important for women a they are they remain important former physical appearance in short formatting but with the footnote that men are willing to drop their standards in short treating a if its low commitment low risk a just sex on without entangling commitments a women are more likely to priorities on what i call a bad boy qualities guys who are very self confident a guys who are a a start guys who are a little arrogant use who e risk taking guys who a defy conventions women are more attracted to those guys in short term mating than long treating a and where is a longtermating they go more for the good dad qualities is the guy dependable was he going to be a good father to my children a and then also in short term mating women use that mate copying a a heuristic that is a if there are thousands of other women who find him attractive women fine him attractive and that is what you have the group phenomenons so with the rock stars for example they are thousands of screaming women all of whom on asleep with this a famous rock star and they used that is information they find if you took a still photo of some of these rock stars and asked women how attractive the guy is verses tellies a famous rock star and showed the thousands of women screaming a at that they judge him entirely differently terms of his a attractiveness a s or even this is this is an important point that woman's attraction to men is more context specific and verses more cross contexts than man's attraction to women and a gave you just an example that this is a a female cologne of my went to a conference an academic conference and she found the organizer of this conference to be really attractive n and and then saw him six months later and wonder what what was i thinking i is not he very attractive at all and what it was is when he was the organizer he was at the center of the attention structure you now he he was the guy up on stage directing everybody and everyone was attending to him and then when he was just a normal presenteratof conference a he was not did not command the attention structure he did in that when he was the organizer and this is just an illustration of how a circumstance dependent woman's attract made attraction is for guys it depends on his his status the number of a women that are attractive to e a the attention structure is see how how he interacts with a puppy or or a baby if he is ignoring a baby in distress or positively interacting with a young child a a all these things wet worse for men it almost does not matter you have context's more irrelevant there hunting in on the specific cyclophysical use that the women is displaying in contacts be damned very interesting a stuck about infidelity a uncommitted relationships a what are some of the consistent a findings around a reasons for and maybeven a longeron consequences of infidelity for men and women this can be marriage or or lunger partnership or you infidelity of any kind i suppose ye well lis thing it does happen yeyeyewell all that how frequent is yet that that is the interesting ting well well how frequent it is is difficult to gauge because o it is the the one of the forms of human conduct that people to keep secret the if you go back a now say seventy years to the class i kindly studies the questions ben infidelity were the questions that most people refused to answer and when the question was brought up cause more people to drop out of the study and that kind of tells you something that what what a people conceal in a infidelity insist murder ye there is a small handful things of people universally one to conceal an infidelity is one of them so but people do it and kinky estimated twenty six per cent of married women committed an an infidelity t some point grin their marriage and about fifty per cent of men other studies have given lower figures and that the exact figures bound surround depending on i a an an empty provided and how comfortable they are with the inter viewer and forth but and by infidelity as living intercourse with somebody else you were not taking about and quatingca emotional affairs r talking about this were just sex sex with somebody others than their committed partner yes unbeknownst to their part right right and there are other forms of infidelity which we could get into including emotional infidelity and financial infidelity but here re busting about for the moment sexual infidelity and the interesting thing about sexual infidelity is that the sex is really differ fundamentally in the motives for committing infidelity for men on the primary motive and that these are on average sex difference whenever i talk about second a ointment on average sex differences was there is overlapping the distributions and and a but these are generalizations of which there are exceptions of for men it is it is mainly a matter of sexual variety about seventy per cent of the men it is the opportunity presented itself i was out of town i had this opportunity low risk low cost a pursuit of sexual variety sexual novelty is a see motivation for men sight interrupted is wo seventy per cent of men that cheat that is a a primary to a cause or is it that seventy percent of men do cheat no nooseventy of the men who cheats seventy per cent thank you for that clarification of the men who do cheat seventy per sent sight that as the key motive a the key reason why they committed an infidelity or i mean climbers climboutans cause they are there because there there if they well you ow the comedian i think it was cross rocks that men are only as faithful as their opportunity a and or or how an how available their password on their phones to their pardner right right yet but and that is an exaggeration but a a but but if you look at women a this just desire for pure novelty sexual variety is much less of a motive but women who have affairs sight that there unhappy with their primer relationship emotionally unhappy ere sexually unhappy and typically both and this may seem totally obvious that well of course people if are unhappy in the relationship are more likely to stray but in fact it is not true for men f you compare men who are happy with their marriage and men who are not happy with their marriage there is no difference in their infidelity rates i think it goes it down to that issue of a you knows motive for seeking variety now why do women do it a because it is it is a risky endeavor she risks for long term mate or losing long teammate it is risking terms of reputation damage for both sexes a it is a riskeeping why do women do it a and there too competing hypotheses at least too but there two primary competing hypotheses in the evolutionary literature one is called a duel mating strategy hypothesis we are women a seeking to get resources in investment from one guy and good genes from another guy in prince an principle that that can that can work and i initially this is a was not hypothec original with me this of steep gang instead randythornhene some others of a dirty hazelton a former stood n mind have advocated this duel mating strategy hypothesis an originally i was a in indorsed it because the it a seem to support it we can get into which data seem to support it but overtime i became more and more dubious about this hypothesis and instead have advocated what i call the mate switching hypothesis and if you look at a a whole host of information around why women have affairs it is not compatible with the duel mating strategy hypothesis and is compatible with the mate switching that is women who are looking to a either divest themselves from an existing mastership a or a trade up in the mating market to a mate whose more compatible with them wore higher and mate value or simply see whether their sufficiently desirable that it eases the transition into the mating pool or keep keeping and mate is a potential back up mate with a can mate insurance i should have car insurance of something bad happens to your car hosehousi house insurance we also have made insurance he o keeping some when one women said the men are soup you always want to have one on the back burner a interest whether that it is the best o know you not on mature but a but at convey captures something about about why well what evidence an i talk about well for one thing women who have affairs he's is about seventy per cent of them they let against a just a one to e on o e to have o the women who have affair let us say ball partkinzii was let say roughly right twenty five twenty six per cent of women will have affairs let just assume that he is right and we do not know exactly a but of the women who do have affairs about seventy per cent say they have fallen in love with their affair partner they become deeply emotionally involved with their affair for partner a and to me if you are just trying to get good needs from a guy that is the last thing you want to do is fall in love with them or get emotionally involved but it is very compatible if you want a switch mates a and the a that sort of that is us one piece of evidence that suggests that women a that the mate witching function of infidelity is a more likely explanation that these two ere not inherently incompatible hypotheses another at it is possible that some women do pursue a duel mating strategy hypothesis a but there is other evidence that suggests for example water the actual rates of genetic cockledry well in the modern environment anyway there pretty low turns out the two to three per cent could you just explain for the audience with genetic cycle solo this is where were the women were were the man believes he is the genetic father of a child but it turns out he is not might be the male manner of the next or able of the guy she is having interfere with a a me mistaken paternity and genetic cockledry is just one way to a capture and after the cuckoo bird right named after the cool big yes who sneaks its eggs into the nest of the other rolls destroys the the future offspring of the right bird and then busily awful odds all the work on to another right father parisatizs ya the preteen vestment of a a different bird species a si anyway i think that and there is other sources of evidence that i think point so one of the sources of evidence that initially seem to support the duelmating strategy hypothesis was ovulation ships another words on it look from the early studies that wen women are ovulating are among non oil taking women non women noon hormonal contraceptives that they experienced a preference shift toward more men who were masculine and symmetrical which were hypothesized markers for engines and and there is an explanation for that but it turns out the effects of ovulation on woman's made preferences are far weaker than inti than the initial studies looked and in fact some larger scale studies have failed to replicate them entirely and it is n that was one of the key sources evidence these ovulationships that women were going after engines because it is only when she is ovulating and she can get pregnant by having sex with another man that it would make sense for her to have sex with another man and there was even some early evidence that women were timing their affairs a timing sex with their affair partners to come inside with when they were ovulating but but as i said some of these subsequent studies have failed to replicate these early findings calling into question that debating strategy notion and i think give have shifted my views on this in and now endures n the made whishing hypothesis as a more likely explanation for why most women have affairs the way you describe this a makes me wonder if when of the women that have affairs do those affairs tend to be more long lasting than the affairs that men have because the way describe it is men are a seizing an opportunity to serve a carpedeum type approach you infidelity and women potentially on average are capitalizing on something that is longer term now of course if they are doing this around population than it would constrain the amount of times they would need to see or have sex with teethe on this other person that there not married to what a is there any evidence that women have more ongoing affairs in men men have train more transit into yes yet there is and if you look at people who have affairs there is a sex difference there that women tend to have affairs with one person and become a emotionally involved with at one person over time men tend to who have affairs tend to have affairs with a larger number of affair partners and which than by definition cannot be long as you can have long term affairs with six different partner e unless he is a juggling multiple a one accounts or ones a i alright and some men try to do that but on this you be very taxing yet on and in the stay n agent is o it is easier to meet more people by virtue of on line communications but it is also easier to get caught meaning it is harder t conceal a interactions everything's in the cloud anyway a good friend of mine who is a former very high level in special operations said anything that is not in your head and only in your head is available others to ye fine should they want it yet think that is and i think that is largely true and and ye o a and fun information text messages and people very good hacking into their partners a funds computers and then also their video camera everywhere a sneaking off to this acquit restaurant ism in their probably ait video camera that and reported you walking in and out of that restaurant everything can be found a ism certain of that you mention emotional affairs and financial infidelity is well ye am i had a grocer and once who a as a early date discussion a said a not that i get the impression that a you are but i want to be very clear she said that you are not emotionally physically or financially tied to any other women i very interesting that now you bring up a financial in fidelity she is a quite happily partner now and a a not with me but a but it is interesting is the first time i heard anyone spelled out that way is a list almost specific names and a grant am a what is emotional infidelity what is financial infiditya was is a very smart woman time a threat and si i seemed you you were you gave honest responses to all those three questions as i recall it as we now know a that the what you can ask her at some point i i you are and there is self deception in the service of deception that is another she emotional an fidelity is basically exactly what it sounds it is it is falling in love with some one else becoming psychologically close to someone else sharing intimate a were private information with some one else a that is what i mean by emotional infidelity and om one of the hallmarks of this o study don by a former a student mid very cult is very clever i thought he analyze the used to be this reality tvesho called cheaters where they would hire detectives i and they would when the detective would to fallow someone to a hotelrum they call up the partner and i say a your husband just walked into the hotelerum a with some one else do you would you to come down to the hotel and confront em and certain percengof people would confront and what he analyzed that he analyzed all these episodes of this so called cheaters and what he examined was the verbal interrogations when people confronted their partners and when men confront of their partners the first question they want now is did you fuck him a women their first question was do you love her and this kind of c captures that difference between a sexual infidelity and emotional infidelity and also kind of captures another sex difference when it comes to sexual jealousy where men tend to be more focused on the sexual components of the infidelity because those are what a compromise his paternity certainty his certainty that he is actual actually genetic father of whatever a offspring ensue a where's a what love is a cue to do you love her that is a cue that he is going to leave you the woman for another woman is a cue that to the long term loss of that investment commitment from that partner and and the sexes seem to differ a in which o aspects of the infidelity with women wore a tune to more upset by the emotional infidelity men wore by the sexual infidelity now financial infidelities been explored much less but in in in my new book a when men behave badly i have a section on financial infidelity were i sunrise all the research has been done and i was kind of flabragasted by the percentage of people who do things have credit cards that their spouse does not know about keep secret bank accounts have the credit card bills mail to their office rather than their home i have a basically a resources and expenditures of pooled resources that they keep from their partner and both sexes do it a and in the percentages very from study to study but they range from thirty to sixty per cent of all people who are keeping financial information from their from their spouse in one way another could be the woman's out being designer o purses or designer hand bags a could be the guise out a going to stript clubs or taking his a fair partner to a restaurants and does not want those charges to show up on a a joint beheld credicrat a financial infidelity's critical and then even things diverting pooled resources to one set of genetic relatives verses another said is another thing that people tend to keep secret there are forms of financial infidelity as well you infidelity your absorb it is a great question because it should not be confined to sexual infidelity which is what most people think about a but also emotional and financial interestingly if you ask people what do you mean what what is infidelity in a marriage men tend to say well it is obvious as she has was sex with some one else a that is infidelity whereas women my liked have a broader definition of infidelity they will sight things e motion infidelity financial infidelity as part of the definition where's men have that more narrow definition interesting i have a a good friend who is a a couples counts a of clinical psychologist and a she told me something interesting that relates to this which is that a in cases of infidelity oftentimes the some of the arguments a between couples boiled down to whether not contraception was used or not that becomes a a key feature and she always a thought that that was youth hot homing on a a detail which of courses and important details t relates to both a paternity issues and pregnancy but also disease right but a as were talking about all this it it makes it a makes me think that a this may have deeper evolutionary ruts in our a fruit further out in the brain as we say n the a of split and a yon and amusing a converse s not using economy not using is a more intimate act in a way you were literally physically more intimate with some one else than if you do use a conium a in at but whether it is a whether evolutionary ruse to was i do not know om economy are probably relatively recent in a least a widespread use o them relatively recent an evolutionary times i doubt we have adaptations specifically for them now in presumably before counts a a one can only speculate because as we say witicomes to a behavior a there is rarely a fossil record a but sometimes there is it would be a the withdrawal method of contraception which a good friend of mine who studies a whose laboratory for sone reproductive biology says the reason that is a poor choice of contraception is because it was designed not to note note to those of a trying to avoid unwanted pregnancy we talked a little bit about status in terms of what men and women are selecting for a predifferen types of relationships a is he anything else about status that it h you find particularly interesting and you now what men are finding attractive besides these tuna waste hybracios and a a quality of potential mothers a and forth a there any kind of a hidden gems in the literature around this that a might not have heard of a well yes i you mean among i a things sex differences in what leads to high status or or for instance or what a or perhaps things that a or surprising in terms of what people are selecting for do people who know what their selecting for this is or is all subconscious any an all of the those topics a of interest to eye well to take them in reverse order you now i think a lot of it is conscious but some of it is certainly unconscious were there elements a which are totally unconscious i mention one earlier where man looks at woman he is not he is aware that he is attracted to her and attracted to her physical appearance but he might not be aware of why in i we did not vault to be aware of why just with food preferences we we find certain things delectable another things a i nauseating we we do not understand the adaptive logic of why are food preferences exist in why we have them and the same is true of mating an i wend a men find women with with a low waste tiporatio attractive a but they might not that they almost rarely really will they dow o low we wasturpacius actually associated with higher fertility lower introcanlogical problems a you lower age et camera a we are sometimes aware what we wont up but we are unaware of why we wanted think their unconscious elements that the whole topic of status and what less to high status on most status topical currently investigating published a couple scientific articles on it and a but maybe will hold off on that for a a future discussion but but it innit intersect ill mention one it intersects with mating and in interesting ways in that higher status gives people the ability to a choose from a wider pool potential mates than they would if they have lost status and one of the reasons that people strive for status is because they have access to more desirable mates conversely having desirable mates endows you with higher status and if you have if your mail you have a very a attractive a woman on your arm that leads to high status and there is a reciprocal link between status in mating in that way and they are been studies where you you say i said they pop a a kind of a unattractive guy older unattractive guy and a stunningly beautiful woman as is a girl friend and they say what what what what is his guy all about and they say well he must be very high and status he must be very wealthy he must a have a lot going for him a where is the reverse people do not make the same attributions and and there is an interesting reciprocal link between status in mating success were make success leads to high status and i status leads to more mating success to over and over again there are these instances that you describe where the assessment of potential made sexual or loner partnership or a being made in the contents of good statistical practices looking at the choices of others as a redoubt of your own choices a that keep this seems to be a theme that this is not being made in a very narrow c texts but paying attention what other people paying attention to see to come up again and again a slightly off center from that but still paying attention to what other people are paying attention to a what is known about jealousy in men verses women and a how frequent it is how intense it is and what people do with that jealousy o mean we hear r have heard at some point that a a large fraction of homicides are the consequence of jealous lovers a that is the darkest angle of all this but a in evolutionary psychology context o what is jealousy a does it relate to fraternity issues only o look tells yes well is a the great set of questions in and when i first started studying jealousy a i reviewed all the prior publications on jealousy and at that time jealousy was regarded as a a sign of immaturity a sign a a insecurity a a sign of a neuroses or pathology or in some cases delusion a and what i argued a is and do argue is that jealousy is an evolved emotion that serve several adaptive functions a a one of which you mention is is a paternity certainty function a but the but to back up a second baby once you have the evolution of long treating long from parsons you are talking about from a male perspective investing a tremendous amount of resources in a woman and her children over years or decades a on with boomerang kids now a go more than to decades boomerang kids yea ids kids to leave how and then come back and we live at home that a to the o they ow ye i do not have children o i a no it is a big thing a but if i do all just expect that the comeback come back o they they cannot find a job or they find it cheaper to live at the parent's house or whatever funkiness i cannot think of anything worse i man i love my parents i now id i get a can imagine but a but it happens and it is happening more and more in given the current economic situation book a nice you have long treating you need a a a defense to prevent were preserve the investment that you have made in a making and long erratic and jealousy serve this a mate guarding function if you will were mate retention functions in other words one way of phrasing this is that we know that their the affairs we know that people break up they get divorced a but people have adaptations to want a whole on to their mates and that is what jealousies impart about and jealousy gets active ate when there threats to that romantic relationship a no other forms of jealousy smiling jealousy and forth fixing on mating jealousy in this contact a now what is interesting is the the threats to an on going valued romantic relationship come from many sources they could be you detect cues to your partners infidelity a a er use a of a a lack oof an emotional distance between you and your partner you you say i love you to your partner and your partner says a i wonder how how the nips are doing the scoring season whatever if you get an reciprocated i love yous a bad cue ore or some people are tune to this if there is a half mill a second delay ray e can detect delays in respond yes yet ye delays in responses but even things that is one set of cues abut then n another set of a interested mate poachers if you are mated to someone who desirable a which many people are other people still desire them and sometimes tried to poach them were were them away from you for a short try sexual encounter or for a longer term relationship and we have to be jealousy motivates people to be attentive to potential mate poachers in their environment abut even were subtle things a mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy even if there are no mate poachers and no used infidelity if a a mate value discrepancy opens up in a relationship in the america system your a six or an eight or a ten a and people generally pair off based on similarity in mate values that tends to happen nit is end up with six is sevens tend up with six the a lust or mind us will not yet yet right these are somewhat subjective you somewhat subjected but there still some consents about these things even colloquy people colloquially people say things a a he is not good enough for you were i think you you could do better a to people an implicitly have a notion of relative mate value and discrepancies therein e discrepancies can open up where none previously existed you get fired from a job all a sudden and most people are very understanding and forgiving about that if it is not too long but you go six months eight months people start having problems were someone is career takes off will say a woman becomes a a famous singer ore actress or or r a man does a career takes off all a suddenness o mate value discrepancy where you have access to a larger pool potential mates and higher mate value potential mates people are attentive to mate value discrepancies and jealousy can get activated even if there are no immediate threats to relationship but the the mate value discrepancy is ay threat that looms on the horizon of the relationship because we know statistically the high or mate value person is more likely to have an affair and is more likely to dump the other person and trade up in the mating market and when people find a new partners for long turn relationships do they tend to trade up on average yes if the discrepancy if the discrepancy is sufficiently large so their cost associate with breaking up in a divorcing for example i is at emotionally financially it is a costly thing and if you have a half a point mate value discrepancy you are not conch a lot of break ups but if you have larger may to discrepancies that is senate eager were for a trading up in the mating market a but say then then you get into n what jealousy is it is an emotion that gets act i and by these circumstances in then what people do about it depends on what their actions are and people do things that i at in my published scientific work i say range from vigilance to violence there is whole spectrum of things and felt of identified nineteen different tactics the people use to deal with problems once they get jealous and one is increased vigilance and the other vigilance for the behavior of the mate yet visions for the behavior of the made in that conclude a a stalking following acting into i fun or or computers o a monitoring a the behavior of mate poachers looking at i contact between other men an your partner there the whole suite of things that you have iris involved in in vigilance a and then at the other extreme and we talk about things in between the other extreme is violence and in my new book a when men behave badly have the whole chapter on intimate partner violence and this is a a what i argue in this is really unfortunate and ism not adore it is illegal it is bad do not do it but people engage in intimate partner violence a in america something twenty eight to thirty per cent of all people who are married will experience intimate partner violence in their in their relationship is not a trivial percentage an that violence is between the to part in the two partners yes a there is also violence that gets directed to r potential mate poachers but that is that is a somewhat separate issue a be one of the things that is functional about the violence is that it tends to reduce perceived an mate value discrepancies another of us say it is a i an guides tend to engage in the violence more than women do although some argue that there is more equality in the violence on but and a minima men tend to do more damage when they do the violence and when you tried about violence is this ever emotional violence i mean the there is that as well and in fact that two tend to be correlated in my studies of married couples om verbal violence is a good predictor a physical violence happening as well one things that happen just to give a concrete example guys will start insulting their partner's appearance you are you are really looking ugly to day your your thighs a heavy or yow not looking her good the try to integrate the woman's appearance which is a key component of woman's mate value the trying to a just more closely the mate value disrupt yet there trying to reduce her perceive self received mate value if if lets a he is is six she is in aid and he can convince her that she is actually only a sex a then she is get e more likely to stay with them very diabolical it is terribly diabolical but the fact is women do not feel good about themselves om when they get a beaten up by their partner in fact it in in the cases where it leaves physical evidence in a women where sun glasses or turtle news or cover up the the bruises is as literally does lower the mate value of the women by i injuring her physical appearance and getting her to conceal herself stay home ye exact ye she is taking her out of the the literally take reducing her visibility right and and that is actually one of the predictors of violence is if he starts doing things other than violence cutting off for relationships with her friends in her family trying to suggest or her i and prevent her from getting exposed to potential other other other partners and it is a very diabolical but i think important understand the the potential functionality of of intimate part or violence what about it as star to interrupt again but a just curious a oftentimes who out inch will say interrupt too often but i want to make sure that do not miss it an opportune to ask you about the intimate partner violence in the other direction female to male where steritipically speaking that the opportunity for physical violence is still there but the the idea in mind is that i it would be more of a psyche logical nature although i think there is evidence that hat some women beat their husbands ye but it ism guessing it yo not is frequent or my although well different studies it depends on whether you just simply count up acts or whether you look at the damage it is done an and as i mention men tend to do more physical damage their shelters for battered women all over the country as far as i know there's one for battered men now it may be and this is partly true that men are a more ashamed if they get beaten up by their partner clock with a frying pan i and ait is possible and there is evidence that police do not take it as seriously there is one case that i report in my book where a guy a called the police and his wife a condom with something and a police shows up and he says the if she is much as broke a finger nail in this altercation they will charge you and not her and there is a there is a a police on bias a potential police bus in this and there may be underreporting of women beating up men as a consequence a zebu the motivations are often different one is that male sexual jealousy will trigger him to attack his partner and then she will use physical violence to defend herself she might pick up and a frying pan or or or weapon of some sort to defend herself and the motivation is his sexual jealousy on his part but self defense on her part and that accounts for some unknown percentage of the cases and in some cases it is women who were outrage when they discover their partners ben having sext with some one else an infidelity o of a sexual financial or emotional nature and there is some female to male violence that absolutely occurs abut the the reduction of a perceive mate value discrepancy is a key function from male perspective not again not that he thinks about this he is just angry and wants to her her but but here heres one other thing that is really interesting at about the intimaparter violence and that is the specificity of it depending on circumstances and namely when the woman gets pregnant she is more vulnerable to physical violence and when the man suspects that he is not the father of that pregnancy he is more likely to direct the violence toward blows to her demon it is that is that is specific and in that case the function is is hypostasis function is determinate the pregnancy by a rival male was opposed to deterring the woman from committing an infidelity or from leaving the relationship entirely that is why one function vent a part or violence's is just sequestering woman in keeping her all to himself a it is both to prevent infidelity and to prevent defection i have a a friend a who a wife told me a that if she if he cheats it'll kill him that is what she said a but it is shall just much easier to keep him very very busy and a and that statement now it leaps to mine because of what your descry sing that there many tactics by which people can engage this effort to reduce the mate value discrepancy not all of which are overtly violent yo to some are but all of which are designed to constrain their behavior right right yet these words to these which fall under what i would call mate retention tactics only one or two of which a fall under the violence category tether even a yet a a within partner psychological manipulations about these things o their psychological manipulations about perceived mate value a no one else would want you i you know our your loser there is denegation of partner within the relationship a even feigning anger to make the partner feel guilty a say looking at some one else u there is all all kinds of a interesting warfare that goes on within relationships to manipulate perceptions of these thing this is some creating a much too hated view of romance and love oh no we will get to the the the happy endings and and i mind there certainly many happy relationships out there i as a nor scientist i hear about this and and the a immediacy of of how people let's fall into a a pattern or jealousy or a a pattern of cheating and not always but and and i just speaks to a bring circuitry that is of alive to protect something and a ism sure this statement is a not exhaustive but i think it is accurate to say that every species but a i especially humans wants to make more of itself and protect its young but these issues of fraternity and a resourceolication i i think their vital and yet i look for to a day where evolutionary psychology and nor science are a con merge at the level of of underlying mechanism but i do not think it is a dark i think it is just the the way rewired that some won a speaking of dark a could you tell us about the dark try at yes the dark triads that we have been talking about sex differences on average but there are critical within sects individual differences and the dark treat is one of the most important ones the dark treat consists of three personality characteristics narcissism machuvalianism and psychopathy hallmarks of narcissism are things a grandiosity person thinks that there more intelligent were a tractive more dazzling more charming than the actually are i think the the greatest persons in slice bread a importantly with narcissism you also get a sense of entitlement a to they feel entitled to a larger share of the pie whether that be the financial pie the statistic or the sexual pie a a machuvalianism a is high score ten to pursue an exploited give social strategy they might fain cooperation but then she on subsequent moves a they view other people as plans to be manipulated for their owninstrumental gains a and then psychopathy one of the marks of psychopathy is a lack of empathy most people have a normal empathy circus were if a child falls down and gets her we feel compassion for the harm that that person is undergoing were if a a poppy gets a hit by a care whatever we feel compassion a psychopath don't though that is those highers emits a dimensional thing it is not a categorical thinks o this high and psychopathy a basically lack empathy a and if you combine these qualities and narcissism psychopathy amachian van macivanism you you have a what some very bad dudes and i say bad duce good intend to score her in these things than women especially on the psychopathy dimension when you talk about clinical levels of psychopathy it is a estimated to be something one percent of women about for percent of of man's a men a are much higher and that wisest important well it is important in the aiding contact because a those who ware high and dark treat traits tend to be a a sexual deceivers for once of their very often very charming a very good seducing women and then abandoning them sometimes with a after fleecing them a or draining their bank account a they are very good at a at the art of seduction a they are also tend to be sexual harassers serial sexual passers an sexual coercers a a when it comes to forms of sexual violence a hydra try guises tend to be perpetrators of this and most men i think a would be find it ethically abhorrent to sexually harass say a woman in the workplace dark treat guises import maybe they feel entitled to it and and and import they do i mean some cases that i report in the book there literal descriptions where the guys are writing in these journals i i knew she was attracted to me and that that is why she she met me in the a zero's room just when i was there to she wanted to admire my bulging biceps or whatever is all about them they ye hey they they the in this gets into a bias that i talk about which is the the male sexual misperception by us where women smiles at a man man thinks out she is she wants my body she is attracted to me and women are thinking ism just being friendly on being polite or professional a but these guys high dark try guys are more susceptible to the a sexual over perception by us and they literally believe that the woman is attracted to them and sending them signals green light a two sexually approach a and if you combine dark dark try rats with the disposition pursuit of a short treating strategy that is an especially deadly commination that is when you get sexual harassment sexual coercion these these are very bad dates a also a predictors of intimate partner violence what what approximate frequency in the male population or these have all three the dark tried traits and i realize the thought a continuum s a yet that is was that's that is why i cannot say out as they are on a continuum and it is sort of arbitrary were you where you draw the line a but but i think it is a it is a minority of men it is a subset of men who commit the vast majority of these acts of sexual violence and that is why it is not if you if you look victims of sexual violence they're more numerous than the perpetrators of sexual violence because the perpetrators tend to be serial offenders to speak one guy in the work place harassing fifteen different women one guy sexually coercing in a multiple women such what you have a in well known cases in the news carved wine steam probably over a hundred different women a bill combe gjeffrey absent some cities a more famous cases these are large number of victims but pretty much souls a you o perpetrators an and there is no question that these guys a alike garvey wine steal jeffrey have sting were definitely high and a tread traits a you mentions talking briefly a say we could just talk about a a some of the less known features about stalking i i think i once heard you give a lecture where you said that a one of the carious things about stalking is that sometimes it works yes ye well staking a has multiple motivations but one of the most frequent motivations is a a a mating motivation were either the there is a break up and the women dumps the guy and the guy does not wan to get don't you wants to maintain a relationship with her and i should say that and when it comes to criminal stalking there's a huge sex difference about eighty present of the stalkers tend to be men bout twenty percent women there is there are woman's stalkers but there a a about a fourth the number compared to to men the motivation of the guys tends to be either an attempt to get back together with the women either sexually or in a relationship or and wore to interfere with her future making prospects i and it works in in some of the time in two senses one is it does interfere with her attempts to remote a in fact it scares off some guise you show up and to pick up a woman at her apartment for a date and her her exam sitting out there glaring at you or a add am i should familiar with the circumstance where early in in a relationship somebody mentions that in acts has made am failed threats about surveillance for instance yes i i that she had to happen several times in my dating history where some one would say you ka star t opening up about previous relationships a little bit as appropriate in someone says yet he mention that he was on as send someone around to to survive me that kind of thing which is a very interesting am faction to pick up in a but i hurt it enough times and people i know have reported ta hearing this enough times did i am guessing the that is probably more frequent than people actually trailing people in cars an things of that sort but planting that it is a the psychological o yes surveillance is is a form of of harassment in some son yes absolutely i think the rein there is that planting the psychological seeds but then also with surveillance a some surveillers remained hidden you do not know necessarily i i confess in this case it did not act as a deter for continuing the relationship that is what am but that is another story how often do women respond have to put this in quotes a for those there listening air quote and quote positively to told mean how often does it work to a rescue the partner after they have been broken ell in in our studies it is a minority of cases that it works to a re establish i think something fifteen per cent of the time that it works either to temporarily reestablish a sexual relationship or lure the woman back in for more paentrelationship most of time it does not work but m a one woman in our study said the guy every time she went out with another go he would threaten the other guy and she said after about six months there were another guise he basically scared off all the other guise and she went back to i because there were no other guise around i i experience this won a was in college i lived in a small town very population dense ill of this you see saint barber and there was a couple where every time am this woman would date when he basely beat up whoever the new suitor was and pretty soon know on go near them they got a reputation as the contiscitin dance couple and indeed it work i a it worked in the sense the it a no one dare go near her and they ended up together i this o have seen real life examples of this yea it happens but but it is it is an in general not an not a successful start oh known it is not one ism suggesting give ora shock to learn that cause we hear stalking and we we have this a there is one very extreme image of it but the underlying motivations i think a a a reveal something about a you meeting dynamics yean i think that the circumstances are often a mad value discrepancy where the go realizes correctly that he will be unable to replace her with a made of equivalent made value we were in some cases in any mate gets locals she she was with me once may be she i can get her back with me again a the psychology is very understandable but abut it tends intends not to work because and another thing we found we to study two thousand five hundred victims of stockings is with joshton the former student mind who now a professor in a criminology department and what we found is there were large a sex to large differences between the sucker and the victim of the sticker where where the sticker tends to be much lower in made value then the victim and basically the is typically the woman who realizes she can do a low better on the making market and the guy realizes i am never going to be able to replace her a with a with a woman of equivalent mad value and am going to used is last rich desperate measured o try to get her back and occasionally at works a in thinking more about this fa ate a mate value a thing this is is number the metric they at ten six a whatever it is a and made value discrepancy playing such a strong role in in all these dynamics a i should have asked is earlier but what is the impact on a mate value perceived or real a of a woman having already had children a for instance a there friends of mine who are married in divorce wo have children often post pictures of themselves with their children in their own line profiles because it shows a a strong sense of paternal instinct a there the puppy thing a a people with dogs or puppies at demonstrating care at a capacity to care and and forcaretaking a in women the the opposes also true women children show capacity it demonstrates fertility at least at at one point perhaps still a fertility that still present a does it positively negatively er neutrally impact a woman to already have children when seeking a another mate regardless of whether not she was married or had the children out of witness a general rule it decreases her mate value because kids with another made or viewed as a cost not not a benefit and there a cost on multiple a a dimensions one of which there going to be a cost to the guy a because he is can to have to invest resources a time attention forth but also apportion of her effort and resources are going to be devoted toward kids who were not genetically related to him and which is one reason why step families there is off a lot of conflict within step families very explicable from an evolutionary perspective incus o in general it is a cost not a benefit sometimes it can be a benefit sad y i know one case were woman got to more she had two kids and she ended up successfully making with a guy who was also divorce and had primary custody of his two kids and there was a compatibility there but is a general rule it will decrease a woman's and the man's mate value to have kids especially kids who are financial who were young and financially dependent a but what happens is less ay the woman would be in aid without kids a guy who is a six might be able to attract her a a and might feel lucky a to attract her because there is no way he would have been able to attract or under other conditions but a that is why the display of effort investing in her kids is often a making tactic hes showing up am willing to invested in kids an going to sacrifice and they essence become equivalent in mate value a as a result of that but a will she be able to attract on average other bites o less likely but the same is true of guises and this is why the the the the reason that affects women more than men is cause more custody tends to go with women that is the kid women tan have greater custody and women tend to invest more in the kids a throughout their lives a now there other things alimony and child support payments and forth but a all the women have talked to add fact to one of whole along with many women about this they view a guy with kids as a cost not a benefit unless the kids are old enough in they have left home and and fun no longer financially dependent and everything you just described a is consistent with with what you said earlier which is that with subsequent marriages ere as men get older the tendency is to a seek mates that are progressively younger right right because there is a higher a lower probability they will already have children if there if there much all right right an there an and if the guys successful if he has status and resources and as other qualities associated with higher mate value than he will remain attractive to younger women i realize it is not your specific area of expertise but these days there is a lot of discussion about ut how really childhood attachment to parents influences mate choice later on this a can a general categorization of avoiding and anxious and anxious avoiding and all this kind of thing and again a putting my hat on as a nurse scientist i think it it make sense that the nor circuits for for attachment in childhood would be somehow partly or in whole purpose for other forms of attachment we do not just tend it say do not get that brain circuitry was for when i was a kid and leman acutance all develop this new attachment circuitry ism guessing it evolves and and what not but u is there anything interesting about a that about childhood attachment strategies vies of the stability of long turn partner choice or that too big a veep for us to make here ye well i may like an offer a some sir inform speculation about it and and as you pun is not my mere expertise but i know a little bit about it and a i may i think that secure attachment style if both partners have a secure attachments not as conducive to a long term mastership am avoidance attachment styles avoiding people tend tea you have more difficulty with intimacy and also higher probability of infidelity a and n anxious attachment style i do not know can a create the problems of its own an overly clingy dependent absorbing what what i call high relationship below s o another mutation load which we all have certain reputation there is a in a a parasite load there is also what i call relationship below what is the baggage to someone brings to the relationship and probably correlated with the frequency of demand of immediate text message response why think white frequency of demand the the latent the expected low latency of text message responses yea plays out u consistently in relationships really on there is a very low expectation of response and then as people get attached depending on their level of anxiety if they do not hear back from somebody really quickly where the mind goes is i is a very interesting aspect a d you become suspicious you become anxious can you stabilize your own internal miles what you war d you need to see not not that i coming back it'd love to see a study on that son ya yet yet that is a good one and and o o my intuition suggest that your prediction about that would would pan out thereof be theinsecure that would really be yin getting upset if there were if there were not that immediate response to the ten i have a friend a female friend who deliberately cote and cote using her language trains her u potential partners to be comfortable with a variable response latency but then i asked her if she is comfortable with a variable responselaand she said absolutely not there is any symmetry at least in that case am this is almost certainly a more rare circumstance but a it'd be remiss if i did not ask about unconventional relationships am these days a i do not think it is just by virtue of living in californium you hear more and more about a monogamist a supposed to monogamous a and various forms of apollyamory that may e may not include the armory part a you do not asses in permission a based on a season circumstance and a priorinfidelities oka somebody had a mishap early on you have one a pass to i grand you hear this kind of language getting thrown around ana and it is intriguing to me because it it seems an an effort to a my pass some of the more a if you will hard wired or at least culturally hard wired aspects of mate choice in sexual partner choice a acknowledging jealousy but confronting it by allowing your partner to be with somebody else for instance a i i confess i have friends wo have in conventional relationships i friends with conventional relationships a any thoughts on the pollyamry yet yet i do have a couple of thoughts on it i have not studied it extensively but am i think that the way i would phrase it is that there's an attempt to am overcome a certain evolves a features of our mating psychology but often in the service of other aspects of relating psychology what i mean by that is this folk about pollyamery first of all there's a sex difference on a to on average that is men are more likely to want to initiate apollyamerous relationship than women there are lots of exceptions and i actually no of a at least one exception personally friends friends of mine who were in apolyameras relationship but the motivation for men is that evolve desire for sexual variety a it gives him access to wider variety of sex partners which is part of our evolve sexual psychology especially for men women one motivation a women also have a desire for sexual variety on average tends not to be as great as that of men but also have it but some women agree to apollyamous relationship as a mate retention tact that that is this guy in order to keep em she has to agree to the relationship and and the motivations for engaging apolyamery are somewhat sex differentiated on average on average on average cures lots of exception now when it comes to sexual jealousy there is this recognition that there an mi the way that i would frame wit resist evolved emotion were we a a tigers sexual jealousy senor p tramming sect were imagining yer partner having sex or befalling in love with someone else and but interestingly and there have not been studies on this but i know of this one polymerous couple where they reported to me a both of them reporting me she said she does not but it does not bother her at all of her husband they are married has sex with other women she they allow it i think it is every thursday night or whatever they have the different couples have different rules a but one time she saw him walking down the street hand in hand affectionately with ha former girl friend and she got extremely jealous because it signaled an emotion of connection the sexual envmother the emotional did she happened to be by sexual and she a and her partner said that it really upset him when she slept with other men but it was fined if she sleep with other woman when i thin that's a fairly common thing that i among the men that i know that ere inpolyamerous relationships that yet that is a fairly come yet he kept trying to n the this the interesting a manipulations trying the encourage her to sleep with other women but not with men and in her case of encouraging him not to get emotionally involved with other women but the sex was outlet i think that i think that in the modern environment in a we we have a very rich and complicated evolve making psychology and what were doing in these novel forms or semi novel cause these things have a pretty deep history themselves a a that we we were attempting to marine some of our evolve desires while men while keeping quiescent other revolved aspects of our sexual psychology jealousy satisfying her desire for sexual variety but keeping jealousy at bay and different couples doe in different ways o as you as you alluded to i know one couple where liven lot angles and the women from the woman said she gives her husband vision have an affair sleep with other women as long as outside of the city limits of let an having this other couple wits has to be thursday night what is different people have different tern restraints o but the constraints a r a specific and somewhat arbitrary to the relationship yet yet the specific in and and often in polymerous relations people talk it out and and come to an agreement o what is acceptable on what is out abounds o but but in a way i mean it in a way it is just we cannot change our evolved sexual psychology i do not think what we can dos we can activate certain elements of it and keep others quiescent and om and that and that is all good in a in a way we we do in the modern environments i even to take it outside a polymer a pornography a widely con used in ant photography what what is that do whether is a big sex different their men tend to consume an a lot more than women the forms of the pornographer are different but in a way the pornography what it does is it parasitize man's evolved desire for sexual varieties they can in some in some sense psychologically experience sexual dishes variety of different women sexually without actually doing by just looking at their computer screen and in a way what you another way of phrasing at is that we create modern novel cultural inventions in ways that satisfy or evolved desires in our evolve sexual desires that is interesting with the of explosion of i of unlike prodigy have a colleague get stamford in psychiatry on olempki who studies the dopa mean system and she mention two things of interest one is that u not only as their tremendous variety of of a experiences that are available to people to view in pornography but the in the intensity is also quite hi much that at least for young people who are observing a lot of pornography it is possible in their studies looking at this now that their brain circuits become wire to observing sexual acts as supposed to being engaged in them which can be extremely problematic it is a it is a sharp blade to speak am the pornography thing it is not what it once was in its evolving quickly a very interesting a how should one frame all this i imagine the number of people listening are in relationships or or would would hope to be in a relationship in terms of understanding what we are selecting for consciously or subconsciously a it seems their common themes it is a people want to feel attractive and attracted e people want to make sure that their stability of the relationships when we hear about security often times i think of this kind of warm oxytos an cere tone and a thing but bat this mate value thing seems powerful in all this assessing mate value how objective are people about assessing their own am value in terms of finding securing and overtime maintaining our relationship securing is dynamic because people age at different rates is there a a a in objective metric of the stuff i guess you get a lot of statistics about somebody is image and you fight come up with avast at average value based on the population but how should people assess themselves because it seems one of the features that would be very powerful for leading to happiness of of good partner selection that stable were you one does not have to resort to these maccavilian or diabolical or anytime other stages would be to be very honest with oneself and how does on do that o great questions a and and i do not think that the science has all all the answers a couple things one is that i think people are generally pretty good at self assessing mate value a and even a self esteem has been hypothesized to be one internal a monitoring device that tracts made value we get a promotion at work or we get raisins as we feel an elevated sense of self esteem we get fire we get rejected we get ostriches ourself esteem plumes on ourself a valuation i think does tract mate value to some extend there are people who over estimate their ate value people hinarcicism a particular in particular a and some people under estimate their ate value another important element is that there's congenital mate value that is if you ask a group of a hundred people there is fair amountican senses that this persons in mate that persons as six but there are also individual differences in mate value one example as i know woman who a professor and she places a high premium on guise who are deeply steeped in russia literature which she is that she can have inept conversations about russia literature note to young men learn russia literature we well but this is high and it is a dimension of mate value this important for hers but probably not important for a lot of other people and where is other people what say might be less at your into football or a were some sport than and other partner think sports are stupid then that is someone whose also disports can be higher in mate value for you there these individual differences in componisimate a which is good cause that means if every one were going after the same people and there was total consensus on mate value than there would be a lot of a a dateless people and a lot of problems in the world a lot of dissatisfied people at both are important the congenital aspects and the individually different differentiated components of of mate value a but ain terms of accuracy of assessment it it is there are not no good measures scientifically to to do this because it is it is sufficiently complicated i mention were mention may be ha may be a dozen different components of mate value a physical attract in this kindest emotional stability health status et camera a and and and these are not the only ones i teach a course on psychology of human mating and i ask the people it is a large course couple under people tell me what do women want in a mate and i started with the blackboard this is back in the old days when there as a blackboard a piece of shock they say i want a mate who has a good sense of humors a right sense of humor intelligent right him time and i go through this and i go through five blackboards and then i run out of space over what women want i do the same for men and men count o run out of space after about blackboard and the half but but what that tells me is that these qualities are large in number and complicated in nature you say you want a guy who is a nice and generous it is a ya a guy who at the end of every month takes his whole paycheck and gives it to the the why know a homeless person well know not that generous an generous toward me but not tor it everyone else nice in general but not nice that they are getting exploited or even in another something you cannot be too healthy people it that is unit mention but you want a guy women want a got whose confident but not too confident and cause too confident womeanngs either arrogant or sadistic or not sufficiently manipulable i m a enemas my point is that because there is many different components of mate value and that they very in a mount as not just listing the qualities in summing a mop theyvout very in amount is a very complicated a endeavor to assess accurately but i think people have a good intuitive sense a people's relative mate value specially if you you are in a group and you have been able to interact with them for a long time and one indication is a again that attention structure how many other peoplereally want a mate with this person that is a good cue that they are high an mate value nobody wants to mate with you then cue that your low in mate value win's me of the time when a one is trying to decide photo ask to the prom there is a there is a complicated assessment based on who one would to go with whether not your already partner who would say yes who would say no because there is a there is a risk in rejection too because that o if ism guessing correctly would would can lower one's own perceived mate you van he rejected right frequency of rejections probably does not lend itself well to increasing mate a one's on view of their mate value i which o which is why why many guides have what i call a making anxiety that is they they do not approach him because they risk getting shot down they are trying to maintain that number a in the by reducing the amount of data right yet very bar's that it is but it it is it is a in back fires in the modern environment there is a famous psychologist alert ell's who had making anxiety and he assigned himself the task o approaching asking i c an't remember what the number was but a say fifty women out on dates he lived in new york city as they lot of women he could to stand still in the altering a n a and the assigns of ask fifty women on a date every e every week and he said after two weeks has made n anxiety disappear with most of them said bad off creep a but he did ops action getting rejected did not cause my world the collapse and the actuary was a cant he kind of injured himself to this rejection and on it ended up by the end that have doing quite well in his mating life another point for corny of behavior diseases action yes exactly he demand the experiment just a couple more questions really a you mentioned self deception base deception and we are something of that sort self deception that people are not always trying to convince somebody else of something that secretly they know is not true but that they deceive themselves i yo relish on that a little at but this is actually this hypothesis is a the famous evolutionary biologist robot rivers first advance this hypothesis and the preface a nineteen a seventy six to docking book the selfish been and the any subsequently written a written more about it a but in scientific article and in a more popular book but the ideas that if a door ideas that successful deception is facilitated by self deception if you really believe that an the acts then you arguing to be a more successful salesmen to convince other people of acts o if you believe you are lets say a ten and mate value you truly believe it even if you are not men to have a more successful time convincing you that i am as well and the hypothesis is basically that people self deceive in order to a increase the effectiveness of of actual deception a but i think that there people who on r or or in one other mention it'll mention to is that as that animals often take each other at our own word for thinks if we are self confident people assume that we must have the goods to back up that self confidence if we are a quivering mass of insecurity people believe well we do not have the goods to back up anything and people use other people's displays of their self confidence as a cue to to their goods and it is gent in general pretty reliable cube but than their over estimates an under estimates as we have talked about with narcissism yet we see the suit the job candidates ye you you are taught to look very carefully at the application and consider all aspects but ultimately you consider that also in light of how firmly some one believes in the vision of what they are trying to bring to the profession and u and tot's a i think o largeliest of conscious process being aware of it can be helpful a but now when somebody is confident you and to think they are going to get where they say they are going to go and it and it acts as a bit of a of a heuristic for not meeting the impulses that one then does not need to go that all the information quite as carefully but if i guess if one is aware of it than to to dig deeper in to because it seems there is a lot of deception going e ye ye well and and a and and a something we talk about earlier people iron psychopathy are very good at a at deception i do not know whether they are good self deception or whether there just really good deceivers an but they can be very effective and about in californium you know you live out in californium ism sure you senor fair share of a cases that oh ye i think a into a cross to day's discussion and various examples pop to mind of a seen these features and humans it is interesting i i find the work that you do incredibly interesting i think this field of evolutionary psychology is fascinating and and m i hope i i said it before bat it'll say it again i feel your science and evolutionary psychology are aiding towards one another and it is only a matter of time before a they merge in in some a formal way i in there is the work for instance on polygamist fess monotomiusts prairievols and levels of these oppressing but it is a big leap to go from these oppressing in a prairie of all i know disrespect to that beautiful work but to humans and say a vase oppressing in hail is are going to make you monogamist or something i think that is a the pro get the direction the effector on but you you get the ye ye n to your absorb right and and i think it it will happen i think it is starting to happen and and it will happen because a getting at the narrow science is getting at the underlying mechanisms that a driving the process what an evolutionary perspective brings to bear is is evolve function a and ultimate explanation the selective forces that created adaptations the functions of those adaptations and the narrow science brings for what is the underlying machinery that these mechanisms are instantiated in i wonderful to collaborate some day may we will do a brainimmaging study on jealousy or something in a i dononn't throw it you are you are the psychologies you would come up with the beautiful experimental design a ism certain that people are wat going to want to learn more about your work a certainly we will give them links to your social media and a other sights you have written a tremendous number of really interesting books am tell us about your most recent book and maybe some of the others that if people are interested in these topics and they want to learn more that they could a explore sure a o case well my most recent book is is called by wen men behave badly the hidden roots of sexual deception harassment and a soul in that book deals with conflict between the sexes sexual conflict and it deals with h them a both in what wat or a what i call mating market conflicts at some of the topics we have been talking about deception in internet dating and things that second is conflict that occurs within mating relationships of the sort that we have been talking about as well financial in fidelity emotional and fidelity sexual infidelity coping with conflict within relationship and actually have some suggestions for strategies for coping with conflict within a relationship coping in the after a dealing with the aftermath of break ups s often there is in a symmetry one person must to break up the other dozen talk about coping in the aftermath and then i also talk in this book a when then behave badly about some of the a darker sides of human mating into ma partner violence a stalking sexual harassment sexual coercion s that is what that books about and i think it a it is gotten well reviewed and people find it very useful and understanding what is otherwise a a lot of baffling phenomena in a why do men and women seem at odds with each other in many domains why to some of the recurrent forms of sexual conflict occur s that is what that books about a my previous books of my my first book which have had the good fortune to be able to revive a couple times a deals more broadly with human mating strategies called the evolution of desire strategies of human mating and gives people abroad over view of what people wanting a made a tactics of attraction tactics of mate retention and wore throughout the whole mating process serial mating causes of divorce and forth a and then a even more broadly i have a text book called evolutionary psychology the new science of the mind which a is in it sit edition right now and is that the most widely used text book involutionary psychology around a north america and rope and and and extuallyhatspeent transom even into arabia and other countries o that deals somewhat with mating but also deals with survival problems a evolved fires and phobias a a issues about kin and family extended family friendships social hierarchy status hierarchies a a warfare another topics o the evolutionary psychology text book is the broadest book and then may be the second broadest is the evolution of desirous strategies of human mine a mating and then for those interested in conflict between the sexes the latest book when men behave badly fantastic a i love your work a ism grateful for the clarity and depth and rigor with which you do it and ya and you convey it to us i know a i speak for many people when i one to say thank you this is a tremendously formative conversation thank you husband a delight to talk with you and i e we do engage in that a research collaboration emerging infra

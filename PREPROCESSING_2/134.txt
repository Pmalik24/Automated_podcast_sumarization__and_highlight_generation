flora governor on to sanity suspends e gorge sorts back prosecute for failing to prosecute crime dine gets cold cock by the market and by comics is the new coke of economics programs i benshupero this is venhpirit so the shows ponserbaxpress the piano and stand up against betel protect or data pestupiandicom flesh men well there is some politicians who say there on to do the thing and then their some politicians to actually do the thing while rondo mantis continues to do the thing at least where he has the ability to in the state of florid and yet another headline that is going to make tin your times go nuts the headline to day to starts suspends second elected prosecutor in floats what exactly happened here well the governor has the ability to suspend certain public officials for failing to do their job and yesterday governor do mantis suspended the upstate prosecutor in organdy he accused herofren competence an selective duty for he charactrisis lenient against silent criminals is a forty page report from the governor's office demonstrating her lack of a prosecuting crime she of course is a gorge sorrow back prosecutor she is somebody who is in favor of a sensually decriminalizing crime and here is the governor announcing her suspension yesterday on equal els administration of criminal just is in the nine spirit has been clearly and fundamentally derived as to constitute both neglactiv duty and in competence the policies er practice is listed in our executive order a suspending her a code constitutes the grounds o suspension a as follows a one a pattern practice to avoid minimum mandatory sentences for gun crimes patterned practice to avoid minimomanditory sentences for drug trafficking offenses patterned practice allowing juvenile offenders to avoid serious charges and in car sedation altogether patterned practice to avoid valid applicable sentencing in enhancements partner practice limiting charges for chat pornography partner practice for seeking with help with holding of the medication in situations not permitted pander florid law now superposing right superaccept this is the stuff that actually moves the ball forward in terms of making people's lives better in places organdy because the fact is that the place were she presided which would be the ninth circuit in florid had eight as per centare dropped of cases non prosecution cases forty two per cent of theft refuels that were made to her office were then dropped by her office forty two per for in ten and governors sent says well that is literally not going you job you are ropes you prosecute crime now the way the media play this is of course that it into partisan hitjob quote the move was the governor's latest aggressive use of executive power against local officials of the opposing political parties just to be clear it is really bad when governor do mantis sides to fire a prosecutor in organdy for failing to prosecute crime that is it that to misuse of executive power to go after an opposing political official when you are the president of the united states and yourdepartment of costs goes to after the person who's currently leading the primaries in the opposing party over crimes that when done by members of your own party were completely exonerate an whitewashed when that happens that is just good law enforcement when merit garland goes afternonal true good lawinforcement when rondistants as fires a prosecute for not doing a job political had job according to our wonderful media toe wants suspended monk corral the elected state attorney of flora's ninth judicial circuit which in clues orange and o shall counties and sited as reasons her handling of three cases and a low over all in carcerationrate among other things hither second time in a year that de mantis has done this but to be fair this also happens to be a period in which a bunch of prosecutors got put in place who do not rescue crinfact things have gotten bad on crime that hilariously enough a dc council person yesterday literally suggested that the national guard be called into washington to see to stop crime which is hilarious because your member that tenter tom cotton of arkansaw rode an of ad in the middle of riot summer twenty twenty suggesting the ay be the national guard need to be call in to to quell riots and this ended with the firing of the pad editor of the york times even peering to run a pease suggesting that thing now you have dc council meters are suggesting the same thing about washington d c itself the mantis said that they charge cases in this particular district an ways that would avoid all of the monitory minimum sentences for both gun and drug trafficking crimes the allowed juvenal to avoid serious charges or in incarceration he said prosecutors have a certain about of discretion about which cases to bring which not to bring this state attorney has abuse that discretion as an effectively nullified certain laws in the state of florid the governor then appointed drew ban a judge from the same judicial circuit to take world place world can appeal her suspension to the republican controlled state senate or go to the florid supreme court unlikely that she a she is going to win that case she will be the new mason b c hero of the day because that is the way that this works if you do not performing drop or if you disrupt the system a tenners state legislator who just the sizes to lead a quasi riot into the middle of the tenners state legislature then mason be you'll make you a hero if then your stript of certain legislative privileges here was the organdy state a tourney depose a suggesting that don the big prom heres that the cobs gave to want is the info ad that the conspire the problem because the cops action went to the governors office out were referring all the crimes o none of none them a getting prosecute shut the cops are the badges see where normal people come from the cops are the good guise in the criminals badges i also want o point out that in workmen has play in bi roll and living the governor the a pertain that he ta for to the for a the pension why well it'll tell you why because when i ran i prom a flow northern a con of silty anti ti had the conte turned we croficuted too then mill a trial terrorist on the corridor community and he wen the talk under my administration and the lord o ora pile wit cat about it you hare the cops of us an backhand i can only assume a he political allies it is for of noting here that she let out of jail people who went on to commit violent crimes when its at an veal a twenty eight fourfold man killed by a can of police officers sturdy after he had shot n critically injured two other officers on fridge night evil had posted banned earlier the were after being charge with sexual battery of fourteen year old girldnas the cantiperson the world was letting out a prison the other case is involved a man who shot and kills his pregnant girl friend after having been released while facing charges including carrying a concealed fire around school property and man who is con evicted f armed robbery in sentence to fifty one weeks in jail as ha youthful offender warrant then went on in this press conference to talk a horonasensis was de strong democracy because democracy is where he get elected to a prosecution position and then refused to prosecute he needed to get acid a into confide a e e e a i a an he will have a coolish that to day he will be in i is inti are fine ill a i knee it a mock e n the take of florid i gat anna and then she continued by suggesting of course that d mantis is what she called a week dictator which is weird since he just fires either he is a strong to tutor who just try too a sea is e week eye did not fire you it is cannot weird to be a a week dictator by the way she finished this press conference by em putting up her fist anti power which has just a great way for a prosecutor to go y an your the laietur in i in is there an ai tin by a we other antathat well i mean it did change that you are no longer the state prosecutor mean that there there is that pagan rondissans is doing the things in florid that are necessary for people in florid to live a a better life this the part of the decants campaign that has been far kind of lacking is the fact that the basis is act very good and lek tee basics of governing in sate of florid meaning wen a bridge that is taken out by hurricane the thing is back up within days make ta highways work here the police are able to do their jobs here when a prosecutor fails to do her job she gets fired in the state of florid and that bred and butter kind of stuff is the reason that de sans is very popular in the state of florid all of the fighting of weakness all of the sort of controversial policy positions that de basis has taken on top of that that that sort of the icing on the cake but the cake is that de basis act very god governing and this i something that re publican voters ought to think about going forward when a comes time to vote in primaries is is dona trump going to learn the lessons of his first presidency and is he then going to be good at the bred an butter kind of stuff or is it just going to be a repeat of the first presidency in which esse did not do any the bred and butter kind of stuff whose can of the people around him doing all that and he mistreated a lot because if you actually wish to see the left lose the thing that you actually need is for the rights to be good at the actual business of governing know how to weed power ineffective ways the sans is doing thensaid he is not the only one a bran camping in georgia is very good at at the effective use of power glen yon can in virgin seems to b using powerwell but the mantis he is using it in a very powerful weight in the state o flora that is something again that sure factoring to how re publicans consider voting in a primary because it turns out being president is not just about what you say it is about what you are able to do and very often do from defends to miss staffing his ad ministration is that he was betrayed well to great would not be betrayed is to staffer ad ministration properly in the first place in the way the u see fits either you think that trump learns and using the at bettered on the job the second time around or you have doubts we will get to more on this in just one second because dinner is now paying the price for the woke cultural battles they have ben fighting we will gets that momentarily first company is looking out for you in the actually greater service and do not charge you for this is great news for new and currents pure talk customers pure take just at a dated

aloft and i rely ism purtolksonat work to be good and it is go to puretolk to come slash apparel save an additional fifty per cent offyour very first month of covering right now pure talk again wireless four america by america organ meanwhile dinner is taking it directly in the teeth the your times of courses attributing us to larger market forces but the reality is that dinner has completely blown out a large segment of its username and tilt didn't s lost thousands of dollars from my family alone and normally and a given year i would take my family to dinner land over here it dinner world over here and flortout take them there at least three times probably over the course of the year and have fairly large family but cousins in everything r talking thousands of dollars the dinner has lost just for my family and i'veithere a massive bill motive multimillion dollar corporation but they're lot people for me they lot of people are not subscribing to dinner plus you've tough i otherwise would just watch the starwort content because dinner has decided to spit in the eye of it is consumer base and obvious that was highlighted by their conflict for no reason whatsoever with the state of florid over the cluster of sexual and doctrnation of children well now then your times reporting that sober tigers urgent to overhaul dinner came in to sharp relief on wednesday disney' streaming operation lost on hut five hundred and twelve million dollars in the most recent quarter bringing total streaming lost is since twenty nineteen when dinner plus was introduced more than eleven billion dollars dinner plus lost roughly eleven point seven million subscribers world wide in the three months that ended you life first for new total of a hundred forty six point one million all the decline came from low price version of dinner plus and indies they basically inflated their numbers by getting a bunch people to sign up for you o the starer package in india and then everybody basically dropped off because dinner lost to big for n the expense rights to india for merely cricket match matches excluding dis in excluding india dinner plus gained eight hundred thousand subscribers primarily over seeswithout rate of growth is not going to make up for the kind of close that day have been experiencing due to trimming tiger is now shifting the folks i dinner plus away from brisk subscriber growth which requires those big marketing campaigns instead dinner has been trying to make more money from dinner plus subscribers at already has by increasing the write another have the price in creases on the way starting on october twelfth the ad free personal cost fourteen dollars pool which is control by visit will begin charging eighteen buck for angry acts that is up from fifteen bucks as an incentive dine will begin selling a new trimming package avvrey acts to both dinner plus handful for twentybuk month starting on submember six now again one of the things that is happening here is that a lot of prospective customers people me have been dropping off it is really lowering their growth curve an leathern per cent in crease in profitability at dishes them park divisions despite weakness want dinner world an flora allowed the company to salvage the quarter to a degree but they are really getting cloth and other teen park operators and flora have seen attendants de lines historically when burgers get tight family cut back on expensive trips o dizzy abas inches that again there is a political aspect to this and here is a thing a marginal move on a major company makes a big difference everybody assumes the giant cane companies run extraordinary profit margins and that's not true it is not true the proper margins predicting the media business can be extremely slim and if you ding the prophet margin by a certain per centare if you alienate a certain percentage of your quart customer base that has really outsides ramifications for the broader market be cause remember valuation when it comes to public markets is always a multiple of the actual cash flow or the actual bit do of the company what that means is that if a company say has a a ghost in come a that the grow they take in is a billion dollars year that company's not valued and a billion dollars on public markets can get value to ten billion fifteen billion dollars on the public markets to pending on what industry n sector the company is in that means that if you ding that company by say fifty million dollars and it goes down from a billion to nine hundred fifty million if you do that than the multiple what say it is it a ten level is going to go down concomitantly at that fifty million is going tend up looking more five hundred million when it comes to the actual market cap of the company to genactury seriously ding a company in the public markets simply by alienating a certain segment of your customer bays and that is exactly what dinner has done by getting into this bleep fight whet governor to mantis the state of flora and more broadly parents across the country and we're only in to get worse by the way mean the fact the they are now doing woke snow white is upon know what their thinking over there or why they thing that is a growth area who are they catering to seriously are the earrings of the chines market it used to be that dishes that the big rap aging dishes that they were catering to the chines market by filming yulan in chonchang and ignoring the slave labor of museums and at least you could make the case on a market level that they were trying to appeal to note i the giant chines market but when they are deciding to make woke snow white with non p dwarves as the dwarves who exactly are they appealing to is not the chines market what is that clever they doing and the answer is that they of been victims of institutional capture by their own people and i assume that as the markets starts to to clinewill him by the economy momentarily that as the market starts tor lines business on to have to do what every other company is doing an the can t have to get rid of the lost leaders and guess what likeness is a lost leader it is a massive lost leader wrong tag ut to more on this in just one second first really really i portal for you have life interns an won for me hat life intern give o hundreds of milling up

meanwhile again the economic lakes here are blinking made things are not going to everyone is very saying when about the state of the economy i am significantly less sanguine about the state of the economy i know too many in festers wo are holding their money in a baying knowing that the economy is on raisers edge every one i talk to a in investment circles and i do a fair share of investing every one ism talking to is holding their money out the market right now because they do not know which way it is going togo well to day the consumer price insects came out again and i it set it some that price is rose three point two per cents in jury from a year ago junior recall ways down to three per cent which still fifty per cent higher then the fad seeks right the fed once to two per cent great of increase year on year that a sort of the melton freemen schicagos school idea that you if you if you constantly d in inflate toe currency and fly value that if you do that it is going to spur a certain level of mommy con summer spending and it is going to keep the wheels churning and all the rest fits imam sorted of henna school guy in in the sense that in i should believe in two per cent in elation rides of by the fat i thing we should see a zero per cent in facia rate from the fad and money should be work what money was worth ten years ago or twenty years ago and we should stop in floating away people savings but call me a classicist the fact is that two per cent is what we have aimed at for years and years and years last month you're on your commit at three per cents say that is fifty that is a full fifty per cent higher now i know that our minds have now been warped by the fact that we he ten per cent in elation for a while there thanks to supply chain thanks to covet and thanks you do bids in stationary monetary and fiscal policies but three per cent still way too high literally fifty per cent too high ospmust be to it is rate those last we are told those also well now it is three point two per cent you are on yore which means that the rate of increase continues to be too high an now the bringing down the rate of increase for nine per cent but it still at three point two per cent which by my calculation is still more than fifty per cent too high hen a monthly basis prices stacked up sure point to percent between tune injury economic say that the bump is linked two temporary factors including rebounding air line hotel and energy prices they are not likely to a rode long or term progress but are not that means at rode longer where motion n run back up to seven per cent but are we getting back down to two per cent the over all number was also higher because prices are being compared at the rates of in crease last jury the first month when inflation began to fall after a long climbed again that its still a price increase again if the curve looks sort of this that does not mean the here it somehow lower than here that is not correct if for those who cants hat ism doing my hand here es sensually ism drawing a curve the the version looks very steep and then search to shallow out but is still increasing were now at the swallowed out but still increasing rate of inflation in the united states and at still again fifty percent too high puchjose run from a out economic to warplanes in the grand scheme we are seeing disinflation and things are moving the resurrection if you look pass the vital categories underling ramentum has not change however ire re back to where we need to be obviously nit this is spurring talk that thefederal reserve is easily going to try to hold out here and not increase the interstates again but i do not see evidence that the rate is dropping down to two per cent without any further action by the federal reserve and this is we it seems the stock market is really vole or right nous can in going up it is going down is can a stick in around the same generalize level the reason for that is deep uncertainty about the impact of the policies the are being pursued right now again when when you look at over all measures of economic health what you are seeing is business disinvestment you are seen mortgage lending dry up you are seeing those those rates of interest on new mortgages go way way way up and eventually eventually when people start losing jobs because the money dries up that's can be a lot people hos star defaulting on tats and when the start defaulting on that's banks are on to take to head and wen those banks are in vest in bonds that is going to have some pretty significant bleed over effects war he broader economy if silken vallybank invested too heavily in government bonds and low interest bearing rates and then they got blown out began the higher interest race that the federal government was offering on its no bonds but that is cause the margins interns bonds where two they tacumany bonds in their portfolio well as banks actually start to experience significant default then those bondstha they have in the partfulergonalic worse and worse right now their operating we will see how that works out for them meanwhile joins out they are still tout and by anomies

jobidon continues to be out their pushing by comics by nomads i is another name for failure here is forbid an trying to push it yesterday it is just it remains incredible to me that this person who as

productive things on plan earth these giant windmills the r spending behind him you bid comics is a giant metal fan that chops up eagles that is that is pretty much correct meanwhile and what is by comic mean it means wasting money on a bunch of pain the to nonsense including for example pushing to block drilling in the united states seven economy where he is constantly talking bout blue collar workers takin it on the chin and here he is basely saying what i put all the oil workers out of business on behalf of the climate while gunshot china india are not cooperating by the way china is by

holds cards with little tips on them going into easy press conferences with friendly reporters there is a reason why this guys failing in the pulse by thewy i know that there lot o people who are jo jobidon and dona trumpet running even which showstone from strength know it chows on frames weakness any republican should be beating jobidon at this point i that includes all the re publicans a gas notches trump it should scare republicans on a generalize level that there is no pole showing a generic republican up on this tendentious senile old fool how how is that public that that shows republican weakness not republican strength this guy is a terrible president he is horrible at his job he wanders into the ocean he is this a person who can barely stand upright and not only that he happens to be deeply corrupt as will get to in a moment any terrible person to boot and re publicans cannot run they cannot fight anybody who will be this guy regularly in poles i god's kind of amazing to me and shows the the state of dissatisfaction inside the country for both republicans and for jobidon personally crenjon peace by the way is now forced to trot out there and pretend that poles do not counts any more i love this here is corangohn pe are pretending that to every she likes joins economic plan despite the fact that done on the economy thirty seven percent the voters actually approve of jobidans tannillyg of the economy from the while out's perspective why is were prosperity between the good story the merit if you think you have to tell and how it is received by the america people cuplikings that you as we know coles do not so everything they do not tell the fool stories he gestated and we have to remember if he look at where were ain the ton twenty twenty to during them etermilections when the president deliver history use terms for o frdemicants were think about how as the is a democratic president he a deliberate try that we had not seen in de rat and he lent that messaging throughout those lots going into novemder a o here is the thing nobody jobidon and the corruption robin surrounding jobidon are going to get significantly worse a yesterday the house overs committed released memo showing how much money the biding family cleared well jobidon was vice president of the united states the answer grantolancer twenty million dollars twenty million

and his associates at d c cagey malady in spring twenty fourteen and aril twenty fifteen and then a hunter got a one hundred a forty two thousand solar car out of it naturally jobidon one asked about this sort of corruption out scolded the reporter asking yours peter d c asking about all of this in your son's business dealing to did you new nothing about them your son's business dealings you said that you're not involved you sitorson never making money from chines sat all these thing though all wives what you have to say there is this testimony now ware one of your sons om of isneesocs s blaming a you rim speaker fain alow with tam stand iris the wets i i n know you have blows tell what d you why's that blows e i true baby is her press n us what an awol i mean it is such a brickle let us a lows he question as none to answer whys it an and when peters use says whats lousy about question he says it is not true which part is not true which par is not true all of it because we have testimony from hunterbidn's business partner that it is true and we know that you're squiring around hunter bison by the way this whole lye that jo bison does this sort of stuff because he loves his son all fired much ism just wondering why if you are i a a father who loves his drug at old son who addicted crack cocaine and horse your giving him access to millions of dollars literally real number one of having a crack addicted son would be don't give him access to the credicard because he is a victim to crack i notice is really complex but it does not seem all tat complex actually it is it is absolutely insane to me that joint gets away with the it is all about the family routine when pretty clearly died benefited and ism just wondering how he did not benefit at this points according to the ne drink post jonathan truly he points out that of course jobbing benefited from all of hunters foreman business dealings how could he not he says the president's denial of any knowledge of is sons form business dealing to finely been exposed as e today lye the final line of defense is now that hunter bone was selling access to job but it was an illusion but there is nothing a loser about tends to millions moving to hunter and other family members also all these clams ignore e mails discussing the fact that hunter and his father used join to counts to pay for expenses including how one account was used to pay job's taxes there is hunter's complaint that hews using half his burnings to support dad one trusted off behind informant said in planning a bribe one form figure is told to avoid direct payments to job to day that is is amateurish as a an envelope of cash on bone to basin the business of influence peddling for decades apparently if hundred gets lecture cars and millings o dollars an twenty million dollars goes in the entire family bank account job did not benefit or receive a bribe apparently only if many went directly in to his bank account would that actually amount to it that that is actually the white houses defense o this point believe ore not that is right the is what there saying now we also know that jobidon y is apparently worth an estimated eight million dollars at this point and that he are not seventeen pen three million knowledge over the four years he was out of office how is how is in ricing all of your family members not a form a bribery ism just wondering if if i went if some on came to me though i want to pay you to say untruth truly untrue things hon your show that you do not actually believe i want to pay you to do that the memento pays ism put your kit is trust for is that not if what a went mac its are young even if they were of majority with that copy a form of bribery ism just ism confuses to how it is not the white house is resting it is it is notice how the gold post end now as we say been pun ted into the ocean the goalpost wore hunter did nothing wrong then it was jo did not know that hunter done anything wrong then it was well job may have known that hunter did something long body wasn't involved then was will jo might have ben involved but no money directly went into his personal wallet in his back pockets i mean you have moved pretty dramatically here i noticed to the white house put out memo setting their final bull postpone to day house re publicans on the overs like committee released another memo full of years old news in you enjoin misdirection but notably missing get again as any connection to present an bison well but i mean there is he was on the for calls he was taking hunter

twenty twenty which is his high charge her and great level of care for the america people he is just a man who hares about you youremember this was the big kitchen twenty twenty this a man his experience pain and because he is experience painting his life he understands your pain as a really weak build canton tight pitch but it one because again downs from is not somebody who tends to feel pain at least not on his surface the truth is that trump when comes sort of the common man actually does feel lot more for those people in jobidon does without a out but that was bison's pitch that all disappeared with that handstand yesterday the state department continued double down on the idea that yobiton had done stellar job in afghanistan here is the state department spokes person math miller saying that actually was a the nominal choice to leave afcanistand in the way we did respect the decision making that when into the with draw from have canister that is something that we spoken to a number of is but what about got ye still believe that this is not this i as tea bees they have a real hard time when the innastration calling is tetrallis taco still believe it was manly the as the correct comfy tour but wan tat o that o we levels a car cabin noise but again i would never want a quibble with a am number who i see fir see and enormous gravity then i think it on that wanted a men we on them e on to some of som e a oh it ism not con blat the found member tot wan her out the family on more in moon human on smumanon bokprison also said that s actualytheyve ben in credibly transparent about how all of this when down which is weird since they have not think the you to til your obbeyation or your o mi is yo i tin trains parent robot i believe we have been in chancy transparent about the actions this department has taken a but with respect to to request from the committee as seen a number of request come i know we have been in discussions with them but i now i soft want a charge prize this a give that i a just not i de custos sir were poison recess ran now cushion of o is low down or was si do not want a comlinim in on detail wo wo i don't talk for a second about transparency and about the fact that no one trusts the government right out because not only s thegovernment not transparent with you but the media whore supposed be the watch dog are not transparent with you long as he democrat is in the oval office if it em rid is in the oval office they're not transparent with you if republican is in the over office not only are they not transparent with you about the republican they are fully non transparent about all investigations into the republican when did all of this happen it is impossible to think that there was not a ground shift in thewy america think about their institutions that was coincident withe risobrockoboma have talked about this a little bit over the course the past week ire's a massively important interview over at tablet magazine which is a great website that is worth the reed they did not interview with a the historian me avid narrow who wrote a p liter prizewenng biography of martnluther hang and then in twenty seventeen he had a a biography of barokobama in his earlier bandit was called rising stars by all right to triple a massive hit this o this book because it actually uncovered a bunch of stuff about agama the themmedia never would have covered for example the fact that in dreams from my father which is almost entirely fictionalized apparently according todivgarro that when barokabam rote his first memoir dreams for my father he has an incident where he broke up with a white girl friends suppose supposedly because she couldn't understand why he want to get in touch with hi black identity and what actually happened is that she broke up with him because he was covering for raving black antisemite that is what avid girl in covered media never checked in to it they never found the girl friend they never dog into anything remotely related to barokabama by the way other revelations included in this book where actual hand written letters from barokobama to one of his girl friends talking about his and is a direct quote repeatedly fantasizing about making love to men and mind that the pretty bombshell kind of stuff no i pretty wild and relations none of it received virtually any coverage at the time but why and the answer is because the media wen barokobama rose to the presidency and as he made that rise the media decided that they were now the actual praetorian guard there always by us to the left but there is certainly certain a level of base line honesty that required them o still report on things and then barokabama rose to level of the presidency and every institution was caponized on behalf of this man personally that is actually wat happen the entire comedic institutional structure for example said it is forbidden to make jokes about agama you cannot make jokes about this absolutely self obsessed ridiculous man because he is actually amesiana figure you remember the rimrock said that he is the country's dad this is this the kind of comedy out entertainment out they we all worshipping at the altar the media out and our public institutions also started reflecting everything with regard to mama avid camels of tablet whose interviewing marry e said rising star highlights a remarkable lack of curiosity on the part of mainstream reporters an institutions about a man who almost instantaneously was treated less a politician and more the idol of an inter e lead cult and it is true the entire neck world revolved around barokobama he became the center of the political universe everybody thinks the center of the political universe is dona trumpet that is not actually right the center of the political universe since too thousandth has been barokobama dona trump is a reaction to barokobama jobidon is reaction to dona trump and happens to be the third turn of barokobama since every person in position of major staffing power is a barokabama alkaline barokabam by the way still resides most of the urnwashington to see and its amazing to me that nobody's actually attempted to track down how much does barokabama actually talk with all the people who used to work with him and shape policy inside the bison administration and again the corruption of all of our institutions from the back of barokabamas personal self obsession is truly an amazing thing a avid arrows biographermobama he says in this interview quote he has no interest in building the democratic party is an instil union i think that is obvious it only he had any truly deep meaningful policy commitments other than the need to feel in to be perceived as victorious as triumphant but because all the institutions went into defendobomamote that has carried forward to jobidon and here is a thing they could get away with it when it actually was when it actually was barokabomic is barokamma had this sort of messianic quality to him at he was actually a really good speaker he was actually a celebrity type but jobidon is not and as that mask has stripped away and as the media have just been demonstrably proved to be members of that interlay call of course faith in then has absolutely plummeted and of course the country is polarized because the institutions the at least used to have sort of a baseline gold and purpose they had o fill even of theirs political big involve every one distrust those institutions now and for absolutely good reason an what that also means tit is very easy when an institution fails to immediately attribute it to this sort of interlay called status is it failure or is it malice have sod many times that i tried to attribute as much a in stupidity rather than malice but the problem is when malice has been pursued over and over and over again against to particular point of view at a certain point you start to see that may be it is not stupidity may be it is malice does it mean all this malice but it means is easy to over a tribute two malice rather thantustupidity which leads to further political polarization and that seems to be what is been happening all over the place institutionally speaking in the united states to really grave effect by the way because what it means that each side is now bouncing off the other republicans are reacting to to anything democrats say by saying that if democratize it we must of it which is a bad idea and democrats are reacting t anything the republican say by saying that if republicans it we must hate it all of that was created by the barokoboma era this is not dona trumpet that is still barokubon azure were just living in the aftermath of that era as have said man times about dona trump people save that he killed america politics destroyed america put dona trump was not the murderer barokobomal was the murder dona trump is the coroner who stumbled on the body and declared dead o can meanwhile we are still experiencing fall out from this oho vote there is a vote in oho to essentially changed the state constitution to enshrine amendment to testate constitution to require more than a sixty per cent a prove to change to state constitution that was meant to prevent a a sort of walk back with regard to abortion law on behalf of those who are proportion instate of oho that measure failed pretty dramatically and once again this demonstrates that republicans have to pursue victory incrementally very often the is that this tendency tit to feel he s got a gofer broke all the time going for broke is probably not going to be a successful is enemy successful tactic what is hilarious is the democrats of course are about to blow it the democrats have decided that actually this removal for trains issues their bunch of articles today suggesting that democrats look at what happened in oho which was the rejection of what effectively was sort of pro life ballad initiative they look at that thy say shall this means that suddenly the people of whir a socially left wing no i means there is a status quoins and it means that whenever there is a muscular attempt two in shrine in state waw of you a reughferendam more proline positions people do not it because there status quotas and for going to do it you have to do it gradually yoeefve to do it over time but both sides because that pollerisation there no longer seeking gradual couther have new york which is seeking to legalize abortion an s you aright five years old or you have people on the right fare seeking to ban all abortion in the take no obis the have lot of sympathy for that second position that is the position that i hold but it is not going to work if you can's actually wind o victory is a necessity here and publicans should be smart about how they pursue it o can time for some things i and then some things that i hate things that i to day there is this crazy case in stockdtin californium where two stockman seven eleven clerks a tacked to would be thief with sticks idea of that jury twenty ninth assault as gain national attention it is a five minute clip this guy is emptying shells of cigarette an other product just into a bag as you about to steal it and one the clerks pins the man down another beats him with a pole to which i say yes more of this stock an police said they were investigating what police call to suspected assault and suspected robberies at the seven eleven hearts what the tape look beating seen in this now several video is under investigation five thatstockton police department a more than five minute clip shows at here is this emptying ss this german per on stockman see an on a stealing for he i tampering a a into trashing ti and go an store clerk stepping in then stor her saying no quoted azoth that and the that gas going to town i what do deserved it good on the stock clerks hones to god ism tired of this nonsensewhere you have to pretend sensitivity for people for stealing product and walking out of stores of trashbacgs filled with stolen product you deserved to get your asking and a that this a this store clerk who gives him a beating a few more beatings this n there will be a lot less thievery and in places stockman the the pathetic fact of corse is that now it is now it is seen is normals to steal that it used to be when i was again that if some he's on a shoplift was a pack of gum in your pocket and now there is walking with giant trashcans and filling them up with things and walking out get's the prices right or something it is wild a good for the toreclerks there not conto be charge d as they as they should not baby cause of coursethat is ridiculous o gave time for a rare things i li gives a very very very rare thing i you ready ism into say the mobile is doing a correcting now for those who sad never say the bine is done a correcting toxin is doing a correcting here istle thing the mobile is doing that is correct he signs an executive order on wednesday times at curbing the flow of america investment an management no how into a limited range of chines firms the administration fears could fuel behaves at military ambitions it is an initial step thatwill not take affect until next year but it is a signal to china leadership that washington is going to continue to impose restrictions on bashing's access two critical technology that is not fact necessary try a is building up it is military they are seeking more and more sophisticated micro chips and superconductors in order to build up that military for possible take over of titan chines officials are mat which is always good indicator that action were doing something right the use habitually politicized is tack and trait issues and uses them as a tool and weapon in the name of national security said chines abs yo spokesman you pain a statement to the washington post but chinahawks on both sides of the isle i a ism that they say the proposal while good does not go far enough the praise is qualified in the sense that i green it dos obviously is a very very limited step by the by can ad ministration by it as they step in the right direction milk my caul re publican of texts says the administration scaling bat at a timeworn a guess one action is needed more than ever continues the trend of a teasing industry the cost of national security but again the fact that binal is doing anything at all is better than nothing i suppose he con see is glassware full lass half empty i choose at this point to see at least this as as somewhat lass quarter far shots put it tout you cate time for a thing that i hate our harts got everybody in lamina valley to day just horrifying apparently death told from fast moving wild fires has now increased to thirty six malaccount the official sent on wednesday night the blaze have been raging across at lest three of wise islands because of strong

to vacation amply pretty regularly with theirs and ta laheinoe was the stop it was the place that you went on on a beautiful evening to go shoppingsto series of shoplift ice cream stores and jewelry stores and art stores ans really fun and really cooky and i and it was basely burn to the grounds is truly yo a horrifying situation eleven thousand people ware evacuated from valley on wednesday alone of all that is terrible a there there are a bunch of links to places that you can go to help people who have beneffected by the wild fires ranging from the america red cross o the many relief fun people should o go and give general sly because that is a terrible situation oke time for our latest episode of deconstructing the culture this is where i go viral for pointing out that pop culture absolutely blows in his terrible for you let us do it today deconstructing t culture comes courtesy of dona cat given name obviously she came out her mother her mother a i shall call this one dona cats and it'll be honest i have no idea what dochacats background is i i do not know why this person is famous because she does not seem to be a particularly talented human but apparently she is perceived is talented by our unit a vast wash the same people who've made barber billion my and a mocha cat apparently she gained her stage name from one of her was as fellas her favoritestrin of marowana i just look hat up right now ism bats definitely away to name yourself is after one of your cats who is apparently name was was cat and also your favorite strain of marijuana obviously that is that is solid style that that is dad's just fan frecantastic ism ism dog cat i has now put out a song title paint the town red the left in culture has gone far now that there there is literally no place left to go except just get directly in bed with satin and this become kind of the common mean these days used to be a little more subtle right honestly when you are talking about donna in the early dies is subtle that is how far we have come mason the early day's writhing around wearing catholic imagery he is doing the can of doing the kind of saint sinter routine that was that was considered brazen then now it is the hight of subtlety because how little mass as having secs with satin having gases with satin in his videos or you have say smith dressing up as fat ugly satin well doing a routine with a man who says that he is woman and now we have dog cat who is jumped in on this just open satanic imagery satin apparently is now the good satin is great satin is great i a well i g i i guess ism glider than the club hart out loud here it is paint the town red by a woman who named herself after her cat and a marijuana strain yes folks there used to be a western civilization hero a a shies does a assassin naked lie prekiin free and now he has dress in a at out ta an re i an as in an an san id on now es like cares sang el looks in wear tan now she is having a it anotheriman that that a wet a not that like my him er alien realign en prig plan an as is cutting then till e cops geranial ism i i do not know what is suppose we happening here other than it is kind of horrifying and and terrible i the lyrics for this which i will now read for purposes of media matters they can clip it out of context nan claim that ism trying to a rap the song i supposed to cynically reading the song i nominal read the lyrics to a this piece of crap and ism going to point out how bather sis by fuck supposing it with on of the great pieces of music ever written that you can tell kind of how we have declined here because obviously this is great art we have been told that this is great art because people apparently this i do not know why but then again i hunt understand the taste of the america people obviously because i mean who would not love a song featuring a woman dressed in nothing but body pain bald wearing devil horns and cutting the q the umbilical cord of an alien creature whowould not would not love the here are the lyrics to paint the town red to the strains of box first brandenburg concerto let us do this thing walk on by walk on by walk on by walk on by ya h i said what i said it'd rather be famous instead i let all that get to my head i do not care i paint the town had i said what i said it'd rather be famous instead i let all that get to my head i do not care i paint the town had she the devil she bad well she a evil she put her foot to the petty it will take a whole lot for me to settle she the devil also send my happiness is all of your misery i put good in all my kidneys it'll king's appends i yah i mean i do not see what is bad about this what is fatso bach used to write music as a tribute to god an that that is literally why azurite music he was a church organist and you would write his music with an eye toward the divine hand's o that is the result and even baton who is much more of a secularist in his religious outlook wrote with an eye toward sort of a secular humanist aversion of a higher morality that is what the the od to joy is at the end of the ninth symphony brooms whose music i love was essentially a secular humanist but very religiously tolerant none of them would have said who is great the devil o of the evil it turns out when you worship the devil and when you worship the pagan the place you went up is here now when satanists start creating actual art that beautifies the world and makes the world better place maybe's start taking their philosophy a little seriously why because it turns out that the products of of philosophy very often are tide to thephilosophy itself but it makes my argument super easy that a satanic pagan current pop culture is garbage when what they produce is actual shrike that is it makes my argument supers the i i appreciate you doing that i appreciate you make the argument supereasy's rand you have to make the argmamore ill have to do a you show clips of dona city person who named herself once again after a cat and a marilonostrane dressed up as satin and rapping that garbage that is all i have to do you made my armed for me i

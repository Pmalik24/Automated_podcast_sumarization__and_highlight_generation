welcome to the superman sapotas a science science pace to e r i mender supermen and of a professor of neurology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day i have the pleasure of introducing doctor matter johns doctor johns is a professor of psychiatry at john skin school of medicine where he also directs the center for psychedelic and consciousness research as many of there is extreme excitement about the use of psychedelics for the treatment of various disorders of the mind doctor johnson's laboratory is among the prefer laboratories in the world understanding how these compounds work how things cylicipen and elected and relate compounds a low neural circuitry in the brain to be shaped and change such that people can combat diseases depression or drama or other disorders of the mind that cause tremendous suffering doctor johns is also an expert and understanding how different types of drugs impact different types of human behaviors such as sexual behavior risk taking and crime doctor johns and his work have also been featured prominently in the popular press such as articles in the new york times in michael polio's book had a change your mind and in a feature in sixty minutes about psychedelics and the new emerging science of psychedelic therapies for treating mental disorders during the course of to day's conversation doctor johns and i talk about psychedelics at the level of what is called microdosing whether r not it is useful for the treatment of any mental disorders we also talk about more typical macrodosing what those macrodoseis entail and he walks us through what an experiment of a patient taking psychedelics for the treatment ad impression looks in his laboratory from start to finish the conversation was an absolutely fascinating one for me to partake in i learn much about the past present and future of psychedelic treatments and compounds and indeed i hope to have doctor johns on this podcast again in the not to distant future that we can talk about other compounds that powerfully impact the mind and human behavior and perhaps can also be used to treat various diseases before we begin id t emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zerocosto consumer information about science and since related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve son delighted that their sponsoring the podcast he reason i started taking athletic greens and reason i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which are vital for microbiompealth have done a couple of episodes now on the called gut microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interact with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the promises to support my microbic if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen and claim a special offer they will gie you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things lykecharvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stoical slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to today's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar o talk many times before in this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have soda magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those sells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparation of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do cam slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do cam slash superman and now my conversation with doctor father johns omathew have beenlooking forward to this for a long time mi m a huge fan of your scientific work and a hear to learn from you likewise big fan and happy to do this with you i thank you my first question is a very basic one which is what is a psychedelic we hear this term all the time but what qualifies a substance to as a psychedelic nomenclature is a real challenge in the ere of psychedelics to starting with the word psychedelic gist if if your pharmacologist it is it is not very satisfying because that term really stands different farmaclogical class is another words if you really concerned about receptor effects in the basic effects of a compound its stand several compass is of compounds but overall it is really more of a a cultural term or a it does have a relation ship to drug effects but it is at the at a very high level all of the called psychedelics across these distinct a classes that i can talk more about the way i put is they all have the ability to profoundly altar one sense of reality and that can mean many things part of that is profoundly altering the sense of self u acutely when some one's on the psychedelic the different classes thatch be the specific form a logical classes that can be called a psychedelic are one that what are called the classic psychedelic in the literature you will see that term and hallusengen and psychedelic ore all have traditionally been used synonymously i think there was a little the tendency to stay away from psychedelics of the baggage but there is been a return to that in the last several years but the classic psychedelics or classicallucigens are things alert sylisivon which is in called magic mushrooms it is in over two hundred species that we know of far of mushrooms a dinathal trip to mean ordo t which is in dozens and dozens of plants a masculine which is in the paste cacti and some other cacti san padre and even amongst these classic psychedelics there are two structural structural classes that is the chemistry there's the trip demean base compounds sylicivon and dm t and then there is the phanethelan mean based compounds cities of the basic to i basic building blocks that that your starting from either a trip to mean structure or a phanethelan mean structure but that is just the chemistry the all of the what is more important or at least to to some one me are the receptor effects and then ultimate leadatcan have a relationship to the behavioral and subjective effects all of these classic psychedelics serve s agonist or partial agonists at the serotonin two a receptor subtype of pseratonan receptor then you have these other classes of of of that you compounds hit you could call psychedelic another bit big one would be the india antagonists of this would include cavemen pa p and dextro athoripment something have done some research with which folks might recognize from rob tripping guzzling a culver u which is something kind of highschal kids are known to do when they cannot get hold or real drugs that type of thing a large overlap and the types of subjective effects that you get from those compounds compared to the two a agonist classic psychedelics but then you have in by the way this description this framework ism describing not every one will agree some people will say no psychedelic only means classic psychedelic there is different opinions here but you have gash savonorna which is a cap opioid agonist which again does that come from e salvia divonorum it is a plant o became twenty years ago wat sort of popped onto legal high scene and there is a me a long history of this predating in great going back to the stuff onecodor in the back of high times magazine inmost of the stuff never worked ye whits the smoke enough of anything made you little lightheaded but this is one of those things tat popped around twenty years ago when it quickly got the reputation holy ship the stuff actually works and works really strongly in these smoked extracts particularly people have these reality altering experience is unbar with smoked dot the classic psychedelic often in we did the first blinded controlled human research with savonorina lots of unity contact feeling that you in the experience of one is actually inner acting with autonomic beings that type of thing and an you have a another big one probably should have mention even before the no savonorna u but you have imam a which really stands in a class by itself it is been called in intactagin and and a what is that men u it means a a touching within e sort of eludes the idea that it can really put some one in touch with their emotions it is also been called in and pathogen in can afford empathy but i think intactagens probably that is the the term that i i tend to focus on and i know ism not telling you anything you do not know but the for the for the u viewers that that the primary mechanism of india ma is seratoneand release and to a degree other monoanmi release penman serotoneand and structure that also in the fanetholaman class which contains masculine the classic psychedelic a but also emphedemi just overall is is is innate fanathel mean class an sis is is other example were chemistry does not dictate i mean you can week a molecular it have that same basic structure but now you have profoundly changed the way it inner acts with the receptor in imdiama does not a exert its actions by a i to say by be by in mimicking the base ball entering the glove the post a a synaptic receptor side in acting as an agonists o mimicking the the the the indigenous nearer transmitter sertoneand the classic psychedelics to imdiama works on the picture side of just basically throwing out more of the natural the bandage do not sing more sir do not be more carton an flooding ye sends i get the impression that the psychedelic space is the en famous cloud of partially overlapping compounds i a meaning summer impacting the santonin system more than the dopamine system others are impacting the dopamine system ore the than the sirtonean system given that the definition of a psychedelic is that it profoundly alter sense of self at least that is included as a partial definition can we break that down into couple of sub category for instance on hallucinating ought either auditory visual o synesthesia perceptional blending the sense that o you can hear colors a and see sounds for instance a common a report open take psychodolix a insufficiently hypnosis hallucinating synesthesia and then in terms of sense of self as a nor scientist i think an what does it mean to alter sense of reality really what the brain does i in a very coarse way is to trying figure out what is happening in space physical space and that physical space can be within us or outside us in what is happening in time and o as a vision scientist the simplest explanations when i move my hand from one location to another location it is measuring the space the location of my hand in space over time and then you get a rate and a your speed and all that kind of stuff right yet that get's more comply as ye into the emotional om ream but is it fair to say that psychedelics are impacting the space time analysis that the brain is performing and thereby creating hallucinations and thereby altering the blending of senses is it fair to say that i think it is it is fair to explore that triad here hears what ism thinking the the clearly there is a change relationship certainly at the it of of orientation an space time i think as as aim primarily a behavior is in in terms of farmacot human behaviourformacology and always go to comparative pharmacology cake what can we say that is it truly unique about the classic psyched or psychedelics in general with that description om thinking o ka alcohol can really throw up your time space a rentaliaception your patreosastalor and in many ways in inner in those gross motor ways far worse been o course everything to is dependent but in the classic psychedelics o obviously defend it spines being verysintly out same thing it'd wanted dig in a little more in terms alike may be there something more specific we could say about that relationship to time in space that that the psychedelics are tinkering with but ism not sure it is an interesting hypothesis that the idea that is a mediator that that is something that there is something fundament up about changing that the representation in time ins in space there might be something to that and i think of these is is psychlux is profoundly altering models were all were prediction machines and that is large much of that as is topped down and a and and psychedelics have a good way of loosely speaking dissolving those models and and one of the the declivous an example of one of a model a i know that when i throw a ball in the air it falls down not up that is it that is a prediction that i learned as a child the i did not come into the world with a brain that knew that relationship between objects and gravity but one of the first things that a child learns is the relationship between objects an gravity in their trajectories yet and with a fore year old i mean i saw that at earlier ages that experimentation a yet that is what happens to right i i if he were to throw of your a child were to throw all and it went up into the sky that would be absolutely mind blowing it would be at adult to i be prepsychadelicate there it is only right and there is that there is a spoke there is a rule there your saying there is a a kind of a a a prediction bit there is a rule that that underlies a prediction that when that rule is violated all a sudden the circuit presumably for that prediction go it does not to a li i o i nohow it creates a surprise element or a were a ye ignition women and it is not filtered out a the and this might sound extreme but there are these cases it was over overblown and through the propaganda the late six see early seventies but therefore credible cases of people and it is verge typical of sounds they really thought they could fly and jump out of of a window now far more people her here fall muttering who knows great the they fall and die out of from height because her drunk it is is extremely rare but there some pretty convincing case there was one research volunteer in our studies a that a it she looked she was in one of our studies that she was trying to dive through a painting on the wall she was fine but she reviewing the video it looked she really thought that she was going to go through that painting and eye she wear the other dimension yes ane violating these predictions u ye i the reason i ask it the the question the way i did is because given the enormous cloud of different substances and giving the range of previous experiences that people show up to a psychedelic experience with a i feel the ability to extract some universal themes is is useful smutched for people who have not done them before i in might i not have an understanding of what their effects are can we just briefly touch on the serotonin system and the dopamean system i want of acknowledge that as you already know that therefore many demodulator systems in the body o and the of systems can a anti systems but there is something profound about the seretonean system in the opening system because the way i defined a demodulator is it is a modulator it changes the way that other circuits behave and essentially it up it increases the probability that certain circuits will be active and decreases the probably the other circus in in it in a general sense compounds plenty ma surchagasa dial mod and soliciban my understanding is that they primarily target this serotonin system how do they do that at a an of general level and why would increasing the activity of a particular seretonand receptor or bachosertoneand receptors lead to these profoundly different experiences that were calling a model challenge s challenging are existing models and yet mean at the end of the day it is a chemical and these receptors or scattered around the rain with billions of other receptors ye what a we think is going on it in a general sense ye end this is really the area of active exploration and we do not have great answers we know a good amount about the receptor level for apology some things about pose receptor signaling pathways in other words just fitting into the receptor clearly o sertonand itself is not psychedelic kenitelor else mud be tripping all of us all the him i can't a ball i get siratoneand release it i an there is and betray having the fatless fan right my understanding seretonean is that enginery broad strokes that it it generally leads to a state of being fairly it pushes the mind and body towards a state of contentment w in the immediate experience whereas the opening system really places us into an external view of what is alter in the world and what is possible ye the there o something i mean that is consisted with my i understanding and a and and ill certainly not in terms i do not primarily identify s an a ineurascientists a definitely tell the the views that were far more ieurdema remain here than mine but interns of had psychedelics and other drugs interface at the at theneurascience level o feel freed to explain it at the experiential level ye it does not a it i think probathere probably are some audience members that are interested is at the rivage to see is that the layer five neurons and core that conversation we could old than that is an interesting conversation but just in terms of the experience of syrutonurgic verses dopomanargic drugs ye they they do seem to create distinct classis of experience i think that is that is the the brier level for us to discuss them and in terms of how they and i it'd to explore the biology a little bit here and tell you sort of what is known in what is the ideas are is you have this pat as you now these are levels of analysis and it is o which one is going on its almost for the particular question which level of analysis is most appropriate is it is a question best addressed by the biology the the the chemistry or r the physics i that i think of repseptr level post receptrsignalling downstrung affects another a other hero transmitters and then on activation level effects and then coronation of activation you got the clearly that with the classic psychedelics the two a activation we we do know that there are downstream effects in terms of a increasing glutamate transmission this is likely a commonality why yocedemi is very psychedelic and sight different way but people who losing the do not can yes yes and it is more dissociative someone is more likely to sort of a be less behavior active they have a really hide us they going to a keyhole and ant the going o really hides corral the a unconscious yet not an whole but a k a whole very different thekaholen cerement interesting as people can take kind of bumps and con a dance on it with the sort of an alcohol level strength of a effect om anezero the class i kind of raving you no use of it but then those folks want a tie trade their dose because a if they do more a line you get up to seventy five hundred kilograms then you are talking about if you are in the dance floor you are on on the floor and your friends are turn to measure people are not stewpan on you that is yo whyai' to somebody want to take a dissociate of an aesthetic i to me it is completely mysterious as to why someone we want to dissociate from their body people claim that these these the these india antagonize psychedelics are extremely encyst in in a very similar way to the experiences with the classic psychedelic an kedemin is now legal for the republic i right provide the the the the intrenasal form marketed by chance and which is academy n is inrsrun of the ye it is prescription and u to people are taking in the nasal sari ye and then are they under going talk there where they are doing typically not its is as very interesting in their much work that needs to be done it is not treated as psychedelic therapy and by that psychlctheripy i mean you tell the person there in to have an alter experience you tell them to pay attention to that ex since that they might learn something from that experience and afterwards you discussed that experience with bravado the model is bravado is is escademine for a it is the the yet that the spray form of academic that it is been after ye approved for treatment resisting depression but it is you will you will probably feel different ignore that that is a sit fact that is an adverse of fact a just ignore it a we do not think that has anything to do it the way it works a but just get this thing it is it is a direct sort memo therapeutic he fact in a sense it is it is it is not facilitating a learning process now there is older work there was a guide cropitzky in russia that did extensive work with overdoses of academy i should say bravado at the prescribed okas is not very sight it is a pretty loose it is in the mild psychedelic range but it is not very strong but this older work that happened in the nineties an early two thousands and in russia a there reading very hypos is in treating at a psychedelic yet treating it as if it was a psychedelic therein you another with telling people you can have this experience it is con were hoping you learn something from it were can help you through it in is discussed afterwards and they found incredibly migrates of success and some pretty well controlled trials for both heroine addiction an alcohol a a addiction i think a whole lot of work needs to be done now and you see some of the ceresin clinics that are using enemy alflavel a lot of them a treating it psychedelic therapy there is essentially no research at this point on that do you get better results a straight apiece of bravado there is some good variability but it is anti to press an effects last about a week a but the kicking immediately now a week is a long time for most most psychiatric drugs you take it every day right a that is amazing but it is still just a week versing effects ya year or more later with with with sylicivan and and some of the classic psychos that could be a form ecological difference or could we that they get a lot more mileage out of redefine if they treated it psychedelic theropeence that is some soworthot leans on a really just our our syliciventic a possessions which i know i haven described but briefly you have anywhere from four to eight hours of preparation getting to know the people who can be the guides or the therapist in the room a maybes to walks through this am let us say i were to come to one of your clinical trials cause these are political trials inner your lava hoping ye and a would i need to be depressed or circus be somebody who want to explore psychedelics it we have had studies for all of these so ant and a number of other distort healthy normal studies oat the code for not a problem to fix but were all he that is what is amazing about psychedelics the because you if you administer them under this model and you develop a relationship an give hides of postdoc y can be healthy normal without a divisible issue but man were all human in the issues seem to come to your surface but we have done work with a smoking cessations o people trying to quit tobacco and have not been successive variety of reasons i maybe it'll just ask some very simple questions at the con steps through the process let say i were to sign up for one of these trials and an i qualified for in these trials i show up you said i would do several hours in advance of getting to know the team that would that would be present during this psychedelic journey first there screenings at kind a a couple of days of both psychiacticallic structured inpsychatric interviews about your hole yet yo your past and symptoms across the the the the ascend the psychiatric bible to see if you might have various disorders that they could u disqualify you the the main ones being the psychotic disorders sketsofrinian were also including u by polar her the manic side of o bi polar solo after that s anal party of vascular screening heart disease after that screen thin the preparation were you get you are both you get you develop a the re peter we poor with the people who were going to be in the room with you your guides but you are also then didactically her explained about what the psychodelicculd be and that is kind of a laundry list because there were known by their variability then it is going heat's not cocaine your going to feel stimulated you are going to feel you can do any u sike you know or all call your good probing in ta feel more relaxed it is i call uppers downers and all around or and the psychedelia all around of it is yet you could be you could have the most beautiful experience of your life er the most terrifying experience of your life this kind of laundry list of the things that could happen others no surprises thing it is important for people to hear because the all grounders they the you really cannot predictive somebody is going to react internally i need just briefly touch on something because we we left that topic but it occurred to me that a lot of these effects of psychedelics and how they function et camera is still very mysterious but then i recall to mind that how most prescription an ti depresses work is also very mysterious they increase santonin or doormen or up and offer et camera but why they take weeks on and several weeks to akin et cameras also mysterious be going back to the the the experience of of coming to your laboratory o get let us say that somebody passes all the prerequisites and the and it is the day as comes the day that they are going to have a this experience are they a eating mushrooms a you turnabout or are they taking in causal form and howwhat sorts of doses are you prescribing as their dose response curve and then secondary to that to talk about mycrudose for macrocosm how do they get the stuff in haw to people a receive it and how do they get into the to they receive pure sylicive and the mushroom and there many species the most drive people a taken mushrooms in the united states its it is most likely my sylacibe cuteness o they are easy to grow they growing calvaries easy training body to from in their closet it does not take a a thousand lot light canvas it takes a little on a ten lit light ball and a toperware been those are what those of the types of mushrooms of pupatipically tape we are not administering those sylicivan is the compound you could draw a molecule sylicive and again based on the trip to mean structure that is a single molecular entity it is a white powder does it look ceratoneand molecuraly yes yes yes free o i look as air stand bile the chemical structure or creatine and the chemical structure of silicone and it would look quite similar right right and there is easily taking ceratonent it a modified version of keratose and which makes sense but it then again this repeated theme of the chemistry does not always needle line up because masculine looks more a a dopheni than it does serotonin but yet it at the receptor activation level the pharmoclogeneur pharmacological effect it is those are similar but but yet i mean and what it does at the receptor is in alternate its it is it is hitting the same switch but then having an alternate response at the receptor a we over people that do not was surely understand the relationship between what we call ligan o the thing that parks in the receptor in the receptors the parking spot one of the reasons that you can get such a variety of effects from different compounds is for instance serotonin might affect a certain pathway at o particular rate and a sylicidan might trigger activation of different components o that pathway different rates since you get vastly different experiences from two things that look chemically similar does it also a good a a reason why people should not just assume that they can cowboy their own chemistry right that what you see on paper and what you can mix up and miles often vastly different a then what you predict it and there is a dose effect curve that is really interesting some of our early work with sylicive and a unhealthy normals a looked at a a trueplocivo plus four act of those as five ten twenty and thirty milligrams of silvan body weight adjusted in a those milligrams our seventy kilograms of body way we have recently published of paper in our newer trials were we are dropping the byway adjustment as are going across hundreds of volunteers we have kind of figure out that that you should not really e you do not need to be adjusting by body way an yet well brainsick does not very that much between individuals yet yen and this is a brain effect hastily probably body as well o case the person in just the the yet powder a lots hill rocket and and not stays thirty milligrams is a small y fitted into a tiny little causal and it will take about a half hour what mean where from fifteen minutes to an hour to kick in and non aver to s range was most of our studies a are looking at where we we want a psychedelic factor in the twenty to thirty milligram range again because we have a busted by body wait and the average america is over seventy kilograms about a hundred and fifty pounds people an in fact have god more me of forty forty five in a lot i cases but it is still a small pill there t the session day itself is not full of for most of our studies is not full of tasks we really want to look at the the peptic response obviously if it is a therapeutic study we want to be a meaningful experience and a research is found not surprisingly that you get a less meaning full experience when you are and an ether i or when you doing a lot of cognomen tasks we have done some research in in o that type for sure and plenty of colleagues have but when you are in a the peptic study or if you trying to understand the peptic affair yet to recognize there's is this this trade all of what you can do our typical the peptic model which again is not just limited necessarily to the therapeutic studies we were trying to treat a specific disorder is is to you have that preparation you the person feels very comfortable with their dudes a nit all ultimately what i told peoples any emotional response it is all welcome i mean you could you could be crying a baby hysterically that is what you should be doing if that is what you feel and in a lot of way son as people with psychedelic experience u on their own it can be harder to train them in this model because in the real world people with psychic experience lot times the rulers net hold your ships ayes over friends go to party they split bag a mushroom that is this is social pressure for good reason not to be the guy in the corner of the room wherever one's trying to just have a good time relax crying about your mother your other friends or there having an experience to in your being a drama king and blow of la and compose yourself hold your you are doing me you are doing therughpy for people this is it is not just about the experience right and the experience is self as very much shaped by by that that container h by the environment and it is agree to which when allows it to happen one should let go of control yet let us talk about the the letting go of control and then as we march through this u hypothetical experience that does take place in your lapin we are using a sort of generic c ace example if you will a the letting go of controls an interesting feature actually because a one of the common themes of of good psychoanalysis is or psychotherapy of any kind is that there is a trust built between the patient and the analyst and that relationship becomes a templet for trust more generally an trust in one self it is actually the the enroll of good psychoanalysis is that the patient actually one of the enrols is that they develop an empathy for themselves which almost sounds an ox more in but you sendal time with that statement it it actually hands out the psychedelic experience is one in which chemically you are under a new new set of conditions right yelled us coarsely space and time or are altered in some way sense of self a for ideas i might be going to a strongly and perceptive mode where ism focussing a everything within the confines of my skin where as normally or sort of interacting in space and pends and conversation and for if i had occasion it'll pain torsion my breathing but ism sort of dilating my end contracting my focus for diverted all the time the letting go of control it seems to me could be sort of the expansion of one perceptional bubble to the point where you are not actually worried that that perceptional bubble is on a pop or that meaning you are not worried about what people think of you yet you are not worried whether not your a brain is gan explode even though a thought could feel enormous ai keep going this it almost som psychedelic but that is the idea here a or if ism paying attention for instance to some somatic experience am the the coursing of waves of heat through my body that ism not suddenly saying is that weird ism actually just going deeper and deeper into it at essentially expanding a perceptional phenomena how do you convince people to go further and further down that path what do you think allows them to do that because i think that that to me is one of the more unusual a aspects to psychedelics is that normally the the social pressure but also just our internal pressure from our own brain is pay attention to many things at one is not just one is that specially these days it that ask we musty task and the more that we focus on one thing the more bazaar that thing actually can appear to us right my i mean even if it is the tip of your finger and you are not taking any psychedelic you spend a long enough looking into to your finger you notice weary we yens i that i think that is the classic psychedelic effect at r one classic effect an one have use many times of this example of who people chunessirly i these are not these one should be judicious in putting themselves in these circumstances so one to be yew having a very strong sill's have an experience once and they trying to navigate their way and man had not cross in the street and they might be staring into the hand and real that is their hand is the most amazing miracle the entire universe as mentally conspired to come to this one point to make this absolutely breathtaking it is almost i think of the simplest form of of of well we know the simplest form of learning is habituation simply keep a plying stimuli and there is less respects this is what organisms doe this whole we have to do and it is theirs is is habituation component that li is habituate yes a would not be able to get through life if we would not be able to cross that street if we were lie hoe this is a miracle we no ism glad you brought this summer an here on reflecting my bis as o vision sides is but most people do not realize this but if you look at something long enough it eventually disappears to it per it does not actually disappear but perceptually it disappears you've these little microns icons that insure that it does not what most of us do not look at any one thing for very long i the the brains default is to exceptionally jump around crazy with the visual system with the auditory system we all eighdydy n you i ti wat city deal this sort of baked in are underlying net worked some bubble and then we hat we can force attention but it sounds o sycadelics the one of the primary rolls the septically is to really drill into one of these perceptual bubbles and expand that bubble and the safety seems is the safety it sort a permission to to do that without worrying that somethings going to happen right because have had people there on the couch on yet remember one lady said is is pily a thirteen fourteen years ago said mat tell me again i cannot die i feel my heart is going to rip through my chest and she was feeling i stand i should say typically carry vascular response is as modest that the a pulse and blood pressure go up somewhat it can be dangerous for people if there at severe hart risk and we do one this we do yet we other on other into a variety of devise yes o every half hour or we we take there on prodigal we you space at a little further further an to the time course but we take their blood pressure in the pulse and if it goes over certain level we have a photo can we have had to do is only a few times but physician comes in gives m a nitric listen under the tongue and a you no not to blood pressure download it does not affect the experience o we have it all in place even tough they probably we find out of an abundance of cautious are in but but have it some one can feel that my got i not die i i have never felt my heart be this before and the spirits of the breath can be just absolutely fantastic it into this sort of the breath is gutsily interesting because it is this auto automatic you no control but it could in also be voluntary people begin into a sense of i got what if i it sounds silly a thunder r y breath exact but people that can be compelling it one other recant get back to one of your questions is what do we do to kind of allow them to go further into these bubbles it is a one as as wearing the eyeshades we do not call em on blindfolds cause that has a negative connetationly pink kitten you and their proliseeing a lot in there anyway blind is not the appropriate right right its that never thought of of see to be inner sight shades a but when you close the eyes the levels of activity in the rating actually are maintained its sponge is just spontaneous activity and it seems an it'd be curious about your thoughts on this n a but the way i describe it is that the in a the minds i the o this kind of loose tern we use can be on rock of booster a lot of times for some people a compounding solicidement for some people there is know perception affect a they are looking at this room and would are pretty much look the same sometimes folks a can things seem a little bit brighter not some people will say ma got there is waves that walls waving in these curtains that on these compounds people do not typically see pink elephants you do actually get that in another class it did not mention the the anti callonergics a sir atropine and scapoluming those drugs those wo that those of the true hallucinations were you thought you were having a conversation with some one who was never there in the am we will definably get to those but when the reason i kind of crimsons that will my when you talked about those is that knowing a little bit about the pharmacology of a see of calling the the idea of manipulating that system to me sound very uncomfortable because a the whole idea of of witches and flying there was a whole history there your hundreds of years ago called witches taking these agents and then thinking they were flying around on broomsticks and things of that demand and there is a lot of mythology round the broomsticks its comvegate but but that sound very unpleasant one thin i i about the serternergic let just i for with suicide and u there is a pecan expansion of a particular fairly narrow percept it could be sound an emotion could be sadness could be a historical event or fear of the danseur and you have mentioned before that there is something to be learned in that experience ye there is something about going into that experience in it in an inulin an in n undeterred way that allow somebody to bring something back into more standard reality ya given the huge variety of experiences that people have on psychedelics given the variety of humans that are out there but what are now very clear it therapeutical facts in the realm of depression what do you think is the value of going into this fair my restricted perceptual bubble what we are calling letting go or giving up control because if the experiences a many but the value of what one exports from that experience is kind of similar across individual that raises all sorts of interesting questions and this is not of a philosophy discussion were toying about biology and psychology here ye let say i decide demon focus on the tip of my pen i mean in the psychedelic state i could fall in love with this pen i do have no these silent defines i savants very much but i could feal real love ye for the pen yet that is not an unreasonable thing to expect on a psych in a psychedelic turn i akin the context of your laboratory model which i thing is a great one that experience would be just as valid as me going into the experience of some of the deep friction that i might have with the family member over my entire life spin ye and yet the export from that those two very vastly different experiences is one of feeling a better relationship to the world into one sell i what is this telling how about pen and the process in your child on trout both lead to rite ye what is this a me it at that level it raises this question first of all how why a manor just what are your thoughts on that this is defiling and the this is in the train were figuring out there no the educated speculations the best i can provide but i i think the best that that the the the to i think the common denominator are persisting changes an self representation tell me more about self representation that is a the way one holds the sense of self the relate the fundamental relationship of a person in the world i mention earlier that these experience seems to alter at the models behold a reality and i think at the self is the biggest model that i an a thing that separate from other things and that is you i am defined by certain i have a certain personality and i ism a smoker that is having wartime quitting or am a depressed person that in a these myself as a failure in all these thing those are models to and and i think i think that change in supprerepresentation may be an end point for these different experiences and he may be the falling in love with the pen the whole idea that your especially in contemplation afterwards and obviously speculating here but that whole idea that you could have such a deep connection with this random obviously random aspect of of the universe could potentially lead to this i you transformed understanding of the self and the pen may be a proxy for the the miracle of reality in a way that realize nothing on i no supernatural thinking e know you can be a hard atheist and take this in ultimately o my god that just the penis is that this is amazing the fact that we exist until there could be an extrapolation chair and you use the pen but i think it sounds a similar to all tosycley's classing description in the doors of reception of the chair and the drapes he took o five hundred telegrams of masculine he was just to a higdosennes ye yet and that is a in yen that is a heroic dos for sure and he just going off in the chariness of the chair this chairs exciting the quality of being a chair and the enclimansion of the perceptional bubble a narrow a narrow a percept that then grows within the confines of that narrow percept the sense of self is a very interesting a phenomenon if we could dissect it a little bit there is the somatic sense of self the ability to literally feel the self a into this process we call in reception and then there is the the the title of the self that i am blank ye and i knows you said that several times its intriguing to me abs a good friend i do not think i u cannot should mention his name but he had a very long and successful career in a within one of the more lie teams within the sealteams and he u his a fairly philosophical guy a allover practical guy a but he has said many times om to me that the most powerful words in any language or i am because whatever follows that tends if you repeated off tends to have this a kind of feed back a fact on the on how you are in the world and it hat at the first passim it it sounded to me a little bit kind of internet psychology type thin i know the secret or seningson which frankly a ism dining for doe a yens if you find alike the whole think ut till you make it i i do not actually subscribed to any of that but in directing that low bit further with him i came to realize that a that these words i am are very powerful i do not think you reprogram your brain just by saying them but how one defines themselves internally not just to other people but how one psychologically and by default in a defines themselves i thing is very powerful and depressed people as well as happy people seem to define themselves in terms of these categories of emotional states i think it is it is interesting that letting go and going into this perceptional bubble which is facilitated by obviously a really wonderful team of a there's but also to ceraternergic agent allows us to potentially reshape the perception of self that is that is a tremendous feet of neuroplasticity right and i think certainly more work needs to be done and this is the the he the horizon and an ash credit a crislethor be a philosopher an australia who a has a forthcoming book it might be out right about hour or sent within the coming months a a psychedelics and philosophy ah as the title of the book it is is it might be psychedelic philosophy really lepers lathered wet well put a link to it right add and his conclusion and this it is a really great book and he really plays with the ideas psychedelic experiences come along with a lot of supernatural stuff a experience it can certainly go along with that but the ideas i can it can these experiences and including as their pubic effects be explained from a naturalist point of a a view and in his conclusion is that the changes in self representation may be the commonality now the could go along with plant spirits and the but and shocks and whatever your model system in jess all of that but it could also a be completely devoid of any supernatural and your religious and we do in fact my all n all of these variety i i i think there is something about this change and in sense of self there is it seems to be something on the identity level both with i think of the the work we did with cancellations who had substantial depression anxiety because of their case or and also ore work with people trying to quit cigarettes smoking i mean there is a real there seems to be when it really works this change and how people view themselves with smoking really stepping out of this model ism a smoke or it is tough to quit smoking cigarettes i cannot do it i failed of much at times i remember one participant during the session but he held on to this afterwards said i god it is i can really just decide flicking off abut i can decide not tho smoke in is i call these a experiences with psychedelics because people often in decanter say you say ism causing most of my own suffering i can i can follow my appointments i can do everything but i can solan for the ism not getting outside in the sunshine ism not playing with my grand kids ism choosing to do that and i they told themselves that before and the smoker has told themselves a million times i can in it it sounds when it comes out their mouths an folks will say this apart of the ineffability of a psychic experience folks i i know the sounds bullshit and the sounds but my god i can just decide the feeling this gravity of agency and which i think its interesting as regardless of the the the the debates on the reality of free will i think the philosophy of that whether the it is ultimately feel free will pure agent see if that exists which ism skeptical of or just the idea that clearly we have a sense of agency there is something there whether it is the sense of agency even that is the human being has and that seems to be at times fundamentally like k supercharge from a psychedelic experience this idea ism just going to make a decision normally outta depressed person lie do not do not think of yourself that way you are not a fail like its is yet you can actually in one of these states have an experienced we realize a my god just using india ay to treat it she organdy staring work with silciden treapetyis to some one could really reprocess their drama in a way that has lasting effects in clearly probably something yo consolidation of those memories ere they are they are altered very consistent with with the are understanding the way memory work the whole idea people can actually in in a few hours have a such a profound experience that they they decide to make these changes an who they are an its sticks there seems to be something that and that is profound i mean i i think a few moments gas i made a some semi disparaging statements about things the secret in formations and and the reason i i do that with with a with a nod to the fact that the people in it who are putting those ideas for tor a well intention people is that the neural networks of the brain put language last we we tell stories and stories are very powerful but i think one of the a most cruel aspects of the whole self help a literature an popular psychology is this idea that everything you say your brain and body hear it that is ashallyg a very a unkind or even cruel thing for people who are depressed or anxious to hear because if they hear that and believe that and i will not a clear i do not think it is true that they think that it is very hard to control thoughts is very hard to control thoughts somebody us as i cannot and then somebody says well know every time you say you cannot your brain hears that and it reinforces that is a very a treacherous place to live am and language is powerful but neural networks the brain and the networks that underlie emotionality an perception and sense of self they do not change in response to language they change in response to experience and it just fundamentally you need there some prerequisites you need certain demodulators present ceretonan or dope me you neither to be at sufficient levels you do not need to drug necessarily do it you could a you give a kid a kitten or a puppy their first in arpuppyan the levels of opening and ceretonean have never measured them but we can be pretty sure that they are higher than base line hand that experience will reshape them right likewise within adult in a certain circumstances i think ism fastening by this idea that i ha somatic and a perceptional experience but a real experience of the sort that you are describing is what allows us to reshape our neural circuitry and to feel differently about ourselves and ah i know there is been u really tremendous success in many individuals of alleviating depression treating drama with these different compounds i wanted step from the the experience under the effects of the psychedelic the person there with your team they go into the expanded perceptual bubble if if things go well they are able to do that to a really deep degree maybe it is the the realize drama maybe it is the beauty of the their ability to connect to things in the world now i won't talk about the transition out of that state and then the export into life because this is really where the power of psychedelic seems to be in the therapeutic sense the ability to learn truly learn from that experience that the learning becomes the default that one does not have to remind themselves oh i am the other one to do in affirmation i am a happy person i am a have i was thing a part season writing on much o or a get work for him does not work for the other lot of to but as they transition out of this state i know that there is a kind of a heighten there is a the local peak where everything seems to be connicascating in at such a level that the person just they cannot really turn it off at that point might challenge and then they start to exit the effects of the drug are those transitionzones are those valuable much is the transition between a dream and the waking state valuable because you are in a sort of mishmash of altered reality and new reality writ what do you would you do to guide people through the out out the tunnel as they regional and i had to say this is where we need more experimentation u really the clinical model goes back to literally the night late nineteen fifties and there is been virtually no experimentation on let saying minimize people to were going a talk more during the latter half of the of the session verses not verses we have them you know wrist an essay after their session verses not very we have this amount of immigration what is a relation in your studies are they are they writing or talk in we er doing and it is called in a very busy guys in a term integration but for us means as there coming back from the experience a sort of five six hours and he knows this is the afternoon they've been dosed around nine o'clock this is four o'clock or just a initial tell us about the experience you want and not unpacking at totally but ten i initially just have a little bat discussion before they go home this little bit of that but then that night their home work is to write something it can be you know a few bullet points it could be twenty pages we we get everything in that range but you know try not to be self critical it is not grated dis to process and for point of discussion the next day they write something that come in the next day for aka one to two hour defining on the study integration cushion basically discutless discuss your experience and beginning on what study it is an what what might that mean for your dealing with answer what might that mean for y your smoking your or becoming in on smokers you encourage him to simply take it seriously and i think this again a sort of one of the points that could be the antithesis of what som just a social users house an this was ridden about by a sexton a smith the scholar of religion in terms of these mystical experiences that can happen from psychedelics and how a lot of times the attribution to a drug effect is dismissed the t even if one has this this sense of being one with the universe in it totally shakes their soul to speak it the next day their friends i o yours threw up too much asci you wo men next time you nu od have a few more bears to bring that at this sort of social reinforcement for dismissing the experience all god you are talking out your head man even if it is been a good natured but it is this dismissal it is not what you want to do is tell me more about that you were crying at one point like can talking bout your on butts talk about that what was that do you remember that o you are you doing that follow up or you there occurs should do that in their own life with the various people in their look both we do that explicitly and in the follow for we have these discussions and i o depending on what the situation is a you might encourage the person to can a follow up it is it is really the basics of it is is supportive u tripe it is non structure it is yet no use all that you no reflective listening and the sort of the humanistic psychology that you unconditional positive regard for the person but but i think if if so one feels inclined to you apologize to their to their you to to their sibling about some things like ego and called up when it it tho something big a relationship change a be sit on that two weeks do not make any big do not end any relationship do not quit your job do not make any big just to tall them not to start any relationship i do not remember that ever coming up poult you let it let to to it om not yo of is wondering its but i sense we like it their dating and they thinking i i might be time to take it to the new sell should i ask this girl to marry me if it did come up i would say there too mint you sexton that a weaker you do not get let your sober my own do not get a puppy certainly soft tins until your i have a question about flash backs a one it one of the kind of o things you hear as flash backs on that out that people do people get flash backs and if what is the basis of flash backs the the on the street a lore about thesis that somehow some of the compound get stored in body fat tissues and then release later a is that complete nonsense no evidence for that probably complete nonsense flashbacks are nonsense over the storage body fates complete the storage body fat to answer whether flashbacks are complete nonsense we have to definite i really think these are multiple contracts that are going that is not the same thing that fall under that term there is a phenomenon that that appears real that is called hallucengin persisting perceptual disorder it is in the ease a certain number a people very small number of people a you percentage wise who have use psychedelics will have these persisting perceptible disorders they will see halos around things they will see some trials the after images following an object in motion at they will see distortions in color and it will be anything else that is a i disorder in the deisemahacity clinically distressing and has to be persisting over some a number of of months and and very rare very mysterious some of the keys to that are amazingly it is never been seen in the thousands of participants either from the order error from the late fifties to the early seventies a people in psychadelixayes with listen solve masculine in its never been seen in the modern air again now with thousands of participate at a number of centers ours throughout the world it seems to be something that is for some reason happening in illicit use tat that brings in o ka is a jolly pharmacology buy know us you drink in during you take what you thought you yet what is the dose is without the purity but then also what i think is actually even more than the what is likely going on is some sort of very rare near logical susceptibility there is one paper that is a case series of individuals reporting these symptoms and they did not limit it to the to just people would had hallucinate in history in the amazing thing about this is that a a number of people seem to have straight up h up d signs is age pop a llucigeand persisting perceptual disorder who have never taken a psychedelic it is often prompted by alcohol bens at spines canary even tobacco and and i believe in one individual no lifetime history of any it was not preceded by any of those a substance u use is i think it is i think of it the precinct action exacerbation of psychotic distorts we t seems pretty clear through observation that some people with with either predisposition or act of psychotic disease that this can destabilize them e psychic the same way that a life experience can de satirize us person more easily i think of that there is probably some pretty rare neurological susceptibility we have tended going this goes back to the aides clinical practice it in it up in the ease okay son hallusage in because i i related to the the psychology of xenophobia it is always the weird other thing that gets the attribution you do not attribute to the thing o ye did you smoke cigarettes did you drink it like well yet but i see lots of people drinking an not ending up with this you take a crazy drug and you can get p people to believe all sorts of crazy stop the biggest example of that is the that the cathenon derivative called basalts can't remember several years back we a i going with lord a that that ate the other guy's face there as a homeless guy that literally a part of some one's face all wall the cravings along while the person was alive and all it took was one share of step e to say well i do not know but i bet it was some of that basalts sup that is been going on the only think what wait was the only thing in his sos of men we could set the record straight for people what what was why would he say basalts and was it basalts it it was not and and the only thing in his to was canvas which we all know typically people do not eat people's faces all after they gets that o hunger not ta right right it is just an example of the xenophobia to day if you get on good images and look up basalts won the most comment ye you images you will see is is poor guy's face being eaten all we are just ready to each on just the people of another culture that we do not know it is it is it is very easy to a sign attribution to a class that your very in familiar ut i think they the psychedelics got that attribution with this very rare an our logical susceptibility the way that alcohol did not i think it is not specific to psychedelics but we do not really know we need but we we would look at it and our research had never seen an example of it but flashbacks can mean a number of other things i think the most common thing people experiences what we call it state dependent learning it is it is it is it is returning yourself to a similar context can bring back the same thoughts and emotions as the experience en if someone used to pea mushrooms a we ago now they do something they smoke some canvas or they a or the they take a warm bath a or there simply relax it seems to come out of the blue and all the son the what were they follow a a thought trail that takes them that reminds m the and they find themselves in that same experience again i think that is more state dependent learning it is not the distressing component that is in and it is not typically not perception and then another class are just sort of perceptible anomalies within a day or two following the experience which is not age pop pity most people have in a joke that this is a free trip you might see if ye trails or hairs the day afterwards it does not last longer than that in its does not screen up it is kind of finally o am saying some traumas people will say it can mean any of those things to lasfacts ye cant you say no appreciate you you clarifying that i mean one very common misconception about neuroplasticity is that it is an event and it is not an event it is a process and we have no understanding of the duration of that process however the experience of any drug or any life experience it even if a drama or wonderful experience or a psychotic experience does not matter sitting motion a series of dominos that fall and it is the falling of those dominos that we call naroplasticity i mean that the reshaping of neral circuits could take years we do not know it is the the trigger an then there is the actual change and i think that some of what you describe could be literally the reordering of circuitry that in some individuals might extend longer than others and there is one phenomenon that a have been told a people experience and ism wondering whether not any of the patience you have worked with er a people in your trials have eve reported this have never done aawaska a which ism assuming has some overlap with the ceremonial system paella hits a variety is ayin to doom sit was work that is any o workers that allow the the you be worthy and i should i should have a recalled that absolutely have never done it but a number of people i know that if done aawaska as well as people i know who have done m d may a report and increase sense of what a sometimes called a sambar these auto ma censer meridian relaxes which is and it is interesting a lot of people a have these naturally and they hide these teaser it is actually a something of many people keep hidden to themselves it'll just ask you if you can do it a some people are able to pass a a shiver down their spine or up their spine consciously you can kind of ism able to actually passer shiver up my spine i should learn how to do this when i was a kid on a hot day of standing on a field and sports campus i get's really hot here and i could actually create a cooling a a percent cooled perception some people have told some on this once and then it is led to a discussion of oh i can do it but i always hid that from people cause it it is silk a somewhat pleasurable and this is a well known phenomenon phenomenon a sambar and some people i know who've taken m d ma therapeutically or awake am will report that they in feel great relief from this they can generate these autonomic reflexes through their body more readily probably ism guessing because they were able tho too into a kind of deeper sense of somatic self now on the inner a som a if you look it up it is lot the baseball thing but another direction there were people that pay a limit let to say there a counts on you to t have many many millions of yours of people that will whisper to them about i for instance there is a a people that will go listen to it seems to be women in prettier whispering about care mechanics or something hereabout were scratching there certain sounds will do this this spring tapping finger tapping and people in ferns immense pleasure from it it is not really sexual pleasure but it is this kind of deep corpse of mead that it is the autonomic nervous system down the crowding let a certain number of people would call cundelini which is anothelent scientifically that is right people who do long duration condoling breathing sessions many of them will report later feeling as if they their perception of self is outside of their head a a that they are little walk it is a very uncomfortable for them that they feel the walking around with their sense of self extended beyond the body and this is a normal this is a clinically describe or logic for now have any studies been done i would imagine that person might actually would they dock oh went turtle dow can interesting o o the ting my lad would want and to to the ether body can clear mere right projection ye would not the sense myself handing there is a there is a we known phenomenon it it is very a in a few individuals very sad were people actually a avidly seek out imputation of their limbs because their limbs they feel do not belong to their body oh ye this is very sad and a the fortunately very rare but also very sad condition anyway i think that the the the corpse of this conversation that were were drilling into is this notion of of reordering the self and it is and it is a relief to me to know that flash backs are not something that is it kind of a forgive the our baked in to the a to the psychedelic experience and i suppose that is a good sexual to ask about other sorts of drugs i a having said baked in the temptation is to go to a meroonor cannabis but but if we if we could it'd to just ask about some of the more noblemen urgent compound in particular emdiama ye my understanding is the emdimay is a purely sense t synthetic compound that you are not gin a fine emdiama in nature far there her debate was for emphasized in the lain an we thought it in exist in nature and then a richer shanties found it everywhere and tat yet who knows a plan out i might be making imam but right as far as we know now no right and we will talk about deemptiin it sources within the body but emdyamay could exist in elsewhere a but it is been emphasized and my understanding is the media may leads to very robust increases in both opening and ceratonan simultaneously which from a from a neural networks perspective is a very unusual situation right normally because doping puts us in this exteroceptive looking outside ourselves seeking things in the world beyond the skin our own skin and dope excuse me ceratoneantunsto focus us inward those are almost mutually exclusive out of petrochemical states bug there always at different rolls why would it be that hosting this a increased opening and increase er atone and would provide an experience the is beneficial and howdy you to esomethingyou can describe it how do you think that experience differs from the sort of experiences that people have on sylisidein or more seratonergic agents just broadly speaking ye ye in terms of that that plant terms of the the the effects generally on serotonin and opening i can only e know speculate sort of is that dopominergic component necessary for let us say we know that the eidola is less react of during in under acute of facts and that may play a role in u a there is last sort of a control from from the amygdala and terms of one's experience of memories maybe part of the sort of reprocessing a this consolidation in these memories in a different way where the signal is not going crazy saying freegalt y to fiderflike wen i and have said it seems emdiama is being used clinically anyway mainly for drama not just for depression although pard of we really do not know me may be that india may as great for depression and some of these other and it may be that and i waking to be looking at the son that filicide in as great for treating it a steal to of underground therapist say that underground psychedelic there's we do not really know under a round oh because the e doing illegal but more a professional there's would it just illegal a and this is a kind of a growing a thing a we do not really know which it it speculating but it may be that india may for a broader number of people is better for for drama because the chances of having an extremely challenging experience what i call the bad trip really freaking out is much lower with india may here can have bad trips but they are f a different nature we was not it is not sort of freaking out because all of reality is sort of shattering and it is less of this it can take many forms with the classic psychedelics but typically you you will hear something i did not know what was going to be this no matter how hard you tried to prepare them that this is get me all this you tries to your was the sits have an i a try yet yet ant and just the sense of ism going insane this is far beyond anything have ever experience and it is scaring to said out on me who i haven't to hold on anything even that i exist as as as as an entity and that can be really i think frankly experientially that is kine of the gate way to both the transcendental mystical experiences that the sense of unity with all things which we know our day to suggest is related on to long turnpositive outcomes wet i wont ta ma sure at serving the bad trip can be related to the trancidential expect i i think those are both speculating but youyou have to pass through this sort of yet reality shattering including your sense of self and one can handle that in one of two ways you can either completely surrender to it or you can try to hang on and if you try to hang on it is going to be more a a bad trip again i wish there is more an holy the will be more experimentation eyes a lot going on here in the black box and terms of the operant behavior of how you are within yourself choosing to handle letting go and eventually will be able to see this in real time with brain image to there they are surrendering to the psychic experience here they are trying to hold on but we are not there yet but i think it is a clinical observation seems pretty clear that something that is going on and certain drugs de t smokdim t can be strong the reason i i think that can be extraordinary concompare the others cause it forces people there is no choice tiding over don't it i has told that tee is a high speed locomotive into the psychedelic experience and out of the psychedelic experience and there is no ability to hold on to the self while you are in the the copekpace is that correct a lot of people say that but som trench mac can who's cone of the classic barred on test effects he would say the sense of self was not intact but everything else the sensorium and what you navigated which you bring into towards everything else change basically but it is hard to win everything's changing hard to say what is the self that is changing what is the rest of the world we languages is tolly deficient to describe experience anyway much less ones psychedelic e what is magenta's background what is this qualification for being this in as you referred thispard of of empty and ever talk that trench and there's also the brother penis a whom i know whose whose can only imagine what yet the rather is at clarence passed away on years couple decades togo now but on he serve the one who is known is being barred and you can find hundreds if not thousands of hours of him on the lecture circuit in the eighties in nineties on you to but his background was really a basion i i do not recall what his college degree was in but he basically u when he was nineteen he travelled to south america and an actually on the initial trip with his his brother who was even a younger than him with some other friends and just i i in search for indebted snuff that they had read about from in the hazard arrives from the work of shorties from a generation before but they had discover all of these mushrooms growing that he at down there the inside cushions with a recognizing just took a lot of mushrooms and and and talked about it talked about i trench was basically a very intelligent very well read and in literature and culture person need he was sort of the the next generations a him learn someone who could really speak get a little closer to the magnitude of what the psychedelic experience was for people and he serves likeleary somewhat of of an advocate any he would tell tell people folks you could see in a the equivalent of a udo landing on on the white house down its right there still take five minutes it will shake everything in your reality he would there of good people in doing will certainly science and clinical medicine is a are just but two lenses with which to explorer these things in life but what part reason i ask is i feel in the world of health and fitness a you have this very extreme condition of areola shortzanaggres and body builders who have two per cent body and they look to most people they look to freakish ye especially now right all especially now is pectin now ye and yet at hora yet i ye it regular exactly law in his a ye and you have contortionists who can put themselves into a small box and wrap themselves into a basil but from those two very extreme sub culture practices that i do not now anything about contortionist really but except that they get really bendy that but it is a community that included a lifestyle practices an nutritional practise drug practices from those very extreme subcultures there is been an export which is that wait training is healthy right the general public is done that or that yoga is healthy contortionist to yoga et camera and i feel a similar thing is happening in the realm of psychedelics where it was learn and hurry i mean i i from the malaria am not far from the meal park vie where one flew over the carouses best i o and easy in those goes and the there has been an attempt at eating this movement toward openness about psychedelics and their positive effects this is happened before the difference is that now there are people you inside the walls of the university or publishing pe reviewed studies and things in that sort reasask about my henna was you know it seems my henna and his brother a what set just two of many people michael pain et camera who haven no real formal training in biology or psychology the other guides who were at universities lost their chops they were removed from places hazard and other universities for their of cavalier exploration a right and now things are kind of returning in the same way that body building led to wait training and every corner him yet men women and children a and contortionist is one extreme but people generally think the yoga is a pretty healthy practice right there these are matter of degrees right and now here you are inside the the the the walls of a very highly respected university johns hoping you arson the medical schools under got t the medical which it is it a serious health a institution u the question is to me what are the what are the valuable exports right and where does the extreme living clearly there is a there is a problem with u tinkering with reality through pharmacology and there is a benefit it sounds to tinkering with reality through pharmacology and what striking to me is this is the elements of a typical experience a typical representation of the self for the for the average person right or for kids that are hearing this kids that are in their teens right what are i want to talk about what are the the dangers of psychodeliges in something you do not here a lot about these days and it is not because ism anti psychotic at all but what are the dangers right if a if a if a kid were adult has a predisposition toward lets say u a psychotic thinking right or auditory hallucinations or u were is on the a asperse side of the autism spectrum is there an increased risk of of bringing the mind into these states cause it sounds a very lay bile situation could we talk a little bit about that and are their classes of these different drugs whether not b my ma lust or dm t that are that you think are particularly sharp blades and therefor need to be wielded particularly careful yet these can be profanely we stabilizing experiences and ones that ideally a a had in a safe container sort of where where some one what are the relevant dangers and what can we do to mitigate the there is too bigger one and have already mention its people with very severe psychiatric illness not not depression not anxiety ism talking about psychotic disorders sets crania or mania as part of by polar disorder an indignosically this is shifted such a little hard to say how many people to day with by poler would have been able to set ofriniaback in the sixties when some of this early research for just clinical observation was done it seems very clear that folks with ta predisposition or act of disease they could be tostablized and some of the cases we know of always sank of did bear it the first singer of pink flood seems pretty clear although i think thin do not no will happen there not i should be sorry ping flood fans i have never the songs a just really long yet you are more of a punk right yet i die got my foot in a lot of worlds defile pardon in the flood world but a time he basically went crazy early on he he it seems out that hisfamily ever admitted it but he develops skits of crania classic pattern and in and he was doing a lot of plenty but a lot of these cases it looked he was showing all of the signs of son some some some hints of of a a that he had that susceptibility before and often the is hard to disentangle what causes what because when to people typically not always but developed whens the total period for first break its ad lessons early andoldhood yet and when to people start playing with drugs same exact time period it can be hard to to disentangle but it seems pretty clear now i should also ay there are cases of folks with sets frank that say syculicts have helped them there is anecdotes for everything to e people rob skits of rennin say help the i knows o as when skits of rennin say things you have to i ma not you an way a wit all do compassion and respect fruit sets fruits disorder of thinking if there saying it help them ho yet can you trust them yet i would not be surprised if there was some colonel truth in some cases but there is just it seems very clear that the other side is there to and that that there ever is a therapeutic potential there for those disorders that that should not be the first thing on our less wean to learn a lot more because of the level querist before we start in doing research to see sell give an can help with skits of crania i do not think that may never be the case but even if it is he would hade to be even more cautious and figure some more things out for us wit some of these other disorders t o limes o over bipolar disorder can o be exasperated by these yes and it is it may be that that that sort of the manifestation of people having prolonged psychiatric issues after a a psychotic experience as as a typical as that is when that happens it it it maybe that is that might be more a manic episode than a psychotic episode and that can be blurry line in its its the folk lore is that yon people goon a trip an thy never come bat it is clearly not the case because to know the drug is matavalize for any one else in the next day there not cents the note reshow circuitry from it right and there is still and i i really do think you n a much the positive o you know a long term of facts that this class of problems is related to the the to the experience in in the the stabilization that can happen from that from that experience if it is not in that in the right container and again these people are susceptible to some people with that psychotic predisposition they lucky to be born to a great family stable environment they maybe never have a full break or the one they have as not nearly as bad as what someone that t that use whose homeless and is coming from all kinds of early childhood drama the disease is probably going to be far worse that the psst having a psychic experience s is one of those stabilizing experiences exclude ow fortunately it is really easy to identify those people and we even i air in the side of extreme caution by eliminating people with say first degree relative in some studies even a second degree relative given the heritability the some increased chance if your brother your yet a in an abundance of caution o even limiting at i think eventually if it is approve for use after ye use at we can dial back on that as we learn more i think it is again over overly cautious which is but your onerrsrash clue actor on very place the star at this point of time but you know if you en give a skid or another structured psychiatric interview with the cognition sing now in this person for a few hours todelvin to their history an an but you could very delivery determine at this person has either you n a psychotic this order were by poor disorder or a strong predisposition that that you can scheme for that and that is how you address that the far more likely danger is the bat trip any one can have this the most psychologically healthy person in the world probably you jack the dose high enough and especially n in n in a less than an a ideal environment you can have a bad trip you you even get it in an an ideal environment ours a at a hide of around thirty milligrams f hillside and after the best preparation we can provide about third of people will say essentially at some point they have a bad trip what some point within the entire journey right now they could have one of the most beautiful experiences of their sometimes a couple minutes later but at some point they had a sense of strong anxiety fear losing their mind a feeling trap something that now typically when people have that in the when there just taken on their own savings they are find they get through it you knowthe're more likely to be better off if they're not having to navigate the streets of man hat and that or and if they are with other people with friends better that those friends are not also dealing with their enpsychelic experience but probably having some friend of any type but whatever i there is better than having nothing they dependent on contacts and the tough thing her that that in in in conveying to the public is that a lot of folks will say they not takin psychedelics hundreds of times and this is your fear mongering and there is no you are exaggerating the danger there i want to say it is a typical but some times and i have a file folder that grows larger every year of these cases either in the medical literature or from the news of people that free out on a psychedelic and they they get harder they die they run into traffic they they they fall from a height whether they thought they could fly or other they just fell they you can do when your drunk or an you are intoxicated on any substance sometimes that that is unclear u or gosh one of the craziest cases was a a a kid an eighteen year old or an in dragon several years back that just he even rode about i want to take the biggest he ha done muslin for i want to take a a a heroic dose the biggest oses have ever taken heated up just totally out of it in it up in a neighbor's house seems just totally disoriented disconnected morality in the cousin an of killing him and i a just tragic obviously never used force in that case cause he was actually naked at the finest naked hundred and twenty pound i thing as a recall kid that in it a dying but well it is analogous to the you knowthet rest use the examples body going culture people therehave takin excesses o amounts of anabolic and dramatics and die then the contortionist culture people put themselves in a old prexy glass boxes to do at the extremes you you are going to get deaths and at the extremes and as and one of the extremes is the sheer number of people with different biological make ups taking the same drop and you can create extremes through numbers you can take extreyou create extremes through desert it it seems o it is why ism such a and of of the fact that people yourself are doing clinical trials inside a the walls of university not because a i think that psychedelics a only have utility in those environments but because it is important toward creating their transition to legality and to understand what legality means for a compound this right right what model right an again all will stay with the anal eateries there is now to stostron and estrogen replacement there beforemon replacement there be is a common medically approve practicebut that is vastly different than people taking their own stophorodie or deciding how much they mean to take right we said there is there is begun there is contortionist in a prexy glass blow and you to thinking oodenior something there these are a matter of degrees speaking of dosage i define want ask you about microcosm verses standard or macrocosm tell me tell me that ism wrong but ism always a little bit on i sort a little a i microcynical if you will about this termicrodose and the reason is that many people that i know who talk about microdosing are taking dosages of compounds that work at might that are very powerful at microgram levels the word micro i think can be a little confusing to people because microcosm implies less than something yet a meaning dose right and yet some of these compounds were are tremendously powerful at microgram concentrations what it constitutes ha microcosm and what is the value of called microdosing if any and how does it differ from standard or what i can only assume as called microdosand ye and plenty would be the the the prototypical example of that superpodent do what what size dosage of of plenty will lead to hallucinations and conistandse her the entry point for psychedelic type effects which may not involve hallucination actually most classic cycodelics do not me to true hallucinations as to find in psychiatry of an see thinking your talking to the person that is not the seeing the pink elephant not my licks loserasirs and things like right and and precisian son people never get that even at a very high dose i think more broadly interns of the psychedelic effects which is not just perceptual unless we get into the level as you are alluding to earlier broader definition of perception one's models of the world the model of the self you can you can consider all of that perception in terms of you know truly not sensation but perception the construction of a putting together reality on yet yet ye its a decychodelic effects are atypically considered to start list round a hundred microgram a tenth of a telegram is a hundred micrograms it the sand taking a hundred micrograms of celeste they on the nowadays people might mistakenly refer to that as a microcosm because it is microgram is but that is actually a macrocosm aid list right they might and that is one of the most common mistakes or situations that people get into with microdosing as they intended to be a microcosm but it finds to being a full blown dose now people do and whenthey'r working without these and they are microdosing ghyll shoot for something say ten milligrams i a something in that range ten twenty milligrams of leste a ten the fifth something o kind of your entry level psychedelic dose peoples ability on the street to do this an i say the street as if thereon the corner but anyway outside of the medical profession to do this varies as you and they are not measure of purity an molarity or thinned theoretically and there is ways to do it even if you do not ultimately know the dose that is in the later paper of acid one could at least get a sense of yet having one of those tabs is a one of those hits is is a psychedelic experience they could do something put in water it is a hundred per cent aqueous soluble you could vault make sure all gets into solution and then vole metrically measure it is going to be homogeneously distributed sericin you take one tenth of that volume of water r after it is fully dissolved no that whatever you started with you can have a tent to that dose the people tat are more sophisticated well do things that and when they are working with mushrooms they they will grow much mushrooms in the no see put it in a cole grinder ism not killing people to d this by the way ism just describing said do not do this at home but grind it all up it is homogenesis cause you can have en a sort of taking two caps in a stem hey this two caps in the send that this body takes is has a different gunnery in this two caps in a send that the otherbody takes people that are kind of en to knob all grind it all up into a homogenous powder and they'll pack it in to whatever size capsule and they will know that and again even if they do not have sometimes they might have a buy that will sneak it into the h peel sea et their at they're job or whatever if they have not you are l i but not li lit that is ever a it seriously never happened but but but they will at least know that hey have got a sense of what two capsule do have got a sense of what five capsule do and but in reality that is not what people do that they they they will take a piece of blot or paper and they get a tiny little pierscissors swissarmy life pierces and the cut up the tab of acid which is i cannot one a quarter and square something and they will cut it up in ten little pieces in it is i got you've no idea if it is equally distributed in that media end we can chuckle about it and om but to me one of the reasons why this experiment around psychedelics this cultural experiment and this legal experiment we are seeing this now but this was all attempted once before in the sixties and seventies the difference was it was all out in the street the people in universities who were dabbling with the stuff lost most of them lost their jobs er were asked to leave through h y a loss of running for this rest seranimaly and anserine on other topic that's your these are precarious times me were it were a were in a keen moment where everyone assumes that this is all going to be legal in a few years but i think that that is a premature assumption medically but and i an let us touch on the legality and some of the things that are happening now but what is microdosing suicide an verses om the sorts of dosages that you describe before in the tend to forty o milligram range o have heard of people taking one or two milligrams of suicide an every day as a way to quote quote and for those listening just making air courts with my fingers increase plasticity which is which is a term that i personally loath because hat what does that mean i you do not really want your brain to be plastic because you need to make predict if you need to maintain your ability to ma predictions ye ism i i as prediction you you need models of the world et i you need heuristics plasticity is never the goal or bet plasticity is never the goal o erected plasticity is the goal i learning a language of reshaping your experience to a drama altering the perception of self but plasticity is a process a yet you said is arena is a lot of plasticity exist right an man it might even be there is one theory that it is extreme on going plasticity that is why people never a create stable representations of anything that is a a kind of a a minority view out there but what is the business with mycrodosing and is there any clinical evidence or pure review publish evidence that it works quod quote to make people feel better about anything microdosing i is is is the aim of taking against something a round a tenth of what would be sort of an entry level psychedelic dos for whatever compounds o am yet fit sillsunusually people almost never pet to people have pure silicon won one milligram sisiden would be in the range of a micra as more likely people can have in a mushroom silo something a a a half of a a a gram of mushroom i know people they goner as ran every day there doings every day r in the the same way that i take a a am personally am not s recommending other people do his but i take some a madman of else all carnations lately give in kind of experiment with the albeit which is not a psyched colic compound i take it every day and ta there taking the that is a selsyn everyday that is their supplement ye yet the claims are in their number of them the two general ones one is i sort of acting in in place of the eighty high d treating drug the sychomunder stimulant o a better version of lateral the other claims are essentially a better version of of the traditional anti to present a better version of prosaic be no eikon both for attention definite and for depression yet and the aspects of those disorders that you know we all have a a degree of just infedomin is going to increase the focus of at the right dose of any one who takes in become and pretty much y whether your eighty go d diagnose or not a the idea it is that the there may not be a necessarily a a clear divide between the their pubic need and in a positive psychology even improving mood and focus you know it is not necessarily correcting a eighty high d but improving focus o supercharge your your life and those o the claims i am to none of the pure reviewed studies that are have much credibility om none of them have shown a benefit and they have tried another it we there is only at this point for or five studies that and i think for things this you really need double blind such cause the effects i men there is one study done an amsterdam where peopled knew they were taking sill given trifles basically same as mocha's an more the roots than mycelia my nosing want taking of what would be considered a a a a microcosm and then doing some some cognitive measures before and after ans types of thing that yo lot cogon measures are measured on the order of reaction time in mill of seconds and me in the types of effects you get as you could imagine a ones that would be you would totally expect could be there from either a practise of felt or or an expectancy offectaplocebo of fact for something these claim you could imagine a sort of an increased focus i an handymen of cognition these are going to be more subtle effects that you really need aka good placebo control for the handful of studies that have done that have shown they have range from finding no effect whatsoever to just a little bit of impairment imparting some one's ability to do o time estimation in production task you want an accurate sense of time at least of your navigating in the real world it is different if you are on the couch on a heroic dose for their pubic reasons were your safe but if you are crossing the street if you are getting up you giniuorn life yet which is where the way people are claiming yo use that helps them be a better see yo you want an accurate sense of time if anything to day to suggests that it makes it a little bit less accurate and and there's evidence that someone feels a little bit impaired om n they feel a little bit high terms of you you call that abuseliability in research not surprising you take a little bit of of a drug that can result in a sometime of a high you take a little tiny bit of it you will fill a little bit high om yet none of the far no studies have have shown you knows a an't any increase in creativity enhancement at any form of cognition or or or a sustained improvement in mood now no studies have actually looked at the the the the system of microdosing that the offischin atom are claiming and there is a couple of models out there but but folks o pall stammers and others they will have particular formulas they are you need to take it one day than take many days off and take it every four days and to o one of getting whose models wat but it is always something that some pattern of use usually not every day and and the claim is that it is not just yo sometimes people get benefit that first time when they take it but they really say you need to be unit for a while a few weeks in any may star to not to this pattern of ut of using it any your your feeling to benefits on those off days the three or er two days in between you are active dose those of the claims again we do not know that there is any truth to that working but studies have not been done to model that that is a big having we as a feel as my we is the as the the scientific feel have not done the studies to really model what the real officiates are claiming in where the theyrepetint benefits come from that said it is it is it is almost assuredly there is a good amount of placing there but but the cannot to that is almost everything in medicine or therapeutics there is an it is going to have some degree of plasma the beef effects are or have a college stamford a a let from who as publish really beautiful work on belief effects that show that it such a you give the same milk shake to two people you are two groups of people you tell them that one contains a lot of neutrience the other as a locally shake the there the insolent response amazing there as dramatically between the two or two b two groups rather doing equivalent amounts of of physical movement and you tell one group that it is going to be good for them and help them lose weight than they lose on average either to twelve pounds more doing the exact sane patterns of movement and i think that these belief facts well down to all sorts of a kind of network wide nor modulation things that sort then that the work at hazard suggesting that even if you do not have deception you give up placing and say this is a sugar pill right you no an some of them that an it guy still treat things that t er to alow as the first thing they looked at right and there is a huge there is a reality there right o there is a necessity n developing drugs to make sure it is not only that but it but in the actual practice of medicine hopefully which are always getting is some underlying direct efficacy play the plasma that any hance is at now it could be that this is the real question is is the microdosing are those claims a hundred decent placing or they only partplacivo and part real in a codon c one affect my bet is and this is totally base on anecdotes that i think there is probably a reality to the anti oppress an effects i find that more intriguing we was i suffering with depression even if it is an it would not be as interesting as i think what were doing with hides strive on our psychotics to treat u depression it would be if this is developed in those reality it would be more a better perhaps o better assess are a better protect would haver sitenglane more tools than fewer tools in the tool box and it should not be that surprise that even before the as going back to the trysyclix and the man inhibitors coming to the fifty grinning extracellular keratose in one way or another for many people leads to a reduction and depressive symptoms it would not be that crazy for chronically stimulating a subtype of serotonin receptor that you have an anti depress an effects i think if i have put my bets on it that there is if there is anything real it is in that cigar although ism very open to lek maybe there is something to the creativity to the improved cognition which covers many domains in an of itself but u my my greatest hopes are on the on the anti depress an effects that set in the big picture i think all of the most interesting thing about psychedelics are the heroic doses i mean the idea give something one too three times and you see improvements and depression months later and in a diction can over a year later and with these in o people dealing with potentially terminal illness i mean it is i mean ism interested in big effects and i do not thin you are ever going to get the really big effects there's also some concern that almost all of these common psychic the more common psychedelics even counting indiamay they have serotonin to be agonist effects and agonizing serotonin to be has been shown to lead to heart valve formation problems morphology issue a vavolopithy and this is why defend was pulled from the market the giro yes the effective right right and it was the the portion of that commination that had the the the serotonin to be activity that was was the problem and we do not know all of the that the toxicologist s have ever spoken to about this would no say in cardiologist say oka if there is some concern there it is not applicable to the whole idea you taken something a few times stereputically within a lifetime but the idea of taking something e twice a week for years i mean even the the hippies back in the sixties were not doing that right there is not even these natural it and even if they even if there was some hart valved dies problem i that stepped from psychedelic use who is connecting those dots that is not showing up in the clinical charts for any one to figure out there is in in invest theoretically there is more of a concern if it somethings on to happen with with heart bawls it is more likely that that those issues would arise when some one taking these things gallic say twice a week forward the next five years and i do when to throw that out to people to really consider it a something i had not heard before that in in micro sound safer micro dosing as opposed to heroic macrodosing and yet unless and in the context of your lab and and other labs doing similar work am you have got this people checked blood pressure you have got people that are really monorduring your psychological and physical safety when people are out their microdosing it sounds there is the potential either through the keratose an five age to to be am receptor or other mechanism that if there could be some noncumulative negative of facts the a and i thing that is an ma really important consideration some glad you brought it up what about kids the brain is very plastic early in life it becomes less plastic as we age although it maintain some degree of last see throughout the life seen a the the year twenty five it not a a the you're twenty five but rather the age twenty five years am is sort of an inflection point where am the rigidity of the cargo system seems to really take off of course people do not wake up on their twenty fifth birthday and find they have no narrow plasticity was the day before they had a lot these are units player mines a ever it is a year to but am depends on the individual am however the the young brain is very plastic and i could imagine there could be great risks who knows maybe even benefits but ism certainly not a a thinking about those am mainly thing about the risks a for young people taking psychedelics are there any trials looking at people am in clinical trials is would be under the age of eighteen has any one explored this in a rigorous way am given the potential to exacerbate psychotic symptoms and bipolar symptoms and some people a is there heighten risk of that what is the story with age of use and psychedelic s for therapeutic purposes there is no formal research although i there is a very high chance that there will be and this is one of the very interesting things folks may not realize are appreciate about the aria approval process the fie already in until instances signalled that there they want to see those studies before well not not before it is approved as necessarily as a e know for for adults but there no eventually one to see in facts of the the maps group that is developing india a ferpetious the they am already signaled that that is coal an enlist of interest and there is even some incentives and that in the it a a pathways for am for insintivising folks to explore that that muslin young people i know in some of the work that i helped with in pushing a sylisivan in to face a face to be clinical research the f to ye said while why cannot you give this to kids it is are are you ware that the impression is a problem it with with adolescence in it is really interesting because this a alias very concerned about suit o specificity we idea he fine sutospose you have put out a drug and say all this is good for men but not women this is good for black folks but not white folks an now sometimes there is a very good rational for that were talking about hormones in for a specific you enough for for for for men verses women and the certain a issues a yet certain disease at i maybe sickle selenemia that is moral a saxes yet exactly but absent of something that there very concerned about saying oh this is for this type of person but not that give of person age is one of those things and also this recognition much the emphasis that at an i ago with with you now with rode studies in human says that you cannot just say you are study men or just went when you your rational thornily step foot to be clear to people there is n a it is a recent which but there is a stipulation in every federally funded grant that both sexes we do not refer to gender in scientific studies unless it is a study of gender person we refer to sex meaning biological sects that there is a stipulation that in order to receive and continue receive funding you have to do a studies on both males and females of that species including humans and at least look even if you are not powered for at t least looking a that in exploratory analysis as a grand review were charged with looking at did they address sex as a biologically relevant variable regaining do y dicertnin there's the same drug have different effects in males verses females right n o can to the us look at the trees even again if you are under power to look at those between subject type effects we non great shift that did not exist in a ten or years ago a something we are both on grants panels am as study section members you did not have to do that now it is it is in important biological variable if you do not a look at that you essentially will not get your your funding and ages a similar thing it is the whole idea man of something could help kids what is the rational i think there is going to be now obviously you are going to have in this studies at least just as much probably more it should be more of a caution cautionary approach it is probably going to be it would certainly whatever diseased take electargan have to be probe treatment resistant at let as a for staph i have to atriassion yet yet and in all of that in the next but hey if the to really helps people that are twenty five or thirty what is the rational that it will not help a younger person in there is contest generic find concerns about the developing nervous system is more susceptible to problem man cuts both ways cause it is also women clastic generally and adaptable may be resilient injury in certain ways but you know you hear the satiric about kids their brains and drugs and it is the developing brain is a special concern yet but i think we are going to be seeing research eventually that is it is interesting i went to the high school that is infamous sadly gun high school o for having it the highest degree at least at one point of suicide suiciderate mum lot very large number f suicide sis was written up in the times and elsewhere is all very academically successful school it is a veranda maid pressuaraacally demanding school yet i went where they have restricted the kids will meet often at six thirty a m or six am before school for study groups anythings that sort that some of it may relate to that om but i have to say that even prior to all that at academic pressure when i went there it was not the pressure was not that that we had a an unusual number of suicides for whatever reason and and the idea of kids being prescribed and no one be emphasized prescribe not just using but i prescribed psychedelics for therapeutic purposes i think might make some people bulk but the idea of kids om killing themselves should also make people balk and ism ism relieved to hear that there is going to be a rational scientific safe clinical trial based exploration of this i want to ask you about the current status of these drugs and compounds ism pretty active on social media more on instrgram than on twitter but as i have been on twirlemit more recently have notice that there is a lot of dialogue around your account and other people's accounts around a couple of themes relate to psychology first of all what is the status o of the transition to legality for for prescription purposes medical doctors eddies prescribing it legally for therapeutic purposes that is the first question the second question is what is the status as it relates to possession and criminal charges a for a long time i lived in talent where we were one day told not to long it is now count quit de criminalized is what i was told that double check people of but what is that and then the other issue in the third question we can parch these one by one is i issue of less you say i am aware of a lot of investor dollars going into companies that are essentially companies focus on psychedelics as therapeutics or psychedelics generally i have to assume that they are investing in anticipation of a shift in the leads toots and there is a lot of interest now will suicide band become a tack able thing just mareuanta it is start with o the question at what is going on in the was legally a is it illegal to possess and a sell and use these compounds my understanding is you can still go to jail for having these compounds in your possession or for selling right even though it is the the legal landscape is very different than with canibast o there are some similarities o one of the similarities is the regardless of what local municipal meaning whit city or state is decriminalize enact that word itself can mean many things the devil some some forms of decriminalization is close to what folks would call legalization and others are pretty weak just saying we suggest that the police make it their lowest lo enforcement priority that is uni e sort sure they turn the other choose con of the right but even that the cops can still choose to but some it you now at pulled over for one thing search and then by definition if it is illegal and they find it rime they have as the all have to do something about and that will probably be determined by both judicial precedent is it can be thrown out and just the local prosecutor even before i artisan to choose even almost arrest are going pursue to really go after those charges make those charges stick i think that still in playing is can a dependent the municipality but canvas federally these are all several one compound which means theirylegal that much means theirelegal a the cavort to taters as has always been the case since pronto fifteen an aliform with canibasts in ninety six is that hey ninety nine per cent of of drug enforcement is done at the local instate level the d ye which is the federal w level l enforcement is a tiny fraction of the arrests that going most people at arrested for any drug are done by local or state level authorities but it is still technically illegal and say you can and they could be potentially and depending on the ambiguity local all they even those local officials could charge you with the a federal crime and theoretically the feds could always come in now although you'll again a similar case with the e whole canvas history it was the the feds came in in the early days but the folks that were basically highly visible they went after mommy thong for selling bongs but you n i remember him being on the tenightsho one time and i think it was back in the ja lino days mesas but o long sanamonical border elect every shop sills bongs how did you go to prison for a half your for songs because he was in there was e is he was in a mommy thong and and there was some high profile minibus groups of you know that were distributing it an he were very vocal those who are the ones rated by the d in early days not the ones counting keeping to themselves keeping i quiet in just doing their thing there is always the potential for selective enforcement and and this initiative an dragon which is a state level legalization of sylicive an serape which is really interesting in a part of their plan for two years is to figure out how to in a great with the federal level and i do not know how that is going to go because unless you re write the controlled substance's act that seems the best your going to get is a a tolerance from the federal government and anal could be very o a hay you change administrations an this is sliced bin by o prescription from a medical doctor or your talking about therapists in who have masters degrees or pies or self appointed coaches or something that administering suicide ban o but without any oversight this is all getting figure out an the dragon case and again there is that two year period of basically were in a figure the out and and what is it with dragon not youth an i i love the sigarogant is but its interesting how you have these pockets dragon sermon seems to be one you get these kind of pockets where people are experimental with plant compounds they seem to be green woody areas for in at least in my mind but there there is sort of culture around plants and the use of plants as therapeutic and combined that with the west just were geographically of more of the the anti on a federalism the anti mean the organ ranchers from several years ago that held up the to the e whatever while life place you known that was a big shut you with the feds and the cot you no just kind of the west is kind of known for more of this idiot he combined the two the hip dip californium dragon by or is homing less hippy dippy the the although it was the there is always been a tradition moccasin the culture around drugs but uncertainly macadamia and intact et camera that the west it has been a place where people have tried to throw off traditionalism and kind of lineage and queer parents are what school you went into and and the past as a determinant of what is nap an exciting about the future whereas om an here we are in east coast institution grand a west as institution got i think that it is this idea of can of innovation and the future verses do we stay grounded in history in tradition and of course their great institutions on both sides which interesting is that am hoping johns hoping a medical school i think of as a a real east coast academic institution it is on these coast but here you are a doing these very pioneering and important and exploratory an studies in a certainly not a hippie dip environment ran er hoping a not a i ice department even among psychiatry departments and as a psychologist in ha psychic payment psychiatry is certainly more conservative than psychology even within academics but even among psychiota departments it is a very conservative department we got the law at the federal level we have got the law at the state and local level and then we have got this question of whether not can be physicians eddies people with peaces or masters agrees or whether not it will be con of a free for all i for for consumption and lacilages the life cot and the general public and rianabis y ism not a nonsmoker o a dis it it is never appeal to me a as just me in my my pharmacology but you can buy cannabis's most places in the u s without a tone of risk it is mice right are we going to see a time in which you can essentially going to as a shop on a about caning boulevard in nice californium and and right now you can go by marijuana if you have a mara o cards my understanding i see a lot of people going in out of these stores the police certify o no promise t is there going to time where people i just go by filicide do you think to you an amsterdam and have your long don time an they i think as at at a certain point and a i do not know how long it is hard to imagine or current level of drug criminalization holding up for anti's thinking large spans of time really in a hundred years ware being to be doing this five hundred years how could that it is nocking to be sudden sustain but five year infer instance i do not think in the united states i i i do think eventually you are going to see something that cases going to be no way and and i think we area a i hope that organ eventually come strongly a weregoina move on from this model of criminalizing drugs that were really in a focus on regulating drugs at the right level for that drug and i i the word regulation better than legalization i mean i could imagine what one day regulation smart regulation might mean for psychedelic maybe it could mean the it there will be yet whether or not you have it a diagnosis of a problem t it may be that even for personal exploration you can do this legally but you first half to may be take a court get a driving this has been i out the fest to say this beget to equivalent of a driver's license you have to go to a get some sort of training may be your first number of experiences need to be with ut with trained guides who can facilitated and then the the public health information for any one using this that this is what risky us all uses going to have rest this o what riskier uses this is less risky use these are the factors i think of eventually were going to be for any but i would see the same thing for methempetomine and and and yew heroine and cocaine all these drugs it is hard to imagine the current approach of just feeding a black market and really exasperating a lot of the harmless from drugs in a that happens under the current model it is hard imagine that maintaining that is not to say i think it should be in all of the seven elevens me sold to kids at at the other i we older non but but i do think it is probably not going to be soon in the united states i do want to make the major point that the even if psychotics had never been made illegal i think the exact the trajectory of the medical research right now would still need to happen if it is effective as an anti depression we need it to be ye there is all the evidence suggesting that whatever disorder f told amount the efficacious can be increased and the risks are going to be mitigate it drastically and the types of models were talking about with the screening with the preparation with the integration of cognaperotheripy or what have you depending on the disorder your treating with the generation afterwards with the professionals on it it it we would be doing it any way so it is not this first is that i do not see it as a race between the decriminalization or legalization of these come out verses their medical development some people who are psychotic and get get all into a bunch about the medical development they say egis wen alike you want it you want to keep it only for for your medical research in t i my tower and you want to be yet in control of it as academics and mi take it i did not make it illegal for any one eerily moving the meed in one direction and it are not even if it was already legal ant and best in i done plenty of serve research of people reporting they took mushrooms for fun or for personal exploration and they said my god why my smoking an the quit smoking twenty yeas because of it or its help with their depression or its help with them overcoming alkalis or these repay sometimes that happens out of the blue when people you psychedelics none the less obviously the efficacy rates are going to be higher when you bringing into these medical models and it is going to be sure safer we going to we need to be pushing that and my best guess is that india may is going to be approved within the next three years and for description by a physician yes in in not just ye take town call me in the morning but in the clinics the way that those those petty trials are being runs to the windy may would be pro for past in every disorder need to be looked at separately and ans can only be improved for those things now there's rank is a i lose an legalize and regulated or now we are getting into the new ants i think when people here it is going to be approved into years they think that they will be able to by and selling usamdia ma without legal consequences and i do not think that is going aga situation it is not way it is and will say that i think the quoting psychedelic community i mean that they have been doing what they want to and will carry on doing what they want to anyway right it is not the the legal status has a has prevented them from doing what they are doing in fact unlike learn and a timetelery and holy and and and and some of the others that were very vocal and lost their jobs in some when to jail et camera i mean you got a lot of public figures now vacant and others or just basely out their talking about psychedelics michael plan who is more of a writer food guy on psychedelic dabbler writer guide a i know he is that he is on of a polymath but the lead the legal status in seem to hinder their a at least online career i i do not know and on even look to their bank accounts but the ism imaging they are doing justified right the fact that work is happening inside of a big institutions i think it is important that you point out and ism just try underscore that that is that is in in no way antagonistic to what people are doing it is in support of a different sort of mission which is to explore the validity in different contacts in a really controlled way a which i really a you knot its i think it is a really important mission a i wont to make sure that i ask you about the other really important mission that you are involved in with respect to psychedelics which is not about depression person but is about neurological e neurologic injury or had injury i realize it is early days for this but i think u a he's lot of concussion out there sadly there is lot of debit dramaticbrain injury not just from sports i think people sometimes forget that it is not tithe major force of dramatic ad injury is not football it is not hawk it is not boxing it is not any of that stuff it is construction workers and i nan if you have ever seen the helmets that construction workers where i mean the a hammer i a aha a not be s y i have a calling the irksomeness and you engineering and when you look at the yen we always think sports but there are many people who make a living in a way that is a overtime is detrimental to the brain and they do not have the option of just not being a professional rather or something of that sort and i they're not doing the construction some one else need something else list it right and and we forge for some reason and i too did not occur to be until i heard it the the people who doing construction man to courts of bycacidents and falls and things that as well sos her no very absolutely om what do you think is the potential for these compounds om particular filicide en but other compounds as well for the a treatment impossible even reversal of neurological injuries and what what sorts of things are you excited to do in that roam yes this is decimally on the more exploratory and it is based upon i at this a sort of beyond the the improvement of psychiatric disorders depression om in depression anxiety associate it with the terminal illness om or a substance used to sort the addiction that are psychiatric disorders this is om these you know there are anecdotes of of people saying a that that psychedelics have helped heal their brain you know they have been in one of these situations in sports a sport where theirs repetitive had impacted and their claiming that in using psychedelics has actually improve their colonize function for example improve their memory am including it improve their the their mood om but but it is kind of more of the ouzo the convey function things memory are now caviar is if you successfully improve someone is depression you can get some cognitive improvement too but that o more of a a weaker more indirect effect but if you take these anecdotes and you combine at way across orders of analysis to the rodent research from am several labs gave it allusion trying a both it these folks that have shown different forms of negro plasticity unfolding o a after it sort of close acutely after in the days following the administration of psychedelic compounds a note o piety psyche thou compounds in even some non psychedelic structural analogues om a that you see these he different forms of her plastistis o a the growth of dendrites and new a connections being formed with with with different neurons that those effects may be at play and the improve in the psychiatric treatments that were dealing with that a we do not know that it seems a decent guess and wireman to be figuring out whether that is the case but another potential that that sets up is that maybe that is what is going on with om with wit wit with these claims of improvements from neuron near logical issues that there is actually a a repair of the brain a a from injuries underlying in things that situations where thees repetitive head and pack perhaps here is a potential for for helping folks recover from stroke a disorders that a it is a wide ride of disorders now that it is a bit of magic and a bit of it is it is something that the enthusiast kind of candy some handwaving and claim that this is already known it is more exploratory but when i am hoping to do s some work with retired athletes a a who have been exposed but by the nature of their sport for example in an a athletes in the you have see who have been exposed to a repetitive head unpacks a lot of sports a lot of a you sports exposed people to and and who are retired from the sport and are suffering from say depression which can a impart result from those types give of of that history of head in pact a see if we can fix the depression but then also as a cherry on top in a more exploratory try aim see if we can have evidence of of improvement in jogging of function and associate using i your eye see if it affects gray matter over time these types of things to see if they are actually some evidence of this improved a this more direct repair of the brain but it again it is very sort of wee got some road in data we have got some human anecdotes w we we will acknowledge its early days and we look forwards to seem the data a a i appreciate how cautious you are invented give you are you not drawing any conclusions i think a from a purely a logical a and somewhat mechanistic perspective i mean if we assume that lack of ability to focus or degradation and mood is the reflection of neurons in the brain i thing we can agree on that some dialogue between your ans of the brain and that what needs to be changed is the nature of that dialogue a a neural plasticity we know that reordering of neural circuitry require in the adult requires these things intense focus followed by rest et camera but the basis for that big beneath focus is the mechanism is a mechanism rather beneath the the been that we call deep breast is a mechanism in those mechanisms or neuromogulator driven to me your a ism not reviewing your grant a but a from a rational perspective it seems that drugs that increase certain neuromodulators ceratonan or opening in a in a controlled way and then coupling that with learning of some sort sensory and put of some sort it make sense that that would lead to could i should say lead to reordering of circuitry that would allow for better thinking better mood a many the same things the you have observed in the critical trials for a for depression the rational is really strong i think that is a very exciting are i could asked all the time about trio and dramatic brain entry and right now it is kind of it a there is not a whole lot that people can do what people are dabbling in the space of a hyperbaric chambers and people do son and breath work and you now and people are kind of clipping at the margins of what really is a problem that resides deep to the skull i think i just want of pilot that the exploration i think it is great provided that exploration is being done in a controlled way it sounds that is what you are doing with the you f we heres that e we we they they were really gracious and had myself and and a few of my colleagues out to their headquarters and vagus in present place rand it is in process ever there is a dialogue going on there am hopeful that there is going to be ism some some work with them but it is it is in process now in terms of exploring that there is a real interest and i ism just really impressed by the organization in their commandments a athlete house and i mill see ye i am to we a we have a a collie out there a were doing all a bit of work with them done in french whose a serious academic in his own right and i think when people her you have see they just think about the acting on in fighting and paper of view fights and things but in talking with them and ism sure you have have these discussions as well they are very much interested in the half and longevity of their fighters they are also interested in the health and longevity of their fighters being a templet for how to treat dramatic brain injury and improve human performance in other sports and in the general public and i think it is not a an image of the you have see that is commonly comes to mine cause they have not been particularly a a verbal about it in the press be think it is great the bringing in academics coming geeks us going in out to the you have see performance center m you do mama but i basically just a geek walking through the place but the fact that their interesting talking to scientists is really am based here but a point in their favor m along the lines of other groups and individuals that have impacted the space that your working in in this pioneering of of the psychedelic space a a few years ago i think if some one submitted to grant saying i want to study how silliest been impacts human depression ism guessing having worked on these panels before that the the response might have been closer too well we need to do a lot of studies and roans and a lot of studies and primates and then maybe just maybe we could explore these drugs because the nationalstitutes of health she has a a a whole institute devoted to a diction right of the exploring compounds only in terms of their negative of facts i which is a nice which is where have got in all of my age funny which is interested i and it is a superimportant institute i wont be clear the amazing people there but philanthropy and foundation have been v my important in supporting pioneering research a and may we just talk a little bit about about that your lab receives funding from tamper dollars through the national institutes of health is that mainly where your sort your your funding comes from our group has gotten some funding from say the nationals don drugs pita for some a small subset of the psychedelic work but only for some work a gear towards understanding these things as drugs of abuse course me you do a study though youths other ut ex i don't other bad right r but one you doing that you can explore ad a the good stuff too but but the the large majority of the work and the most interesting work has been funded by philanthropy driven now i i still have some great a support from pita outside of psychedelics i shipping more and more of my a my time towards yo focusing only on psychedelics and in fact us getting that the the sentry level funding from am some really big picture philanthropists helped me to start to make that transition but groups to have to research organization penis mckenof which is one of the founding members the brother tarmac can who is by the way an athnobotanists that is what i what is name s an no on studying the the essentially the anthropology of a a of psycholact of plant use the only get a degree in the ye ye ye hanging out with cultures and studying their use of these compounds in the traditional ways a hon there is at that degree exists it johns i do not i do nothing that degree exist at hoping o tat i mean the the kind of the most can as as you will as from maced me i ism not yes sometimes folks ism not sure how many people's p h s actually in ask no bony or s a as er an for something else but the real focuses my degree is general experimental psychology a o i stalls out there just de sided their on a major an ethnobotany wish i mean wonder the pioneers of the psychodelicharea before leery and before and actually he was late even for the human researchers folks humphryosmen and ever safer an kidney con were earlier but even before those folks om richer shorties at hazard he was i mentioned him earlier in the conversation discovered all of this i this the serious tribes using i pastor yoga different name for the same thing u throughout south america and these deem containing snuffs and all of this you about was a athnobotany this kind of the the conintersection of anthropology in these psycholact of a plant a compounds so to have to research institute which penis is a is o it is founding inactive a a member of aboard member they have funded a lot of our early work there also an organization called the the u debeckly institute a basin inland that the lady man of fielding is that has been the head of that has a they provided the first funding for our umsylicivan a smoking cessation research in harder came in an provided subsequent funding but it is and then there other groups a council in spiritual practices a great guy and me obese unfunded some of the original work at hoping looking at the nature of mystical experience outside of treating disease states a disorders that is understanding these people take these compounds and astonishingly in a frequently well say that was the most important everything have ever experience i hell is that i have had some one mention recently i think this might surprise bulla bits t certainly surprise me out of friend who adores his children he is got the recorded adores his children ha happy marriage great great father the broth greeprnt and he told me that as part of a clinical trial he had a deity experience that he claims he said it'd love to tell you that it that the birth of my children was that profound but if that was a more profound experience than the birth of my children any one of them an all of them combined is wilt love never done the empty bolls i well that is a pretty strong statement how he did it in the contexts of one of these clinical explorations i soon know was part of a legal clinical trial but the ti mean that saying something the saying something and he is a very rational very grounded guy otherwise but philanthropy foundations and then i most recently and i just in man as i cannot skip it our enter lain clans a giving has year and a help i we that we mean the after group the belly group i been these are wonderful coming these are people that have been holding the flame alive during the darkest hours the rain same thing with meet with the maps organization on or india aside holding that candle during the darkest years that mean us a we but smaller organizations connected e smaller but growing over time you now pockets of wealth but we basically limped on limped along on a wing in a prayer until recently when we got the seventeen million dollar gift that we could create nominal enter and as basically to the university that means you get a certain number of dollars and a lot of them you can call yourself a center it is a capital investment a young staff you n equipment salary support which is always been the huge thing for us but the seventy million doll get get which was split between the the the the coin foundation stepped in alexandr con a they covered half of it in the other half of the them varies collaborative basically him and a few a friends ponied up that the you now divided the rest of that half of that seventeen million dollar gift and came together just i mean it just its completely transformed are the work that we done in our ability to to folly deal into this area and not worry that a if i focus on this rather than putting another three not a grace on some other topic that man may not get fund if i fog is too much on the psychedelics and i putting my career at jeopardy but likes a your knowing not only attended professor also a full endowed outright o that the way must say somebody is a fully endowed profess an m very clear what that means that means that the a mana of o the above it now i have no knowledge of your particular situation but a you you probably do a but sure the am an these a what wore sumcshy saying is that funding which does not change somebody salary level i just one to be clear as i think the general public is in m there is no reason why they would a understand all the the not and bolts of how this were again as were any is weird because it we are not talking about increasing we are not talking about an endowment that were philanthropy that went to increase am mats salary that that something that set at the university level am it is always been said in it a this he least is still true now which is that your nobody goes into science for the money at least not at the academic level am not it macadamia but am allows people to to vote more of their time and energy to these a exploratory a realms psychedelic receive or on the case of my lab the work that were doing the avid speakers lab on on respiration breath work and hypnosis for manually ingrain states these are not typically areas that the national institutes of health another major organizations have institutions set up to support now there is an exciting initiative a which is the end c ago which is complimentary health a mes to be in cam yo ye ad a as and now we are not just throwing out acronyms just a to bat back and for thacranyms but i think what we are looking what we are seen now it is a movement toward science and scientists and citations and the general public and philanthropy being engaged in this dialogue which says o k there are problems in the world depression head drama a psychological tramapetst eighty h the these problems clearly exist the solutions are going to involve behaviors they're going to involve nutrition supplementation social connection however there are drugs there are compounds that can change the brain and allow the brain to change its circuitry through experience and psychedelics are one of of several others but one of the powerful levers it sounds and and i just one to say i think the reason i reach out to you in excited to sit down and shot with you is because i see very few people inside the halls of macadamia who have thrown their arms around this issue of psychedelics in a way and gone through the trouble of trying to find the funding to get it done gone through the trouble of trying to set up clinical trials i know what is involved in down this it complicated time consuming an painstaking and you have made real progress i meringue as are publishing papers there is a new dialogue emerging that is not just books on bookshelves and ism and pay psychedelic psycho not peruse on the inner net a who also plain important role but you are really moving this field forward and i know their others as well their colleagues in inland and others as well will will acknowledge them but i just want to say personally that ism inspired and impressed by the way that you have gone about this and the level of rigor i mean when i ask you a question about serotonin most people just kind o kick back to me will you got receptors an got align but mean it is clear to me that you care about the details and that you care about the future of this area and you also really are about these patients an these individuals i know am s beyond behalf of a ton of people now and in the future that do not even know what they are going to receive as a consequence of this i just one of voice o real sincere ism thank you for for that afford it is your lab and your work matters and that is a really special and unique that appreciate that i had a a good colleague bacshareds an grand support under the mufti pig system years ago and and she she actually took a join an at at in i ages as as a review officer and remember her telling me uni ain she actually left when she had multiple are one it is like she did not know a ones are of that the ray of voter an big parents that every ism every card carrying a it is a mark of respect in our community to have you are one or several of these e yet ye men in it is i you you you which you kill in academy gets si over talking out later it is you do not make more money but pulling migrants but you are able to pay the salary that the university does not pay you your salary your your goes through them you dousablely any more work yet in you are able to liken if you do not pull in the grands to of your salary your join come to in it even if your ten poured at a place hoping they can do tricks slowly lower your salary over these is let you non ta you oryx you they just take away your space yet they put you in a class and give you no support for trainers and basically make life hell for you i have a cat an balletomane call yourself a full professor hoping truthfully that you are not have no ability to assure the going the done but i but ye reneger one of things this collogue said who is successful but left on top said i r really not nowthat o making a difference in the world and she did some great memory research and an and connected to drugs also connected to aging but she she said i do not you now i do not i do not feel the impact of what ism doing in the world world an it is unfortunately there for a lot of academe what we do it stays in the ivory tower you know the world is a not an in for that as a place and a lot of this does not disseminate and and and because of the various structures the way the world is set up and thankfully this i mean because the work that that our group as well as a few others around t the world over the last twenty years it is you do happen emerging psychedelic start up industry now with buildings abollige of investment and yet that is goon a turn into both good and bad you know it is up in the once there is can be a lot of good and bad that comes from that but any new technology is going to result in that but we got silicone and designated for two separate entities as a break through trip by the f the and people may not realize an india a is designated as a break through there for and for past this is a really big deal that is a very high am farm of companies would pay millions of dollars to get there new drug a designation that an what it means is it early researches show saying it chose a high potential for treating disorders that do not have very good treatments we are and were probably yet again a few years away from both eddy and probably a year two after that silicone and being treated for past and depression respectively this is e we have to wait for the face three studies but if the results hold up an even if the effects is is have of what we are seeing now it is still going to be a lot larger which you are seeing with the traditional medication and it is going to be a proved if the day to hold up and it probably wild for my judgment i feel what ism doing is actually having a positive impact and in the world in a way that and i feel i feel lucky that i got interested in area that happens o plug into a place in the world were there is that opportunity were some me o great colleagues and friends are folks on areas were i wish they had the opportunity for the work to be disseminated i wish the amen was likely to be interviewed on on sixty minutes because of this work and was on my got i dos going there is a bit of a in poster serum lie and my got i know many scientist that deserve no more than me to be have that level of exposure o but if you happen to be in that place were it you got to do your best t to make it work to take advantage of that luck in that intersection of the world and to to push it and not have been lucky but also did take a bit of a leap o a faith early on i did have some you know advisers that told me you got a really promising pedigree early on our sure you ant a focus i you i an the academics e yhouvebeen you have embraced rest coming i think that i in the world's changed and since that in twenty twenty certainly but your channels social media pardcasts and things that sort y your exposure is is because people are interested in these topics and notes who people myself or are interested in talking t you i mean it at stamford there are now a few labs starting to explore psychedelic s mort the mechanistic gloves but arson animal models am excellent labs am but also i can imagine and because of the pioneering work that you have done hoping ill start to become more common ism certain that people are going to have questions about how to get in contact with you and learn more am if people have to a pities the depression a you it is likely that they are going to start seeking ways than which they can potentially prerticipaing clinical trials you are very active on twitter active i should say you have got other obligations but where you are active on social mete your active on twitter it is it is drug it is at drug down score research or it it i ki drug under score research or a that is how to find me great account by the way am matter and i have recently got into a dialogue there about some of the deeper of facts of psychedelics an the literature verse is how they are being discussed in the general public and i follow his account it is a really wonderful account for whether not love a science background or not a if people are inland ism gain a time persuade you to be more active on in stergrand but i do not know all som non id an in your us i an i i get it i running until i get at you are busy but but a we your drug downcome research or there as well and am the same hands a your lab at hoping is pretty straight fort to find through fugal search of your name matter johns johns hoping university or their portals for people to am to explore clinical trials a presuspicion clinical trials of various ye and in a grub is a you go to hoping psychedelic data word that is the webs i and y be cannot remember that just john time insipid epic ye w yet and you are going to find us i it will be the first thing the pops of and we have trust me if we have a study on something it is going to be on that website the means to he is there being very polite i will be a little bit more aggressments and do not smell him directly he will not see that email wait until there is a posting for a study and then sign up through the current final and i try to get back to those males but frankly and it is a it is cause mean a ism lucky the area has taken off much but there are many days where i simply get many a to forests that i yon can do wherever i we ye if i answer of yet trust me if there are not are not something that a lot of folks do not get in being an academic we are it is easy to forget how people do not understand we do not no realize is this is experimental research it is it a approved as an experiment i of who were working for its formal it e approval for straight of clinical use but right now some one cannot bring me a case of some idiosyncratic thing and and say ism suffering from this complex constellate our not a clinession and yet i not aglet an even if i was i would not be able to treat them with sylicibe an or to send em anywhere that was legal to to to to to take it you know if if if we are going to be treating you it is it has to be or any one else in the united states or most other countries for that matter it is going to have to be under the guise of a very specific critical this number of telegrams to treat p t it to treat major to press disorder to treat you a treatment resistant a tobacco use disorders obnicotin addiction very specific studies this is not one all treatment it folk say all i can pay to go out to baltimore if you see m a my son has this you a complex it in their tragic cases but you if you are interested in a study go to our website if it is not on that website you no we do not have a study on it they'll argon to be forthcoming cities on can be starting studies on outta diction and pasty and analyst study for chronic pain it the day that those are open for recruitment they are gin to be up on our websites o that is where you look ism to see everything in fact i would just recently cope o days ago put up a couple surveysays also where we posting sour surveysudy if you if you had psychedelic you have taking them for the pesto content intent for petit or for depression or anxiety you can find a link and also if you've done breath work for those reasons we have a link for a study of that type up there now which is a a holotropecstyli t very psychedelic type of o a a breathing technique that can lead to some of these similar experience so it is up there more broadly outside of our group cause there's a growing number of groups in the u s doing this and in rope doing this research but you can go to to clinical trials dot got and if you look in for the the the main search term up of sylicibean or india may or psychedelic plugin those terms you cane get a list of the growing number i m i think there i think there is over forty maybe it is been a while it there might feel for fifty now i do not know but a studies with jucilicive an going on right now on clinical trials dot gob check out clinical trials dot of to see what is going on but it is going to be if you are going to do anything legal it is going to be in the contacts of a very specific study it is not going to be one all treatment right yet i should say is not just legal but also supported in the right framework that you described of having a team et camera i obviously peoplewill do what they will do and the sene if o yo i was not if people i never inch urge people to take drugs of any i do not encourage cabins every drug has its rest i encourage my own came i bay helves ism drinking upright now is the great ans is very strong mate is what we are drinking it is not led to a a alteration on my perception of of self to the extent that we talked but earlier however this conversation was in a a good example of how we can enter a perceptional able i learn much about psychedelics and the future of this for sake of mental health and other aspects of health that thank you much for your time for your knowledge and i think you put it best earlier for a holding the candle in a very dark time and then now there is light thank you wellthanks for help in misread that light i really appreciate that you have been doing a this is a great great medium that you have going on thank you for doing it months my pleasure thank you thank you for joining me for my conversation with doctor matter johns if you enjoying this podcast and learning from it please
